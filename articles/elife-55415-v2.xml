(<italic>Mtb</italic>) employs plethora of mechanisms to hijack the host defence machinery for its successful survival, proliferation and persistence. Here, we show that <italic>Mtb</italic> upregulates one of the key epigenetic modulators, NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), which upon infection translocate to the nucleus and deacetylates histone H3K18, thus modulating the host transcriptome leading to enhanced macrophage activation. Furthermore, in <italic>Mtb</italic> specific T cells, SIRT2 deacetylates NFκB-p65 at K310 to modulate T helper cell differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 restricts the intracellular growth of both drug-sensitive and resistant strains of <italic>Mtb</italic> and enhances the efficacy of front line anti-TB drug Isoniazid in the murine model of infection. SIRT2 inhibitor-treated mice display reduced bacillary load, decreased disease pathology and increased <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific protective immune responses. Overall, this study provides a link between <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, epigenetics and host immune response, which can be exploited to achieve therapeutic benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>AGK2</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>SIRT2</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DST/INSPIRE/04/2014/002012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dwivedi</surname><given-names>Ved Prakash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DST/INSPIRE/04/2014/002069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhaskar</surname><given-names>Ashima</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR13522/COE/34/27/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandicoori</surname><given-names>Vinay Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JC Bose Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCB/2019/000015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandicoori</surname><given-names>Vinay Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inhibition of host Sirtuin-2 by AGK2 restricts mycobacterial growth in vivo by modulation of host transcriptome leading to activation of protective immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), a deadly disease caused by the intracellular pathogen <italic>Mtb,</italic> has existed since time immemorial and continues to remain one of the leading causes of mortality by a single infectious agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">WHO, 2018</xref>). Classic anti-TB therapy which comprises the administration of multiple anti-mycobacterial drugs, fails to provide complete sterilization in the host. Incessant rise in drug-resistant TB cases further highlights the failure of current anti-TB therapy which only focuses on targeting microbial pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">WHO, 2018</xref>). The host immune system plays a pivotal role in the containment of the infection, while <italic>Mtb</italic> has evolved diverse strategies to avoid immune surveillance facilitating its survival, replication, and persistence in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayer-Barber and Barber, 2015</xref>). Our growing knowledge on host-pathogen interactions indicates that augmenting the current anti-TB therapy with host-directed strategies may result in enhanced bacterial clearance, shorter treatment times, reduced tissue damage, a decline in drug-resistant strains and a lower risk of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palucci and Delogu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>For its enormous success as an intracellular pathogen, <italic>Mtb</italic> skews multiple host pathways in its favor. For example, <italic>Mtb</italic> is known to restrict the killing capacity of macrophages by inhibiting host generated oxidative stress, apoptosis and multiple stages of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krakauer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). It also influences the adaptive immune response by promoting the secretion of T helper 2 (Th2) polarizing cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection significantly changes the transcriptional landscape of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roy et al., 2018</xref>) by secreting a plethora of virulence factors to carry out these functions. It also hijacks the function of several host genes for its gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawn et al., 2013</xref>). Yet another mechanism has been uncovered recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamon and Cossart, 2008</xref>), wherein intracellular pathogens remodel the host chromatin for their persistence.</p><p>A balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation carried out by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Till date, few bacteria have been reported to modulate the levels of acetylated histones. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, a food-borne pathogen, dephosphorylates H3 and deacetylates H4 in epithelial cells through the action of a secreted virulence factor: listeriolysin O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamon et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilium</italic>, which causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis has been shown to activate the expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 leading to transcriptional repression of key immunity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Garcia et al., 2009</xref>). The influence of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection on histone modifications and chromatin remodeling is still in its infancy. It has been shown that <italic>Mtb</italic> inhibits the expression of IFNγ-induced genes including CIITA, CD64, and HLA-DR through histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kincaid and Ernst, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors enhance the anti-mycobacterial potential of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moreira et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The class III HDACs, or sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are homologous to the yeast Sir2 family of proteins and require NAD<sup>+</sup> as a cofactor that links their enzymatic activity to the energy state of a cell. Thus far, very few studies have demonstrated the role of sirtuins in bacterial pathogenesis. Recent works emphasize the importance of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in the progression of bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eskandarian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gogoi et al., 2018</xref>). Despite enhanced phagocytosis in SIRT2-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciarlo et al., 2017</xref>), myeloid-specific SIRT2 deficiency fails to control <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardoso et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>SIRT2 primarily a cytoplasmic protein, is known to shuttle into the nucleus during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">North and Verdin, 2007</xref>) where it regulates chromosome condensation. Mounting evidence suggests the role of SIRT2 in cell cycle regulation, tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration, cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomes et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we attempt to decipher the role of SIRT2 in TB pathogenesis using chemical inhibition of SIRT2. We show that <italic>Mtb</italic> infection leads to upregulation and nuclear translocation of SIRT2 which induce consequential changes in histone acetylation, cellular signaling and transcriptional profile of the infected host macrophages and <italic>Mtb</italic>-stimulated T cells. Inhibition of SIRT2 activity restricted <italic>Mtb</italic> growth and reduced disease pathology in infected mice. SIRT2 inhibition triggered the induction of host protective immune responses, enhanced the efficacy of front-line anti-TB drug isoniazid (INH) and showed protection against drug-resistant strains. Thus, the study unravels a novel epigenetic mechanism employed by <italic>Mtb</italic> to recondition the host defense system, which can be exploited toward designing host-directed adjunct therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SIRT2 inhibition restricts <italic>Mtb</italic> growth ex vivo</title><p>To delve into the epigenetic modifications induced by <italic>Mtb</italic> to evade host defence system, we evaluated the expression of all known HDACs in THP1 cells 24 hr post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (pi) through microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehta et al., 2016</xref>), Gene Expression Omnibus series accession number <bold>GSE65714</bold>. Among a total of 18 HDACs, SIRT2 and HDAC6 were significantly upregulated whilst SIRT1 and HDAC9 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehta et al., 2016</xref>). This is in accordance with a previous report indicating the <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated downregulation of SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). The increase in the expression of SIRT2 following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection was further confirmed in mouse peritoneal macrophages by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and intracellular staining with α-SIRT2 followed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). To uncover the biological relevance of <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated SIRT2 upregulation, we analyzed the intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> in peritoneal macrophages upon addition of AGK2, a well-established SIRT2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Outeiro et al., 2007</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of peritoneal macrophages infected with GFP expressing bacteria revealed significantly reduced <italic>Mtb</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, CFU enumeration indicated a significant reduction in the bacillary load upon AGK2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Unlike Ciarlo et al, we did not observe any significant difference in the uptake of <italic>Mtb</italic> by macrophages treated with AGK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). To further ascertain the effects of SIRT2 downregulation on <italic>Mtb</italic> survival, we transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages with mouse shRNA-directed against SIRT2. Among the four shRNAs tested, shRNA three and shRNA five showed maximum downregulation of SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Similar to AGK2 treatment, bacterial survival was markedly attenuated in RAW 264.7 macrophages transfected with shRNA 3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). SIRT2 is known to modulate the expression of antioxidant genes thereby influencing cellular redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomes et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition or downregulation of SIRT2 leads to the induction of apoptosis in many tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kozako et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Since both apoptosis and ROS constitute one of the major innate defense strategies employed by macrophages against <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behar et al., 2011</xref>) and SIRT2 has been previously shown to modulate the induction of apoptosis and intracellular ROS in different disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), we analyzed these parameters upon SIRT2 inhibition during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. While AGK2 treatment has minimal effect on uninfected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>), its treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages with a concomitant decrease in the necrotic population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and M</xref>). Interestingly AGK2 treatment also led to a significant increase in the intracellular ROS levels following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection with minimal effect on uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N and O</xref>). Moreover, treatment of cells with an anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>) significantly decreased the anti-mycobacterial effect of AGK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P–R</xref>) indicating that ROS generation is one of the mechanisms by which SIRT2 inhibition restricts bacillary growth. Collectively, these results indicate a role for SIRT2 in assisting mycobacterial survival inside the host.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SIRT2 aids in mycobacterial survival ex vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of microarray data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehta et al., 2016</xref> reveals differential expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, HDAC6 and HDAC9 in THP1 cells 24 hr pi.

However, it is known to migrate to the nucleus during the G2/M transition and certain bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eskandarian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaquero et al., 2006</xref>). To address whether similar translocation is promoted during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we determined the site of action of SIRT2 through immunofluorescence. Interestingly, while SIRT2 presence was observed in both the cytosol and the nucleus of uninfected macrophages, SIRT2 predominantly localized to the nucleus following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection as early as 4 hr pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). SIRT2 migration into the nucleus was also confirmed by performing immunoblotting at 24 hr pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Significant increase in the overall expression of SIRT2 at protein level post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection correlated, with our qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Since SIRT2 modulates the acetylation levels of histone H3K18 upon infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, we analyzed H3K18 acetylation upon <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and AGK2 treatment in mouse peritoneal macrophages. AGK2 treatment had minimal effect on the acetylation levels of H3K18 in uninfected cells. However, there was a significant increase in H3K18ac levels in infected macrophages treated with AGK2, indicating that <italic>Mtb</italic>-induced nuclear localization of SIRT2 results in deacetylation of histone H3K18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). α-tubulin is the major cytosolic target of SIRT2 which deacetylates it at lysine-40 to attenuate microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">North et al., 2003</xref>). In order to evaluate the cytosolic activity of SIRT2, we checked the acetylation levels of α-tubulin following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and upon SIRT2 inhibition. AGK2 treatment led to a comparable increase in the acetylated α-tubulin levels in uninfected and infected macrophages indicating the presence of cytosolic SIRT2 activity under both the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, increased nuclear localization of SIRT2 after <italic>Mtb</italic> infection may contribute to the enhanced acetylated α-tubulin levels in the <italic>Mtb</italic> infected cells as compared to their uninfected counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). SIRT2 modulates intracellular signaling by manipulating the activation of key Ser/Thr kinases in the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jing et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kosciuczuk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Thus we evaluated if SIRT2 inhibition had any impact on intracellular signaling. We measured the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in peritoneal macrophages 2 hr after <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by immunoblotting. Interestingly, <italic>Mtb</italic> induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 was decreased by AGK2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since SIRT2 inhibition strongly influenced the intracellular signaling and histone deacetylation, both of which ultimately lead to changes in cellular gene expression, we hypothesize that SIRT2 influences the intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> growth by modulating the host gene expression.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SIRT2 translocate to the nucleus and modulates histone deacetylations and cellular signaling during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endogenous SIRT2 was detected by immunofluorescence in mouse peritoneal macrophages uninfected or infected with <italic>H37Rv</italic> for 4 hr.

AGK2 treatment in uninfected cells did not alter the gene expression in a significant manner which is consistent with our earlier results wherein no effect on apoptosis, ROS levels, histone deacetylations and cellular signaling was observed in uninfected cells treated with AGK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1K, O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D and F</xref>). In contrast, AGK2 treatment significantly affected the gene expression profile induced upon <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. In total, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection led to the differential expression of 992 genes which is in agreement with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mehta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roy et al., 2018</xref>).

SIRT2-dependent genes can be further classified into six categories. Group 1: Decreased expression in I with no change in IA. Group 2: No change in expression in I and increased expression in IA. Group 3: Enhanced gene expression in IA as compared to I. Group 4: Decreased expression in IA with no change in I. Group 5: Increased expression in I with no change in IA. Group 6: Enhanced gene expression in I as compared to IA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Innate and adaptive immunity play a crucial role in shaping the disease outcome in case of TB. Previous studies have revealed the influence of SIRT2 on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lo Sasso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>).

SIRT2 inhibition led to a marked increase in the expression of monocyte differentiation markers, CD11b and CD11c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). AGK2 treatment resulted in the increased expression of MHCII and CD80 co-stimulatory molecules which are known to stimulate T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, E and F</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of CD11b, CD11c and co-stimulatory markers CD80 and MHCII was significantly increased even in the condition where only the T cells were pre-treated with AGK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>). With no change in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>), we observed an increase in their activation as evidenced by an increased expression of T cell activation markers CD69 and CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). A similar trend was observed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–M</xref>). Furthermore, SIRT2 inhibition increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and IL17 by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N–Q</xref>). However, SIRT2 inhibition in macrophage alone failed to drive strong Th1 and Th17 responses in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells while co-treatment of macrophages and T cells with AGK2 had a synergistic effect as IFNγ and IL17 production was significantly higher when splenocytes were co-cultured with macrophages in the presence of AGK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N–Q</xref>). Similarly, the treatment of AGK2 in splenocytes alone or in both the cell types led to a significantly higher reduction in bacterial survival as compared to the SIRT2 inhibition in macrophages alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>).

Recent studies hint toward the pathogen-induced histone modifications as an emerging host subversion strategy employed by a number of bacteria and viruses for successful persistence inside the host. Virulence factors and toxins released by the pathogens have been shown to alter host epigenome by modulating the activity of HATs and HDACs. <italic>Mtb</italic> was shown to induce histone deacetylation at the HLA-DRα promoter leading to the inhibition of IFN-γ-dependent HLA-DR gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Since this study, many pathogens were shown to influence host histone acetylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grabiec and Potempa, 2018</xref>). For instance, virulence factor listeriolysin-O (LLO) of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> causes global histone H4 deacetylation, whereas invasin protein InlB mediates histone H3K18 deacetylation both of which lead to transcriptional reprograming of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eskandarian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamon et al., 2007</xref>). Upregulation of HDACs by intracellular pathogens like <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> led to epigenetic suppression of host defense genes. Lately, pathogens were shown to target sirtuins for subverting host acetylome. <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> degrades SIRT1 to evade autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganesan et al., 2017</xref>) while it upregulates SIRT2 to regulate NOS2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gogoi et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, it was shown that activation of SIRT1 aids <italic>Mtb</italic> survival by inducing phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we for the first time show significant upregulation of SIRT2 during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in peritoneal macrophages. Inhibition of SIRT2 activity by AGK2 as well as a decrease in the SIRT2 levels following siRNA treatment led to decreased intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>APCs play a critical role in TB pathogenesis by directly killing the bacteria and by activating T cells and thus shaping the extent and nature of the adaptive immune response. Expression and engagement of MHC and costimulatory molecules on the surface of APCs activates these cells as well as T cells leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and IL17 which are shown to play a protective role in TB disease. IFNγ deficiency in humans and mice is associated with increased susceptibility to <italic>Mtb </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flynn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Apart from being a protective cytokine, IL17 is also essential for recall responses to <italic>Mtb</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2011</xref>). SIRT2 has been shown to inhibit the stress-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and surface activation markers in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lo Sasso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pais et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, AGK2 treatment increased the expression of activation markers on the surface of mouse peritoneal macrophages upon <italic>Mtb</italic> infection leading to a prominent T cell activation and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. A similar effect of SIRT2 inhibition was observed in <italic>Mtb</italic> specific T cells wherein AGK2 treatment led to enhanced acetylation of histone H3K18 and NFκB p65 leading to the induction of proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). For the first time, we demonstrate that SIRT2 inhibition in T cells shifts the type-1/type-2 balance toward protective Th1/Th17 response during TB pathogenesis.</p><p>The protective role of SIRT2 deficiency has been well documented in age-related neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourcade et al., 2018</xref>). However, very few studies talk about SIRT2 dependent disease progression in bacterial and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciarlo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gogoi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piracha et al., 2018</xref>). As a well-established SIRT2 inhibitor, several studies have used AGK2 treatment in mice models with no visible side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). Consequently, we extended our study in the murine model of TB. Mice administered with AGK2 displayed a significant reduction in bacterial load, which translated into diminished tissue pathology evident by the negligible presence of granulomatous lesions in the lungs. Innate cytokine milieu induced by SIRT2 inhibition drive the adaptive immune response toward Th1 and Th17 cells. Cytokine profiling indicated a robust pro-inflammatory response in the lungs and the spleen of AGK2 treated and <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice. SIRT2 has been shown to regulate immuno-metabolism in sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). SIRT2 inhibits inflammatory response in obese mice via deacetylating NFĸB p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Treatment of SIRT2 specific inhibitor AK7 enhanced LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine response in RAW 264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> upregulates the expression of IL-10 via TLR2-ERK pathway to promote TB pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beamer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richardson et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, AGK2 treatment decreases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, previous reports suggest that high SIRT2 expression is associated with upregulation of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lo Sasso et al., 2014</xref>). The immune response generated during AGK2 treatment was <italic>Mtb</italic> specific as was evident by adoptive transfer studies wherein T cells from AGK2 treated and <italic>Mtb</italic> infected mice when transferred into naive <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice conferred resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Moreover, splenocytes from mice treated with AGK2 displayed a higher ability to promote <italic>Mtb</italic> killing by macrophages. In mycobacterial infections, apoptosis of infected macrophages is thought to prevent bacterial spread and restrict mycobacterial growth by inducing host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2014</xref>). However, apoptosis of T cells results in T cell exhaustion and is correlated with defective immune response. Noteworthy is the fact that SIRT2 deficiency resulted in increased apoptosis in peritoneal macrophages with no effect on T cells which is in agreement with earlier reports demonstrating the anti-apoptotic effects of SIRT2 in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>SIRT2 is mainly considered to be active in the cytosol where it targets many cellular proteins to regulate multiple pathways such as microtubule dynamics (α-tubulin, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">North et al., 2003</xref>], adipogenesis (FOXO1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jing et al., 2007</xref>], mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>], metabolism (ACLY, PEPCK1, G6PD, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>], ROS suppression (FOXO3a, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2007</xref>], inflammation (NF-κB, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rothgiesser et al., 2010</xref>] and many more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomes et al., 2015</xref>]. However, SIRT2 has also been shown to transiently shuttle to the nucleus under certain conditions where it targets both histone and non-histone proteins. It regulates mitosis by deacetylating H4K16 and DNA-damage induced hyper-acetylation by targeting P300 and H3K56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houtkooper et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, Eskandarian et al uncovered a novel nuclear function of SIRT2 where it regulates host gene expression by deacetylating H3K18 during <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. Our data also suggests nuclear migration of SIRT2 upon <italic>Mtb</italic> infection where it deacetylates H3K18 to influence gene expression. In line with the above observations, our RNAseq data revealed a similar trend where AGK2 treatment did not influence the gene expression pattern of uninfected macrophages, whereas out of 992 total genes affected by <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, the expression of more than 50% (578) of the genes was dependent on SIRT2 activity. KEGG pathway analysis performed on SIRT2-dependent genes revealed a significant number of pathways, which have a known role to play in the containment of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. For instance, there was a significant up-regulation in genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, Th17 cell differentiation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and TNF signaling.</p><p><italic>Mtb</italic> infection results in the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt while inhibiting the activity of either PI3K or Akt leads to the suppression of mycobacterial growth in the host cell via upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brace et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, PI3K-Akt signaling and TLR signaling pathways were downregulated upon AGK2 treatment.</p><p>Although antimicrobial effects of SIRT2 inhibition have been demonstrated in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Listeria</italic>, this is the first report suggesting modulation of host adaptive immune responses as one of the mechanisms by which AGK2 inhibits the growth of an intracellular pathogen. These data are further strengthened by our transcriptome studies which provide an insight into the mechanistic details of how SIRT2 activity aids in mycobacterial survival. The proposed mechanism of mycobacterial restriction via AGK2 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of SIRT2 up-regulation and consequence of SIRT2 inhibition on <italic>Mtb</italic> survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Mtb</italic> infection induces the expression and translocation of SIRT2 in the nucleus where it deacetylates histone H3K18 to induce consequential changes in host transcriptome leading to decreased activation of macrophages, reduced levels of apoptosis and ROS, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory Th2-polarizing cytokines. Simultaneously, upregulation of SIRT2 in <italic>Mtb-</italic>specific T-cells specifically deacetylates and deactivates NFκB p65 leading to an anti-inflammatory response.

(<bold>B</bold>) SIRT2 inhibition in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cells reverses the SIRT2-dependent gene expression changes enhancing the capacity of macrophages to activate T-cells. AGK2 treatment also enhances anti-mycobacterial defense forces in macrophages such as apoptosis, ROS and pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 polarizing cytokines. Moreover, hyperacetylation of NFκB p65 in <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific activated T-cells leads to Th1/Th17-mediated pro-inflammatory immune response.

RNAseq was carried out by Macrogen, Inc in collaboration with Bencos Research Solutions Pvt. Ltd. for data analysis. Briefly, the methodology included generation of raw sequencing reads followed by adapter trimming and QC filtering of reads:Phred score (Q) &gt; 30, alignment to reference genome (mapped unique reads &gt;80%), normalization and read count generation and finally differential expression determined using DESeq2 (significant differentially expressed genes selected based on FDR &lt; 0.05). The quality assessment was carried out on raw Fastq files received using NGS QC toolkit with a minimum average quality (Q) value of 20 and an overall cutoff of 70%. Filtered reads were aligned with STAR alignment tool. GRCm38 was used as a reference genome. HTSeq was used to quantify the reads for all genes.

the role of SIRT2 during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) infection and how this can be exploited in new therapeutic approaches. These studies are important for our general understanding of <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogenesis as well as the development of new host-directed therapies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Host Sirtuin 2 as an Immunotherapeutic Target against Tuberculosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show that <italic>Mtb</italic> modulates NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) resulting in changes in histone acetylation, cellular signaling and transcriptional profile of the infected host macrophages and <italic>Mtb</italic> stimulated T-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 improved infection outcomes in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice. Mice had reduced CFU, improved pathology and exhibited enhanced Th1/Th17 response. This is a nice study, but several key experiments are missing weakening the overall conclusions that inhibition of the SIRT2 pathway in T cells provides a novel therapeutic host target against <italic>Mtb</italic>. A compiled list of reviewer comments are included below, but as a summary, the major concerns that all reviewers agreed on were the manuscript's disjointed organization and focus, experiments needed to be repeated for rigor and reproducibility standards, missing key data (i.e. need to show CFU in Figure 10), missing key information on how experiments were performed, and the absence of an experiment demonstrating the role of T cell-specific-SIRT2 inhibition during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 10: A key measurement missing in this experiment is CFU. The authors show that the adoptively transferred T cells from SIRT2-deficient mice were polyfunctional. However, whether the adoptive transfer of these T cells affected the bacterial burden in the lungs was not determined. This is important since it is abundantly clear that polyfunctional T cells do not reflect the ability of the T cells to restrict intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> growth.</p><p>2) Better quality and higher magnification H&amp;E images should be included. Also, it would be helpful in evaluating pathological changes if the low magnification images of the entire lung lobe for all the mice are provided, maybe as supplementary data. Also, histopathological changes should be presented as quantitation of lung inflammation rather than presenting it as the number of granulomas.</p><p>3) Concerns with the flow of the paper, which was slightly disjointed – it starts with in vitro work showing macrophages are important for the SIRT2 effect, then onto consistent results in a mouse model treated with the same inhibitor then back to showing T cells matter when it turns out that the mouse result is not consistent with previous work. It might be smoother if the authors showed upfront that macrophages and T-cells were involved in altered SIRT2 and then go on to the in vivo results to dissect which aspect has the largest effect in vivo. Further, the authors explain the discrepancy between Cardoso et al., 2015 results (higher CFU early and then no effect by 60 days) being due to the myeloid-specific KO used in the previous study. The drug/inhibitor being used in the current study may indeed show the importance of cells other than myeloid as having a role, however, considering in the current study the authors spent the first few figures arguing for the SIRT2 effect as being specific to macrophages, I find it hard to reconcile the sudden shift in argument that it is independent of macrophages.</p><p>4) To demonstrate a role for T cells in vivo during Sirt2 inhibition, the authors could deplete T-cells in the mouse after infection (+/- inhibitor) to see if the protective effect (of lower CFU burden) is lost without T-cells.</p><p>5) The other hypothesis is that the inhibitor is not just against SIRT2 and may have off-target effects explaining the reduced bacterial growth in mice. This could be tested by having genetic (SIRT2 T cell specific KO mouse) targeting of SIRT2. Without genetic validation to show that the drug is working through Sirt2 specifically and Sirt2's important role is in T cells (although it may still be a combination of macs + T cells), the authors must be careful to not overstate their findings without this genetic data.</p><p>6) Figure 1A – Unclear why only SIRT1 and 2 data was shown, when the claim is that they are significantly upregulated/downregulated from a total of 18 HDACs. Why not show all or at least comment on the others not being altered? Also unclear why there are no error bars to show the variability of induction after infection. Depending on how the data was normalized, it may be hard to show standard deviation, but at least put confidence intervals so the reader can interpret variability.</p><p>7) Figure 1E – The timepoint for upregulation of SIRT2 expression from 1A was 24 hrs – in 1B the reduced bacterial growth was at 48 hours. Did the reduced bacterial growth also correlate with a reduction in SIRT2 after drug treatment at 48hours? Could this effect be seen at 24 hours?</p><p>8) Figure 1F – this is CFU data presented as % survival – it would be easier to readers to interpret if the average CFU for each replicate was shown instead. Also with Figure 1I.</p><p>9) The RNAseq data in Figure 3 was nice to show the transcriptional landscape of SIRT2 inhibition in cells but I’m not really sure what the difference in 3D and 3E is, except for different ways of showing that immune genes are altered after SIRT2 inhibition. Also unclear why only 3 upregulated and 2 downregulated genes were cherry-picked to validate. Were more checked but didn't validate? It might have been nice to validate some of genes of the pathways that were highlighted in D and E.</p><p>10) Considering all of the in vitro and ex vivo work in Figures 1-4 were done in C57BL/6 mice, it is unclear why the study then switched to BALB/c mice for the in vivo experiments (i.e. BALB/c are still relatively resistant to infection but have different H2 haplotypes and immune profiles) and then back to C57BL/6 mice for some of the T-cell coculture experiments. Could the discrepancy with in vivo results and past work simply be due to different host backgrounds being examined in vivo? Can the authors comments on that in the Discussion?</p><p>11) In Figure 8 when infected mouse spleens are immunoprofiled, it is unclear why the authors chose the spleen and not the lung. It has been shown that there are organ-specific differences in protective immunity (Sakai, 2016). Was this experiment back to BALB/c mice again? This should be made clear in the figure legend.</p><p>12) There is no mention in the Introduction that genetic Sirt2 deletion in myeloid cells was shown to increase <italic>Mtb</italic> load in the lungs of mice early but not at later timepoints (Cardoso et al., 2015) or that SIRT2 deficiency enhances bacterial phagocytosis as a mechanism explaining increased survival in chronic staph infection (Ciarlo, 2017). These references are mentioned later in the Results and Discussion when the results are discrepant from previous studies, but it might be nice to mention these on the front to so the reader is aware there has been past work in this area (at the moment, the Introduction seems to be pitched that no one has looked at sirtuins in <italic>Mtb</italic> before).</p><p>13) Some hyperbole throughout manuscript – for e.g. &quot;to our astonishment&quot;; &quot;brilliant strategies&quot; could be toned down.</p><p>14) What was the sex of the mice used in vitro and in vivo? Note sex differences have been observed in both human and mouse studies. For the field standard and reproducibility, it would be helpful to include the mouse sex in the Materials and methods.</p><p>15) Several of the in vivo experiments (Figure 8, 9 and 10), the adoptive transfer experiment and splenocyte flow cytometry experiment were only performed once with 3 mice – for rigor and reproducibility, the authors should repeat these experiments for independent biological replicates.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Host Sirtuin 2 as an Immunotherapeutic Target against Tuberculosis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that the revised manuscript is greatly improved, and additional data have been provided to mostly address the original concerns. There were just a few remaining points to be addressed and included:</p><p>1) The authors should describe what the control cells are (Figure 10 G and H) in the adoptive transfer experiment. Are they cells from infected but not AGK2 infected mice?</p><p>2) Please add a discussion of the increase in acetylated-tubulin in infected (Cnt) cells compared to uninfected (Cnt) cells and the similar increase in infected (AGK2) cells compared to uninfected (AGK2) cells in Figure 2E.</p><p>3) For Figure 4, Figure 6E-J, please include data from both experiments.</p><p>4) Subsection “SIRT2 deacetylates NFκB p65 in <italic>Mtb</italic> specific T cells”, fourth paragraph should be read as – SIRT2 &quot;inhibition by AGK2&quot; modulated the acetylation.</p><p>5) Figure 7 – There are issues with the gating strategy of the lung APCs. The first gate is labeled as lymphocytes, but that is not an accurate label for that population. In general, how the authors decided on their gates is not clear and does not appear to match the pattern of cells on the plots. The boxes do not contain distinct populations and often cut across populations. Were fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls used to determine where to make the cutoff for each marker? Can authors provide details regarding what they think each population is, in addition to defining the populations based on markers?</p><p>6) Please confirm if the mouse experiments (Figure 7 – 10) were done more than once, and if they were only done once, please add a replicate experiment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55415.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 10: A key measurement missing in this experiment is CFU.

In the revised manuscript, we have included the representative 10X, 20X and 40X magnification images of the lungs (Figure 6B). The quantification of the lung inflammation is done in accordance with the previous literature (Soni et al., 2015). The table describing the number and nature of granulomas has now been included in the manuscript (Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concerns with the flow of the paper, which was slightly disjointed – it starts with in vitro work showing macrophages are important for the SIRT2 effect, then onto consistent results in a mouse model treated with the same inhibitor then back to showing T cells matter when it turns out that the mouse result is not consistent with previous work.

In the revised manuscript we have reorganized the figures in order to segregate the ex vivo and in vivo work more effectively.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the first two figures of the manuscript describe the importance of SIRT2 inhibition in macrophages in restricting intracellular bacterial growth. Our rationale behind starting the manuscript with the macrophage infection experiments was based on the fact that the macrophages are one of the very first cells to encounter <italic>Mtb</italic> inside the host. The transcriptome analysis of macrophages following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and SIRT2 inhibition revealed important insights into a plausible role of SIRT2 in modulating T cell responses during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and hence we went further to investigate the T cell mediated responses after SIRT2 inhibition.</p><p>We do concur that our ex vivo and in vivo results do not follow the same trend as described by Cardoso et al. in 2015 where myeloid-specific SIRT2 KO mice displayed higher bacterial burden at early time points with no effect at 60 days post infection. To address this disparity, we hypothesized that it is the inhibition of SIRT2 in cells other than macrophages is critical for containing the <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. To validate the hypothesis, we performed experiments in <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice that lack mature B and T cells. AGK2 treatment in these immuno-deficient mice did not alter the bacterial survival as compared to the control group (Figure 6H-J) indicating that SIRT2 inhibition in T cells is important to restrict <italic>Mtb</italic> growth inside the host. However, since macrophages are essential for activating T cell mediated immunity, we do not believe that the phenotype is independent of macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To demonstrate a role for T cells in vivo during Sirt2 inhibition, the authors could deplete T-cells in the mouse after infection (+/- inhibitor) to see if the protective effect (of lower CFU burden) is lost without T-cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their suggestion. To demonstrate the importance of SIRT2 inhibition in T cells, we used <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice which lack mature T cells. As discussed in the previous response, the effect of AGK2 treatment in terms of reduced bacterial survival is lost in these immuno-deficient mice (Figure 6H-J) indicating that inhibition of SIRT2 in T cells is important to restrict <italic>Mtb</italic> growth inside the host.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The other hypothesis is that the inhibitor is not just against SIRT2 and may have off-target effects explaining the reduced bacterial growth in mice.

The experiments in <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figure 6H-J) to an extent suggest that the observed phenotype is likely not due to do the off-target effects of AGK2. Nonetheless, we agree that in the absence of genetic validation, we should be careful not to overstate the findings. Thus, we have avoided making any overstatements in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1A – Unclear why only SIRT1 and 2 data was shown, when the claim is that they are significantly upregulated/downregulated from a total of 18 HDACs.

In the revised manuscript, bar graph in Figure 1A is replaced by a table detailing the expression of all the HDACs which are significantly altered in THP1 cells at 24h post infection (SIRT1, SIRT2, HDAC6 and HDAC9).

Could this effect be seen at 24 hours?</p></disp-quote><p>AGK2 is a specific and a reversible inhibitor of SIRT2 activity. It is known that AGK2 targets the nicotinamide binding site of SIRT2 (Outeiro et al., 2007). However, our data suggests that AGK2 treatment during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection also leads to the reduction of SIRT2 mRNA levels. We believe that the reduced bacterial survival after 48h of AGK2 treatment is because of the inhibition of SIRT2 activity as well as a reduction in SIRT2 levels. Similar mycobacterial growth restriction was observed as early as 24h post treatment with AGK2. The data is provided in Figure 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1F – this is CFU data presented as % survival – it would be easier to readers to interpret if the average CFU for each replicate was shown instead. Also with Figure 1I.</p></disp-quote><p>The CFU data was presented as % survival wrt the 0h time point to negate the effect of any variation in the uptake of the bacilli due to the pre-treatment with AGK2. In the revised manuscript, the data in Figure 1F and 1I has been replaced by the average CFU for each replicate at 0h and 48h post infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The RNAseq data in Figure 3 was nice to show the transcriptional landscape of SIRT2 inhibition in cells but I’m not really sure what the difference in 3D and 3E is, except for different ways of showing that immune genes are altered after SIRT2 inhibition. Also unclear why only 3 upregulated and 2 downregulated genes were cherry-picked to validate. Were more checked but didn't validate? It might have been nice to validate some of genes of the pathways that were highlighted in D and E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rearranged the figure. Earlier Figure 3D depicted the KEGG pathway analysis of all the SIRT2 dependent genes whereas Figure 3E represented the gene ontology immune system analysis on SIRT2 dependent upregulated genes. However, to avoid confusion we have removed Figure 3E in the revised version. We have also included RT-PCR on the candidate genes which belong to key pathways such as antigen presentation and processing, Th17 differentiation, T cell activation, NFκB signalling and PI3K-Akt signalling (Figure 3D and 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Considering all of the in vitro and ex vivo work in Figures 1-4 were done in C57BL/6 mice, it is unclear why the study then switched to BALB/c mice for the in vivo experiments (i.e. BALB/c are still relatively resistant to infection but have different H2 haplotypes and immune profiles) and then back to C57BL/6 mice for some of the T-cell coculture experiments. Could the discrepancy with in vivo results and past work simply be due to different host backgrounds being examined in vivo? Can the authors comments on that in the Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments. In order to maintain the consistency in the ex vivo and in vivo work, we have now repeated the in vivo experiments in C57BL/6 mice. The <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice used in the study are also in C57BL/6 background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 8 when infected mouse spleens are immunoprofiled, it is unclear why the authors chose the spleen and not the lung. It has been shown that there are organ-specific differences in protective immunity (Sakai, 2016). Was this experiment back to BALB/c mice again? This should be made clear in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concern, we have included the immune profiling data of the lungs of infected C57BL/6 mice (Figure 7A-E, Figure 8A-G and Figure 9A-G) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) There is no mention in the Introduction that genetic Sirt2 deletion in myeloid cells was shown to increase Mtb load in the lungs of mice early but not at later timepoints (Cardoso et al., 2015) or that SIRT2 deficiency enhances bacterial phagocytosis as a mechanism explaining increased survival in chronic staph infection (Ciarlo, 2017). These references are mentioned later in the Results and Discussion when the results are discrepant from previous studies, but it might be nice to mention these on the front to so the reader is aware there has been past work in this area (at the moment, the Introduction seems to be pitched that no one has looked at sirtuins in Mtb before).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the insight. In the revised manuscript, we have modified the Introduction by adding these references and a few more which talk about sirtuins and HDACs during bacterial infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Some hyperbole throughout manuscript – for e.g. &quot;to our astonishment&quot;; &quot;brilliant strategies&quot; could be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns.

The first gate is labeled as lymphocytes, but that is not an accurate label for that population. In general, how the authors decided on their gates is not clear and does not appear to match the pattern of cells on the plots. The boxes do not contain distinct populations and often cut across populations. Were fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls used to determine where to make the cutoff for each marker? Can authors provide details regarding what they think each population is, in addition to defining the populations based on markers?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their insights. We would like to apologize for the mislabelling of the population in dot plot. By default, FlowJo software names the first population to be gated as lymphocytes. In the revised version, we have changed the name of the first gate in Figure 7-9. Since in Figure 7-9, we are analysing the total lung and spleen cells, the first gate was decided based on the distinct population by adjusting FSC and SSC voltages followed by doublet exclusion gates. Yes, we use FMO controls for the gating. We also use unstained and single colour controls to apply the gates over the population wherever it is necessary. Further, we make use of contour plots to mark the populations whenever they are not clearly distinct in the dot plots. Finally, we apply the same gates across the samples to be analysed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please confirm if the mouse experiments (Figure 7 – 10) were done more than once, and if they were only done once, please add a replicate experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the mice experiments in Figure 6-10 were done more than once.
