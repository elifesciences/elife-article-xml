A hallmark of this condition is progressive loss of memory, accompanied by a buildup of hard clumps of protein between the brain cells. These protein clumps, known as amyloid plaques, are a key focus of research into Alzheimer's disease. They are likely to be toxic to brain cells, but their role in the development and progression of the disease is not yet known.</p><p>Though the cause of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, an inherited form of the disease may hold some clues. Mutations in genes for proteins called presenilins cause an earlier onset form of Alzheimer's disease, in which symptoms can develop in people who are in their 40s or 50s. The presenilin proteins appear in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays many roles in the normal activities of a cell. Among other things, this structure stores and releases calcium ions, and cells use these ions to send and process many signals.</p><p>The cell's energy-producing powerhouses, the mitochondria, use calcium to boost their metabolic activity. This allows them to make more energy for the cell, but in the process they also make damaging byproducts. These byproducts include oxygen-containing chemicals, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which react strongly with other molecules. While low levels of ROS are a normal part of cell activity, if the levels get too high, these chemicals can attack and damage structures within the cell.</p><p>Untangling the effects of amyloid plaques and presenilins on brain cells in humans is challenging. But, a nematode worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> does not form plaques, making it possible to look at presenilins on their own. Previous work in these worms has shown that presenilin mutations affect the endoplasmic reticulum and change the appearance of mitochondria. Here, Sarasija et al. extend this work to find out more about the effects presenilin mutations have on living cells.</p><p>Presenilin mutations in young adult worms increased the amount of calcium released by the endoplasmic reticulum. This increased the activity of the mitochondria and caused ROS levels to rise to damaging levels. This caused stress inside the cells, and the worms started to show early signs damage to their nervous systems. Mutations that decreased the movement of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria helped to prevent the damage. Treating the mitochondria with antioxidants to mop up the extra ROS also protected the cells.</p><p>This kind of damage to brain cells did not depend on amyloid plaques. Whilst the plaques are likely to be toxic, these new findings highlights the role that other chemical and biological processes might play in Alzheimer's disease. Further work to reveal the underlying cause of Alzheimer's disease may lead to new therapies to treat this condition in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>presenilin</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM088213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>Kenneth R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, presenilin functions, independent of its gamma-secretase proteolytic activity, to regulate mitochondrial metabolism by controlling ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer and, even in the absence of Abeta signaling, loss of this activity leads to neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all metazoans, mitochondria are essential organelles and mitochondrial dysfunction is frequently observed in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. While mitochondria have a well-established role in ATP generation, they also have a vital role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Several studies have shown that release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in the elevation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels which in turn stimulates metabolic activity of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das and Harris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glancy and Balaban, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansford and Zorov, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCormack and Denton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mildaziene et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wernette et al., 1981</xref>). Thus, insults or deregulated signaling between the ER and mitochondria can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and affect cellular fitness.</p><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and accounts for between 60–80% of all cases of dementia. Familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is a subset of AD where there is a genetic predisposition to the disease as a result of mutations predominantly in the presenilin genes, <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">ALZFORUM, 2016</xref>). PSENs are ~50 kDa multipass transmembrane proteins that primarily localize to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008</xref>) and are enriched in the ER membrane associated with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Area-Gomez et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, PSENs are the critical aspartyl protease component of the gamma-secretase complex, a multi-subunit protease that resides in cellular membranes. Gamma-secretase is involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) into beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides, and in the cleavage and activation of several other transmembrane proteins, including Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beel and Sanders, 2008</xref>). Dominating the study of AD pathogenesis is the amyloid hypothesis which ascertains that altered PSEN function leads to an increase in the toxic Abeta42 peptide, and the eventual accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain leads to neurodegeneration and dementia observed in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardy, 2006</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that while amyloid plaques serve as a histopathological hallmark of AD, there is no correlation between plaque load and the severity of dementia, and postmortem analyses of some AD patients with exaggerated cognitive decline have shown a lack of plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giannakopoulos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guillozet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Terry et al., 1991</xref>). Also, using neuroimaging techniques, extensive plaque formation has been observed in people with no cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nordberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Villemagne et al., 2008</xref>). Concomitantly, there is a large body of work that implicates exacerbated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as the causative agent in AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leissring et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stutzmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tu et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, there is evidence of enhanced ER-mitochondria crosstalk in cells from FAD patients with mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic>, <italic>PSEN2</italic>, and <italic>APP</italic>, as well as patients with sporadic AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Area-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>) and enhanced ER to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer is observed in cells expressing FAD-mutant PSEN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zampese et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, reactive oxygen-mediated oxidative damage has been observed in brains of AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lovell and Markesbery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lovell et al., 2011</xref>) and an increase in hydrogen peroxide levels is observed in AD mice models even prior to the appearance of plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manczak et al., 2006</xref>). However, despite decades of research, a clear connection between these seemingly disparate observations does not exist that explains the pathogenesis of AD.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> disruption of the PSEN ortholog, SEL-12, leads to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation that causes mitochondrial disorganization and reduced organismal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>). Here, we examine whether these mitochondrial defects observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants lead to mitochondrial metabolic defects that can result in neuronal dysfunction. From these analyses, we find that <italic>sel-12</italic> mutations result in increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, accelerated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. Remarkably, we demonstrate that reducing ER to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants can normalize mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and function, reduce the levels of ROS and suppress neurodegeneration. Moreover, we demonstrate similar mitochondrial dysfunction in fibroblasts isolated from FAD patients. Lastly, we show that treating <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant suppresses the neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> do not encode an Abeta peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daigle and Li, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McColl et al., 2012</xref>), our data indicates that neurodegeneration occurs in presenilin mutants by faulty ER to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer leading to mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, completely independent of Abeta signaling, and consummates in the rise of mitochondrial ROS generation to detrimental levels. Therefore, our study provides a comprehensive delineation of AD pathogenesis in an intact animal model and its importance is underscored by the fact that we provide evidence that Abeta signaling does not appear necessary for neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations in <italic>sel-12</italic> increase mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration resulting in increased OXPHOS</title><p>Previously, we observed mitochondrial disorganization in the body wall muscle of <italic>sel-12</italic> animals, which could be rescued by reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER or mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that mutations in <italic>sel-12</italic> result in increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. To test this hypothesis, we expressed in the body wall muscle, a mitochondrial matrix targeted GCaMP6 (a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator) along with a red fluorescent protein, mCherry, as an expression control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We normalized the fluorescence intensity of the GCaMP6 to that of mCherry to determine the relative mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in day one adult wild type animals and two <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, <italic>sel-12 (ar131) and sel-12(ty11). sel-12(ar131)</italic> mutants carry a missense mutation in the <italic>sel-12</italic> gene, which is a conserved change seen in FAD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">ALZFORUM, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levitan and Greenwald, 1995</xref>) and <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> mutants contain a premature stop codon in the <italic>sel-12</italic> gene, which is a predicted null mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cinar et al., 2001</xref>). Strikingly, we observe that the relative fluorescence intensity of GCaMP6 to mCherry is 2.4 and 3.4 fold higher in <italic>sel-12 (ar131) and sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals, respectively, compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, consistent with our hypothesis, <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants have higher levels of mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Since <italic>sel-12</italic>, like <italic>PSEN1</italic>, is widely expressed, we examined mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in a subset of neurons using the same ratiometric GCaMP6/mCherry construct. Similar to our observation of body wall muscle mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, we detected higher fluorescence levels of GCaMP6 in the ALM and PLM light touch mechanosensory neurons of <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants consistent with elevated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Although mitochondria can act as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink, they also respond dynamically to increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Indeed, an increase in mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels results in the coordinated up regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS, increasing ATP output and ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das and Harris, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glancy and Balaban, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansford and Zorov, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCormack and Denton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mildaziene et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wernette et al., 1981</xref>). Thus, to investigate whether the elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutant mitochondria influence mitochondrial activity, we first analyzed ATP levels as a general read out of mitochondrial function. Remarkably, we observed that ATP levels are higher in <italic>sel-12(ar131), sel-12(ty11)</italic> and <italic>sel-12(ok2078)</italic> (an additional null allele) animals when compared to age matched day one wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, to determine whether this elevation in ATP levels was a result of amplified OXPHOS, we examined mitochondrial respiration by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutant and wild type animals using a Seahorse XFp Analyzer. While wild type animals had a basal OCR of 3.9 pmol/min/worm, <italic>sel-12(ar131), sel-12(ty11)</italic> and <italic>sel-12(ok2078)</italic> animals respired at a rate of 5.8, 6.4 and 5.5 pmol/min/worm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, when challenged with carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), an uncoupler of mitochondrial OXPHOS, we detected an increased maximal OCR of 11.7, 10.3 and 10 pmol/min/worm in <italic>sel-12(ar131), sel-12(ty11)</italic> and <italic>sel-12(ok2078)</italic> animals respectively when compared to the maximal OCR of 7.2 pmol/min/worm in wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants have elevated OXPHOS activity, which results in higher OCR and ATP levels. Consistent with elevated mitochondrial activity, we have previously reported high ROS levels in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, as <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants age, mitochondrial respiration dramatically decreases compared to wild type animals suggesting a reduction of mitochondrial function in old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>The elevated levels of ATP, ROS and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as the high OCR observed in young adult <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants could arise due to increased mitochondrial content in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. Thus, to investigate this possibility, we first used qRT-PCR to measure relative mitochondrial DNA (mitoDNA) copy number versus nuclear DNA in day one adult wild type and <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. We found that the relative mitoDNA copy number in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants is similar to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Additionally, we measured fluorescence intensity of day one adult animals expressing a TOM20::GFP integrated transgene that labels the outer mitochondrial membrane in the body wall muscle. We found that fluorescence intensity between wild type and <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants are indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data suggest that the changes in ATP and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and OCR are not caused by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis or mitochondrial accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Skin fibroblasts isolated from FAD patients have increased ATP, OCR and ROS levels</title><p>A recent study on astrocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from AD patients with <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutations demonstrated high OCR and ROS levels in these cells, which could be rescued by CRISPR/Cas9 correction of the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oksanen et al., 2017</xref>). These data along with our data suggest a conserved role of PSEN1 and SEL-12 in regulating mitochondrial activity. To investigate this further, we analyzed mitochondrial activity in skin fibroblast cells isolated from FAD patients with PSEN1 mutations. First, we examined ATP levels to obtain an approximation of mitochondrial activity in control and FAD fibroblasts. As we observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, we found that ATP levels are significantly higher in FAD fibroblasts compared to control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Next, we investigated mitochondrial respiratory rate by measuring oxygen consumption in FAD and control fibroblasts. Again, consistent with the <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants and similar to FAD astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oksanen et al., 2017</xref>), we found that the basal and maximal OCRs are significantly higher in FAD fibroblasts compared to control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Lastly, since we previously found high levels of ROS in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>) and ROS is produced by mitochondrial respiratory activity, we examined ROS levels in FAD and control fibroblasts. Like <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants and FAD astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oksanen et al., 2017</xref>), we found elevated ROS in the FAD fibroblasts compared to control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These observations are consistent with PSEN1 having a role in mitochondrial activity in human fibroblasts similar to the role SEL-12 has in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>sel-12</italic> mutants have disorganized mitochondrial morphology in mechanosensory neurons</title><p>In addition to body wall muscle mitochondria, we previously observed mitochondrial disorganization in a subset of interneurons in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>) and therefore, sought to determine whether mutations in <italic>sel-12</italic> lead to mitochondrial disorganization in other neuronal cell types and, if so, investigate whether this leads to a physiological defect in neuronal function in vivo. We focused on touch receptor neurons, a class of mechanosensory neurons that respond to light touch.

Thus, we next investigated whether mechanosensation is mediated in a gamma-secretase dependent but Notch-independent manner. We pharmacologically inhibited gamma-secretase activity using Compound E which specifically blocks SEL-12 but not HOP-1 (another <italic>C. elegans</italic> presenilin homolog) mediated gamma-secretase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>). In order to obtain complete lack of gamma-secretase activity, we treated <italic>hop-1(ar179)</italic> null animals with Compound E and examined their response to light touch. The gamma-secretase inhibited animals responded at 87.1, 79.8 and 78.3% to light touch at day 1, 2 and 3 of adulthood respectively, which is similar to wild type animals at 83.1, 69.3 and 67.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of ALM mechanosensory neuron morphology in animals treated with Compound E did not show ectopic sprouts as is observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While compound E treatment clearly shows loss of gamma-secretase function regarding Notch signaling (e.g. <italic>glp-1</italic> like sterility), it is unclear whether the drug is targeting the nervous system. To address this caveat, we generated a proteolytic dead version of SEL-12. The gamma-secretase activity of presenilin is dependent on the presence of two intact aspartate residues, D257 and D385 in PSEN1. Disruption of one aspartate residue leaves PS catalytically nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolfe et al., 1999</xref>).

Consistent with gamma-secretase inactivation, the SEL-12 D226A mutant does not rescue the loss of Notch signaling required for vulval development leaving the <italic>sel-12</italic> animals with their characteristic egg-laying defect. However, <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals expressing the gamma-secretase dead SEL-12, similar to the animals expressing wild type SEL-12 rescue construct show improved response to touch at 85 and 82.8%, respectively, comparable to the response of wild type animals at 79.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Similar to our studies of mitochondrial structure in the body wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>), we observe a dramatic improvement of mitochondrial organization in <italic>crt-1; sel-12</italic> double mutants compared to <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Next, to ascertain whether exacerbated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is responsible for the elevated OCR observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, we determined the OCR in <italic>crt-1; sel-12</italic> and <italic>unc-68; sel-12</italic> mutant animals. We found that <italic>crt-1; sel-12</italic> and <italic>unc-68; sel-12</italic> double mutants have basal OCR and maximal OCR rates comparable to wild type and significantly lower than <italic>sel-12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These data are consistent with the notion that higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER leads to elevated OXPHOS in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. Additionally, this elevated OXPHOS activity can explain the increased levels of ROS we previously observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarasija and Norman, 2015</xref>). Since we found that the OCR was decreased in <italic>sel-12</italic> animals that had reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, indicating decreased OXPHOS activity, we investigated whether <italic>crt-1; sel-12</italic> mutant animals would have a reduced ROS burden. To test this, we quantified ROS formation and discovered that <italic>crt-1; sel-12</italic> animals have ROS levels comparable to wild type animals and lower than <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Strikingly, the ectopic sprouting, wave-like processes, lesions and breaks of the ALM mechanosensory neurons observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants are strongly suppressed in <italic>crt-1; sel-12</italic> and <italic>unc-68; sel-12</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

To reduce mitochondrial activity, we used doxycycline to inhibit mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moullan et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals grown in the presence of doxycycline showed inhibition of mitochondrial function as evidenced by the suppression of the high mitochondrial respiration rate observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Interestingly, doxycycline treatment also rescued the mechanosensory defects in <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals, both in touch response and axon morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). Moreover, to test whether elevated mitochondrial activity causes the elevated ATP and ROS levels and OCR observed in FAD fibroblasts, we treated control and FAD fibroblasts with doxycycline and measured these outputs. Consistent with FAD cells showing high mitochondrial activity, doxycycline treatment reduced ATP and ROS levels as well as OCR in FAD fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–I</xref>).

To gain further insight into the cause of neurodegeneration in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, we sought to determine the mechanism underlying the neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. First, to investigate whether there is an elevation in mitochondrial ROS in the mechanosensory neurons undergoing neurodegeneration, we used a mitochondrial matrix targeted roGFP, a reduction-oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Remington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>) and discovered that <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals have elevated mitochondrial ROS compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Since OXPHOS leads to the production of superoxides, high levels of which can be toxic to cells and we observed elevated OXPHOS and mitochondrial ROS in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, we hypothesized that mitochondrial superoxide production could be causing the neurodegeneration observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. To investigate the impact of mitochondrial superoxide production on the mechanosensory defects observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, we exposed <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals to a mitochondria-targeted superoxide-scavenger called MitoTEMPO or triphenylphosphonium (TPP), which lacks the superoxide-scavenging moiety and acts as a control. Consistent with MitoTEMPO reducing mitochondrial ROS levels without altering mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, we found that <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals treated with 500 µM MitoTEMPO showed significant reduction in oxidized neuronal mitochondrial roGFP fluorescence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>) while mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels remained similar to control <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we examined neuronal structure and behavioral response to light touch. <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals raised on MitoTEMPO show a decrease in the number of ectopic neuronal sprouts from two sprouts/ALM in control <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals to one sprouts/ALM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) while TPP treated animals showed no such improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

However, MitoTEMPO treatment does not rescue the mitochondrial morphology defects seen in <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that oxidative stress is not directly causing mitochondrial structural disorganization.

Despite the identification of PSEN involvement in AD over 20 years ago, the mechanism causing neurodegeneration in FAD patients has remained elusive. In this study, we provide evidence that mutations in the gene encoding a <italic>C. elegans</italic> PSEN homolog, <italic>sel-12</italic> result in ER to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling defects, elevated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, mitochondrial structural disorganization, dysfunction of mitochondrial metabolism and subsequent oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration.

Moreover, we show that skin fibroblasts isolated from FAD patients with mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> show a similar mitochondrial phenotype as observed in <italic>C. elegans sel-12</italic> mutants, demonstrating a conserved role of PSEN in mitochondrial regulation.

Furthermore, mitochondria have a critical role in buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in turn modulates mitochondrial activity. Indeed, increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> aids in the allosteric activation of several TCA cycle enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCormack and Denton, 1993</xref>), stimulates the ATP synthase (complex V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das and Harris, 1990</xref>), α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCormack and Denton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wernette et al., 1981</xref>) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCormack and Denton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mildaziene et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, the increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration results in the coordinated upregulation of the TCA cycle and OXPHOS machinery, allowing for increased oxygen consumption, and ATP and ROS production. Here, we discover that mutations in <italic>sel-12</italic> lead to deregulated ER and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling resulting in increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which promotes mitochondrial metabolic activity. Additionally, we provide evidence that this elevated metabolic activity elevates ROS levels in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants and the deleterious effects of ROS results in the emergence of structural and functional phenotypes of neurodegeneration.</p><p>Upon reducing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, the mitochondria of <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants are no longer disorganized and show normal OCR, and the high levels of ROS and neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants are suppressed. These data indicate that SEL-12 activity is required for normal ER to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, proper mitochondrial function and mitochondrial superoxide maintenance. Consistent with PSENs having a role in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, several studies in a variety of PSEN FAD models as well as tissue samples isolated from AD patients have shown that loss of PSEN function leads to perturbed ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ito et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leissring et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tu et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, PSENs are predominantly ER membrane proteins that are enriched in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Area-Gomez et al., 2009</xref>). The mitochondria-associated ER membrane is a highly active subcompartment of the ER that is physically connected to the mitochondria and is critical for several metabolic functions, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, cholesterol metabolism and the synthesis and transfer of phospholipids between the ER and mitochondria. Importantly, elevated ER to mitochondrial contact and crosstalk has been observed in <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic> knockout cells, in cells expressing FAD mutant PSEN2, and in skin fibroblasts from FAD and sporadic AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Area-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filadi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kipanyula et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zampese et al., 2011</xref>). Although the functional importance of these observations has not been resolved, our analyses of skin fibroblasts isolated from FAD patients, indicates that there is an up regulation of OXPHOS, ATP production and ROS generation that can be reduced by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, similar to what we observe in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. We also demonstrate that in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants neurodegeneration is caused by elevated ER to mitochondrial transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, these data present an inclusive model that indicates that PSEN function on the ER membrane is required for normal ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria and in the absence of optimal PSEN function, excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> is transferred to the mitochondria leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and an elevation of mitochondrial generated superoxide radicals that promote neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). However, recent analyses of PSEN1/2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), unlike our studies, have shown reduced mitochondrial activity suggesting PSEN function is vital for mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Contino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pera et al., 2017</xref>). Significantly, one of these studies demonstrated that the reduction of mitochondrial function in PSEN1/2 KO MEFs could be rescued by PSEN2 and not PSEN1, implicating a role of PSEN2 in mitochondrial function in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Contino et al., 2017</xref>). While the reduced mitochondrial activity might appear to be at odds with our study, a recent analysis of astrocytes derived from iPSCs isolated from skin cells from patients with <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutations also showed elevated OCR and ROS production, which could be rescued by CRISPR/Cas9 repair of the <italic>PSEN1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oksanen et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, illustrating an important role of PSEN1 in the regulation of mitochondrial activity in astrocytes similar to SEL-12 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Also of note, we did observe in day eight vs. day one adult <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants a drastic reduction of mitochondrial activity in comparison to aged matched wild type animals indicating that in aged animals mitochondria function becomes impaired in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, consistent with the decreased mitochondrial function as a result of PSEN mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). The impairment of mitochondrial function with age in <italic>sel-12(ty11)</italic> animals could be a result of increased mitochondrial activity resulting in ROS-mediated oxidative damage at earlier stages of adulthood.</p><p>The best-studied function of PSEN is its role as the proteolytic component of the gamma-secretase complex and its cleavage of APP and Notch. Gamma-secretase mediated cleavage is required for the activation of Notch signaling and emphasizes the critical role of PSEN in mediating Notch function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Strooper et al., 1997</xref>). Also, it is the gamma-secretase mediated cleavage of APP that leads to the generation of Abeta peptides of various lengths, including the toxic Abeta42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardy, 2006</xref>). Here, we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that gamma-secretase activity of SEL-12 is not required for neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. While we are not able to rescue Notch signaling defects using a <italic>sel-12</italic> protease dead genetic construct, we are able to rescue the mechanosensory behavioral defects observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Furthermore, using a gamma-secretase inhibitor, which abolished Notch signaling, we do not recapitulate the neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Consistently, our analyses of Notch mutants also did not reveal mechanosensory defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results demonstrate that the role of SEL-12 in the regulation of mitochondrial function and nervous system fitness does not require gamma-secretase activity or Notch signaling.</p><p>In the last two decades, research into AD therapeutics has relied heavily on the amyloid hypothesis, which holds the toxic Abeta peptides and their aggregation to form plaques responsible for AD pathogenesis. However, the exact role Abeta peptides have in AD is not clear, which is further emphasized by the failure of phase III trials of anti-Abeta therapies like the gamma-secretase inhibitor, semagacestat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doody et al., 2013</xref>) and solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Couteur et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests the need to shift focus from Abeta peptides to more proximal causes of AD. Therefore, <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a unique system for investigating the mechanisms underlying AD. Besides the usual strengths (e.g. rapid growth cycle, genetic manipulation, cell biological approaches, simple nervous system), <italic>C. elegans</italic> encodes a single APP-like protein, <italic>apl-1</italic>. Unlike APP, APL-1, like its APL-1 mammalian homologs (APLP1 and ALPL2), lack the Abeta peptide sequence. Furthermore, APL-1 lacks the beta-secretase recognition sequences and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome does not encode a beta-secretase; therefore, it is unlikely that <italic>C. elegans</italic> produce Abeta peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daigle and Li, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McColl et al., 2012</xref>) and indeed, no Abeta peptides have been detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McColl et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a model system that can explore the mechanism underlying AD without the confounding role of Abeta. Excitingly, utilizing this experimental system, we find that in the absence of Abeta, mutations in PSEN result in deregulated ER to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that causes elevated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> which hyperactivates mitochondrial respiration leading to the accumulation of superoxides and the subsequent reduction of neuronal cell function and health.</p><p>In spite of our findings indicating that the role of SEL-12 in neurodegeneration is independent of Abeta accumulation, due to the fact that worms do not express Abeta, some toxic effects of Abeta accumulation have been demonstrated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Overexpression of human Abeta1-42 results in chemosensory defects, locomotor defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Ebert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dosanjh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) and touch defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, similar to the drastic reduction of OXPHOS we observe in older adult <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants compared to age matched wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), recent studies have shown that overexpression of human Abeta1-42 in the nervous system or body wall muscle results in the reduction of OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorrentino et al., 2017</xref>). However, there are some important distinctions between overexpression of human Abeta1-42 and mutations in <italic>sel-12</italic>. Although overexpression of human Abeta1-42 in the nervous system disrupts touch response similar to <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), it fails to result in hallmark <italic>sel-12</italic> mutation defects such as axonal morphology phenotypes, disorganized mitochondria, and excessive calcium loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism of Abeta1-42 overexpression appears distinct from presenilin mutations. These important findings suggest that an initial insult in FAD, since <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not produce Abeta peptides, is elevated ROS production from the mitochondria due to an increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer. Thus, Abeta accumulation may be a secondary, albeit critical, component to the pathogenesis of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal maintenance and strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> are grown on NGM plates between 16–25°C.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Presenilin mutations deregulate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and metabolic activity causing neurodegeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While there is enthusiasm for this body of work, there is also concern about the completion of the outlined experiments.</p><p>The authors of the study propose that neurodegeneration occurring in Alzheimer's disease might be completely independent of amyloid aggregates presence, and they attempt to demonstrate this hypothesis using mostly <italic>C. elegans</italic> presenilin mutants. These should offer the advantage of a clean model where to study the effects of LOF presenilin on neurodegeneration independently of Abeta amyloid generation. They show that in the presenilin mutants neurodegeneration occurs by faulty ER to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer, which leads to increased mitochondrial ROS generation and conclude that Abeta presence is not necessary for neurodegeneration.</p><p>There are two major lines of inquiry that need to be addressed before this paper can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. One, the authors need to firmly address whether increased OXPHOS and ATP production and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> is indeed the culprit behind the increased respiration rates. Two, the results surrounding the PSEN mutation in the absence of Abeta production are bold, yet lack experimentation. Within both lines of query, the worm model can be used and the reviewers are not asking for new discoveries in vertebrate models, but rather formal testing in existing worm models. A detailed list of experiments is bullet pointed to guide the authors.</p><p>1) Does ETC respiration play a direct role on the phenotypes observed? In worms this is simple to achieve with RNAi towards any one of the ETC subunits, mitochondrial ribosome components or merely treating with doxycycline. This needs to also be confirmed in the human patient cell lines.</p><p>2) Figure 2 describes defects in mito morphology, fragmented, that do not really fit the OCR and OXPHOS results. The authors need to block fission and test if the <italic>sel-12</italic> mutant is still effective. RNAi towards <italic>drp-1</italic> should suffice.</p><p>3) The calreticulin mutant experiment is over interpreted on its own. The loss of <italic>crt-1</italic> will indeed disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling from the ER, but it also creates a mess for the ER affecting many other things. Therefore, I think another approach should be employed and OCR and OXPHOS on these animals must be performed.</p><p>4) The MitoTEMPO experiments are neat, but uncontrolled. The authors need to test ROS levels in the MitoTEMPO <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants as well as express a catalytically dead version of MitoTEMPO to ensure that it is not merely affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on its own. Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels need to be measured as well.</p><p>5) The authors insist that Abeta peptide production is not necessary for neurodegeneration. However, existence of amyloid plaque accumulation is a well-known pathological hallmark of AD and using only <italic>C. elegans</italic> devoid of amyloid plaque accumulation as an AD model is hence not sufficient for such a bold conclusion. The authors should measure neurodegeneration and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in a neuronal/muscle Abeta expressing worm line. In case these worms have Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels perturbations, they should try to rescue neurodegeneration by normalizing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Moreover, they should clearly state that their conclusions are a) limited to this model system, and b) show that mutations in PSEN are enough to cause neurodegeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but one can't exclude the additional contributions of Abeta in humans.</p><p>6) A recent paper studying MEFs from PSEN KO mice (Contino et al., 2017), shows results that seems to contradict the result presented in this manuscript, with mitochondria showing decreased OXPHOS, respiration and ATP production in MEFs KO cells. How could the authors reconcile their proposed mechanism with this work?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Presenilin mutations deregulate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and metabolic activity causing neurodegeneration in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have performed a number of additional experiments. The revised manuscript is thereby largely improved, however, there are still a few aspects that require clarity in the final manuscript.</p><p>1) The doxycycline experiments show a clear improvement of the phenotypes in worms and cells. However, while for worms the authors use an amount of compound in the range of what also reported by literature (μg/ml), for the fibroblast experiments they report a concentration of 5 mg/ml, which seems very high. Lower concentrations (in the 0.5-30 μg/ml range) have been shown to affect mitochondrial function in cells, while still not affecting viability, why is such a high amount used here? Are the cells still viable? An experiment with a lower dosage of dox, or a dose titration study, should be included.</p><p>2) While the authors have performed the Abeta expression experiments in the worms, the description and experiments fully proving the presence and effect of Abeta are still superficial. First, a detailed description of the methods used to generate the transgenic Abeta worms should be included. Secondly, experiments showing the presence and expression of Abeta peptide should be included. Third, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and mitochondrial morphology do not seem affected, literature has largely described that the presence of Abeta in worms' neurons (one example, doi:10.1038/srep33781) or in muscle (for instance, doi: 10.1038/nature25143) consistently affects mitochondrial function by reducing respiration and affecting other mitochondrial parameters. The authors need to bring these papers into their Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33052.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] There are 2 major lines of inquiry that need to be addressed before this paper can be considered for publication in eLife. One, the authors need to firmly address whether increased OXPHOS and ATP production and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> is indeed the culprit behind the increased respiration rates. Two, the results surrounding the PSEN mutation in the absence of Abeta production are bold, yet lack experimentation. Within both lines of query, the worm model can be used and the reviewers are not asking for new discoveries in vertebrate models, but rather formal testing in existing worm models. A detailed list of experiments is bullet pointed to guide the authors.</p><p>1) Does ETC respiration play a direct role on the phenotypes observed? In worms this is simple to achieve with RNAi towards any one of the ETC subunits, mitochondrial ribosome components or merely treating with doxycycline. This needs to also be confirmed in the human patient cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we took the reviewers’ suggestion and inhibited ETC by adding an appropriate amount of doxycycline to our worms or cultured fibroblasts. From these analyses, we found mitochondrial ETC respiration has a critical role in the <italic>sel-12</italic> mutant neurodegenerative phenotype. This data is incorporated into a new figure (Figure 8) and the Results section (subsection “Reducing mitochondrial function but not mitochondrial fission rescues neurodegeneration in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2 describes defects in mito morphology, fragmented, that do not really fit the OCR and OXPHOS results. The authors need to block fission and test if the sel-12 mutant is still effective. RNAi towards drp-1 should suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we again listened to the reviewers suggestions and used <italic>drp-1(RNAi)</italic> to improve mitochondrial structure in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants and analyzed mitochondrial function. From these analyses, while we could improve mitochondrial morphology, we did not see an improvement in the <italic>sel-12</italic> phenotype. These data are presented in a new figure (Figure 8—figure supplement 1) and a new Results subsection “Reducing mitochondrial function but not mitochondrial fission rescues neurodegeneration in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The calreticulin mutant experiment is over interpreted on its own. The loss of crt-1 will indeed disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling from the ER, but it also creates a mess for the ER affecting many other things. Therefore, I think another approach should be employed and OCR and OXPHOS on these animals must be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The other approach we used to address this concern was to introduce an <italic>unc-68</italic> null mutation (<italic>unc-68</italic> encodes the sole ryanodine receptor in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome) in the <italic>sel-12</italic> background and tested whether loss of <italic>unc-68</italic> could suppress the elevated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, abnormal axon morphology and elevated OCR we observe in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. Similar to the <italic>crt-1</italic> null mutation, we found that <italic>unc-68</italic> loss could also suppress the <italic>sel-12</italic> phenotypes. This data is shown in a new figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and in the Results (subsection “Decreasing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release improves mitochondrial function and suppresses neurodegeneration in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The MitoTEMPO experiments are neat, but uncontrolled. The authors need to test ROS levels in the MitoTEMPO sel-12 mutants as well as express a catalytically dead version of MitoTEMPO to ensure that it is not merely affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on its own. Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels need to be measured as well.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these concerns, we tested whether MitoTEMPO could reduce mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and/or ROS levels. To accomplish this we utilized our mGCaMP6/mCherry construct and measured the ratio of GCaMP6/mCherry fluorescence in the presence or absence of MitoTEMPO. Similarly, we utilized a redox sensitive GFP (roGFP) that is expressed in the mechanosensory neurons to gauge whether MitoTEMPO is reducing ROS in the mitochondria of these neurons. We found that MitoTEMPO did not influence mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels but did reduce mitochondrial ROS levels. These data are presented in the subsection “Mitochondrial generated superoxides cause mechanosensation and neuronal morphology defects in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants” and in Figure 9A, Figure 9—figure supplement 1A and B. Also, all experiments were repeated in the presence of TPP. These data are included in the aforementioned subsection and figure supplements and in Figure 9B and C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors insist that Abeta peptide production is not necessary for neurodegeneration. However, existence of amyloid plaque accumulation is a well-known pathological hallmark of AD and using only C. elegans devoid of amyloid plaque accumulation as an AD model is hence not sufficient for such a bold conclusion. The authors should measure neurodegeneration and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in a neuronal/muscle Abeta expressing worm line. In case these worms have Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels perturbations, they should try to rescue neurodegeneration by normalizing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Moreover, they should clearly state that their conclusions are a) limited to this model system, and b) show that mutations in PSEN are enough to cause neurodegeneration in C. elegans, but one can't exclude the additional contributions of Abeta in humans.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have expressed human Abeta1-42 pan-neuronally and examined light touch response, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and mitochondria and axon morphology. From these analyses, we found that touch response in animals overexpressing Abeta showed a similar defect as observed in <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants. However, unlike <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and mitochondrial morphology are normal. Moreover, axon morphology was normal in Abeta overexpressing animals. These data are presented in the subsection “Expression of human Abeta1-42 peptide results in loss of mechano-perception in a mechanism disparate from loss of SEL-12” and in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A recent paper studying MEFs from PSEN KO mice (Contino et al., 2017), shows results that seems to contradict the result presented in this manuscript, with mitochondria showing decreased OXPHOS, respiration and ATP production in MEFs KO cells. How could the authors reconcile their proposed mechanism with this work?</p></disp-quote><p>While the data from Contino et al. appears to contradict our data to a certain degree, there are some significant differences. 1) Their data is collected from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 2) their culture conditions are in low glucose and it is unclear what the glucose (or pyruvate or glutamine) concentration was used for their OCR recordings, and 3) they find that presenilin 2 has a role in mitochondrial function unlike our studies in skin fibroblasts isolated from FAD patient who have mutations in the gene encoding presenilin 1. Moreover, a recent study published in the Stem Cell Reports by Oksanen et al., (Stem Cell Reports 2017) examining PSEN1 iPSCs generated from patients with a mutation in presenilin 1 show elevated OCR and high ROS levels, similar to what we observe in FAD skin fibroblasts and <italic>C. elegans sel-12</italic> mutants. Additionally, these authors found that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated correction of the PSEN1 mutation in these iPSCs could reduce the OCR and ROS levels, thereby, implicating PSEN1 in mitochondrial function. We have discussed these points in the subsection “Skin fibroblasts isolated from FAD patients have increased ATP, OCR and ROS levels” and Discussion, third paragraph.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have performed a number of additional experiments.

This has been corrected in the subsection “Doxycycline and Ru360 Treatment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the authors have performed the Abeta expression experiments in the worms, the description and experiments fully proving the presence and effect of Abeta are still superficial.

The authors need to bring these papers into their Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We address each point below:</p><p>1) The Abeta strain used for this study is available from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and has been characterized by multiple labs and several publications utilizing this reagent exist in the literature (e.g. Wu et al., 2006; Dosanjh et al., 2010; Van Assche et al., 2015 doi: 10.1007/s11306-014-0711-5; Zhang et al., 2016 doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2016.09.031; Jan et al., 2017 doi: 10.1007/s00401-016-1634-1; Ahmad and Ebert, 2018 doi: 10.1016/j.exger.2018.04.021; VazBravo et al., 2018 doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-21918-5). The strain is listed in the “Animal maintenance and strains” subsection (CL2355). It was raised at 20°C for analysis as described in the animal maintenance and strain section. The phenotype analyses were carried out as described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>2) While presence and expression has been shown previously (Wu et al., 2006; Dosanjh et al., 2010), we have conducted western analysis to authenticate that this reagent expresses and we can detect the presence of Abeta under the conditions we used for our analyses. This data is included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and in the subsection “Expression of human Abeta1-42 peptide results in loss of mechano-perception in a mechanism disparate from loss of SEL-12”. Methods have been added subsection “Abeta western analysis”.</p><p>3) This is one of the exciting points of our manuscript. While the Abeta hypothesis is a large driving force in AD research, there are many studies that suggest Abeta may be a secondary insult in AD pathogenesis (e.g. Herrup 2015 doi: 10.1038/nn.4017). In our study, we demonstrate that mutations in presenilin result in defects in ER-mitochondrial calcium handling that leads to elevated OXPHOS and ROS generation. This causes neurodegenerative phenotypes. While it is clear from others and in our own work that ectopic overexpression of Abeta is toxic and can lead to defects in cellular function, survival, and mitochondrial activity, the mechanism appears distinct from presenilin mutations. This important finding suggests that the initial insult in FAD, since <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not produce Abeta peptides, is elevated ROS production from the mitochondria due to an increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer. Thus, Abeta accumulation may be merely secondary, albeit critical to the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>Importantly, our study focuses mainly on the loss or reduction of function mutations in <italic>sel-12</italic> and not the ectopic overexpression of an exogenous protein, which is well known to be prone to aggregation and toxic. Moreover, our study of <italic>sel-12</italic> mutants shows neuronal defects in the absence of Abeta peptides, which provides evidence that PSEN dysfunction is likely an initial cause of neurodegeneration and Abeta peptide aggregation may be a secondary insult.</p><p>We have discussed our results in relation to the studies by Fong et al., 2016 and Sorrentino et al., 2017 at the end of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
