They form the BCR complex together with the associated Igα and Igβ heterodimer to transmit signals for B cell development, proliferation, survival, and activation. Each B cell expresses a BCR with a given specificity, which is acquired by a progressive rearrangement of the <italic>variable</italic> (V), <italic>joining</italic> (J) and, in case of the HC, <italic>diversity</italic> (D) gene segments of the BCR <italic>HC</italic> and <italic>LC</italic> loci in the bone marrow (BM) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>). The key enzymes that facilitate V(D)J recombination are recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oettinger et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schatz et al., 1989</xref>). V(D)J recombination is initiated at the pro-B cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rolink et al., 1999</xref>). An in-frame rearrangement at the <italic>HC</italic> genes leads to the expression of a µHC that is binding to the λ5 and VpreB components of the surrogate light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karasuyama et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reth et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tsubata and Reth, 1990</xref>). Together with the Igα/β signaling subunits, these chains form the pre-BCR complex, which is first expressed on large pre-B cells. Signals from the pre-BCR and the interleukin (IL)–7 receptor (IL-7R) induce a proliferative burst that is followed by cell cycle attenuation, promoting <italic>LC V</italic>- to <italic>J</italic>-gene segment rearrangement in the small pre-B cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flemming et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mandal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ochiai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reth et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reth and Nielsen, 2014</xref>). A productive rearrangement leads to the pairing of the pre-existing HC with the newly generated LC, forming the IgM-BCR expressed first on the immature B cells in the BM (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matthias and Rolink, 2005</xref>).</p><p><italic>LC</italic> locus opening and recombination during B cell development and receptor editing (a process changing the specificity of the BCR by secondary <italic>LC VJ</italic>-gene rearrangements) is dependent on transcription factors including Ikaros, Aiolos, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)–4, IRF-8 and E2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inlay et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lazorchak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mandal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pathak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic mouse models individually lacking some of these transcription factors show impaired <italic>LC</italic> locus opening, affecting λLC expression more severely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pathak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Quong et al., 2004</xref>). The activity of these transcription factors is directly or indirectly regulated by pre-BCR and BCR signaling. Mice lacking a signaling competent pre-BCR or BCR, or lacking signaling molecules downstream of the pre-BCR or BCR including the adapter protein SLP65, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), are characterized by an altered LC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dingjan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, mice deficient in SLP65 show reduced <italic>LC</italic> germline transcripts especially from the <italic>Igl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, the absence of BTK, a kinase that is recruited by SLP65, severely reduces <italic>Igl</italic> germline transcripts and LC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dingjan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>). The concurrent ablation of both SLP65 and BTK abrogates <italic>Igk</italic> and <italic>Igl</italic> germline transcription and BCR surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>). PLCγ2 is recruited to SLP65, regulating the calcium signaling downstream of the pre-BCR and BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). PLCγ2-knockout (KO) mice show a strong reduction of λLC B cells and a mild reduction of <italic>Igk</italic> germline transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). The combined deficiency of BTK and PLCγ2 almost completely abrogated LC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Pre-BCR signaling is important for the induction of <italic>LC VJ</italic>-gene rearrangement at both <italic>LC</italic> loci (<italic>Igk</italic> and <italic>Igl</italic>). However, the ratio between the usage of the two LCs diverges greatly among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sun et al., 2013</xref>) and the regulation of their differential expression is still not fully understood. The primary B cell repertoire in mice is dominated by the κLC that is roughly ten to 20 times more frequent than the λLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGuire and Vitetta, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). It is generally accepted that λLC B cell generation is favored when rearrangement at the <italic>Igk</italic> locus is unsuccessful, or when the immature κLC-containing BCR confers autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luning Prak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nemazee, 2006</xref>). In the latter case, the BCR specificity is modified by receptor editing. The ratio of κ/λ LC is further impacted by the survival of developing B cells. Extending the life-span of B cell precursors by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), promotes the generation of λLC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Azzouzene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dingjan et al., 2001</xref>). In line with this, limiting B cell survival by genetically abrogating the NF-κB signaling pathway, results in mice with a reduced amount of λLC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>). Based on these observations, the generation of λLC B cells mainly depends on (i) the ability and kinetics of the <italic>LC</italic> locus opening, (ii) the life-span of developing B cells, and (iii) the efficiency of receptor editing during tolerance induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the differential regulation of the κ- <italic>versus</italic> λLC expression. We have identified the transmembrane protein Kidins220 as a new binding partner of the BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>).

Conditional mb1Cre-mediated B cell specific Kidins220 KO mice (B-KO) showed reduced BCR signaling, and almost complete loss of λLC B cells in the BM and periphery, with only mild effects on the κLC compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>). Our new findings presented here indicate that Kidins220 is crucial for the generation of λLC B cells by supporting B cell progenitor survival and pre-BCR and BCR signaling, which allows for <italic>Igl</italic> locus opening, recombination, and protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kidins220 B-KO mice show a skewed primary BCR repertoire</title><p>Despite almost normal B cell numbers, B-cell-specific Kidins220 KO (B-KO) mice show an approximately 75% reduction of B cells carrying a λLC-containing IgM-BCR on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>).

In contrast, in B-KO B cells, the µHC was almost exclusively co-expressed with the κLC (98%) and only 2% of all cells contained a λLC.

We obtained very strong correlations for <italic>Igh-V</italic>- and <italic>J</italic>-gene usage (<italic>r</italic>=0.97 and 0.98, respectively), suggesting that Kidins220 does not influence which V(D)J-gene is used for the µHC of the BCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The murine <italic>Igk</italic> locus consists of at least 101 functional <italic>Igk-V</italic>-genes as well as four functional <italic>Igk-J</italic>-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki-Ota et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Likewise, we observed a good correlation of the <italic>Igk-V</italic>- and <italic>J</italic>-gene usage (<italic>r</italic>=0.96 and <italic>r</italic>=1, respectively) between CTRL and Kidins220-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), confirming a rather intact κLC repertoire. Still, B-KO B cells showed a slightly increased use of <italic>Igkj5</italic> (14.2%) when compared to CTRL (10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Use of <italic>Igkj5</italic> correlates with increased secondary <italic>Igk-V</italic>- to <italic>J</italic>-gene rearrangements. It frequently occurs before deletion of part of the <italic>Igk</italic> locus via a recombining sequence recombination and opening of the <italic>Igl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Retter and Nemazee, 1998</xref>). The murine <italic>Igl</italic> locus comprises one cassette including <italic>Iglv2</italic> and <italic>Iglv3</italic> upstream of <italic>Iglj2-c2</italic> (λ2), and a second cassette containing <italic>Iglv1</italic> upstream of <italic>Iglj3-c3</italic> (λ3) and <italic>Iglj1-c1</italic> (λ1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerdes and Wabl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sanchez et al., 1996</xref>). In mature wild type B cells, the different λLCs are used at a frequency of 62%, 31% and 7% for λ1, λ2 and λ3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boudinot et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sanchez et al., 1996</xref>). This pattern was confirmed by our sequencing results for immature B cells in CTRL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The <italic>Igl-V</italic>-gene usage showed a preference for <italic>Iglv1</italic> over <italic>Iglv3</italic> or <italic>Iglv2</italic>, independent of the presence of Kidins220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, Kidins220-deficient B cells showed a relative increase of <italic>Iglv1</italic>-gene usage (88% <italic>vs</italic> 59% in CTRL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Both CTRL and B-KO immature B cells preferentially used the <italic>Iglj1</italic>-gene segment (44% and 69%, respectively). However, B-KO B cells used <italic>Iglj3</italic> more frequently than <italic>Iglj2</italic>. These observations suggest that in the absence of Kidins220, the genes of the second λLC cassette are favored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Indeed, the Pearson correlation coefficient for the <italic>Igl-J</italic>-gene segments was weak in B-KO cells (<italic>r</italic>=0.51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the <italic>Igl</italic> locus, <italic>VJ</italic>-gene recombination preferentially takes place within the same cassette and is almost absent between cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reilly et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sanchez et al., 1991</xref>). In line with this, we almost exclusively detected recombination of <italic>Iglv1</italic> to either <italic>Iglj3</italic> or <italic>Iglj1</italic>, whereas <italic>Iglv2</italic> and <italic>Iglv3</italic> recombined to <italic>Iglj2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Both CTRL and Kidins220-deficient λLC B cells showed a prominence of <italic>Iglv1- Iglj1</italic> joins. We next compared the HC, κLC and λLC repertoires of CTRL and B-KO immature B cells by analyzing the frequency of unique CDR3s in all chains. Both genotypes showed a clear polyclonal distribution for the κLC, but polyclonality was slightly reduced for the HC and strongly restricted for the λLC in the B-KO immature B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The analysis of paired HC-LC combinations highlighted that indeed the repertoire of those BCR bearing a λLC was strongly restricted in the B-KO immature B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We did not observe any predispositions for potentially autoreactive BCRs as characterized by longer or more positively charged CDR3s within their variable domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>We further analyzed the architecture of the BCR repertoire by applying similarity networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miho et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, we created networks in which unique CDR3 sequences (nodes) are represented as individual dots. These nodes are connected via similarity edges only if their sequence differs by one amino acid (Levenshtein distance = 1). Thus, similar CDR3 sequences appear clustered indicating clonal expansion and are highlighted by arrowheads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Unexpectedly, the primary B cell repertoire of B-KO mice showed signs of specific clonal expansion, especially of one single clone containing the <italic>Ighv10-1</italic>-gene segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The usage of this <italic>Igh-V</italic>-gene segment has been previously associated with anti-DNA antibodies and herpesvirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maranhão et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zelazowska et al., 2020</xref>). Lastly, we determined the ratio between productive and unproductive rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Unproductive sequences are defined as out-of-frame sequences, sequences containing premature stop codons, orphon genes or non-<italic>Ig</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smakaj et al., 2020</xref>). They encompass a significant high proportion of the raw outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smakaj et al., 2020</xref>) and are usually removed during a preprocessing step prior to data analysis (as done for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both, CTRL and B-KO, showed similar frequencies of sequences defined as unproductive rearrangements (92% and 93%, respectively) from the <italic>Igh</italic> locus. In contrast, the frequency of sequences defined as unproductive rearrangements from the <italic>Igl</italic> and <italic>Igk</italic> loci was increased in B-KO compared to CTRL cells: 1.2 times for <italic>Igk</italic>, and 2 times for the <italic>Igl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Deeper investigations revealed that these unproductive rearrangements within the <italic>Igl</italic> locus were caused by a series of premature stop-codons. Taken together, genetic ablation of Kidins220 in B cells skews the primary BCR repertoire mainly due to unsuccessful production of λLCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Kidins220 is essential for the opening of the <italic>Igl</italic> locus</title><p>Kidins220-deficient B cells failed to express λLC.

The total pro-/pre-B cell numbers remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Remarkably, the reduction in IgM<sup>+</sup> cells in κ-KO mice was stronger in B-KO mice, representing only 15% of the B220<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> population of the CTRL κ-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).

Although the total number of splenocytes did not significantly change between κ-sufficient and -deficient backgrounds in CTRL mice, κ-KO mice showed an overall reduction of the B220<sup>+</sup> and B220<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell percentages and numbers in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>), concomitant with a relative increase in T cells (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Takeda et al., 1993</xref>). This reduction in B220<sup>+</sup> B cells was strongly amplified by Kidins220-deficiency (60–80% reduction of B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in B-KO κ-KO compared to CTRL κ-KO mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Most of the transitional B cells further mature into follicular (FO) B cells, whereas a smaller fraction develops into marginal zone (MZ) B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pillai and Cariappa, 2009</xref>). We previously reported that in the absence of Kidins220, maturation towards the MZ compartment is favored resulting in around 18% of all mature splenic B cells with a MZ B cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N, O</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>). κ-KO mice additionally lacking Kidins220 showed an even stronger reduction in the FO compartment, skewing the differentiation toward the MZ compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N and O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>). As expected, all splenic B cells exclusively express λLC BCRs in κ-KO mice, independent of Kidins220 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L, M</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P,Q</xref>). In the presence of Kidins220, the development and maturation of λLC<sup>+</sup> B cells compensates the B cell numbers reaching about 50% of the κLC-sufficient situation in most populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–N</xref>). However, in the absence of Kidins220, λLC-expressing B cell numbers are significantly reduced failing compensation to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>).

To explore whether Kidins220-deficiency compromises the generation of λLC B cells by affecting B cell survival, we determined the amount of early apoptotic and dead cells throughout B cell development in the BM of CTRL and B-KO mice. The amount of early apoptotic (Annexin V<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>-</sup>) and dead (Annexin V<sup>+</sup>PI<sup>+</sup>) cells were tendentially increased in the absence of Kidins220 during B cell development that became statistically significant for λLC<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is in line with our previous report showing that <italic>ex-vivo</italic> cultured pro-/pre-B cells from B-KO mice have a decreased survival upon IL-7 withdrawal compared to CTRLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>). Since developing B cells in the BM depend on functional IL-7R signaling for survival prior to pre-BCR expression, we investigated IL-7R expression in CTRL and B-KO mice. As expected, IL-7R expression was higher in pro-B cells and decreased subsequently throughout B cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). No differences were detected between CTRL and B-KO mice. Still, absence of Kidins220 resulted in enhanced IL-7R signaling via the PI3K pathway as shown by increased phosphorylation of AKT on S473 and of its target FOXO1 on S256 in both pro- and pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we aimed to rescue the survival defect in B-KO B cells upon IL-7 withdrawal by retrovirally transducing primary BM-derived pro-/pre-B cell cultures from CTRL and B-KO mice with a BCL2-IRES-GFP overexpression or Mock plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, BCL2 overexpression rescued B cell survival from CTRL and B-KO mice to a comparable level over 9 days following IL-7 withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of <italic>BCL2</italic>-transduced pro-/pre-B cell cultures revealed that IL-7 withdrawal induced κLC and λLC surface expression in both CTRL and B-KO B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, even though <italic>BCL2</italic>-transduced B-KO B cells showed a pronounced increase of λLC<sup>+</sup> B cells, it was still significantly reduced compared to CTRL cells. This reduction was compensated by a slightly enlarged κLC<sup>+</sup> B cell proportion in B-KO B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>BCL2</italic>-transduced CTRL and B-KO B cells revealed a similar induction and kinetics of <italic>Igk</italic> germline transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, Kidins220-deficiency dampened the abundance of <italic>Igl</italic> germline transcripts compared to CTRLs, even though the relative abundance of <italic>Igl</italic> germline transcripts seemed to be partially rescued after 9 days of IL-7 withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, the abundance of <italic>Tcf3 (E47</italic>) and <italic>Rag2</italic> mRNA transcripts was significantly reduced in B-KO cultures compared to CTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These findings strongly indicate that Kidins220 plays a pivotal role in regulating factors within the recombination machinery, consequently influencing LC recombination. Notably, this effect becomes apparent when the survival defect dependent on Kidins220 is rectified through BCL2 overexpression. Together, these data confirm a role for Kidins220 in the survival of B cell precursors. However, the function of Kidins220 seems to be beyond just facilitating B cell survival, since BCL2 overexpression did not fully rescue λLC expression in Kidins220-deficient primary B cell cultures.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>BCL2-mediated survival partially rescues λLC deficiency <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup to generate primary BM-derived pro-/pre-B cell cultures overexpressing BCL2.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from CTRL and B-KO mice expressing the leukocyte marker CD45.2 were injected into sublethally irradiated CD45.1<sup>+</sup> wild type (WT) or CD45.1<sup>+</sup> κ-macroself mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The HSC of CTRL and B-KO mice gave rise to similar percentages of B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in the BM of both CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT and κ-macroself transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with a slight increase in total B cell numbers in κ-macroself mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). κLC<sup>+</sup> B cells were rarely detected in κ-macroself mice reconstituted with either CTRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Azzouzene et al., 2005</xref>) or Kidins220-deficient HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, recognition of strong self-antigen signals and successful elimination of autoreactive BCRs from the cell surface does not require Kidins220. Transfer of B-KO HSC to non-transgenic WT mice still showed the reduction in λLC-expressing B cells in the BM compared to transfer of CTRL-HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings strengthen once more that the diminished production of λLC cells in the absence of Kidins220 is B-cell intrinsic. As expected, negative selection of κLC<sup>+</sup> B cells was accompanied by a significant increase in λLC usage when CTRL HSC were transferred into κ-macroself mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Azzouzene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Consequently, in B-KO mice, there is a deficiency of B cells capable of responding to foreign epitopes recognized by BCRs carrying the λLC, resulting in what has been described as ‘holes in the BCR repertoire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodnow, 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ectopic BCL2 fails to rescue λLC expression during <italic>in vivo</italic> receptor editing</title><p>We next asked whether increased survival might rescue λLC expression during receptor editing. To this end, we modified our BM-transfer protocol by transducing the isolated HSC of CTRL and B-KO mice 24 hr post-isolation with a BCL2-IRES-GFP overexpression plasmid. Following another 24 hr of HSC culture in optimized medium, the cells were injected into sublethally irradiated CD45.1 WT or κ-macroself mice for BM reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). For the analysis, all cells were pre-gated on the GFP<sup>+</sup> population (BCL2-expressing cells) prior to gating for the individual B cell subpopulations. BCL2-overexpressing HSC from CTRL and B-KO mice reconstituted the BM of CD45.1 WT and κ-macroself transgenic mice equally well, since we obtained similar B cell frequencies and total cell numbers in all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, Kidins220 is needed to rearrange the genes of the <italic>Igl</italic> locus and thus fulfil the repertoire with innocuous BCRs.

Further, mice deficient for pre-BCR downstream signaling components, such as BTK, SPL65, or PLCγ2, show an impaired upregulation of surface markers like CD25, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II concomitant with defective downregulation of CD43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kersseboom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Middendorp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the surface expression of these markers on BM B cells from CTRL and B-KO mice. Indeed, developing B cells of B-KO mice showed a reduced percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells with lower levels of CD25 on the B cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, B-KO mice pre-B cells failed to efficiently upregulate MHCII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), whereas the relative amount of CD43-expressing B cells was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In all, these data indicate reduced pre-BCR signaling. For deeper investigation, we analyzed the basal phosphorylation state of several prominent BCR signaling molecules throughout B cell development. Our data revealed an unaltered phosphorylation pattern of the proximal (pre<bold>-</bold>) BCR signaling molecules SYK and SLP65 in B-KO cells compared to CTRL B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). No major differences were found for the phosphorylation of p65 and IκB which are components of the NF-κB signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of phospho-ERK positive pre- and immature B cells in Kidin220-deficient mice was significantly reduced when compared to CTRLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Next, we analyzed the basal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CTRL and B-KO mice. ROS serve as important second messengers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tsubata, 2020</xref>). To this end, we isolated primary BM cells and splenocytes from B-KO and CTRL mice and labeled them with the fluorogenic dye DCFDA, in combination with a surface marker to analyze cellular ROS production within the different stages of B cell development. B cells from B-KO mice showed a significantly reduced level of ROS during almost all BM developmental stages except for large pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). We confirmed a significant drop of ROS from the large to small pre-B cells, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stein et al., 2017</xref>). This drop was much more pronounced in Kidins220-deficient developing B cells. ROS were maintained at very low levels throughout B cell development in the BM of Kidins220-deficient mice. Splenic naïve B cells of Kidins220-sufficient and -deficient mice showed similar low ROS levels. One of the main production sites of intracellular ROS are the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, previous reports pointed toward a connection between Kidins220 and mitochondrial function in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaudon et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, we examined the mitochondrial mass and activity in developing B cells using MitoTracker Red. However, we did not detect differences between CTRL and B-KO mice, suggesting a rather normal mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results might indicate that Kidins220-deficient B cells produce less ROS due to impaired pre-BCR and BCR-mediated signaling. Reduced pre-BCR and BCR signaling might in turn prevent the opening and recombination of the <italic>Igλ</italic> locus in developing B cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Rewired pre-BCR signaling in the absence of Kidins220.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative flow cytometry plots of the BM of CTRL and B-KO mice showing the surface expression of CD25, MHCII and CD43 (left).

The distance of the λ<sub>2-4</sub> enhancer to the λ<sub>1-3</sub> enhancer might preclude that <italic>Igl</italic> gene recombination 5’ of the λ<sub>2-4</sub> enhancer profit from transcription factors and co-factors of the recombination machinery bound to the λ<sub>1-3</sub> enhancer. The rearrangement of the <italic>Iglv1</italic> to <italic>Iglj1c1</italic>-gene segment eliminates the intervening sequence comprising the <italic>Iglj3c3</italic>-gene segment, resulting in the accumulation of λ1 LC B cells. Interestingly, we observed a relative increase in the usage of the genes of the λ3-family compared to the λ2-family in B-KO <italic>versus</italic> CTRL mice. This observation suggests that the recombination of the <italic>Igl-V</italic>-gene segments that are 5’ of the λ<sub>2-4</sub> enhancer is more depended on Kidins220 expression than the others. A possible explanation for this observation is that pre-BCR and BCR signaling are reduced in the absence of Kidins220 making the recombination of λ2-family <italic>V-</italic>genes unlikely. Instead, <italic>Iglv1</italic> is recombined to <italic>Iglj3c3</italic> more often in Kidins220-deficient mice. Together, our single-cell sequencing analysis supports that Kidins220 is dispensable for <italic>Igk</italic>, but essential for efficient <italic>Igl</italic> locus opening and gene recombination.</p><p>Reduced production of λLC B cells has been previously described in studies using mouse models with genetic deletion of signaling molecules downstream of the pre-BCR and BCR like BTK, SLP65, and PLCγ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dingjan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Middendorp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the combined deletion of some of these signaling components almost completely abolishes both <italic>Igl</italic> and <italic>Igk</italic> germline transcription, <italic>LC V</italic>-gene recombination, and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). These data led to the interpretation that the generation of λLC B cells is more sensitive to defects in the signals transmitted by the pre-BCR and/or BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>). Kidins220-deficiency has been previously described to dampen signaling by receptors in neurons, glial cells, adipocytes, T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arévalo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deswal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaudon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jaudon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López-Menéndez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, BCR stimulation in a Kidins220 knockdown mature B cell line resulted in dampened activation of the RAS-ERK pathway due to an inefficient coupling of the BCR to the downstream Raf kinases B-Raf and Raf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, IgM-BCR-mediated stimulation of primary splenocytes from B-KO mice resulted in less phosphorylation of ERK and PLCγ2, as well as reduced calcium influx compared to CTRL cells; further highlighting the role of Kidins220 in BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>). Our data herein suggest that pre-BCR signaling is also reduced in the absence of Kidins220. Firstly, B-KO mice showed a reduction of the amount of MHCII<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup> cells as well as reduced CD25 surface expression on B cells in the BM. CD25 is upregulated upon pre-BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rolink et al., 1994</xref>), and its expression level is reduced in mice with genetic ablations of BTK, SLP65, or PLCγ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kersseboom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kersseboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Middendorp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stadhouders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Secondly, phosphorylation of the downstream MAPK family member ERK was reduced in pre- and immature B cell stages. Interestingly, in both of these stages active signaling takes place either ligand independent (pre-BCR) or ligand dependent (autoreactive BCR), respectively. It has been already described that (pre-) BCR signaling controls <italic>Rag</italic> expression via the MAPK/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mandal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mazari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shaw et al., 1999</xref>). In the absence of Kidins220, the coupling of (pre-) BCR with the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is defective resulting in insufficient upregulation of proteins needed for LC rearrangement (RAG, E47). It has been previously shown that interference with RAS-MEK signaling leads to upregulation of the negative regulator of E47, namely ID3, and a downregulation of <italic>Tcf3 (E47</italic>) transcripts and protein levels thus prohibiting its transcriptional function for LC rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mandal et al., 2009</xref>). A similar scenario is conceivable in the context of Kidins220-deficiency. It is worth noting that rearrangement at the <italic>Igl</italic> locus demands higher levels of E2A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2009</xref>). This further reinforces the notion that in the absence of Kidins220, the levels of RAG and E2A proteins are insufficient for rearranging the <italic>Igl</italic> locus while the <italic>Igk</italic> is rearranged normally. Thirdly, Kidins220-deficient B cells showed reduced ROS levels during BM development, especially in those stages where pre-BCR (small pre-B cells) and IgM-BCR signaling (immature B cells) is crucial. ROS are important second messengers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tsubata, 2020</xref>). In mature B cells, BCR activation induces ROS production to fully activate NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wheeler and Defranco, 2012</xref>). Considering the parallels between BCR and pre-BCR signaling, ROS might exert a similar role downstream of the pre-BCR. Indeed, previous reports have demonstrated that λLC B cell development but not κLC editing depends on NF-κB signals in line with our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, ROS and MAPK/ERK pathways are manifold interconnected (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corcoran and Cotter, 2013</xref>). ROS directly leads to the oxidization of certain amino acids in ERK leading to its activation and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galli et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, ROS are well-recognized as inactivators of phosphatases of the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kamata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Son et al., 2011</xref>) but also of phosphatases regulating BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singh et al., 2005</xref>) in non-hematopoietic cells. Thus, reduced generation of ROS in the absence of Kidins220 might lead to a higher activity of ERK-directed phosphatases, which eventually leads to the observed reduced phosphorylation of ERK in B-KO mice. Taken together, our findings support a mechanistic model in which Kidins220 mediates its effects by enhancing pre-BCR and BCR signaling. Still, we cannot formally rule out that Kidins220 might possess direct, signaling-dependent or -independent effects on the <italic>Igl</italic> locus opening.</p><p>Our data suggest that Kidins220 contributes to pre-B cell survival, which is necessary for <italic>LC</italic> gene recombination. In fact, a prolonged life-span in pre-B cells, induced by overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL2, increases the amount of λLC<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Azzouzene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dingjan et al., 2001</xref>). BCL2 overexpression rescues the generation of λLC B cells in scenarios in which NF-κB signaling was abolished during B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>). A connection between (pre-) BCR signaling and survival is well recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kraus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meffre and Nussenzweig, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yasuda et al., 2008</xref>). However, there is limited data on the exact mechanism. In particular, pre-BCR signaling might lead to the activation of the NF-κB pathway, that in turn regulates the transcription of <italic>Pim2</italic>, a pro-survival protein in pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bednarski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derudder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siebenlist et al., 2005</xref>). Pre-BCR-mediated ERK activation might induce phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM and thereby interfere with its inhibitory interaction with BCL2, resulting in enhanced pre-B cell survival similar to reports on IgM-BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Reilly et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, pre-BCR-mediated ERK signaling might induce <italic>Bcl2</italic> transcription itself, thereby prolonging B cell survival during B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yasuda et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the afore-discussed defects in coupling pre-BCR and/or BCR signaling to ERK activation in Kidins220-deficient B cells could lead to BCL2 levels that are insufficient to protect developing B cells from cell death. Indeed, <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultured B cell precursor from B-KO mice die faster upon IL-7 withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiala et al., 2015</xref>), and we also detected increased amounts of apoptotic cells during BM B cell development in these mice. However, overexpression of BCL2 did not fully rescue λLC-deficiency in B-KO mice, suggesting that prolong survival of B cell precursors is required, but not sufficient, to optimally generate λLC B cells in the absence of Kidins220 expression.</p><p>The κLC to λLC ratio is also affected by receptor editing. Receptor editing can lead to further recombination on either the same <italic>Igk</italic> allele, the second <italic>Igk</italic> allele or can proceed to the <italic>Igl</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luning Prak et al., 2011</xref>). The κ and λLCs differ in the physicochemical and structural properties of their CDR3 regions, and λLCs are proposed to be more effective in rescuing BCRs that show autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Townsend et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wardemann et al., 2004</xref>). In line with previous studies, we show here that genetically forcing receptor editing using κ-deleting (κ-macroself) mice increased the production of B cells using the λLC in Kidins220 competent mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Azzouzene et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of Kidins220, strong autoreactive ligands efficiently induce the downregulation of surface κLC-BCRs indicating successful tolerance induction. However, the replacement of the autoreactive κLC by an innocuous λLC was severely impaired in the absence of Kidins220. These data underline the importance of Kidins220 for <italic>Igl</italic> gene recombination, even under the high selective pressure imposed by the κ-macroself mice. Indeed, overexpression of BCL2 did not profoundly enhance λLC expression by B-KO cells in the κ-macroself recipients, highlighting again that increasing survival is not sufficient to optimally obtain λLC B cells in the absence of Kidins220 expression. The data obtained in the κ-macroself mice are in line with our single-cell repertoire analysis showing that we did not find any signs of potentially autoreactive BCRs in B-KO mice. Since Kidins220-deficient B cells do not open the <italic>Igl</italic> locus efficiently, secondary rearrangement at the <italic>Igk</italic> locus should be increased. Indeed, we observed a slight increase in the <italic>Igkj5</italic>-gene usage in B-KO mice compared to CTRLs. <italic>Igkj5</italic> is associated with several rounds of secondary rearrangement and often represents the last rearrangement before silencing of the <italic>Igk</italic> locus by recombining sequence recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Retter and Nemazee, 1998</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, our study demonstrates that Kidins220 supports pre-B cell survival and promotes pre-BCR and BCR signaling via ROS and ERK to allow <italic>Igl</italic> locus opening and λLC expression during both homeostatic B cell development and receptor editing. The heightened sensitivity of the <italic>Igl</italic> locus, compared to the <italic>Igk</italic> locus, to reductions in expression and activity of recombination machinery proteins regulated by pre-BCR and BCR signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Novak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pathak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vela et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Verkoczy et al., 2005</xref>), explains why the absence of Kidins220 specifically impacts <italic>Igl</italic> gene rearrangement. This study adds thus to our understanding of the underlying mechanism regulating the differential expression of the κ and λLCs in B cells and the generation of a self-tolerant repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and mice</title><p>Primary murine BM or pro-/pre-B cells were cultured in Opti-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol in a humidified saturated atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Erythrocytes were removed as described before (see section: Flow cytometry). For ROS staining, 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells were incubated in Opti-MEM with H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA (10 µM; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Mitochondria were stained by incubating 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells in 500 µl Opti-MEM supplemented with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (60 nM; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Afterwards, cells were washed twice and stained for surface markers for flow cytometry (see section: Flow cytometry). For quantification, the fluorescence intensity of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA was normalized to the cell volume by FSC-W as an indicator of cell diameter as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tzur et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Flow cytometric data were analyzed using FlowJo V10 (Tree Star, Inc) software.

Single B cell antibody V(D)J libraries were prepared with the 10 X Genomics Chromium Single Cell V(D)J platform version 1, allowing immune profiling of full-length antibody variable HC and LC (10XGenomics). Briefly, samples were loaded onto the Chromium Controller and partitioned into Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) containing single cells. The mRNA was reverse transcribed into barcoded cDNA. HC and LC full V(D)J variable sequences were amplified with a two-step PCR. Sequences were then fragmented and indexed with indices for Illumina sequencing. Quality control of the materials were obtained throughout the process and library concentration quantification was performed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Antibody library pools were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument at 2x300 bp paired-end reads using the MiSeq Reagent kit v3 (600 Cycles).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Annotation, preprocessing and statistical analysis of antibody repertoires</title><p>Antibody repertoire data generated through the 10 X Genomics V(D)J platform was demultiplexed using Cellranger mkfastq and subsequently annotated with IgBLAST version 1.14 and Cellranger version 4.0. Preprocessing included filtering for retaining CDR3s longer than amino acids, selection of productive sequences and retaining only CDR3s occurring more than once in the repertoire, with productive sequences defined as sequences that are in-frame and contain no stop codons. Statistical analysis of antibody repertoire datasets was conducted using R 4.0.5. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of the linear association between the <italic>V</italic>- and <italic>J</italic>-germline gene frequencies between CTRL and B-KO mice for HC and LC. The correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Material availability statement</title><p>All material used in the present study are available from the corresponding author upon justified request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>owns shares in aiNET GmbH</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal protocols (G12/64) were performed according to German animal protection laws with permission from the responsible local authorities.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83943-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank K Fehrenbach for technical assistance, the group of M Erlacher, M Reth and F Cesca for providing mice and J Jellusova for technical advice with ROS staining.

We thank them for all suggestions to improve our current manuscript. We acknowledge the patience of the reviewers and editorial team, it has taken quite some time to finalize this revision due to unforeseen issues with the animal colony. We have aimed in the revised version to provide deeper mechanistic insights to extend our current knowledge of the differential regulation of light chain expression in B cells. Briefly,</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We have improved the graphical representation of our data as well as the clarity of some statements as requested.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We have performed experiments to provide deeper mechanistic insights into the role of Kidins220 in pre-BCR signalling (new Figures 2D, 4E, 8A and Figure 2— figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1).</p></list-item><list-item><p>We have also included new reconstitution experiments further supporting the link between reduced pre-BCR signalling in the absence of Kidins220 and generation of λLC-bearing B cells (Figure 9).</p></list-item></list><p>Reviewer comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This is a very well performed study on the role of a transmembrane protein called Kidins220 in B cells. This protein has previously been shown by the authors to be a binding partner of the BCR. In B-cell specific KO mice (B-KO) they had previously found an almost complete lack of immunoglobulins with λ light chains. In this manuscript the authors determine the mechanism of this defect in much detail. They show a failure to recombine the genes of the λ LC locus. Kidins220 enhances the survival of pre-B cells and extends the time of the opening of the λ LC locus, to allow rearrangement. Interestingly, extending the survival of pre-B cells of B-KO mice by BCl-2 overexpression does not rescue this λ light chain defect. With an autoreactive transgenic model the authors further demonstrate that Kidins220 is not essential for tolerance induction, but even in this model where receptor editing is enforced, for a complete λ LC rearrangement. Overall the data are very convincing.</p><p>I have only minor comments for changes in the presentation and arrangement of the data, which are nevertheless necessary for better clarity of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I do not understand the presentation of data in Figure 1G. The description in the legend is too little. As I am not familiar with this method of showing an antibody repertoire, I do not understand it. I guess this will be similar for other readers as well. Please explain the method better that the figure can be understood.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. We are happy to improve the comprehensibility of this paragraph by better explaining how the analysis of the antibody repertoire was performed (former Figure 1G, now Figure 1I). We followed the method developed in <italic>Miho et al., 2019</italic>. Briefly, we have created a network in which each CDR3 clone (represented by a node) is connected to another CDR3 clone via a similarity edge if and only if, their sequence differs by one amino acid (Levenshtein distance = 1). In other words, nodes that differ by only one amino acid in their CDR3 sequence are linked by edges and appear clustered. Clustered clones are indicative of antigen-dependent clonal expansion and selection. Clones which sequences differ in more than one amino acid, are not connected in our representation.</p><p>Clusters indicating clonal expansion were seen more often in the B-KO repertoire than on the CTRL repertoire. We have now indicated the clustered clones with arrow-heads to improve clarity. We have revised this section and implemented further information to improve the comprehensibility of this paragraph.</p><p>Please find our editions in lines 169-173 of the main text and lines 1191-1194 of the Figure legend. Please note, that it was formerly Figure 1G and is now Figure 1I on the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 3, Figure S3. The is the first example of several figures with FACS data, where relative percentages of cell populations are shown in the main figure (Figure 3), but total cell numbers are shown in the supplementary figure (Figure S3). The total cell numbers are more important, because they are clearer. They should be shown in the main Figure , the relative numbers as supplementary. Please exchange C-G and I-O with the respective parts of Figure 3S. One example of the unclear data of relative cell numbers is Figure 3M. By looking at the Figure the reader thinks that their is a increasing rise of the MZ B cell numbers. However Suppl.Figure 3M shows that they are reduced in total numbers in the last mouse line on the right, just less affected than transitional or FO B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this Reviewer that in many cases the graphs representing the total cell numbers are clearer and support our message better. Thus, we have exchanged the panels in the new version of our manuscript as following: total numbers are now displayed in Figures 3, 5, 6, and 7, while the percentages are shown now in the corresponding Figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 5, Figure S5. The same story. It is a rather complicated presentation of the relative numbers in C-G. The total cell numbers in Figure S5 are much clearer. Pease exchange!. In lines 288-290 the authors describe the mature B cells of the BM as IgM+. This is wrong. The authors did use an B220 antibody or fluorophore that does not separate IgM+ B220 low and B220 high cells very well, so I suppose they used the IgM+ IgD+ gating for mature cells in the bone marrow?</p></disp-quote><p>We have exchanged the Figures as suggested, please see our detailed answer to question #2.</p><p>We thank the Reviewer for noticing the mistake of saying “mature IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells”. Indeed, we have used IgM and IgD to separate immature and mature B cells in the BM. We now rewrote the text in lines 337-339 accordingly in the new version. It now reads: “IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> mature B cells clearly accumulated in the BM of -B-KO BCL2-transgenic mice…<italic>”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 6 and Fg.7. Please also use the total cell numbers here.</p></disp-quote><p>We exchanged the requested panels in the new version for Figures 6 and 7. Please see our detailed answer to question #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 372. I did not understand the sentence of &quot;innocuous λ LC, possibly leaving holes in the BCR repertoire&quot;. Please explain!</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for highlighting the lack of clarity. We have here used the concept of “holes in the BCR repertoire”, that was already put forward by Goodnow back in the 90’s. (<italic>Goodnow, 1996</italic>). The concept hypothesizes that the establishment of tolerance, removing self-reactive B cells from the repertoire, generates “holes in the repertoire” since the lost B cells could have also potentially recognized foreign epitopes that structurally resemble determinants on selfantigens. Thus, the “holes” created in the B cell repertoire could be exploited by microbial pathogens. Building on this concept, the absence of λLC B cells in Kidins220 B-KO mice alters the B cell repertoire generating an incomplete repertoire with “holes”, since those antigens which recognition is dominated by the λLC will not be recognized. This is not only a theoretical possibility. For example, primary immune responses driven by the hapten NP are accounted by BCRs carrying the λLC (<italic>Reth et al., 1978</italic>). Therefore, the BCR repertoire of B-KO mice have a “hole” lacking BCRs that are able to identify this particular antigen, as we have already demonstrated (<italic>Fiala et al., 2015</italic>). We have now edited the paragraph seeking to improve the understandability of our message as follows: <italic>“Consequently, in B-KO mice, there is a deficiency of B cells capable of responding to foreign epitopes recognized by BCRs carrying the λLC, resulting in what has been described as “holes in the BCR repertoire” (Goodnow, 1996).</italic></p><p>Please find our editions in lines 425-427 of the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. For the pre-BCR signaling study: Why was ROS production chosen as a readout for this? Why not e.g. phospho-FACS of proximal or distal intracellular signaling proteins? That would have been more straightforward, according to my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been well documented that ROS are produced upon BCR engagement (<italic>Feng et al., 2019; Tsubata, 2020;Wheeler and Defranco, 2012</italic>). Still, we agree that additional readouts would strengthen our data. We have thus performed phospho-flow FACS analysis of signaling molecules downstream of the (pre-) BCR.</p><p>Firstly, we have tested multiple phospho-antibodies and selected those that fulfilled the following criteria: the phospho-flow signal of the respective antibody shifted towards positiveness upon anti-IgM stimulation only in those populations expressing the targeted molecules. We have thus selected anti-phospho-SYK (Y348), anti-phospho-SLP65 (Y84), antiphospho-p65 (S536), anti-phospho-IκB (S32), anti-phospho-ERK (T202/Y204), and antiphospho-AKT (S473).</p><p>Secondly, we have comparatively investigated the phosphorylation state of the selected molecules during B cell development in the BM of CTRL and B-KO mice at basal conditions. No statistically significant differences in proximal signaling molecules downstream of the (pre-) BCR were detected between CTRL and B-KO mice as shown by analyzing the activatory phosphorylation of SYK (Y348) and SLP65 (Y84) (new Figure 8B). In contrast, the proportions of cells positive for phospho-ERK (T202/Y204) were reduced in B-KO pre- B cells and immature B cells compared to CTRL (new Figures 8B and 8D). Remarkably, pre- B cells and immature B cells are indeed the maturation stages expected to integrate pre-BCR and BCR signals, respectively. These results are in line with our previous report highlighting a link between the BCR and the ERK pathway (<italic>Fiala et al., 2015</italic>).</p><p>We did not detect major differences with respect to NF-κB signaling between B-KO and CTRL B cells (Figure 8C). In contrast, PI3K signaling was enhanced (phospho-AKT (S473)) signaling during early B cell development in B-KO compared to CTRL mice (new Figure 4— figure supplement 1C). PI3K signaling during early B cell development is primary triggered by IL-7R (reviewed in (<italic>Clark et al., 2014</italic>)). Indeed, increased IL-7R signaling results in enhanced AKT phosphorylation, enhanced phosphorylation of its target protein (phosphoFOXO1 (S256)) (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C), and consequently, the retention of FOXO1 proteins in the cytoplasm, reducing thus FOXO1 target gene expression like <italic>Rag1/2.</italic> In fact, <italic>Rag2</italic> expression is reduced in B-KO cells as shown in new Figure 4E.</p><p>Taken together, our additional data point towards a role of Kidins220 in supporting (pre-) BCR signaling via ROS and ERK, as well as IL-7R signaling via AKT/FOXO1. The absence of Kidins220 notably affect developmental stages in which the B cells are highly dependent on signals supporting survival and V(D)J recombination. Hence, λLC B cells are the most affected by the absence of Kidins220.</p><p>The new data are displayed in new Figure 8B-D and new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C. In addition, further experiments supporting the role of Kidins220 coupling signaling of the pre-BCR and BCR to the development of λLC B cells are provided in new Figure 9. For a detailed explanation of those experiments, please refer to question #2 of Reviewer #2.</p><p>Our editions are in the main text lines 300-307 and 482-489.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>It is a significant and important study about the regulation of antibody light chain rearrangement by a B cell signaling protein. Although the research question was quite specific, the findings are of greater relevance for regulation of Ig light chain rearrangement. This is important for the generation of the full antibody repertoire, but also for central tolerance induction in the BM.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his/her thoughtful synthesis and for highlighting the significance of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Kidins220 regulates the development of B cells bearing the λ light chain&quot; Schaffer et al. describes the important role of Kidins220 in the development of λ light chain (LC)+ B cells supposedly by regulation of the opening up of the λ LC genetic locus. Λ LC is important for receptor editing and for the rescue of the developing B cells with autoreactive BCR. The manuscript presents a tour de force in terms of applying various combinations of mouse models including strain crossings and bone marrow chimeras to assess the effects of B cell survival and tolerance. Interestingly, the generation of λ-LC B cells cannot be efficiently induced even when Kidins220-KO is combined with a kappaLC-KO model or when the receptor editing is forced by kappamacroself mice. The experiments are carried out and reported carefully, and the data is robust. The phenotype is interesting and has implications in the BCR repertoire. Mechanistically, the authors show reduced pre-BCR signalling and suggest that as the underlying reason of λ-LC defect.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The group showed in their earlier paper the role of Kidins220 in BCR signalling and B cell activation including antibody responses (ref 37). Here, reduced signalling outcome of pre-BCR signalling is reported. However, this aspect remains somewhat superficial and, notably, no experimental data is shown that would convincingly link the reduced signalling to the defects in the λ locus. Could this hypothesis be experimentally explored?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our manuscript will benefit from more experiments exploring the role of Kidins220 in pre-BCR signaling and the rearrangement of the <italic>λLC</italic> locus. This suggestion is in line with the opinion of Reviewer#1. We have performed phospho-flow FACS analysis of signaling molecules downstream of the (pre-) BCR (new Figure 8B-D) and reconstitution experiments by overexpressing BTK in pro-/pre-B cells (new Figure 9). We would like to refer you to question #6 of Reviewer#1 for a detailed explanation of new Figure 8B-D, and to the next question (question #2, Reviewer #2) for a detailed explanation of new Figure 9.</p><p>We are confident that the new experiments further support our hypothesis that Kidins220 plays a role in pre-BCR signaling.</p><p>Our editions are in the main text lines 300-307, 482-489 and 509-520.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Could the phenotype be rescued by enhancement of the pre-BCR signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for suggesting rescue experiments.</p><p>We have used our established IL-7 BM cultures to overexpress wildtype BTK in pro-/preB cells aiming to rescue the generation of λLC B cells by enhancing pre-BCR signaling.</p><p>We have then compared the generation of λLC B cells between CTRL and B-KO cells upon IL-7 withdrawal. As shown in the new Figure 9, the proportion of λLC B cells was clearly increased in CTRL B cells upon BTK overexpression showcasing that increase signaling results in increase generation of λLC B cells. In the absence of Kidins220, enforced expression of BTK slightly increased the proportion of λLC B cells, but failed to rescue to CTRL levels. BTK overexpression also slightly increased the amount of κLC B cells in both CTRL and B KO cells. This is in line with previously published data showing that BTK is mainly needed for the generation of λLC B cells (<italic>Dingjan et al., 2001; Kersseboom et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2007</italic>). Taken together, these data support a role of Kidins220 guaranteeing optimal (pre-) BCR signals regulating the development of λLC B cells. These data emphasize once again an additional role of Kidins220 beyond regulating (pre-) BCR signaling via BTK. Based in our data, Kidins220 most probably enhances the survival of developing B cells to ensure that in case of unsuccessful rearrangement of the <italic>κLC</italic> locus, rearrangement of the <italic>λLC</italic> locus can take place.</p><p>Alternatively, this question could be addressed genetically by crossing our B-KO mice with mice expressing a constitutive active BTK (E14K mutant). It has been previously reported that the introduction of this mutation increased the proportion of λLC B cells in mice (<italic>Dingjan et al., 2001</italic>). Unfortunately, we did not have access to the BTK-E14K mutant mice. We are confident that the Reviewer´s question is answered by our experiments and that he/she agrees that creating a new mouse model would be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The new data are displayed in new Figure 9 and lines 509-520 in the transferred manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors speculate about a link via reduced activity of RAG and/or E2A proteins, but no experimental data on this is shown. Exploration of the mechanistic aspect would be interesting and if such a mechanism would be identified that would clearly lift the impact of the work. However, the task is not easy and might not be fast to solve.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment and for acknowledging that the task is indeed challenging. We have addressed this task twofold: by directly addressing RAG activity and by analyzing <italic>Rag1/2</italic> expression levels.</p><p>Firstly, we have analyzed RAG1/2 activity by retrovirally transducing IL-7 BM cultures of</p><p>CTRL and B-KO mice with a previously described RAG-activity reporter plasmid (GFPi) (<italic>Trancoso et al., 2013</italic>). The plasmid is designed to express two fluorescent proteins: RFP and GFP. On the one hand, the sequence of RFP is in-frame in the plasmid and serves as fluorescent marker for transduction efficiency. On the other hand, the sequence of GFP is inverted and flaked by RAG-recognition signal sequences (RSS). RAG protein activity will lead to a RAG-mediated GFP inversion and thus, a GFP fluorescence signal is expected as readout for RAG activity. The results are displayed in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D. RAG activity was equally induced in both CTRL and B-KO B cells in BM cultures three days upon IL-7 withdrawal as shown by the comparable percentages of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Based on these results, we conclude that RAG activity <italic>per se</italic> is not affected by the absence of Kidins220 expression. Text editions are in the main text lines 222-231.</p><p>Secondly, we have analyzed <italic>Rag1/2</italic> expression levels in two complementary settings: in BM cultures shortly upon IL-7 withdrawal (equivalent conditions to the RAG activity assay), in <italic>ex-vivo</italic> sorted B cells. Both shortly upon IL-7 withdrawal and in sorted developing B cells, the levels of <italic>Rag1</italic> and <italic>Rag2</italic> were comparable between CRTL and B-KO cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C).</p><p>Text editions in the text lines 221-222.</p><p>Taken together, <italic>Rag1/2</italic> levels shortly upon IL-7 withdrawal are sufficient for efficient recombination in the absence of Kidins220. This aligns with the normal generation of κLC B cells in B-KO, since it is generally accepted that rearrangement at the <italic>κLC</italic> locus occurs first (<italic>Engel et al., 2001; Luning Prak et al., 2011; Nemazee, 2006</italic>). However, in long-term BM cultures overexpressing BCL2, expression of <italic>Rag2</italic> and <italic>E47</italic> (see below, question #4) significantly diminishes in B-KO cells leading to the subsequent reduction in rearrangement at the <italic>λLC</italic> locus (Figure 4E). It is worth noting that rearrangement at the <italic>λLC</italic> locus demands higher levels of E2A proteins (<italic>Beck et al., 2009</italic>). This further reinforces the notion that in the absence of Kidins220, the levels of RAG and E2A proteins are insufficient for rearranging the <italic>λLC</italic> locus. Unfortunately, we were unable to investigate the activity of E2A proteins using similar approaches. In line with our results of <italic>Rag1/2</italic> expression, our qRT-PCR results showed reduced <italic>E47</italic> expression upon IL-7 withdrawal in long-term BM cultures, while <italic>E12</italic> expression was unaffected (Figure 4E).</p><p>Text editions in the main text lines 321-326.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 278-88. The authors state that the dampened abundance of λ-LC germline transcripts was not caused by an altered expression of, E47, Rag1 and Rag2. However, this seems to be based on only one experiment with one mouse per genotype (Figure S4). The direct comparison of the data is challenged by the genotypes not shown directly next to each other, but there could be a reduction in Rag 2 and E47, which is worth verifying with proper replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have changed the display of the former Figure S4, which is now Figure 4E and have further strengthened our results by analyzing the expression of <italic>Rag1</italic>, <italic>Rag2</italic> and <italic>Tcf3</italic> encoding for E2A (<italic>E12</italic> and <italic>E47</italic>) in additional biological replicates. Our new results show a statistically significant reduction in the expression levels of <italic>E47</italic> and <italic>Rag2</italic> over time upon IL-7 withdrawal in BM cultures overexpressing BCL2.</p><p>We want to use the opportunity to further discuss our data. We did not detected differences in <italic>Rag1/2</italic> or E2A (<italic>E12</italic> and <italic>E47</italic>) expression in directly sorted cells or short-term BM cultures upon IL-7 withdrawal when CTRL and B-KO were compared (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C). However, we detected differences at later time points, when <italic>Bcl2</italic> was overexpressed to allow long-term <italic>in-vitro</italic> cultures (Figure 4E). These results might appear conflicting. Taking in consideration our compelling evidence that in the absence of Kidins220 the survival and fitness of developing B cells is reduced, we think that we have already selected for the most robust cells in our primary sorted cells as well as in our short term BM cultures t. Under these conditions, no differences in <italic>Rag1/2</italic> or E2A (<italic>E12</italic> and <italic>E47</italic>) expression were observed because those cells with reduced expression of the transcription factors did not survive. It is only over time when survival is enforced by overexpression of BCL2 that the absence of Kidins220 ultimately impacts recombination at the <italic>λLC</italic> locus by an insufficient induction of <italic>Rag1/2</italic> or <italic>E12/E47</italic> levels (Figure 4E).</p><p>We have now rewritten the paragraph in the new version of the manuscript accordingly (321-326).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Several reports have used the level of expression of MHCII as a read out for efficient pre-BCR signaling during B cell development. Indeed, mutations in well-described signaling molecules downstream of the pre-BCR resulted in reduced levels of MHCII on the surface of developing B cells (<italic>Kersseboom et al., 2003; Kersseboom et al., 2006; Middendorp et al., 2002; Stadhouders et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2007</italic>).

The authors convincingly demonstrate that in the absence of Kidins220, λ, but not κ, light chain is poorly transcribed. This is not improved by forcing usage of the λ locus by deleting κ or by expressing an autoantigen that deletes κ expressing cells. In part, λ light chain expression in Kidins220-deficient B cells is improved by preventing apoptosis by overexpression of BCl<sup>-</sup>2. The authors also show reduced ROS production during B cell development of Kidins220-deficient B cells. The authors conclude that Kidins220 is required for preBCR or BCR-induced initiation of λ light chain locus directly, as well as prolonging survival of the B cells to afford time for using this chain after κ failed to generate a functional, non-autoreactive BCR.</p><p>The work is of very high quality and the experiments are well constructed and the data are clear and convincing. There is a great level of detail in the analysis of the BCR repertoire and the effects of Kidins220 on the light chain expression during the various genetic manipulations and the figures are informative and contain all the essential analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her precise synthesis, for highlighting our major findings and for his/her positive comments towards our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While the data are clear, sometimes the description is difficult to follow due to the level of detail.

We have implemented her/his suggestion along the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The most open question that is not addressed is what is the signalling pathway by which Kidins220 regulates λ light chain selectively? The previous work of the authors analysed calcium, MAPK and PI3K signalling in the knock out B cells. Here, the manuscript focuses on ROS production. It is not clear whether ROS production is a substitute for &quot;general&quot; strength of BCR signalling and therefore the effects on the λ locus are a matter of quantitatively reduced signalling, or whether some specific pathways are more affected by Kidins220 deficiency than others and may help to explain the λ phenotype. Is it possible to look at MAPK, PI3K and NFkB signalling? How about signalling to transcription factors that were implicated in λ locus function such as IRF4? Providing just a little more information would link what is known about the signalling functions of Kidins220 with the in vivo phenotypes and would enhance the overall value of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his/her suggestion to provide deeper insights into signaling network by which Kidins220 regulates λLC expression. This point is in line with the requests expressed by the other two Reviewers. Therefore, we will like to refer to the response to question #6 formulated by Reviewer #1 for a detailed answer. Briefly, we have investigated (pre-) BCR signaling in the presence and absence of Kidins220 by analyzing the levels of phospho-proteins using phospho-flow. Our results are summarized here. Firstly, we did not detect differences in proximal (pre-) BCR signaling (phospho-SYK and phospho-SLP65, new Figure 8B). Secondly, we did not detect major differences in respect to NF-κB signaling between B-KO and CTRL B cells (new Figure 8C). Lastly, reduced levels of phospho-ERK were observed in both pre-B and immature B cells lacking Kidins220 (new Figure 8D).</p><p>In addition, we observed enhanced phospho-AKT and phospho-FOXO1 levels in the absence of Kidins220 in pro- and pre-B cells indicative of increased signaling via the IL-7R since IL-7R levels were comparable in the presence and absence of Kidins220 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Taken together, our data point towards a role of Kidins220 in supporting (pre-) BCR signaling via ROS and ERK, as well as IL-7R signaling via AKT/FOXO1. The absence of Kidins220 notably affects developmental stages in which the B cells are highly dependent on signals supporting survival and V(D)J recombination. Hence, λLC B cells are the most affected by the absence of Kidins220.</p><p>Our editions are in the main text lines 300-307 and 482-489, as well as in the new Figure 8B-D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In some figures, the numbers for the λ gene are too small compared to κ to be appreciated. Putting them on a separate graph or using a separate y axis would help. For example Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer suggesting these changes to increase the readability of our figures. We have now displayed the two LCs in separate graphs (new Figures 1C-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript's main contribution is about the regulation of λ light chain expression during B cell development. In itself, this does not have a broad significance, particularly because the manuscript does not make it clear why Kidins220 is a key molecule in this process in comparison to other BCR-dependent (or BCR-independent) signals. However, the regulation of light chain expression and editing is an important step in B cell development and the decisions that regulate it are important for the generation of normal BCR repertoire. Since this process is defective in various immune deficiencies and in immune dysregulation including autoimmunity, understanding the role of Kidins220 can potentially shine some light on these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his/her thoughtful synthesis and for recognizing the relevance of this study.
