Anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are urgently needed to treat patients, save lives, and help revive economy. Yet daunting challenges confront the development of such drugs. Though small-molecule drugs could target SARS-CoV-2, it can take years to develop them and their use is often limited by poor specificity and off-target effects. Repurposed drugs, developed against other viruses, also have low specificity against SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic antibodies have been identified and generally have high specificity; however, their expression in mammalian cells often leads to low yields and high production costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salazar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Breedveld, 2000</xref>). A realistic therapeutic solution to COVID-19 must be potent and specific, yet easy to produce.</p><p>Nanobodies (or VHH antibodies) are unique antibodies derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies found in members of the camelidae family (llamas, alpacas, camels, and so on) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure-supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Könning et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). Because of their small size (2.5 nm by 4 nm; 12–15 kDa) and unique binding domains, nanobodies offer many advantages over conventional antibodies including the ability to bind cryptic epitopes on their antigen, high tissue permeability, ease of production, and thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Steeland et al., 2016</xref>). Although small, nanobodies bind their targets with high affinity and specificity due to an extended antigen-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Steeland et al., 2016</xref>). One drawback of nanobodies is their quick clearance by kidneys due to their small size; this can be overcome by adding tags to increase the molecular weight to a desired level that is above the kidney clearance threshold but still much lower than conventional antibodies’ molecular weight. Underscoring the potency and safety of nanobodies as human therapeutics, a nanobody drug was recently approved for clinical use in treating a blood clotting disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scully et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, due to their superior stability, nanobodies can be inhaled to treat lung diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Heeke et al., 2017</xref>) or ingested to treat intestine diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vega et al., 2013</xref>). Nanobodies are currently being developed against SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hanke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schoof et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wrapp et al., 2020a</xref>). However, these reported nanobodies have not been adequately evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction of a camelid nanobody phage display library and use of this library for screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies.</title><p>A large-sized (diversity 7.5 x 10<sup>10</sup>) naive nanobody phage display library was constructed using B cells of over a dozen llamas and alpacas.

The spike protein guides coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing the viral and host membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Perlman and Netland, 2009</xref>). The RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and a closely related SARS-CoV-1 both recognize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Previously, we have shown that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs both contain a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM) and that SARS-CoV-2 RBD has significantly higher ACE2-binding affinity than SARS-CoV-1 RBD due to several structural changes in the RBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2005</xref>). We have further shown that SARS-CoV-2 RBD is more hidden than SARS-CoV-1 RBD in the entire spike protein as a possible viral strategy for immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shang et al., 2020b</xref>). Hence, to block SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2, a nanobody drug would need to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD more tightly than ACE2.</p><p>Here we report the development of a series of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody drug candidates, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>. Identified by screening a camelid nanobody phage display library against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series bound potently to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and were effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. The best performing drug candidate, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>, demonstrated preventative and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models. Produced at high yields, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> is easily scalable for mass production. It also demonstrated excellent in vitro thermostability, in vivo stability, and bioavailability. Our data suggest that <italic>Nanosota-1c-Fc</italic> can potentially contribute to the battle against COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Nanosota-1</italic> was identified by phage display</title><p>For the rapid identification of virus-targeting nanobodies, we constructed a naive nanobody phage display library using B cells isolated from the spleen, bone marrow, and blood of nearly a dozen non-immunized llamas and alpacas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD, expressed and purified from mammalian cells, was screened against the library to identify RBD-targeting nanobodies. Selected nanobody clones were tested in a preliminary screen for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into target cells (more details about the assay are reported below). The nanobody that demonstrated the highest preliminary neutralization potency was named <italic>Nanosota-1A</italic> and was subjected to two rounds of affinity maturation. For each round, random mutations were introduced to the whole gene of <italic>Nanosota-1A</italic> through error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and mutant phages were selected for enhanced binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Nanobodies contain four framework regions (FRs) as structural scaffolds and three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) for antigen binding. The nanobody after the first round of affinity maturation, <italic>Nanosota-1B</italic>, possessed one mutation in CDR3 and two other mutations in FR3 (near CDR3). Affinity maturation of <italic>Nanosota-1B</italic> resulted in <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, which possessed one mutation in CDR2 and another mutation in FR2. We next made an Fc-tagged version of <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, termed <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>, to create a bivalent construct with increased molecular weight.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Nanosota-1</italic> tightly bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and completely blocked the binding of ACE2</title><p>To understand the structural basis for the binding of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexed with <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>. The structure showed that <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> binds close to the center of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among the 14 RBM residues that directly interact with <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic>, six also directly interact with human ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the structures of the RBD/<italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> complex and the RBD/ACE2 complex were superimposed together, significant clashes occurred between ACE2 and <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> binding to the RBD blocks ACE2 binding to the RBD. Moreover, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is present in two different conformations: the RBD stands up in the open conformation but lies down in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wrapp et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ke et al., 2020</xref>). When the structures of the RBD/<italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> complex and the closed spike were superimposed, no clash was found between RBD-bound <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> and the rest of the spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, severe clashes were identified between RBD-bound ACE2 and the rest of the spike protein in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, neither RBD-bound <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> nor RBD-bound ACE2 had clashes with the rest of the spike protein in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Although several studies have reported nanobody drug candidates that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hanke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schoof et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wrapp et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pymm et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nambulli et al., 2021</xref>), as of this writing, only two studies have evaluated their nanobody drug candidates in an animal model for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pymm et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nambulli et al., 2021</xref>). None of these studies have evaluated their nanobody drug candidates for in vitro thermostability, in vivo stability, or tissue biodistribution. The current study describes the full development and characterization of a series of nanobody drug candidates that specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Our study included screening of nanobody phage display library, two rounds of affinity maturation, structural determination of the RBD/<italic>Nanosota-1</italic> complex, and neutralizations of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry and live SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We also evaluated the protection efficacy in two different animal models (hamsters and mice), characterized the nanobody’s production yields, demonstrated its in vitro thermostability and in vivo stability, and clarified its tissue biodistribution. The extensive scope of the work makes the current study among the most comprehensive on anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody drug candidates.</p><p>The two best-performing drug candidates from our study are <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> and <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>. The latter was constructed from the former through addition of an Fc tag to make a bivalent molecule with increased molecular weight and picomolar RBD-binding affinity. In this study, recombinant viral receptor ACE2 was selected as a comparison for evaluating antiviral potency because <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> directly competes with ACE2 for the same binding site on the RBD. Compared with ACE2, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> bound to the RBD ~3000-fold more strongly and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry ~160-fold more effectively. Compared with ACE2, the much higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was partly due to the small size of its antigen-binding domain and its ideal binding site on the RBD, allowing <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> to access the RBD in both the open spike during viral infection and the closed spike during viral immune evasion. Thus, the <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series are ideal RBD-targeting drug candidates that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral particles regardless of whether the viral spike molecules are in an open or a closed conformation. Importantly, we showed that the effectiveness of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> was not limited to in vitro experiments, but translated directly to in vivo experiments by demonstrating efficacy in animal models. It is worth noting that the molecular weight of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> (78 kDa) is above the kidney clearance threshold (60 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Steeland et al., 2016</xref>), but it's still only half of conventional antibodies’ molecular weight (150 kDa). Its ideal size contributed to ease of production, excellent in vitro thermostability, good in vivo stability, and high tissue bioavailability. All of these features are critical for the implementation of <italic>Nanosota-1C-F</italic>c as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic.</p><p>How can <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drug candidates contribute to the battle against COVID-19? First, as evidenced by both of our animal studies, <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Because of its excellent in vivo stability (significant RBD-binding capacity remained after 10 days in vivo), a single injected dose of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> can theoretically protect a person from SARS-CoV-2 infection for days or weeks in the outpatient setting, reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations. Second, data from both of our animal studies showed that <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> can be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus, potentially saving lives and alleviating symptoms in infected patients in the clinical setting. It is worth noting that given the recent success of COVID-19 vaccines, future development of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series should focus on its therapeutic efficacy rather than its preventive efficacy. Moreover, to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with RBM mutations, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series can be further developed through additional affinity maturation against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The series may also be developed to become part of cocktail therapies that target multiple sites on SARS-CoV-2. Third, despite its rapid clearance from the blood, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> could be used as an inhaler to treat infections in the respiratory tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Heeke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nambulli et al., 2021</xref>) or as an oral drug to treat infections in the intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vega et al., 2013</xref>). The worldwide distribution of COVID-19 in the world calls for the large-scale manufacturing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Molecules such as <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>, with their high production yields from bacteria and excellent in vitro and in vivo stabilities, are promising drug candidates to meet this need. Therefore, if further validated in clinical trials, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> drug candidates can help minimize the mortality and morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infections and contribute to the battle against COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, plasmids, and virus</title><p>HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies).

The efficacy of each inhibitor was expressed as the concentration capable of neutralizing 50 or 90% of the entry efficiency (i.e., ND<sub>50</sub> or ND<sub>90</sub>, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>SARS-CoV-2 plaque-reduction neutralization test</title><p>The potency of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> in neutralizing live SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay. Specifically, the individual drug candidate was serially diluted in DMEM and mixed with SARS-CoV-2 (at a titer of 80 PFU) at 37°C for 1 hr. The mixtures were then added into Vero E6 cells at 37°C for an additional 45 min. After removing the culture medium, cells were overlaid with 0.6% agarose and cultured for 3 days. Plaques were visualized by 0.1% crystal violet staining. The efficacy of each drug candidate was calculated and expressed as the concentration capable of reducing the number of virus plaques by 50% (i.e., ND<sub>50</sub>) compared to control serum-exposed virus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>SARS-CoV-2 challenge of hamsters</title><p>Syrian hamsters (n = 24; equal sex) were obtained from Envigo (IN) and challenged via intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 (1 x 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) in 100 µl DMEM (50 µl per nare). Sample size was constrained by the availability of resources. Four groups of hamsters (n = 6 in each group; randomly assigned) received <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> via intraperitoneal injection at one of the following time points and dosages: (i) 24 hr pre-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight; (ii) 4 hr post-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight; (iii) 4 hr post-challenge at 10 mg/kg body weight. Hamsters in the negative control group were administered PBS buffer 24 hr pre-challenge. Body weights were collected daily. Hamsters were humanely euthanized on day 10 post-challenge via overexposure to CO<sub>2</sub>. The lungs and bronchial tubes were collected and fixed in formalin for pathological analysis. At a sample size of six animals per group, G*Power analysis indicates that we can detect an effect size of 1.6 with a power of 0.80 (alpha = 0.05, one-tailed).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>SARS-CoV-2 challenge of human ACE2-transgenic mice</title><p>Human ACE2-transgenic mice (K18-hACE2-transgenic mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McCray et al., 2007</xref>) (n = 35; males and females; 7–8 months old) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories. Mice were challenged via intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 (5 x 10<sup>3</sup> PFU) in a volume of 50 µl DMEM. Sample size was constrained by the availability of resources. Five groups of mice (n = 7 in each group) were treated with <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> via intraperitoneal injection at one of the following time points and dosages: (i) 24 hr pre-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight; (ii) 24 hr pre-challenge at 10 mg/kg body weight; (iii) 4 hr post-challenge at 20 mg/kg body weight; (iv) 4 hr post-challenge at 10 mg/kg body weight. Mice in the negative control group were administered PBS buffer 24 hr pre-challenge.</p><p>Viral titers in the lungs of mice were measured by a plaque assay. To this end, five mice from each group were euthanized on day 2 post-challenge. Lung homogenate supernatants were collected and then serially diluted in DMEM. 12-well plates of Vero E6 cells were inoculated and then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr and gently rocked every 15 min. After removing the inocula, the plates were overlaid with 0.6% agarose containing 2% FBS. After 3 days, overlays were removed and plaques were visualized via staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Viral titers were quantified as PFU per ml tissue. At a sample size of five animals per group, G*Power analysis indicates that we can detect an effect size of 1.72 with a power of 0.80 (alpha = 0.05, one-tailed).</p><p>Histological examination of lungs was performed. For this pupose, the remaining two mice from each group were euthanized on day 5 post-challenge and then perfused transcardially with PBS. Mouse lungs were fixed in formalin. Sections (approximately 4 µm each) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In vivo stability of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic></title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice (3–4 weeks old) (Envigo) were intravenously injected (tail vein) with <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> or <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> (100 μg in 100 μl PBS buffer). At varying time points, mice were euthanized and whole blood was collected. Then sera were prepared through centrifugation of the whole blood at 1500 x<italic>g</italic> for 10 min.

Briefly, the nanobodies were first conjugated to the bifunctional chelator p-SCN-Bn-Deferoxamine (DFO, Macrocyclic) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zeglis and Lewis, 2015</xref>). [<sup>89</sup>Zr] (University of Wisconsin Medical Physics Department) was then conjugated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hintz et al., 2020</xref>). [<sup>89</sup>Zr]-labeled nanobodies (1.05 MBq, 1–2 μg nanobody, 100 μl PBS) were intravenously injected (tail vein). Mice were euthanized at various time points. Organs were collected and counted on an automatic gamma-counter (Hidex). The total number of counts per minute (cpm) for each organ or tissue was compared with a standard sample of known activity and mass. Count data were corrected to both background and decay. The percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) was calculated by normalization to the total amount of activity injected into each mouse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The development of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> and animal testing were supported by funding from the University of Minnesota (to FL) and NIH grants R01AI157975 (to FL, AML, LD, SP), R01AI089728 (to FL), and R35GM118047 (to HA).

stability, ease of production etc. and can be applied as both therapeutic and diagnostic agents. This study describes a nanobody that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and has the potential to be a drug candidate for COVID-19.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Development of a Novel Nanobody Therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zhiwei Wu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Please note that the major concern for all reviewers was lack of in vivo efficacy data with respect to viral titers. This will be the most critical data needed for competitive resubmission.

Figure S7. The impact of the nanobody on viral titers seems quite model relative to the impact on weight loss. It would seem that a highly effective nanobody would more robustly reduce viral burden, by more than the half-log drop shown here. By comparison maybe therapy in a hamster model results in 2-3 log drop in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Can the authors examine viral RNA from these samples? What else might explain why the viral load is not diminished more than it is? Also, the statistical analyses of these data are not clear. Only one p value for each group is mentioned in legend.

Is there a negative control that can be included for comparison?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Ye et al., the authors employed a phage display library based on naive camelids to identify nanobodies that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. A clone named Nanosota-1A was identified from the initial screen, which was further optimized for RBD binding by in vitro affinity maturation. The resulting nanobody Nanosota-1C binds moderately the RBD at 14 nM. The authors determined the crystal structure of Nanosota-1C in complex with the RBD and found that Nanosota-1C partially overlap with the ACE2 binding sites.</p><p>To potentially enable bivalent binding and increase the pharmacological properties, the authors fused the lead construct with an Fc domain (Nanosota-1C-Fc) and positively evaluated its neutralization potential (with an NC50 of sub-microgram/ml) using a clinical isolate of the virus. Moreover, Ye and colleagues performed experiments to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of Nanosota-1C-Fc (for prophylaxis and potential treatment) in a COVID model using golden hamsters. For treatment, they evaluated two doses of a lead construct (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 6 hours post-infection (IN/intranasal-based inoculation). The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated based on body weight, lung pathology, and virus tilter from nasal swabs. Both prophylaxis (pre-IN) and treatment (post-IN) groups post-infection showed potential protections on body weights compared to the control group. The lead construct also appears to mitigate lung infections with decreased BAL hyperplasia, which is especially true for pre-IN animals, and less so for the post-IN(treatment) group, consistent with in vivo studies using monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, no significant decrease in nasal viral titers was detected.</p><p>The authors further expanded the study by evaluating the solubility, stability, and biodistribution of the lead construct. They provided data to indicate that Nanosota-1C-Fc can be expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with high yield, and is potentially stable both in vitro and in vivo. Using a wild type mouse model, they found that following i.v., Nanosota-1C-Fc is widely distributed in the major organs.</p><p>While the lead construct is not among the most potent nanobodies developed to date, this study is highly comprehensive including in vivo evaluations in the hamster model. Clearly, there were lots of efforts and I appreciate the amount of data presented here, from screening/ in vitro affinity maturation, structural characterization, bioengineering, biophysics to in vivo efficacy studies. However, I do have the following concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. The overall flow is fine, however, the manuscript will need to be improved for clarity and conciseness. There is grammar throughout the text. Finally, the Discussion section seems to be a bit awkward and lengthy.</p><p>2. The major advantages of nanobodies over monoclonal IgG antibodies include the small size, biophysical properties for COVID, potential inhalation delivery, as well as high bioengineering potentials. In the present work, the lead construct (Nanosota-1C-Fc) was back-engineered into a full-length antibody comparable with the monoclonal antibodies directly isolated from COVID patients. The in vitro neutralization potency of the Fc fusion construct (Nanosota-1C-Fc) appears to be considerably inferior to other monoclonal COVID antibodies under clinical evaluations(e.g., single-digit nanogram/ml). Would the authors elaborate on the key conceptual advances of this work?</p><p>3. The affinity of Nanosota-1C-Fc: the authors claimed that there was a three-log improvement on the RB binding affinity, after fusing monomeric Nanosota-1C to an Fc (from 14 nM to ~ 16 pM). This raises the possibility of avidity binding. However, since the RBD does not dimerize, how could bivalent binding occur? Along the same line, I wonder if the ACE2 competition assay could be performed on Nanosota-1C-Fc to substantiate the KD measurement.</p><p>4. Line 187: the NC50 curves were plotted without sufficient data points and dilutions ( Figure 3B and S6), the quantitative differences (20 fold and 6,000 fold) therefore can not be accurately derived.</p><p>5.

Regarding the weight increase of hamsters: there was evidence to indicate that weight recovery/increase in the infected hamsters is likely non-specifically related to the IP administration. What is the placebo/control used for Figure 4A? Is that PBS injection? It is not clear what &quot;control (no drug)&quot; indicates here.

The authors found that Nanosota-1C bound to both the closed and open conformations of the RBD with high affinities. The nanobody also exhibited inhibitory activity against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells in vitro and inhibited live virus replication and lessened pathology in a hamster model. In addition, the authors also demonstrated that Nanosota-1C-Fc exhibited excellent stability in vivo and bioavailability, and suggest that Nanosota-1C-Fc is a potential therapeutic and preventative candidate for COVID-19. The study is well designed and executed with evidence that supports some of the conclusions.</p><p>The study demonstrated biochemically that Nanosota-1C-Fc binds both the close and open conformation of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and that the nanobody neutralized pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in in vitro assay. However, the in vivo viral inhibitory activity of the nanobody was not supported by the data since no convincing evidence was presented.</p><p>The study also suffers from incomplete investigation of the antibody role in controlling the virus since the authors did not investigate the nanobody in the nasal compartment where virus was easily detected.</p><p>Due to the unique immunological and biochemical charactertistics of the nanobodies, this study will have some impact on the therapeutic antibody development against COVID-19.</p><p>However, there remain a number of serious concerns that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication:</p><p>1. For the in vitro neutralization study, the authors only calculated ND50 values. The ND90 values are more meaningful biologically with respect to the efficacy of inhibiting viral infection and reflect the potency of an antibody in suppressing the virus. The authors should calculate ND90 values and presented in the text.</p><p>2. For the in vivo study, the viral load in various settings showed essentially no differences across all time points as shown in Figure S7, suggesting that the Nanosota-1C-Fc either did not inhibit the viral infection or the intravenous-administrated nanobody did not reach functional concentrations in the nasal compartment. Did the authors measure Nanosota-1C-Fc concentrations in the nasal cavity ? Figure 5D clearly indicated that there is little antibody in the lungs.</p><p>3. In view of the Figure S7 data, did the authors measure viral titers in other compartments, particularly lungs, to see if virus was inhibited by Nanosota-1C-Fc. It is critical that the mitigation of the pathology is indeed caused by the reduced viral infection/replication rather than other mechanisms.</p><p>4. Based on the data presented, there is no evidence that the nanobody inhibited virus in the in vivo model. How did the administration of Nanosota-1C-Fc resulted in the reduction of disease severity ? The authors need to provide an explanation.</p><p>5. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces marked inflammatory cytokine secretion which causes extensive organ damage and is the major pathogenic mechanisms of the viral infection. Did the authors look into the inflammatory cytokine production before and after Nanosota-1C-Fc administration ? Using bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia alone is not sufficient to indicate the efficacy of the antibody.</p><p>6. The authors overstated the roles of Nanosota-1C-Fc as a protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. With 1-2 weeks of in vivo life, using antibody for prevention is both costly and ineffective. In particular, if Nanosota-1C-Fc is not present in the nasal compartment or oral/upper respiratory mucosa in functional concentrations, intravenously administrated Nanosota-1C-Fc will not prevent the viral transmission. I suggest that the authors remove these statements.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The Development of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic>as anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody drug candidates&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Because nasal wash is not a good source, the data are uninformative and not included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>A superior index of viral titers in treated animals is to measure virus titers in the animal lungs during the peak of viral infections. Although limited resources prevented us from repeating the hamster study, we were able to conduct this critical test in a mouse model. Specifically, to further examine the in vivo efficacy of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic>, we evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in a human ACE2-transgenic mouse model challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Instead of monitoring the body weights of the mice through the viral infection and recovery process, we measured the virus titers in the lungs at the peak of the viral infection. To this end, four experimental groups of mice (seven per group) were injected with a single dose of <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc.</italic> Five out of the seven mice from each group were euthanized on day 2 post-challenge, and the virus titers in their lungs were measured using a virus titer plaque assay (Figure 4C). The remaining two mice in each group were euthanized on day 5 post-challenge for pathology analysis of their lung tissues (Figure 4D). Compared to the untreated control group, the mice that received <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> had much lower virus titers in the lungs (2-3 logs lower) and showed improvement in their lung pathology. Combined with the weight and pathology data from the hamster study, these findings showed that <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces marked inflammatory cytokine secretion which causes extensive organ damage and is the major pathogenic mechanisms of the viral infection. Did the authors look into the inflammatory cytokine production before and after Nanosota-1C-Fc administration ? Using bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia alone is not sufficient to indicate the efficacy of the antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>In our human ACE2 transgenic model challenged by SARS-CoV-2, most cytokine/chemokine increase occurred at 4 and 6 dpi. (J. Zheng et al., COVID-19 treatments and pathogenesis including anosmia in K18-hACE2 mice. Nature 589, 603-607 (2021).). In the current study, lungs of five mice from each group were collected at 2 dpi for the purpose of measuring virus titers in lungs. Consistent with our previously published results, for samples collected at this time point, we didn’t find a significant increase in cytokine secretion even in the PBS control group. Nevertheless, in the revised manuscript, we showed that compared to the untreated control group, the mice that received <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> had much lower virus titers in the lungs (2-3 logs lower) and showed improvement in their lung pathology. Combined with the data from the hamster study, the current manuscript showed that <italic>Nanosota-1C-Fc</italic> demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors overstated the roles of Nanosota-1C-Fc as a protective agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. With 1-2 weeks of in vivo life, using antibody for prevention is both costly and ineffective. In particular, if Nanosota-1C-Fc is not present in the nasal compartment or oral/upper respiratory mucosa in functional concentrations, intravenously administrated Nanosota-1C-Fc will not prevent the viral transmission. I suggest that the authors remove these statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed these statements and added the following discussion:</p><p>“It is worth noting that given the recent success of COVID-19 vaccines, future development of <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series should focus on its therapeutic efficacy rather than its preventive efficacy.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

None of these studies have evaluated their nanobody drug candidates for in vitro thermostability, in vivo stability, or tissue biodistribution.”</p><p>We also added one new reference (in red) to the following discussion:</p><p>“Third, despite its rapid clearance from the blood, <italic>Nanosota-1C</italic> could be used as an inhaler to treat infections in the respiratory tracts (10, 33) or as an oral drug to treat infections in the intestines (11).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Since Nanosota targets highly variable ACE2 binding sites, it may not resist many circulating VOCs (especially E484K/Q that shares with beta and the prevalent delta variants). It would be useful to discuss this vis-a-vis the evolving virus.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added the following discussion:</p><p>“Moreover, to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with RBM mutations, <italic>Nanosota-1</italic> series can be further developed through additional affinity maturation against the RBD of SARS-CoV2 variants. The series may also be developed to become part of cocktail therapies that target multiple sites on SARS-CoV-2.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
