In some cases, transcription factors define the context for how signaling pathways elicit tissue- or cell-specific responses, and in others, they influence signaling through transcriptional regulation of signaling components or accessory factors. We previously showed that during optic vesicle patterning, the Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 has a contextual role by linking the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway to downstream targets without regulating the pathway itself. Here, we show that during early retinal neurogenesis in mice, Lhx2 is a multilevel regulator of Shh signaling. Specifically, Lhx2 acts cell autonomously to control the expression of pathway genes required for efficient activation and maintenance of signaling in retinal progenitor cells. The Shh co-receptors Cdon and Gas1 are candidate direct targets of Lhx2 that mediate pathway activation, whereas Lhx2 directly or indirectly promotes the expression of other pathway components important for activation and sustained signaling. We also provide genetic evidence suggesting that Lhx2 has a contextual role by linking the Shh pathway to downstream targets. Through these interactions, Lhx2 establishes the competence for Shh signaling in retinal progenitors and the context for the pathway to promote early retinal neurogenesis. The temporally distinct interactions between Lhx2 and the Shh pathway in retinal development illustrate how transcription factors and signaling pathways adapt to meet stage-dependent requirements of tissue formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lhx2</kwd><kwd>Sonic Hedgehog</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EY013760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-EY014800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-EY008216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EY020560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackshaw</surname><given-names>Seth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-EY007315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuller</surname><given-names>Alexandra W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-007491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Patrick J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-HD087532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Pulin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The LIM-homedomain transcription factor Lhx2 confers competence to retinal progenitor cells to activate and maintain Sonic Hedgeghog signaling at physiological levels during a key phase of tissue growth and cell type generation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is essential for the patterning, growth, and histogenesis of multiple tissues.

The canonical pathway is composed of core and accessory components, which contribute to Shh production, availability, reception, intracellular signaling, and transcriptional regulation of target genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramsbottom and Pownall, 2016</xref>). At its simplest, Shh signaling occurs when secreted Shh binds to its cognate Patched receptor, relieving inhibition of the Frizzled class GPCR transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In turn, an intracellular cascade blocks the proteolytic processing of the GLI zinc-finger transcription factors, Gli2 and Gli3, converting them from transcriptional repressors to activators with Gli3 the predominant repressor and Gli2 the predominant activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lipinski et al., 2006</xref>). The net result is the expression of downstream genes which includes the third mammalian GLI paralog Gli1, which like Gli2, functions as a transcriptional activator.

For a responding cell to be competent, positive transducers must be expressed prior to signaling (e.g. Smo, Gli2), but kept in the ‘off’ state by negative regulators such as Patched, Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), Gli3, and accessory factors such as Protein Kinase A (Pka), Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (Gsk3b), and Casein Kinase 1 (Ck1). Pathway activation also requires binding of Shh to one of three co-receptors: the integral membrane proteins Cell Adhesion, Oncogene Regulated (Cdon), Brother of Cdon (Boc), or the GPI-anchored protein Growth Arrest Specific 1 (Gas1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Izzi et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, pathway regulation is complex even before signaling is initiated. Since many pathway genes are not expressed ubiquitously, understanding how they are regulated in specific contexts can reveal how signaling is tailored to meet the demands of developing tissues and provide insights into developmental timing mechanisms.</p><p>In early eye development, Shh signaling is initially required for the regionalization and ventral patterning of the optic neuroepithelium including in the nascent neural retinal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallardo and Bovolenta, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hernández-Bejarano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Take-uchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). In the newly formed retina, a second interval of signaling occurs in retinal progenitor cells (R<underline>P</underline>Cs) at the onset of neurogenesis, propagating as a central-to-peripheral wave that is coupled to retinal ganglion cell (R<underline>G</underline>C) production and RGC-derived <italic>Shh</italic> expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wallace, 2008</xref>). This coupling is maintained even when RGC production is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sigulinsky et al., 2008</xref>) indicating that Shh availability sets the developmental timing of pathway activation because RPCs are competent to signal prior to Shh exposure.

Because of its well-established role as a readout of pathway activity, we first asked if Gli1 expression was altered by the loss of Lhx2 function.

A decrease in the RPC marker Hes1 expression was observed, but DAPI staining and the expression patterns of the RPC marker Cyclin D1, RGC marker Pou4f2, and photoreceptor precursor marker Otx2, were all similar between control and CKO retinas, indicating that tissue organization was not yet severely disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Addition of the Shh-blocking IgG antibody, 5E1, to the culture medium suppressed mCitrine expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), demonstrating a continued requirement for Shh-N in the open-loop cells even at the lowest levels of Ptch1 expression (i.e. without doxycycline treatment). Taken together, these data indicate that mCitrine expression in the <italic>open-loop</italic> cells is dependent on Shh-N in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>We next tested the ability of retinal tissue to stimulate signaling in <italic>open-loop</italic> cells. Prior work showed that mCitrine + <italic>open</italic> loop cells extended several cell diameters away from cellular sources of Shh as long as cells remained confluent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore developed a coculture paradigm in which whole retinal tissue was flat mounted onto the underside of a transwell insert, placing the retina in direct contact with a confluent monolayer of <italic>open-loop</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We initially tested the apical and basal surfaces of the E18.5 wild type retina because RGCs, the Shh-producing cells, are located at the basal surface and Shh signaling extends across the central to peripheral axis of the retina by this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sigulinsky et al., 2008</xref>). As anticipated, <italic>open-loop</italic> cells responded preferentially when in contact with the basal retinal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Taken together, our observations show that this reporter system can be used to assess the bioavailability of endogenous Shh in the intact retina especially when the <italic>open-loop</italic> cells are in direct apposition to the basal retinal surface.</p><p>If reduced signaling was not due to impaired Shh activity or availability, then <italic>open-loop</italic> cells should respond similarly to CKO retinas compared to control. This response could be reflected in the number of mCitrine + cells, the expression levels of mCitrine, or in the kinetics of mCitrine accumulation. Tamoxifen was administered at E11.5, retinas were harvested at E15.5, placed onto confluent <italic>open-loop</italic> cells with the retinal basal surface in direct contact, and longitudinally imaged at 24 hr intervals by widefield epifluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; single channel and bright field images for representative co-cultures are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). mCitrine expression was not observed at the start of the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, top row), but was readily apparent in <italic>open-loop</italic> cells cocultured with control (n=10) or CKO (n=13) retinas by 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, bottom row). mCitrine expression was Shh dependent, revealed by the reduction in mCitrine + <italic>open</italic> loop cells when the 5E1 antibody was added to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, n=2 explants). Using representative explants for each condition, the accumulation and fluorescence intensities of mCitrine + cells were plotted over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In general, the behavior of the <italic>open-loop</italic> cells exhibited similar temporal characteristics, but CKO explants supported the highest number of mCitrine + cells at 96 hr, and the accumulation of mCitrine + cells in the presence of 5E1 was notably reduced. Quantification of the total number of mCitrine + cells per explant area revealed that Ctrl and CKO explants promoted similar numbers of mCitrine + cells at 48 hr and 72 hr, but more mCitrine + cells were associated with the CKO retina at 96 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This higher number of mCitrine + cells could be due to a higher concentration or bioavailability of Shh in the CKO (see discussion). On a per sample (n) basis, the averages of the mean Tfluorescence intensities of the <italic>open-loop</italic> cells were generally similar between Ctrl and CKO explants, indicating similar levels of signaling were achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Subtle but significant differences in fluorescence intensities were observed with the 5E1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), but these differences could have been due to stochastic variation in Ptch1 expression in this small cohort of <italic>open-loop</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In sum, these data reveal that Shh bioavailability is not compromised in the CKO retina and point to a cell-autonomous role for <italic>Lhx2</italic> in RPCs to promote Shh signaling during early retinal neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Modulating Smoothened activity ex vivo stimulates Shh signaling in Lhx2-deficient RPCs</title><p>We next asked if the reduced Shh signaling activity in the CKO retina was due to defective intracellular signal transduction.

Since the RPC gene <italic>Vsx2</italic> was still abundantly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left images), the drop in <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in the untreated control explants was not due to RPC loss but instead to a specific reduction in Shh signaling.

We also treated retinal explants with 20 nM Shh-N and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

As expected, retinal explants cultured without Shh-N exhibited a strong reduction in <italic>Gli1</italic> expression compared to its level at the start of the experiment (t=0), whereas 3 nM Shh-N was sufficient to maintain signaling, and 10 nM significantly enhanced signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Based on these observations, we tested the responsiveness of CKO and control explants at 0, 1, and 3 nM Shh-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). With all expression data normalized to the level of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in control explants at t=0 (solid circle, upper dashed orange line), we made several observations (statistics are listed for all comparisons in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). First, when compared to CKO explants at t=0 (closed triangle, lower dashed red line), <italic>Gli1</italic> expression decreased in CKO explants cultured without Shh-N (0 nM Shh-N; open triangle,), revealing that endogenous Shh promotes a low level of signaling in the CKO retina. Second, <italic>Gli1</italic> expression dropped in control explants cultured without Shh-N (open circle, 0 nM Shh-N) to the same level as the CKO retina at t=0 (closed triangle, lower dashed red line). This is consistent with the low level of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in the vehicle treated control explants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>. Third, CKO and control explants exhibited a similar response profile to Shh-N from 0 to 1 nM, but CKO explants exhibited a reduced response from 1 to 3 nM.

Direct analysis of the requirements for <italic>Gas1</italic> in RPCs through conditional inactivation could help to clarify this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Lhx2 deficiency reveals potential differences in RPC receptivity to endogenous and recombinant Shh-N</title><p>Given the importance of the co-receptors in pathway activation, the upregulation of <italic>Gli1</italic> in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO explants treated with recombinant Shh-N was unexpected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). One possibility is residual co-receptor activity after <italic>Lhx2</italic> inactivation. Indeed, <italic>Cdon</italic> (mRNA and protein) and <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA expression persisted in the dorsal retina for a few days after tamoxifen treatment, albeit in disrupted (<italic>Cdon</italic>) and diminished (<italic>Gli1</italic>) patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). However, 20 nM Shh-N treatment induced <italic>Gli1</italic> across the CKO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and although we did not track the axial orientation of the explants, this continuous pattern was consistently observed, making it unlikely that we were only sampling dorsal retina.</p><p>Another possibility is that recombinant Shh-N bypassed the requirement for co-receptors in pathway activation. Supporting this, Ptch1 and Shh-N can form ternary complexes (Ptch1:Shh-N:Ptch1) that are capable of promoting signaling although with lower efficiency compared to complexes containing coreceptors (i.e. Cdon:Shh-N:Ptch1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beachy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qi and Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qi et al., 2018</xref>). Another consideration is that endogenous Shh is post-translationally lipidated with cholesterol and palmitoyl moieties, key adducts for efficient signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manikowski et al., 2018</xref>). Following secretion by Shh-producing cells, endogenous Shh is kept soluble while in transit to responding cells by forming a ‘lipid-shielding’ complex with SCUBE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tukachinsky et al., 2012</xref>). The Shh:Scube2 complex initially forms a ternary complex with Cdon or Boc on the responding cell. The Shh:Scube2 complex is then transferred to Gas1, which releases Shh from Scube2 and allows Ptch1 to bind Shh to initiate signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wierbowski et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the recombinant Shh-N used here is not lipid modified and is soluble in its native form. It can directly bind Ptch1, obviating the need for Gas1 to disengage Shh-N from a complex with Scube. In the context of the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retina, then, endogenous Shh could have been rendered less efficient than recombinant Shh-N because of the differential requirement for the co-receptors to receive endogenous Shh and remove Scube.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Lhx2 regulates multiple pathway components to achieve the optimal level of signaling</title><p>Since <italic>Cdon</italic> and <italic>Gas1</italic> are downregulated in the retina by E14.5 but Shh signaling persists, <italic>Lhx2</italic> regulation of their expression is only relevant for pathway activation. However, <italic>Lhx2</italic> inactivation at E14.5 also reduced pathway activity. It’s possible that <italic>Lhx2</italic> regulates another co-receptor such as <italic>Lrp2</italic> to sustain Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) but this is unlikely since the <italic>Lrp2</italic> CKO retina does not have a phenotype at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cases et al., 2015</xref>). Rather, we propose that the role for <italic>Lhx2</italic> in sustained signaling is co-receptor independent and through regulation of other cell intrinsic pathway components. Our data does not support the existence of a single, essential pathway component that is under strong <italic>Lhx2</italic> regulation, but instead suggests that <italic>Lhx2</italic> exerts a more subtle regulation of multiple pathway components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), and we identified <italic>Smo</italic>, <italic>Gli2</italic>, and <italic>Gli1</italic> as candidate Lhx2-dependent genes. Genetic reductions in <italic>Smo</italic> or <italic>Gli2</italic> on their own do not exhibit haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakagami et al., 2009</xref>), but their combined reduced expression could result in pathway sensitization that if strong enough, could cause a synthetic haploinsufficiency. Supporting this, <italic>Gli2</italic> heterozygous mice are phenotypically normal, but exhibit greater teratogenic sensitivity to vesmodegib, a small molecule Smo inhibitor, as compared to their wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heyne et al., 2016</xref>). If the reductions in <italic>Smo</italic> and <italic>Gli2</italic> expression were still not sufficient to reduce signaling, additional changes in other pathway components such as <italic>Gli1</italic> could have shifted the balance. Although we did not uncover evidence of Lhx2 binding in or near the <italic>Gli1</italic> locus, it is possible that <italic>Lhx2</italic> exerts some control over <italic>Gli1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Importantly, an interaction of this nature would have to be context specific since <italic>Gli1</italic> inactivation, on its own, has minimal effect on development and expression of Shh target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furimsky and Wallace, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McNeill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wall et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, subtle, or partial regulation of multiple pathway genes by Lhx2 could confer optimal levels of signaling, first during activation in conjunction with strong regulatory input to the coreceptors, and during sustained signaling, after co-receptor downregulation. This could be especially important in the retina where <italic>Shh</italic> expression is comparatively lower than in other tissues but exhibits a qualitatively similar level of <italic>Gli1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sigulinsky et al., 2021</xref>). Related to this, it was interesting that there were more mCitrine + <italic>open</italic> loop cells in cocultures with <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO explants than control after 96 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) indicative of an increase in ligand-mediated signaling. This difference could reflect an increase in ligand availability in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO explants secondary to a reduction in co-receptor-dependent ligand internalization in the Lhx2-deficient RPCs or increased RGC production. It is also possible that the physical interface between the CKO retina and <italic>open-loop</italic> cells was more permissive to Shh signaling.</p><p>In sum, we propose that <italic>Lhx2</italic> regulates the expression of multiple pathway components required for optimal Shh signaling in RPCs, both during and after pathway activation. Although <italic>Lhx2</italic> does not regulate Shh availability at a functional level, it does limit the production of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>). Because RGCs are the primary source of retinal Shh, <italic>Lhx2</italic> acts in an indirect but semi-autonomous manner to limit Shh expression in the retina. Furthermore, since <italic>Lhx2</italic> is an essential RPC transcription factor, it also likely acts to link Shh signaling to downstream targets as suggested by the persistent phenotypic severity of the <italic>Ptch1</italic>, <italic>Lhx2</italic> dCKO retina. Through this molecular and cellular circuitry, Shh signaling is tailored by <italic>Lhx2</italic> to meet the demands of early retina formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Lhx2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID:16870</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Lhx2<sup>flox</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">in lab &gt;5 yr;

Features (i.e., genes) were removed that contained 0 counts across all samples or when fewer than three samples had normalized counts greater than or equal to 20. Analyses of gene set overrepresentation and activity state prediction (ASP) was done with the Canonical Pathways (CP) tool in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis package (IPA; Qiagen). The analysis was performed on the cohort of DEGs with an FDR cutoff of 0.001 or smaller with the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (genes only) used as the reference. Gene set overrepresentation was determined with the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test with the -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) of 1.3 or larger considered significant. The <italic>gene expression ratio</italic> is the fraction of pathway genes from the reference set (Ingenuity Knowledge Base) that were identified in the analyzed DEG set.

Lhx2-associated genes were then analyzed for gene set overrepresentation with the KEGG database as the reference, using the enrichKEGG function in clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). For ATAC-seq peak calling, the -j option was used to set up Generich in ATAC mode. A consensus list of peaks was generated by merging all the ATAC peaks sets and filtering peaks that were reproducible in at least two samples. DESeq2 was used to identify differential accessible chromatin regions (DARs) between wildtype and Lhx2 CKO ATAC datasets from the consensus peak list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Two criteria were used to associate Shh pathway genes with Lhx2 binding and DARs: ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq peaks were located within introns or 10 kb of the intergenic regions upstream or downstream of the gene body, or the assigned gene was the closest gene to the peaks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR)</title><p>Relative changes in gene expression were determined with the delta-delta-Ct method (DDCt). <italic>Gapdh</italic> served as the internal control gene for the initial normalization (DCt values).

The insert was turned over and placed into a well of a 24-well plate containing a confluent monolayer of NIH3T3 open-loop responder cells. Contact between the basal surface of the retina and the cell monolayer was achieved by removing the filter insert support legs and applying gentle manual pressure to the insert for approximately 4 s.

Potential daily variations in illumination and sample background fluorescence were managed with post capture background subtraction (see next paragraph).</p><p>Image processing and quantification were done with ImageJ (version 2.1.0). In brief, images were processed to obtain regions of interest (ROI) masks for identification of mCitrine + objects (nuclei). All images were first processed with background subtraction (rolling ball algorithm) and bit depth conversion from 14 to 8 prior to mask generation and measurement. Masks were then generated through thresholding, binarization, and watershedding. Masks were then applied to their respective images for object counts and pixel intensity calculations (average mean intensity per object, sum of integrated densities sum of the products of mean pixel intensities for each object by the area of each object (mean pixels x µm<sup>2</sup>)). Objects smaller than 90 µm<sup>2</sup>, an empirically estimated measure of a nucleus, were excluded. Objects that passed this filter were retained for quantification and considered to represent cells based on 1 nucleus/cell and designated as such. Objects with larger areas were attributed to overlapping mCitrine + nuclei. These larger objects were also retained for analysis since their exclusion would exacerbate underrepresentation of cell counts and fluorescence intensities in the conditions with the highest number and brightest objects. Some inflation of fluorescence intensity was likely due to overlapping nuclei although the use of average mean intensities per object as a measure should have substantially reduced the impact of this confounding variable.</p><p>Graphing and hypothesis testing were done with Microsoft Excel (version 16.43) and GraphPad Prism (version 9.0).

In germline Lhx2 mutants, morphogenesis arrests at the optic vesicle stage.</p><p>All paracrine signals have two parts - the sending and responding cells. In this study, Li, Gordon et al. explore how neural progenitors acquire the competence to receive and transduce sonic hedgehog signals - via expression of coreceptors and other pathway components, regulated in large part by Lhx2.</p><p>They deeply explore the mechanism of Lhx2 action in RPCs. They offer plausible explanations for the phenotypic similarity between Lhx2 and Shh retinal CKO (conditional knockout) mice. To test their central hypothesis - that Lhx2 confers RPCs with enhanced competence to respond to Shh signaling by positively regulating expression of Gas1 and Cdon coreceptors - they push and pull the Shh pathway at multiple levels. They employ informative mutants, Hes1-CreERT temporal loss-of-function mice (to delete Lhx2 in all RPCs at the onset of histogenesis, from embryonic day E11.5), pharmacological treatment (N-Shh, PMA agonist), bypass experiments, and creative bioassays (e. g. retinal explant cocultures with apposed open-loop NIH3T3 fluorescent Shh reporter cells). They assess molecular effects of Lhx2 deletion on mRNA (bulk RNA-seq, qPCR) and protein abundance, chromatin accessibility, and informative reporter expression (e. g. Gli1-lacZ knock-in allele) and evaluate Lhx2 genomic targets (ChIP-seq). The various data converge. The authors apply standard pathway logic (molecular epistasis) to define the major steps and general mechanisms through which Lhx2 modulates Shh signaling.</p><p>The results are complicated and do not fully explain all phenotypes. Lhx2 is neither necessary nor sufficient for Shh action. Signaling is attenuated but not eliminated in mutant RPCs. Despite this complexity, the study advances understanding and provides a basis to explore how signaling pathways are integrated and finely tuned.</p><p>1. The initial data are presented in a confusing order. After noting similarity between Lhx2 and Shh retinal CKO phenotypes, the authors show in situ hybridization images (Fig 1) suggesting that Shh signaling (Gli1) - but not Shh ligand - is downregulated in Lhx2 CKO retina. This is the major premise for the study - and title of the first Results section. However, the ISH data are not quantitative (or persuasive), and the CKO histological phenotype does not obviously differ from control at E14 ('cell type profiles' in line 132, a bit vague), so the manuscript does not start with a strong foundation. However, the Gli1 and Shh qPCR data (Fig 6B) are convincing and do support ISH findings - and should be presented early, before the Gli1 immunoblot (Fig 1C). Most readers will look for these quantitative mRNA data in Fig 1. They belong here, logically, since Gli1 is a well-established, sensitive readout of Shh signaling.</p><p>Likewise, the Lhx2 RNA-seq data in Fig. 2C-E are confusing. Knowing the structure of the conditional allele in advance, the authors should quantify mRNA isoform reads with WT (ex 1/2, 2/3 or 3/4 junctions), deleted (ex 1/2 junction) or unknown (reads lacking ex 1-3) splicing patterns separately, in their existing dataset. Rather than the simple schema in Fig 1E, they should show 6K WT and CKO reads aligned to the mm10 reference genome, along with the AUG and qPCR amplicon, and note whether deleted isoforms are predicted to undergo NMD and should thus have lower mRNA abundance a priori (in Methods or legend).</p><p>How much is Lhx2 mRNA downregulated within 48 hr of Tam treatment (line 130)? What are 'other' features in Fig 2B?</p><p>2. The bioinformatic rationale for exploring Lhx2 regulation of Shh pathway genes (Fig 3) is logical but presented in a jumbled way. Two orthogonal strategies are applied (three, including ATAC-seq) - and only one pathway (Hh) emerged with statistical significance in both. One approach (RNA-seq of dissected CKO retinas, with KEGG pathway topology analysis of DEGs) tests altered mRNA expression - direct and indirect regulation - whereas the ChiP-seq data (from flow-sorted wild-type RPCs in an earlier study, analyzed via clusterProfiler) tests Lhx2 chromatin occupancy - expected for direct regulation. The logic for this overlapping strategy is buried in the text, and obscured by interspersed panels in Fig 3, forcing the reader to carefully dissect the legend to understand what kind of (highly derived) data are presented. Label panels 3AB better so these methods are obvious.</p><p>3. The appositional explant assay is a compelling functional measure of bioactive Shh (Fig 5). Likewise, the Lhx2 and Ptch1 CKO and dCKO data (Fig 7) are creative and instructive, showing that Lhx2 acts upstream but that Shh signaling remains intact (attenuated) in Lhx2 CKO RPCs.</p><p>However, the qPCR normalization (Fig 7A) does not make sense (to me) - each control value should be set to 1.0 +/- SE (or SD). There is a similar normalization concern in Fig 10 (lines 701 ff notwithstanding).</p><p>Does the increased abundance of Cyclin D1+ cells (Fig 7) reflect an increase in bioactive Shh mitogen (Fig 5B)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78342.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1: Figure 1 – Provide immunohistology of Lhx2 CKO phenotype at E15.5 in Figure 1, notably RGC and RPC markers.</p></disp-quote><p>Immunohistology data is now provided in Figure 1C.

We initially considered normalizing the mCitrine+ cell counts by retinal area but ultimately decided to normalize to the number of retinal explants per well (1 in all cases), arriving at the measure of <italic>reporter+ cells/explant</italic>. We believe this measure yields an accurate assessment of ligand availability, but we acknowledge that it doesn’t account for the potential variability in the amount of retinal tissue in each culture. Therefore, we went back and calculated the area of each explant and normalized the reporter+ cell counts to these values using the following measure: <italic>number of reporter+ cells/mm<sup>2</sup> of retinal explant</italic>. We then performed 2-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. When compared to the statistics of the measurements of <italic>reporter+ cells/explant</italic>, we generally obtained smaller p-values. Notably, two comparisons dropped below the 0.05 α value threshold: the CKO+5E1 condition versus the control condition at 72hr and 96hr. These outcomes lend even stronger support to our conclusions. We are happy to replace the existing data and statistics in Figure 5D pending agreement from the reviewer and/or editor. For now, the data is included as an additional Supplementary files for reviewer/editor consideration (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 11).</p><p>This change is now incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1: original Figure 8 (now Figure 9) – Lhx2 staining should be done to confirm that the reporter+ cells are not escapers.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the valid concern of potential escaper cells (Lhx2+ cells in the CKO retina) by performing electroporations with the pCIG plasmid (GFP expression only) into control and <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retinal explants (the original plan highlighted above). GFP+ cells were scored for co-expression of Lhx2 and b-Gal. As shown in Figure 8F, there were very few cells that co-expressed Lhx2 and b-Gal in the CKO retina, even though b-Gal could be detected in CKO explants electroporated with pCIG alone. The presence of b-Gal+ cells is not surprising since the culture medium contained Shh-N (3nM). This is the likely explanation for the b-Gal+ cells in the pCIG-electroporated CKO explants that were served as the control condition for the coreceptor overexpression experiment (Figure 8E, black bar; representative images are provided Figure 8-Supplementary Figure 1E). This data further supports our position that the increased proportion of b-Gal+ cells in the CKO retinal explants transfected with Cdon and Gas1 was due to Cdon and Gas1 overexpression and not persistence of Lhx2+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1: additional comments – The ﬁnding that a Lhx2 controls several components of the HH pathway could be relevant to Lhx2 activity in patterning of the cortex – I suggest to discuss the possible relevance of the ﬁndings to other organs.</p></disp-quote><p>In the introduction, we now provide a brief description of the multifunctional nature of Lhx2 in other organ systems, notably limb and hair follicle and refer the reader to the cerebral cortex as well as to a recent review of Lhx2 in multiple developmental contexts, to provide a stronger rationale for studying Lhx2 in different developmental contexts, including the retina.

It could be that the CKO retina has a higher ligand bioavailability because the coreceptor-deficient RPCs were not internalizing ligand. Another reason could be the shift toward increased RGC production resulting in more ligand. A more speculative possibility is that extracellular environment of the CKO retina enhanced the interaction with the <italic>open-loop</italic> responder cells was more permissive. Importantly, it supports our conclusion that endogenous Shh was available and biologically active in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retina. We provide this explanation in the discussion, section <italic>“Lhx2 regulates multiple pathway components to achieve the optimal level of signaling</italic>”, end of first paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 – Figure 6 C,D,E,F: Does Lhx2 CKO, cause cell death as the levels of vsx2 are low in vehicle in CKO (D,F) as compared to ctrl (C,E).</p></disp-quote><p>In Supplemental Figure 6, we show that cell death is enhanced in the RGC layer but not in the neuroblast layer where the RPCs are located, the cells that normally express Vsx2. The cell death pattern is observed in both wild type (control) and Lhx2 CKO retinas, and, as we describe in the results, is a known issue in embryonic retinal explant culture when cultured in suspension and lacking the addition of neurotrophic factors and cell death inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 – Figure 6: The levels of Gli1 are higher in CKO vehicle (D,F) than the control panel (C,E). This difference in Gli1 expression is more evident D versus C. Does it mean that CKO increases Gli1 expression in explants, which seems to be opposite of what shown in the ﬁrst results (Figure 1D, E).</p></disp-quote><p>The method used here for in situ hybridization is not sensitive enough to conclude that the expression levels of <italic>Gli1</italic> are different between the vehicle treated</p><p>Ctrl and CKO tissues. The method is suitable, however, for the robust, qualitative changes we observed for each treatment within a genotype. A better evaluation of a difference in <italic>Gli1</italic> expression in the CKO versus Ctrl is provided by qPCR in Figure 6G (0 nM SHH-N, 24hr timepoint), which shows the <italic>Gli1</italic> is lower in the CKO. This data is supported by statistical analysis (Supplemental Table 5 – Figure 6G – Tukey’s multiple comparisons test p&lt;0.0001 for 0nM CKO vs. 0nM CTL). In this regard, all our data are consistent with reduced Gli1 expression in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retina when no additional treatments are done. The reason why the vehicle treated Ctrl retinal explant has reduced <italic>Gli1</italic> expression after 24hr is because the suspension cultures and basal medium do not support continued Shh signaling without addition of ligand or agonist. This deficiency is what allows us to use the wild type retina as a positive control for purmorphamine and SHH-N activities in these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 – Figure 6: It is not clear why the increase in Gli1 expression with Shh-N (E,F) is not that much evident than with purmorphamine (C,D) in both control and CKO explants.</p></disp-quote><p>The SHH-N experiments and stainings were performed after the purmorphamine experiments, so each treatment should be considered independently of one another. Even if done together, it would be very difficult to compare the efficacy of SHH-N vs purmorphamine in this manner because their mechanisms of action are different: SHH-N acts through Ptch1 and purmorphamine bypasses Ptch1 and acts directly on Smo. Rather, our intent here was to ask: Can Shh signaling be stimulated in the CKO retinas with purmorphamine, and if so, with SHH-N?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 – Figure 7 7-F: The changes in the levels of Cyclin D1 and Hes1 in Ctrl/Lhx2 CKO/ dCKO are not very clear from the data in present form. It would be better to show the changes in their mRNA levels by qPCR analysis. Further, it is not clear how the changes in CyclinD1 and Hes1 levels are proving that Lhx2 acts downstream of Shh signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Cyclin D1 and Hes1 expression levels in RPCs are promoted by Shh signaling (Sakagami et al., 2009; Wall et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2005). Since the qPCR data in Figure 7A indicated increased Shh signaling in the dCKO, we anticipated some improvement in the phenotype compared to the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO but this was not observed (Figure 7B – E). Therefore, we propose that Lhx2 is also acting downstream of Shh signaling to drive retinal development, and this is in line with Lhx2 acting as a central RPC transcription factor. During our analysis, we observed an increase in Hes1 staining intensity in the dCKO and the graph in Figure 7F documents this. This suggests that Shh signaling, while not sufficient to restore the number of Hes1+ cells, could still be stimulating Hes1 expression in the RPCs that persist. We observed a similar effect with Cyclin D1, but in this case, the increased staining intensity was correlated with <italic>Lhx2</italic> inactivation (Figure 7D). Thus, at least one downstream target of Shh signaling (Hes1) supports the qPCR data in Figure 7A that <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation promoted Shh signaling in the absence of Lhx2 even though it wasn’t sufficient to improve retinal development.</p><p>With respect to Hes1 and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels, the RNA sequencing data shows them to be highly downregulated in the Lhx2 CKO (Supplemental Table 1), consistent with fewer expressing cells. In this light, we don’t believe the intensity increases observed by antibody staining in Figures 7C-E will be detected by qPCR, even if the changes in protein levels are tied to increased mRNA in the few cells that express Cyclin D1 and Hes1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of analyses that authors prefer not to carry out</p><p>Reviewer 1: related to Figure 2 – Perform GSEA analysis for the hedgehog pathway genes.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first submission, we provided a gene enrichment analysis of the RNA seq data using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) package from Qiagen, specifically the <italic>Canonical Pathways</italic> analysis. While IPA and GSEA use different statistical methods to identify gene set enrichments, both provide similar information and query overlapping gene set databases (e.g. GO, KEGG) although IPA also queries an in-house, actively curated information hub (Ingenuity Knowledge Base). An additional and useful feature of <italic>Canonical Pathways</italic> is its pathway topology feature, yielding a Z-score to predict the activity state of the signaling pathways. In the case of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, the Z-score predicted <italic>inhibition</italic> in the Lhx2 CKO retina, consistent with our other data.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, because our study deeply investigates the connection between Lhx2 and Shh pathway, our conclusion is not strongly dependent on the gene set enrichment to identify the Shh pathway as a pathway of interest, although we were encouraged by this observation. Our primary purpose for the RNA sequencing was to efficiently identify Shh pathway genes as candidate targets of Lhx2 based on their differential expression and their associated predicted effects on signaling. For these reasons, we don’t believe that GSEA will add additional information to the study than was already obtained with IPA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: Figure 1C – Western blots, tubulin is less in CKO alongside Gli1.

We are confident in the accuracy of the western blot data as it is consistent with all other measures of Gli1 expression (in situ hybridization, RNA sequencing, qPCR, <italic>Gli1<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> reporter), but it can be removed if deemed necessary. Its removal shouldn’t weaken the findings of the study given the abundance of other evidence showing reduced Gli1 expression in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: “Authors do not seem to have performed a rescue experiment with Lhx2 CKO. If this is absolutely not possible, a conditional overexpression could have given conﬁrmatory clues on the Lhx CKO phenotype discussed. In any case some sort of rescue experiments are essential with respect to Lhx2 as done with Cdon and Gas1.”</p></disp-quote><p>We believe 2 questions are being asked by the reviewer’s suggestion to re-express Lhx2 following <italic>Lhx2</italic> inactivation: Are the changes in retinal development caused by <italic>Lhx2</italic> reversible? And if so, for how long? These are indeed interesting questions but addressing them would require a full study to assess cellular phenotypes, chromatin, or effects on signaling. It’s also unclear how this line of inquiry will provide further resolution to the questions asked in this study: Does Lhx2 interact with the Shh pathway, and if so, how? Even if an argument could be made that this line of inquiry is relevant to the current study, there are significant challenges with feasibility. Electroporation and the ex vivo culture platform has technical limitations for assessing cell and tissue level phenotypes over extended intervals, and while an inducible <italic>Lhx2</italic> transgenic mouse is published (Z/Lhx2-GFP; (Hägglund et al., 2011)), this transgene, like the <italic>Lhx2<sup>flox</sup></italic> allele, is Cre-dependent. We therefore don’t have the ability to generate temporal windows of Lhx2 deficiency since the <italic>Lhx2<sup>flox</sup></italic> allele and the <italic>Z/Lhx2-GFP</italic> transgene would be recombined at the same time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: Figure 6 – Gli1 readout at higher ShhN concentrations would shed light on the roles of co-receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer is suggesting the following: if the <italic>Gli1</italic> response in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retina remains attenuated at a high Shh-N concentration (20 nM, Figure 6F), then this would support the idea that the role of the co-receptors is to lower the ‘effective concentration’ of ligand needed to activate the pathway. This might be true, but we also point out that an equivalent response to 20 nM Shh-N between control and <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retinas would not negate the co-receptor model because the high ligand concentration could override the mechanisms that function at physiological concentrations. That was the basis for the dose response (Suppl Figure 6C) − To identify a concentration range that approximates physiological conditions and to use this range to make quantitative measurements (Figure 6G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following responses refer to the coreceptor overexpression experiments</p><p>Reviewer 1: Gas1 is confined to the peripheral RPCs and ciliary margin. Explain why Cdon and Gas1 were co-electroporated and the outcome of electroporating only Cdon.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that electroporating the coreceptors individually is sensible and could shed light on potential differences on how the coreceptors are utilized for Shh signaling. This was not our question, however, and we had to consider the factors described below, which ultimately led us to combined coreceptor electroporation.</p><p>– The frequency of generating an <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO embryo with the <italic>Gli1<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> reporter is 1 in 8. This very low yield required us to generate a high number of embryos for the control electroporation (GFP alone) and the combined coreceptor test condition. Adding in the single coreceptor overexpression conditions would have tripled the number of mice needed, adding considerable effort and cost to the experiment. This was difficult to justify for the intended goal of the experiment, which is described in the next bullet point.</p><p>–The intent of this experiment was to address the following question: Is the pathway downstream of the co-receptors sufficiently intact to support coreceptor-mediated activation? If true, this would add another piece of evidence that Lhx2 mediates at least some of its effect on the pathway by promoting co-receptor expression. Combining the coreceptors was the most efficient way to test this.</p><p>– In the discussion, we describe a recent study showing that Cdon and Gas1 can work cooperatively (Wierbowski et al., 2020). Considering this, it’s possible that single coreceptor electroporation would not stimulate expression of the <italic>Gli1<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> reporter. Importantly, this wouldn’t change our stated conclusion. It could suggest that Gas1 has a role in central RPCs, and based on our expression data, at a lower level of expression than in peripheral RPCs and ciliary margin. This would be interesting, but would require significant follow up experiments, which would extend the work beyond the focus of the interaction between Lhx2 and the Shh pathway.</p><p>– Addressing coreceptor requirements is best done by loss of function. Cdon was already shown to be required for retinal Shh signaling (Kahn et al., 2017). The requirement for Gas1 in this context is not known because the earlier phenotype in the germline <italic>Gas1</italic> KO precludes this model from being used for this purpose. To our knowledge, this has not been examined with an inducible <italic>Gas1<sup>flox</sup></italic> allele. These points were stated in the original submission and found in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1: The outcome of electroporating the coreceptors in the control retina should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer is referring to the wild type/<italic>Lhx2</italic> heterozygous retina as the control retina. For the following reasons, we believe that performing these experiments in the wild type context is not easily interpretable and that the wild type retina does not meet the definition of a control in this set of experiments.</p><p>– In the control (wild type/<italic>Lhx2</italic> het) retina, Shh signaling is already active and the co-receptors are downregulated by E13.5 (Figure 8A, Suppl. Figure 8). This rapid downregulation of coreceptor expression following Shh pathway activation is also observed in other tissues and is interpreted to mean that coreceptors are not required for maintained signaling (Lee et al., 2001; Tenzen et al., 2006). Thus, the context of the wild type retina is different than the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retina at the start of the culture period. Because of this, the wild type does not serve as a control in these experiments. Rather, the empty vector (GFP only) in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retina is the relevant control since the underlying genetic context is the same.</p><p>– While it could be argued that starting the cultures earlier would make the wild type a more relevant condition to function as a control, the experiment would have to be initiated prior to Shh signaling activation. This is not possible, however, because the culture would have to be initiated prior to E11.5, which is when tamoxifen is administered. Earlier tamoxifen treatment is confounded by the developmental arrest of eye development due to Lhx2 inactivation at a sufficiently earlier stage such as E9.5. This reasoning is further confounded by the issue that the Gas1 and Cdon are expressed at these earlier stages, which again suggests that wild type context is different than the Lhx2 CKO. Based on these considerations, we argue that the experimental design used is the most relevant and interpretable for the question being asked.</p><p>– Another consideration is that 3 nM Shh-N was added to the medium in these experiments to compensate for the loss of the Shh producing cells in the suspension culture paradigm (Suppl. Figure 6). This maintains Shh signaling in the wild type retina (Figure 6G), which could mask any potential positive effects of coreceptor overexpression.</p><p>– Finally, like many other reporters, β-Galactosidase (βGal) protein is not rapidly downregulated, and this is problematic for conditions where the reporter is already expressed at the start of the experiment, which is the case in the wild type retina. Even if βGal expression dropped below detectable levels within 24 hr of the start of the experiment, its basal level might still be higher than in the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO retinal explants, which again complicates the use of the wild type retina for the coreceptor electroporations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: Cdon and Gas1 overexpression in the following contexts: wild type, Ptch1CKO, PMA/ShhN exposure, ex vivo culture. Alternatively, an ex vivo or in vitro approach using cultured cells may also prove worthy to prove this point.</p></disp-quote><p>To respond to the suggestions made here, we consider each context individually.</p><p>– Wild type: This is equivalent to the control retina condition suggested by Reviewer 1 and was discussed above.</p><p>– <italic>Ptch1</italic> CKO: <italic>Ptch1</italic> inactivation autonomously activates and stimulates the pathway, which is the same direction observed with coreceptor overexpression. Since the co-receptors act directly upstream of Ptch1 as part of the mechanism to present Shh ligand to Ptch1, it could be difficult to observe additional stimulation of the pathway because of epistasis and/or because the pathway is already overstimulated due to Ptch1 inactivation.</p><p>– Purmorphamine exposure: Purmorphamine acts directly on Smoothened to stimulate Shh signaling and purmorphamine stimulation is ligand independent. In contrast, coreceptor mediated stimulation of Shh signaling is ligand dependent and functions upstream of Smoothened (and Ptch1). Purmorphamine would therefore mask any stimulatory effects of the co-receptors on the pathway if combined into a single condition.</p><p>– Shh-N exposure: This condition was done in our study. As mentioned above, 3 nM Shh-N was used in the coreceptor electroporation experiments (Figure 8C-E). The coreceptors require ligand to activate the pathway and adding Shh-N to the culture medium was necessary to compensate for the loss of the Shh producing retinal ganglion cells during the culture.</p><p>References</p><p>Allen, B.

The additional comments points to additional details of the manuscript that need your attention.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The Lhx2 LIM homeodomain transcription factor plays multiple key roles in vertebrate eye development - specifying regions of the eye field, patterning the optic cup, maintaining the pool of mitotic retinal progenitor cells (RPC), modulating retinal cell fate determination (histogenesis), and integrating signaling pathways. In germline Lhx2 mutants, morphogenesis arrests at the optic vesicle stage.</p><p>All paracrine signals have two parts - the sending and responding cells. In this study, Li, Gordon et al. explore how neural progenitors acquire the competence to receive and transduce sonic hedgehog signals - via expression of coreceptors and other pathway components, regulated in large part by Lhx2.</p><p>They deeply explore the mechanism of Lhx2 action in RPCs. They offer plausible explanations for the phenotypic similarity between Lhx2 and Shh retinal CKO (conditional knockout) mice. To test their central hypothesis - that Lhx2 confers RPCs with enhanced competence to respond to Shh signaling by positively regulating expression of Gas1 and Cdon coreceptors - they push and pull the Shh pathway at multiple levels. They employ informative mutants, Hes1-CreERT temporal loss-of-function mice (to delete Lhx2 in all RPCs at the onset of histogenesis, from embryonic day E11.5), pharmacological treatment (N-Shh, PMA agonist), bypass experiments, and creative bioassays (e. g. retinal explant cocultures with apposed open-loop NIH3T3 fluorescent Shh reporter cells). They assess molecular effects of Lhx2 deletion on mRNA (bulk RNA-seq, qPCR) and protein abundance, chromatin accessibility, and informative reporter expression (e. g. Gli1-lacZ knock-in allele) and evaluate Lhx2 genomic targets (ChIP-seq). The various data converge. The authors apply standard pathway logic (molecular epistasis) to define the major steps and general mechanisms through which Lhx2 modulates Shh signaling.</p><p>The results are complicated and do not fully explain all phenotypes. Lhx2 is neither necessary nor sufficient for Shh action. Signaling is attenuated but not eliminated in mutant RPCs. Despite this complexity, the study advances understanding and provides a basis to explore how signaling pathways are integrated and finely tuned.</p><p>1. The initial data are presented in a confusing order. After noting similarity between Lhx2 and Shh retinal CKO phenotypes, the authors show in situ hybridization images (Fig 1) suggesting that Shh signaling (Gli1) - but not Shh ligand - is downregulated in Lhx2 CKO retina. This is the major premise for the study - and title of the first Results section. However, the ISH data are not quantitative (or persuasive), and the CKO histological phenotype does not obviously differ from control at E14 ('cell type profiles' in line 132, a bit vague), so the manuscript does not start with a strong foundation. However, the Gli1 and Shh qPCR data (Fig 6B) are convincing and do support ISH findings - and should be presented early, before the Gli1 immunoblot (Fig 1C). Most readers will look for these quantitative mRNA data in Fig 1. They belong here, logically, since Gli1 is a well-established, sensitive readout of Shh signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the qPCR data for <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic> expression in Fig. 6B is now located in Fig.1G.</p><p>We also included an immunohistological comparison of the proliferation markers PCNA and EdU, and Lhx2 from E15.5 <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO and Ctrl embryos (Fig. 1C). This data shows the persistence of RPCs, lending support to the argument that Gli1 levels are not reduced because of a lack of RPCs at this age. We also provided a more specific description of this histological feature than originally provided per the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><p>Additional related changes:</p><p>Although the reviewer suggested the qPCR data be provided before the ISH data, we found the logic flow to be difficult and these data are provided after the ISH data, along with qPCR data showing that <italic>Lhx2</italic> mRNA is downregulated within 48 hr of tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 1H), a requested control to establish the timing of <italic>Lhx2</italic> inactivation.</p><p>The original Supplemental Fig. 1 in situ hybridizations for <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Shh</italic> at E16.5 following tamoxifen treatment at E12.5 was removed because it was redundant with information provided in Supplemental Fig. 8A. The current Supplemental Fig. 1 contains images showing eye size and marker expression comparisons between the <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO and controls at E15.5 in support of the new phenotype data provided in Fig. 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, the Lhx2 RNA-seq data in Fig. 2C-E are confusing. Knowing the structure of the conditional allele in advance, the authors should quantify mRNA isoform reads with WT (ex 1/2, 2/3 or 3/4 junctions), deleted (ex 1/2 junction) or unknown (reads lacking ex 1-3) splicing patterns separately, in their existing dataset. Rather than the simple schema in Fig 1E, they should show 6K WT and CKO reads aligned to the mm10 reference genome, along with the AUG and qPCR amplicon, and note whether deleted isoforms are predicted to undergo NMD and should thus have lower mRNA abundance a priori (in Methods or legend).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide coverage plots (Fig. 2 E) showing the merged read counts for all <italic>Lhx2</italic> CKO and control samples mapped to the Lhx2 locus. We did not map exon junctions to assess isoform combinations, but the data clearly show that all exons except for exons 2 and 3 are expressed at similar levels in the CKO and control, suggesting that NMD is not occurring. This is now mentioned in the legend of Fig. 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How much is Lhx2 mRNA downregulated within 48 hr of Tam treatment (line 130)? What are 'other' features in Fig 2B?</p></disp-quote><p>Lhx2 mRNA downregulation within 48 hr of tamoxifen treatment is shown by qPCR in Fig. 1H.</p><p>Other features are rare transcript biotypes from MGI such as <italic>pseudogenes</italic>, <italic>processed transcripts, antisense RNAs, TEC RNAs.</italic> This is now explained in the results and Fig. 2B with ‘pseudogenes’ as an example.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The bioinformatic rationale for exploring Lhx2 regulation of Shh pathway genes (Fig 3) is logical but presented in a jumbled way. Two orthogonal strategies are applied (three, including ATAC-seq) - and only one pathway (Hh) emerged with statistical significance in both. One approach (RNA-seq of dissected CKO retinas, with KEGG pathway topology analysis of DEGs) tests altered mRNA expression - direct and indirect regulation - whereas the ChiP-seq data (from flow-sorted wild-type RPCs in an earlier study, analyzed via clusterProfiler) tests Lhx2 chromatin occupancy - expected for direct regulation. The logic for this overlapping strategy is buried in the text, and obscured by interspersed panels in Fig 3, forcing the reader to carefully dissect the legend to understand what kind of (highly derived) data are presented. Label panels 3AB better so these methods are obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the concerns raised here as well as in minor comments 3-6, we did a major revision for this section (Results/Lhx2 inactivation alters the expression of multiple Shh pathway components). We also revised the Methods/Bioinformatics/<italic>RNA-seq data analysis</italic> section, Figure 3, and Figure 3 legend. Listed below are specific issues and changes made:</p><p>– The text was rewritten to better clarify the orthogonal comparisons at the levels of pathways and individual genes. The volcano plot was moved to Figure 2.</p><p>– More detailed explanations of the underlying statistics for all bioinformatics analyses were moved into the <italic>Bioinformatics</italic> subsection of the Methods.</p><p>– Methodological information was moved from the results to the methods.</p><p>– We adopted terms to better highlight the meaning of the statistical values in the text and Figure 3A and B. They are defined at first use.</p><p>ASP score: Activity State Prediction score - equivalent to the ‘Z-score of Activation’ from CP.</p><p>DEG ratio (Fig. 3A; right y-axis): Defined in text, figure, and legend.</p><p>Bound gene ratio (Fig. 3B; right y-axis): Defined in text, figure, and legend.</p><p>– Panels Fig 3A and B were more comprehensively labeled and incorporated the new terms above. The layout of the panels was modified to provide a more uniform appearance for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The appositional explant assay is a compelling functional measure of bioactive Shh (Fig 5). Likewise, the Lhx2 and Ptch1 CKO and dCKO data (Fig 7) are creative and instructive, showing that Lhx2 acts upstream but that Shh signaling remains intact (attenuated) in Lhx2 CKO RPCs.</p><p>However, the qPCR normalization (Fig 7A) does not make sense (to me) - each control value should be set to 1.0 +/- SE (or SD). There is a similar normalization concern in Fig 10 (lines 701 ff notwithstanding).</p></disp-quote><p>The mean for the control values vary from 1.0 for Figs. 7A and 10 because a single control sample was designated as a reference sample that was repeatedly used on separate runs and all samples were normalized to this reference. We took this approach to account for batch effects that could arise due to samples being run on different plates and/or days, which was necessary to collect the qPCR data in Figs. 7A and 10. This information is now provided in the qPCR method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the increased abundance of Cyclin D1+ cells (Fig 7) reflect an increase in bioactive Shh mitogen (Fig 5B)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer is referring to the increased fluorescence intensities of Cyclin D1+ cells in the mutants rather than the cell population abundance, which is lower in the mutants (Fig. 7C, D). This question is interesting because the increase in Cyclin D1 levels seems counterintuitive to a reduction in proliferation. It could reflect enhanced mitogenic signaling, or it could reflect a cell autonomous change in Cyclin D1 regulation. The implication of this observation could be a compensatory mechanism that sustains proliferation in the absence of Lhx2. Further work would be needed to understand its potential functional significance and mechanism(s) causing this effect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
