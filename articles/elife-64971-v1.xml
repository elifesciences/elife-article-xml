different continents, natural selection increased the presence of alleles advantageous in the new environments. Heritable variations that alter the susceptibility to diseases vary with the historical period, the virulence of the infections, and their geographical spread. In this study we built polygenic scores for heritable traits that influence the genetic adaptation in the production of cytokines and immune-mediated disorders, including infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, and applied them to the genomes of several ancient European populations. We observed that the advent of the Neolithic was a turning point for immune-mediated traits in Europeans, favoring those alleles linked with the development of tolerance against intracellular pathogens and promoting inflammatory responses against extracellular microbes. These evolutionary patterns are also associated with an increased presence of traits related to inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>neolithic</kwd><kwd>disease</kwd><kwd>immune system</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>833247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>948207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09150161910024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domínguez-Andrés</surname><given-names>Jorge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Spinoza</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Netea</surname><given-names>Mihai G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006209</institution-id><institution>Radboud University Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hypatia Grant (2018)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09150161910024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domínguez-Andrés</surname><given-names>Jorge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>MINECO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-110933GB-I00 (AEI/FEDER UE)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertranpetit</surname><given-names>Jaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neolithic was a turning point for immune responses in Europeans, favoring tolerance against intracellular pathogens, promoting inflammation against extracellular microbes, and being related to current auto-immune diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human history has been shaped by infectious diseases. Human genes, especially host defense genes, have been constantly influenced by the pathogens encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fumagalli and Sironi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karlsson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Quintana-Murci and Clark, 2013</xref>). Pathogens drive the selection of genetic variants affecting resistance or tolerance to the infection, and heritable variations that increase survival to diseases with high morbidity and mortality will be naturally selected in people before reproductive age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karlsson et al., 2014</xref>). These selection signatures vary with historical period, virulence of the pathogen, and the geographical spread.</p><p>Here we investigated the historical evolutionary patterns leading to genetic adaptation in cytokine production and immune-mediated diseases, including infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. Cytokine production capacity is a key component of the host defense mechanisms: it induces inflammation, activates phagocytes to eliminate the pathogens and present antigens, and controls induction of T-helper (Th) adaptive immune responses. We have therefore chosen to investigate the evolutionary trajectories of cytokine production capacity in modern human populations during history. To determine the difference in polygenic regulation of diseases and cytokine production capacity, we used data derived from the 500 Functional Genomics (500FG) cohort of the Human Functional Genomics Project (HFGP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org">http://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org</ext-link>). The HFGP is an international collaboration aiming to identify the host and environmental factors responsible for the variability of human immune responses in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). Within the HFGP project, the 500FG study generated a large database of immunological, phenotypic, and multi-omics data from a cohort of 534 individuals of Western-European ancestry, which has been used to integrate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on cytokine production and immune parameters. We subsequently deciphered the factors that influence inter-individual variations in the immune responses against different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schirmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ter Horst et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these individuals were challenged with bacterial, fungal, viral, and non-microbial stimuli, and six cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and interferon (IFN)γ) were measured at 24 hr or 7 days after stimulation, generating 105 cytokine-stimulation pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The stimulation time intervals were chosen based on extensive studies that showed that the time points used were best suited for assessing monocyte-derived and lymphocyte-derived cytokines per stimulus. Not all the stimuli induce the production of all cytokines; so the selection of the cytokine-stimulus pairs was performed for those pairs for which cytokine production was measurable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruschen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schirmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ter Horst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van de Veerdonk et al., 2009</xref>). We correlated cytokine production with genetic variant data to obtain cytokine quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which were employed to compute and compare the polygenic risk score (PRS) of the genomes of 827 individuals from different human historical eras (early upper Paleolithic, late upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, post-Neolithic), which were downloaded from version 37.2 of the compiled dataset containing unimputed published ancient genotypes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data-compiled-published-papers">https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data-compiled-published-papers</ext-link>) and 250 modern Europeans randomly selected from the European 1000G cohort. The individuals in this cohort present a similar genetic background (Western-European ancestry) and balanced characteristics in terms of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ter Horst et al., 2016</xref>), allowing us to represent the natural variability in the immune responses and minimizing the impact of the inter-individual variability in our results. In line with this, cytokines were measured in batches in which a certain cytokine was measured the same day for all the samples, in order to decrease the potential influence of technical variations. Intra-individual variation of cytokine production capacity was found to be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ter Horst et al., 2021</xref>,) while inter-individual variability was largely depedent on genetic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the PRS changes over time through constructing linear models and correlation analysis. In order to account for the ancient DNA (aDNA) samples being pseudo-haploid, ambiguous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (A/T and C/G) were excluded when computing PRS to prevent errors due to strand flips. PRS was computed using the most significant QTLs that had a p-value lower than our predetermined threshold for each given trait and removing all variants within a 250-kb window around these variants. Additional PRS models were calculated at varying window sizes (250, 500, 1000 kb) in order to show consistency in the direction of the trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The dosage of these variants was multiplied by their effect size while the dosage of missing variants in a sample was supplemented with the average dosage. Although replacing missing values with the population average does not skew the observed trends over time, it does affect the scale of the data. We opted for this approach, however, due to the scarcity of variants shared by all samples; we focused instead on consistent observations after excluding samples with higher missing genotype rates. Finally, we scaled the PRS to a range of −1 and 1 and correlated the scores of the samples with their respective carbon-dated ages. In order to verify the robustness of our results, we repeated the analysis at multiple threshold combinations for variant missingness and QTL thresholds.</p><p>We plotted locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) regression models to show the variations in PRS across time for each trait and highlight the time periods around which they drastically change. After plotting the changes before and after the Neolithic revolution at various thresholds for both the missing genotype rate in samples as well as QTL inclusion threshold, only traits that showed consistently significant trends in the same direction were chosen. Additional boxplots and t-tests show the variations in PRS between different pairings besides pre- and post-Neolithic samples. A schematic representation of the steps performed is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Lastly, we used a separate test to determine whether traits were under selective pressure between any two broad time periods using the trait-associated Wright’s fixation index (Fst). This test shows an increase in the number of traits under selective pressure after the start of the Neolithic and highlights the traits and points in time for which the observed trends in PRS can be partially attributed to selective pressure as opposed to drift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>Applying the methodology described above, several patterns were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The first overall observation is that the estimation of cytokine production capacity based on PRS shows significant differences between populations in various historical periods, and the strength of evolutionary pressure on cytokine responses was different before and after the Neolithic revolution. We did not observe significant changes in cytokine production capacity between individuals who lived in different historical periods before the Neolithic, whereas strong pressure is apparent after adoption of agriculture and animal domestication in Europe. This different pattern may have resulted from the more limited number of samples available for the older time periods, resulting in lower statistical power, but the presence of some evolutionary pressure also before the Neolithic argues that this is most likely not the full explanation. The development of agriculture and domestication of animals in the Neolithic increased population densities on the one hand and the contact between humans and domesticated animals as a source of pathogens on the other hand. The number of zoonoses increased dramatically (examples being tuberculosis, brucellosis, Q-fever, and influenza), which strongly increased the selective pressure and caused significant adaptations of immunity at the genetic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flandroy et al., 2018</xref>). Most of the genetic adaptations to pathogens took place in the period since modern humans abandoned their hunting-gathering lifestyle and developed agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deschamps et al., 2016</xref>). In this respect, the strongest changes leading to tolerance (decreased cytokine production) were exerted in the cytokine responses to intracellular zoonotic infections (tuberculosis and <italic>Coxiella</italic>). In contrast, responses to the extracellular pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> indicate increased resistance, with high production of IL-22 and TNFα, respectively. The increased response to the important fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic> after the Neolithic period is validated also at the transcriptional level. Overall, these patterns are reminiscent of the studies showing that human immune responses need to adapt to a new landscape of infectious agents depending on the geographical location and types of microbe encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferwerda et al., 2007</xref>). Such different patterns were most likely encountered also through history.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of PRS of cytokine response QTLs across time.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Polygenic risk score (PRS) models based on quantitative trait loci (QTLs) at a p-value threshold of 1e-5.

The resistance against intracellular pathogens increased after Neolithic with higher IFNγ responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>): indeed, it is known that Th1-IFNγ responses are crucial for the host defense against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria or <italic>Coxiella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thakur et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the resistance to the extracellular pathogens <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> is also increased after this Neolithic era, with TNFα and IFNγ production increasing steadily after. These two cytokines are very well known to be important for anti-<italic>Candida</italic> and anti-<italic>Staphylococcus</italic> host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MRSA Systems Immunobiology Group et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Domínguez-Andrés et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, a different pattern emerges in relation with the IL1β-IL6-IL17 axis: the production of these cytokines is seen decreasing after Neolithic (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). In this context, the decrease through time of poly I:C induction of cytokines, as a model of viral stimulation, is intriguing but potentially very important: many important viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) exert life-threatening effects through induction of cytokine-mediated hyperinflammation (also termed ‘cytokine storm’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tay et al., 2020</xref>); evolutionary processes to curtail these exaggerated responses are thus likely to be protective, and tolerance against viruses becomes a host defense mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diard and Hardt, 2017</xref>).</p><p>These evolutionary genetic adaptations to pathogens throughout human history greatly influence the way we respond to multiple diseases in modern times as well. To assess these effects, we calculated the PRS associated with the risk of several highly prevalent immune-mediated diseases. The first focus was on common infectious diseases such as malaria, human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS), tuberculosis, and chronic viral hepatitis; we calculated the changes in susceptibility to these diseases in the last 50,000 years of human history, based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) databases available from the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results show that humans are becoming more resistant to these diseases, with the notable exception of tuberculosis, whose risk score remained stable along the period studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Of note, the QTLs that passed our thresholds were scarce, resulting in a PRS model using a limited number of SNPs, making them sensitive to changes in the p-value cutoff, especially in traits related with infectious diseases. Our results suggest that humans have built up a genetic makeup that made them more resistant to a variety of microbes. The pattern of this adaptation is very interesting as well, with a suggested decrease of susceptibility to malaria especially in the last 10,000 years. The reason for this accelerated resistance after Neolithic might be linked to a higher disease prevalence due to increased population density, as otherwise <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are known to have circulated in Africa since at least the Paleogene 30 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Poinar, 2005</xref>), and we have likely inherited it from gorillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, we also observed a strong decrease in susceptibility to HIV: this is a contemporary pathogen, therefore this signal could be due to common genetic and immune pathways with other infections that were present in human populations. The increased resistance to HIV in Europeans may be derived from selective pressures induced by other pathogens such as <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duncan et al., 2005</xref>). Our data suggest, on the other hand, that the source of this increased resistance is even older.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Distribution of PRS of infectious diseases across time.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Polygenic risk score (PRS) models based on a p-value threshold of 1e-5.

This surprising finding may be explained by a concept in which <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is at the same time a pathogen and a symbiont, in which latent infection enhances the resistance against other pathogens, and this is why our immune system tolerates mycobacterial presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). In this regard, individuals with latent tuberculosis exhibit enhanced macrophage functions that may protect against other pathogens through the induction of trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joosten et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, humanity may not be adapting to tuberculosis because increased resistance against mycobacteria is not evolutionarily advantageous. All in all, these results suggest that the risk of suffering infectious diseases has steadily decreased at least for the last 50,000 years as a result of the selection of genetic variants that confer resistance to infections.</p><p>It has been proposed that the increased prevalence of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is associated with the immune-related alleles that have been positively selected through evolutionary processes to protect against infection; hence, the contrasting differences in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases between populations result from diverse selective pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, it has been hypothesized that genetic variants associated with protection against infectious agents are behind the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in populations with low pathogen exposure, such as Europeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fumagalli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raj et al., 2013</xref>). To study the changing patterns of susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases during history, we used publicly available summary statistics from GWAS of digestive tract-related autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and arthritis-related diseases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and calculated the PRS for each of the samples under study. Interestingly, we observed a robust increase of the genetic variants related with the development of inflammatory diseases in the digestive tract after the Neolithic revolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). PRS scores associated with celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease were strongly associated with the age of the samples, regardless of the p-value thresholds or the missing genotype rates used for PRS calculation, showing the robustness of these results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The fact that especially intestinal inflammatory pathology is increased after a historical event that fundamentally modified human diet is unlikely to be an accident. Our results are in line with earlier research demonstrating that variants in genes important for immune responses and involved in celiac disease pathophysiology (such as IL-12, IL-18RAP, SH2B3) are under strong positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhernakova et al., 2010</xref>). The reasons for the selection pressure on these genes are not completely understood, but an advantage for host defense has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhernakova et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distribution of PRS of inflammatory diseases across time.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Polygenic risk score (PRS) models based on a p-value threshold of 1e-5.

For pre-Neolithic periods, these patterns had little impact with decreasing PRS for digestive tract diseases and increasing PRS for ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A strong decrease in susceptibility to juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis is seen after the Neolithic period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is likely linked to the decreased production of the IL-1/IL-6/IL-17 axis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which is particularly important in the pathophysiology of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akioka, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mei et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The significant changes in cytokine production and disease susceptibility in European populations after the Neolithic can be due to selective processes on the one hand (as described above), but also due to important demographic changes due to migrations of human communities such as the Anatolians (in Neolithic) or the Yamnaya populations from the Pontic steppe (during the Bronze Age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Racimo et al., 2020</xref>).

Human evolution has been influenced by multiple factors such as migration, urbanization, climate, and diet, which also influence the responses to pathogens. The advent of the Neolithic lifestyle was a milestone for human societies: after the Neolithic, the density of human populations and the rate of contact with domesticated animals increased significantly, which increased the emergence of pathogens and the ease with which those could spread. Our data show that while various events and conditions throughout human history have influenced our immune responses to pathogens, the advent of the Neolithic lifestyle was an important turning point for our capacity to respond to pathogens.</p><p>Collectively, our results show that the advent of the Neolithic era was a turning point for the evolution of immune-mediated traits in European populations, driving the expansion of alleles that favor the development of tolerance against intracellular pathogens and promote inflammatory responses against extracellular microbes. This is associated with a higher presence of genetic traits related with inflammatory and auto-immune diseases of the digestive tract and a lower number of alleles linked with the development of arthritis. It is important to underline that our results are obtained using European aDNA samples and GWAS summary statistics computed using European cohorts. Therefore, our results would be specific to European populations and should be interpreted with caution for populations from other geographical locations. Further research should compare the trends in different populations that have been exposed to different environments across the planet and clarify the influence of ancestry, time, and rural vs urban lifestyle to shed light on the influence of the infectious environment on genetics and human evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cohort selection</title><p>Ancient DNA genotype data were downloaded from version 37.2 of the published aDNA genotype database, compiled by and available on the David Reich Lab website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data-compiled-published-papers">https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data-compiled-published-papers</ext-link>). The aDNA samples consisted of pseudo-haploid genotype data. This was due to the low genotyping coverage.

This was done in order to remove outliers with extremely low coverage. Only samples within Europe were used for this study, and these samples were selected based on their geographic location, that is latitude (within 35 and 70 degrees north) and longitude (within 10 degrees west and 40 degrees east). Samples without a carbon-dated age were also filtered out. We also selected 250 European samples from the 1000 genomes project phase 3.

The Neolithic era ranges from 8500 to 3900 BCE, and the post-Neolithic era ranges from 5000 BCE and more recent ages. Using the geographical data in combination with archeological clues and the genetic data, the broad time period of origin was also available for samples that were dated to a point in time with overlapping broad time periods.

Some complex traits had multiple different sets of summary statistics available. In these cases, the data, which were more recent and used bigger cohorts that were either of European or mixed (European and Asian) ancestry, were selected. The variants of these summary statistics were then filtered by only keeping bi-allelic variants. Most aDNA genotypes available are pseudo-haploid as a consequence of their lower sample quality.

The goal was to track the evolutionary trajectories of cytokine production capacity over time in a number of patients with different exposure to infectious organisms, infectious disease, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases using the 500 Functional Genomics cohort of the Human Functional Genomics Project. From this analysis it was hypothesized that the Neolithic transition was characterized by strong changes in the adaptive response to pathogens in human biology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolution of cytokine production capacity in ancient and modern European populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been sent to 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Fernando Racimo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Overall, the main concern of both reviewers focused on statistical methodology followed by the authors and its limitations. There was a feeling that it was not strong enough to support the manuscript's conclusions as stated. These reviewer comments, which were numerous, centered on what was felt to be inadequate models and partitioning. Fully addressing the reviewer's concerns and revising the model and data analysis as appropriate will be needed to strengthen the paper.</p><p>1. The authors should comment on the impact and limitations on using the &quot;average genotyped dosage&quot; to be substituted for missing variants and data interpretation. It was described that the dosage of these variants was multiplied by their effect size while the dosage of missing variants in a sample were supplemented with the average dosage. Although agreed that this method doesn't skew the PRS preferentially one way or the other, but it could dilute or strengthen the scale of the data without knowing what the &quot;true&quot; values of the missing data points are.</p><p>2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were challenged with bacterial, fungal, viral, and non-microbial stimuli while measuring 6 cytokines (TNF α, IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and IFN γ) at 24 hrs and 7 days post-stimulation yielding 105 unique cytokine-stimulation pairs. Although a large number of such pairings were provided, likely due to data availability, the data set is not complete i.e. for the same organism not all 6 cytokines were followed and not all pairings had both a 24 hour and a 7 day time points. Some had a 48 hour time point.

In Figure 1, how was this particular subset of cytokines-stimulants pairings chosen from the larger set in Figure S1?

The authors estimated cytokine production capacity based on PRS which authors claim to have significant differences between populations in various historical periods with the largest strength difference reported before and after the Neolithic revolution. In Figure 1, the split was done to look at before and after the Neolithic era and the linear regression correspond to those two eras. However, the authors do not comment or show the data to demonstrate why they choose that specific break point as opposed to looking at every historical era transition i.e. from early upper paleolithic to late upper paleolithic to Mesolithic to Neolithic to post-Neolithic to modern. The authors should justify why grouping together all of the historical eras to being before and after the Neolithic revolution is acceptable and demonstrate from the data that the linear regression lines would follow the same pattern in each distinct historical period vs in the pre- and post-Neolithic grouping. This should be addressed in the main figures or as a supplemental figure.</p><p>6. In Figure 1-3 and as briefly discussed in the text, there are very few data points in the pre-Neolithic in comparison to post-era which would make it challenging for the reader to draw robust conclusions about the trends in the pre-Neolithic era. This should be addressed in the main text to prevent any overinterpretation of the main figures. In the supplemental figure S2, the authors do make claims about robustness of the trend when comparing to downsampled numbers in the post-Neolithic era and do comment that the power decreases with lower number of samples.</p><p>7. Throughout Figures 1-4, the authors state that the correlation pattern is the same across a number of thresholds 0.96, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. It would be best for the only one threshold range to be presented in these main figures and to move the complete data across multiple threshold ranges into a supplemental figure as the added ranges do not add anything new to the data results and interpretation.</p><p>8. Although the authors picked a very homogeneous population, the authors should discuss in terms of addressing the limitations of the current study, what the impact of other factors or events throughout history that could have a role here such as the development of vaccines the cross reactivity of antigens that may be shared between organisms, the development of medications (antimicrobials, antivirals, anti-inflammatory, etc …)?</p><p>9. Although the authors had a robust discussion on the prevalence of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases within the European population over different historical eras. A similar discussion around factors such as population density, migration, living conditions, living environments, diet/nutrition, sanitation/hygiene, etc … is lacking in discussing the evolution of cytokine production to specific pathogens.</p><p>10. The authors should highlight additional limitations of this current study in terms of the generalizability to other populations or to clearly state that this is limited to the European population at the specified latitude and longitudes used. The authors did demonstrate for the most part agreement with prior published studies which adds strength to their current results.</p><p>11. A concern is that the statistical methodology followed by the authors is not appropriate to support their conclusions – in particular, the fact that data imbalance and their effect on the P-values has not been properly accounted for, and that the choice of pre-partitioned pair of linear models is not the correct way to detect a shift in scores (or to make the much stronger claim of adaptation). I would recommend changing the model being used so as not to rely on a preparation of the data, and to properly account for genetic drift.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64971.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors should comment on the impact and limitations on using the &quot;average genotyped dosage&quot; to be substituted for missing variants and data interpretation. It was described that the dosage of these variants was multiplied by their effect size while the dosage of missing variants in a sample were supplemented with the average dosage. Although agreed that this method doesn't skew the PRS preferentially one way or the other, but it could dilute or strengthen the scale of the data without knowing what the &quot;true&quot; values of the missing data points are.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important remark. Replacing missing values by the average dosage would indeed dilute the observed effects or artificially increase the power of the observed trends. The alternative would be using only SNPs present in all samples. This would also bias our analysis since older samples have a higher error rate during genotype calling compared to our more modern samples. This is due to the sparsity of data and cytosine deamination which affects older samples to a greater extent. In our analysis, we tried to alleviate potential bias by using multiple thresholds for average missing genotype rate. By focusing on the consistent pattern across different thresholds, we were able to put our findings in a better context and show that the trends we observed hold true even when filtering out samples with high rates of substitute values.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were challenged with bacterial, fungal, viral, and non-microbial stimuli while measuring 6 cytokines (TNF α, IL-1 β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and IFN γ) at 24 hrs and 7 days post-stimulation yielding 105 unique cytokine-stimulation pairs. Although a large number of such pairings were provided, likely due to data availability, the data set is not complete i.e. for the same organism not all 6 cytokines were followed and not all pairings had both a 24 hour and a 7 day time points. Some had a 48 hour time point. The authors should try to provide a subset of data in which there is completeness of data to allow the readers to more clearly be able to compare trends appropriately (i.e. across the same cytokine markers or the same time point post stimulus etc …).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these remarks. The stimulation periods were chosen based on extensive studies that showed that the timepoints used were best suited for assessing monocyte-derived and lymphocyte-derived cytokines per stimulus. Not all the stimuli induce the production of all cytokines, so the selection of the cytokine-stimulus pairs was performed for those pairs in which a cytokine production could be measured (PMID: 1385767; PMID: 19380112; PMID: 27814509; PMID: 27814508; PMID: 27814507). The missing stimulus-cytokine pairs are simply due to the fact that some stimuli did not induce the production of some cytokines. The differences in the cytokine availability and time points are adjusted to the optimal time of production per stimuli. Monocyte-derived cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa) are early response cytokines, produced by innate immune cells shortly after stimulation (6 to 24h, the latter being used standard). IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-22 are lymphocyte-derived cytokines, produced by adaptive immune cells, in this case T helper cells upon stimulation by antigen-presenting cells. These cells need to differentiate for 2-7 days before they start to produce these cytokines, this is the reason why the time point of the measurements of these cytokines is 7 days. In the case of IFNγ, the kinetics of its production is more rapid, and we therefore measured it 48h after stimulation in whole blood samples.</p><p>We have included these considerations and new references in the new version of the text (lines 82 to 87).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Therefore, the variability of the cytokine responses between different individuals caused by the intrinsic gene expression variation and the environmental factors cannot be avoided. In this study we have used a cohort of individuals with a similar genetic background (Western-European ancestry) but with balanced characteristics in terms of age, sex, BMI and habits (PMID: 27814508), which allowed us to represent the natural variability in the responses. Cytokines were measured in batches in which a certain cytokine was measured the same day for all the samples. This was done to decrease the potential technical variations. Moreover, in a recent study we evaluated the intra-individual variation of cytokine production capacity, which was found limited (ter Horst et al., J Immunol, in press). On the other hand, inter-individual variability of cytokine production was largely depedent on genetic variants (PMID: 27814507, PMID: 29784908) We have included these considerations in the new version of the manuscript (lines 96 to 105).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

As mentioned also in our response to the previous reviewer, in this study we focus on the effects of different pathogens in cytokine production and therefore in the response to different infections. Human evolution has been influenced by multiple factors, such as migrations, urbanization, climate, diet, which also influence the responses to pathogens. The advent of the Neolithic era was a milestone for human civilization and human lifestyle, with higher density of human populations and rate of contact with animals which increased the emergence of pathogens. Our data show that despite the fact that other events and conditions throughout human history have influenced our immune responses to pathogens, the advent of the Neolithic was a turning point for our capacity to respond to pathogens. The evolution of cytokine production to specific pathogens is also a very important factor to take into account. The more contact humans have had with a pathogen, the greater the likelihood that the interaction between host and pathogen will lead to changes in the cytokine production and also the adaptation of the pathogen to the human host. We have included a Discussion about these topics in the new version of the manuscript (lines 273 to 282).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

In our study we focus on summary statistics obtained from European populations and only employ European aDNA samples, so our results should not be extrapolated to other populations from other geographical areas.

In order to account for the data imbalance in terms of samples per historical age period we pooled all samples prior to the neolithic age together before testing the difference in average PRS between neighbouring periods using a T test, we also show LOESS regression models to not depend on a pre-partitioning of our data. In addition we aim to show how consistent our post-Neolithic results are by downsampling the post-Neolithic samples and reperforming linear regression (please see our replies to points 5 and 6).</p><p>In addition we performed a seperate test for adaption as opposed to genetic drift using Wright’s fixation index (Fst) to test for significant differences in genetic differentiation of trait specific SNPs compared to background SNPs in order to determine whether the changes we see in PRS over time are due to selection or due to genetic drift. This analysis shows that changes between the pre-Neolithic to Neolithic are not significantly different from drift, whereas after the onset of the Neolithic we do see significant amount of selection. We have explained this further in the manuscript line 130 to 135 and included the new Table S2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
