resilience in smallholder farming. The push–pull strategy reportedly suppresses lepidopteran pests in maize through a combination of a repellent intercrop (push), commonly <italic>Desmodium</italic> spp., and an attractive, border crop (pull). Key in the system is the intercrop’s constitutive release of volatile terpenoids that repel herbivores. However, the earlier described volatile terpenoids were not detectable in the headspace of <italic>Desmodium</italic>, and only minimally upon herbivory. This was independent of soil type, microbiome composition, and whether collections were made in the laboratory or in the field. Furthermore, in oviposition choice tests in a wind tunnel, maize with or without an odor background of <italic>Desmodium</italic> was equally attractive for the invasive pest <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>. In search of an alternative mechanism, we found that neonate larvae strongly preferred <italic>Desmodium</italic> over maize. However, their development stagnated and no larva survived. In addition, older larvae were frequently seen impaled and immobilized by the dense network of silica-fortified, non-glandular trichomes. Thus, our data suggest that <italic>Desmodium</italic> may act through intercepting and decimating dispersing larval offspring rather than adult deterrence. As a hallmark of sustainable pest control, maize<italic>–Desmodium</italic> push–pull intercropping has inspired countless efforts to emulate stimulo-deterrent diversion in other cropping systems. However, detailed knowledge of the actual mechanisms is required to rationally improve the strategy, and translate the concept to other cropping systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>push–pull intercropping</kwd><kwd>integrated pest management</kwd><kwd><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic></kwd><kwd>fall army worm</kwd><kwd><italic>Desmodium</italic></kwd><kwd>mechanical defence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Maize</kwd><kwd>Spodoptera littoralis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Instead of repelling, <italic>Desmodium</italic>, a hallmark of pest suppressive sustainable intercropping, acts as a mechanical and developmental barrier to larvae, thereby truncating population development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the dawn of agriculture, humanity has been in an arms race with insect pests. Traditionally, a set of integrated cultivation strategies tailored to local settings helped keeping pest insects at bay, including associational resistance through varietal mixtures and intercropping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abate et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Snyder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wuest et al., 2021</xref>). With the advent of agrochemicals, monocultures superseded traditional strategies. However, their profound externalities on ecosystem resilience and global climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altieri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shukla et al., 2019</xref>) have resuscitated interest in more sustainable alternatives, frequently grafted on traditional strategies. Trending terms such as agroecology, and climate-smart, regenerative, or organic agriculture highlight the search for solutions that harmonize food production and pest control with ecological sustainability. Some innovative practices have been important sources of inspiration. Among these, the push–pull strategy in which maize is intercropped with the legume, <italic>Desmodium</italic>, is arguably the most well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The push–pull strategies aim to reduce the abundance of insect pests in crops through repelling the ovipositing herbivores from the crop, while simultaneously attracting the pest outside the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Cowles, 1990</xref>). Using this ‘stimulo-deterrent diversion’ principle, a push–pull strategy was devised to combat lepidopteran pests in sub-Saharan smallholder maize farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2010</xref>). Embroidering on the common practice of smallholder farmers to intercrop maize with e.g. edible pulses, the strategy uses the perennial fodder legume <italic>Desmodium</italic> as intercrop in maize plots. <italic>Desmodium</italic> reportedly constitutively releases large amounts of volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as (<italic>E</italic>)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene ((<italic>E</italic>)-DMNT), (<italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene and cedrene, that repel (push) lepidopteran pests and attract natural enemies (pull) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassanali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2000</xref>). A ‘trap crop’ sown as border crop (another ‘pull’ component), typically Napier grass, complements the strategy, as it induces oviposition in <italic>Lepidoptera</italic>, but reduces larval survival compared to maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan et al., 2016</xref>). This cropping strategy thus suppresses infestations with various lepidopteran pests, including <italic>Chilo partellus</italic> and <italic>Busseola fusca</italic>, as well as <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, a polyphagous invasive pest that is ravaging maize and vegetable production and threatens food security in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldmann et al., 2019</xref>). This intercropping strategy has found widespread adoption in East Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niassy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nkurunziza, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">ICIPE, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Government of Ruanda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenya National Assembly, 2019</xref>). As a hallmark of sustainable pest control, it also serves as a tremendous source of inspiration for intervention strategies in other cropping systems.</p><p>The ‘push’ volatile terpenoids reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2000</xref>) are usually released in detectable amounts by plants after induction by herbivory. Although several plants do release them constitutively, such as <italic>Melinis minutiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimani et al., 2000</xref>), constitutive release of volatile terpenoids is not known from legumes. We sought to understand the role of soil-borne interactions, particularly the soil microbiome, in the constitutive release of these volatiles. This is of particular interest given that push–pull intercropping of maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic> causes substantial shifts in below-ground ecosystems, including increased soil microbe diversification, increased soil nitrogen and carbon, increased plant defense through plant–soil feedback, and suppression of parasitic weeds and pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mutyambai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mwakilili et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, soil and root–microbe interactions have been found to induce pathways that lead to release of volatile terpenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mutyambai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malone et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore verified if the ‘constitutive’ release of volatile terpenoids was, in fact, induced or enhanced by soil-borne interactions. The root–microbe interactions are of particular interest, given the intimate association of legumes with specific microbial groups e.g. rhizobia and mycorrhizae.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Different from the expectations, in the headspace of intact <italic>Desmodium intortum</italic>, which is by far the most commonly used intercrop in push–pull technology, the presence of the earlier described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassanali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2000</xref>) volatile terpenoids was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). This was independent of the soil in which <italic>D. intortum</italic> was grown, whether live soil (organic potting soil, organic clay Swedish soil, or African clay loam soil from <italic>D. intortum</italic> plots), autoclaved soil, or autoclaved soils inoculated with mycorrhiza or rhizobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>) was used. Similar results were obtained with <italic>D. uncinatum</italic>, a species that has also frequently been used in push–pull cropping systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, we did confirm that <italic>M. minutiflora</italic>, a poacean plant used previously as a push intercrop, releases a diverse blend of terpenoids regardless of herbivory ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Intact <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants thus did not release the earlier described repellent compounds in detectable quantities, independent of soil interactions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Desmodium intortum</italic> does not constitutively release terpene volatiles, and hardly following larval feeding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis of volatiles emitted by <italic>D. intortum</italic>, <italic>Z. mays</italic> cv.

Also under field conditions, very few <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants released detectable amounts of terpenoids in the headspace.

This confirms the greenhouse experiments and underlines that <italic>Desmodium</italic> does not constitutively release detectable amounts of volatile terpenoids, whereas following induction, the release is comparatively low. Although it cannot be excluded that other conditions or more substantial herbivore attack may induce higher release of volatile terpenoids, our experiments conducted under different growth conditions, and in different geographic regions show that this is likely rare, which would make it tenuous to be at the core of a generic strategy. In contrast, the headspace of field-sampled maize, most of which displayed some herbivore damage, did contain typical herbivore-induced volatile terpenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turlings et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Degen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Mérey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), with variations in volatile release likely reflecting differing levels of, and age since herbivore infestations, which could not be controlled in the field.

Besides locomotion, they also passively disperse with wind through spinning silk threads allowing them to ‘parachute’ between plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Njuguna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sokame et al., 2020</xref>).

First, <italic>Desmodium</italic> entices larval feeding, but truncates development. Second, trichomes on <italic>Desmodium</italic> hinder movement, damage the cuticle and even entirely immobilize larvae on the plant, increasing developmental time, exposure to natural enemies and overall mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaur and Kariyat, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kariyat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaur and Kariyat, 2020</xref>). Third, ingestion of trichomes damages the intestinal lining and affects digestion, development and survival in closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaur and Kariyat, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, while first instar larvae fed around the large uncinate trichomes, larger larvae did ingest trichomes as evidenced by trichomes found in larval frass. Effectively, rather than functioning as a repellent intercrop, <italic>Desmodium</italic> appears to be a trap crop for larvae.</p><p>We hypothesize that ‘push’ does not describe the mode of action of <italic>Desmodium</italic>. Instead, the plant exhibits properties reminiscent of a ‘pull’ crop, a ‘trap crop’. Although superficially similar in mode of action to the ‘pull’ border crop Napier grass, <italic>Desmodium</italic> is distinctly different, as it is preferred by larvae, not by adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassanali et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, <italic>Desmodium</italic> forms a mechanical barrier to dispersing larvae. Further field studies need to detail how oviposition preference of different stemborer species, larval dispersal, development and survival on <italic>Desmodium</italic>, mechanical obstruction by <italic>Desmodium</italic>, and additional mechanisms such as parasitization and predation rates, interplay with crop phenology in suppressing various lepidopteran species across the cropping season. Knowing the exact mode of action is critical if we, for instance, wish to substitute the fodder crop <italic>Desmodium</italic> with a food crop to enhance food security, or design push–pull inspired, pest-suppressive conditions for other crops.</p><p>The observation that <italic>Desmodium</italic> does not emit detectable amounts of volatile terpenoids and does not repel <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, contrasts with the large number of publications and the global attention that maize<italic>–Desmodium</italic> push–pull technology has garnered over more than two decades. Indeed, the idea of the ‘push’ crop <italic>Desmodium</italic> repelling moths is found in numerous papers since its first mention around the year 2000. However, close scrutiny of the literature revealed a limited amount of primary data, except for a recent paper discussed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>). The data presented here suggest that the mechanism of push–pull requires detailed studies. This is important as, although push–pull clearly suppresses lepidopteran pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hassanali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mutyambai et al., 2019</xref>), knowing the precise mechanism is essential to optimize the strategy to and troubleshoot it when it underperforms. How the mechanical defense described here impacts herbivore population, growth rate, the rate of parasitization and predation, depends on other biotic and abiotic factors and needs to be further studied as well. With the mechanism at hand, the strategy can also be further tailored to the needs of local smallholder farmers e.g. replacing <italic>Desmodium</italic> with food crops with similar properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kariyat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaur and Kariyat, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballhorn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">QulRing et al., 1992</xref>), as well as rationally translating the concept to other cropping systems.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ideas and speculations</title><p>In our experiments, we exclusively detected volatile terpenoids when <italic>D. intortum</italic> was damaged by herbivores. In a recent study, aimed at testing the repellence of <italic>Desmodium</italic> to <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> under laboratory conditions, <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants may appear to emit volatile terpenoids constitutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>). However, besides difference in odor collection methodologies (see below), the objective and experimental design of that study differed substantially from the current study, which makes comparison with the current study tenuous. Sohby et al. primarily aimed to assess the preference of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> for maize alone or in combination with <italic>Desmodium</italic> without focusing on herbivore induction. At a first glance the volatile profile of intact <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref> would appear herbivore-induced, as these profiles compare well with our herbivore-induced <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize. However, the absence of both positive and negative control plants (induced and non-induced <italic>Desmodium</italic> and other push-plants such as <italic>M. minutiflora</italic>) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>, makes a direct comparison difficult. The current study provided contrasts through the inclusion of these controls. <italic>Desmodium</italic>, under a large range of conditions in the laboratory and the field, did not release detectable amounts of induced volatile terpenoids, and comparatively little when induced. While the antenna of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>) can detect volatile terpenoids, in our study these appeared only to be released in detectable, small amounts upon herbivory of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants.</p><p>Besides differences in the hypotheses and design of the studies, a methodological factor, the volatile collection methods, is also worth considering. Static (this study) versus dynamic headspace sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>) in combination with other factors such as the adsorbent used, impacts volatiles collected in many ways, and in turn its interpretation ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tholl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tholl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raguso and Pellmyr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ouyang and Pawliszyn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosen and Zupančič-Kralj, 1999</xref>). Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) used here allows for time and cost-efficient collection of large numbers of samples, but this is non-exhaustive and with limited possibilities of absolute quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Compared to SPME, using adsorbent filled volatile traps in a dynamic headspace is an exhaustive volatile collection method ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and its sensitivity and quantifiability is better compared to SPME ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tholl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ouyang and Pawliszyn, 2008</xref>). In addition, the vastly more tedious collection procedures of dynamic headspace sampling substantially reduce the number of biological replicates that can be handled ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tholl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosen and Zupančič-Kralj, 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of volatile collection methods.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88695-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The limitations of these methods point out the importance of designing the extraction protocols carefully including relevant blank samples and using internal reference compounds. Furthermore, the choice of method needs to be anchored in the research questions and hypotheses, which influences the design of the experiments and the choice of relevant positive and negative controls to include.</p><p>Further studies should quantitatively evaluate emission of behaviorally active volatile terpenoids from maize, <italic>Desmodium</italic> and e.g. Napier grass under various realistic field (intercrop) conditions. These will be helpful to understand odor release against a background of volatile terpenoids in the cropping system, and how insects may navigate in these odor spaces.

At the furthest upwind part of the flight section of the tunnel, two 4- to 5-week-old maize plants (<italic>Z. mays</italic> cv. Delprim) were positioned at 60 cm from each other. Directly upwind from the maize plants and separated by a stainless steel gauze (100 mesh) an 8-week-old <italic>D. intortum</italic> or artificial plastic plant was placed. In both sections a 20-cm plexiglass sheet was placed in line with the airflow to separate the airflows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two 6-day-old females and one 6-day-old male were climatized in a plastic cup for 3 hr. One hour prior to scotophase, the cup was opened and placed on a 20-cm high stand in the center of the wind tunnel, 120 cm downwind from the maize plants. A cotton ball soaked in 5% sucrose solution was placed in the chamber at the release point as a source of food. The position of the female and the number of egg batches laid on each side of the chamber were recorded after scotophase, 12 hr following the start of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Larval choice experiments</title><p>We conducted two-choice feeding bioassays to determine the feeding preference of the first larval instar of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. We cut 8 mm diameter leaf discs from young leaves of 6- to 7-week-old maize plants and leaves of 10- to 12-week-old <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants. We put the leaf discs on wet filter paper discs at 60 mm apart from each other in 100 mm × 20 mm plastic Petri dishes. Ten 1-day-old <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae were placed in each arena and the position of larvae was recorded after 1, 2, and 20 hr periods. After 20 hr feeding each leaf disk was photographed and the consumed surface area of each disk was determined by image analysis using ImageJ (version 1.53) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Larval survival experiments</title><p>Larval survival on maize and <italic>D. intortum</italic> was scored in plastic Petri dishes (100 mm × 20 mm), which were lined with wet filter paper to increase humidity. Five first instar <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> larvae were moved to each arena on the day of egg-hatching and fed daily with ad libitum amounts of freshly cut <italic>D. intortum</italic> leaves or leaf blades of 4- to 5-week-old maize (<italic>Z. mays</italic> cv. Delprim). After reaching the fourth instar, the maize diet was supplemented with the ligule, leaf sheets and young stems of maize and the larvae were separated into individual plastic cups to prevent cannibalism. The growth of the larvae was monitored daily, and we determined the larval stage based on body coloration and the diameter of head capsules. We terminated the experiment after the insects pupated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Light microscopy of <italic>Desmodium</italic> spp.</title><p>Upper and mid stem branches as well as the leaves of healthy 8-week-old <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants were sampled for light microscopy. In addition, <italic>S. littoralis</italic> larvae that were immobilized on <italic>D. uncinatum</italic> and <italic>D. intortum</italic> stems and leaves were observed and photographed with a digital light microscope (Keyence VHX-5000, Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan) equipped with standard zoom lens (VH-Z20R magnification: ×20–200 and VH-Z100R magnification: ×100–1000). For detailed, high depth-of-field images, a photo stacking technique was used. Series of images were captured (50–100 depending on the size of the examined larvae) at different focus distances (step size, 20–40 µm). Subsequently, partially focused images were combined with Helicon Focus software (Helicon Soft Ltd, Kharkiv, Ukraine) into a high depth-of-field image.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Scanning electron microscopy of <italic>Desmodium</italic> spp.</title><p>To get further insights in the structure of the <italic>D. intortum</italic> trichomes, scanning electron microscopy was performed on leaf and stem samples. Healthy leaves and stems were collected from 8-week-old and 1-year-old plants from the greenhouse, and scanned using a FEI Quanta 3D scanning electron microscope operating with a field emission gun electron source, equipped with SE (LVSED/ETD), BSE (vCD), and EDAX SDD EDS detectors. Low-vacuum mode (50–80 Pa specimen chamber pressure) was used in order to avoid sample charging, and to allow using plant material without sample fixation, dehydration, and sample coating. The accelerating voltage was 10–20 kV with 40–480 pA beam current.</p><p>Furthermore, the elemental composition of trichomes was studied using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, acquisition time: 50 s. Measurements were taken in four regions (base, lower and higher middle, and tip) on the longer type of trichomes and from three regions in case of small uncinate trichomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In case of each volatile sample the absolute peak areas were divided by the area of the internal standard peak to account for differences in volatile sampling efficiency. The volatile components were categorized into four compound groups: monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, green leaf volatiles, and other volatiles. We calculated the total sum of peak areas for these volatile groups across samples for the laboratory volatile collections and field volatile collections by location. The volatile collections were further normalized across samples by dividing the absolute peak areas by the sum of the total area of the volatile group from the corresponding dataset.</p><p>The clustered heatmaps of volatile emission profiles were generated from <italic>z</italic>-scores calculated from the normalized volatile data using package pheatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolde, 2019</xref>). Jaccard dissimilarity indices were calculated from binary (presence/absence) standardized volatile data and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was completed using the metaMDS function of package vegan in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oksanen et al., 2013</xref>). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance was completed on Jaccard dissimilarity indices using the adonis function of the vegan package. For assessing differences in the normalized volatile peak areas for (<italic>E</italic>)-DMNT and (<italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene between groups Kruskal–Wallis tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used from package stats with Benjamini and Hochberg p value correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We used Wilcoxon paired rank sum tests with a null hypothesis of random choice using package stats for two-choice oviposition experiments and larval choice experiments. As the statistical power of Wilcoxon paired rank sum tests are limited, we also fitted generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) by maximum likelihood with fixed factor for choice and random factor for replication on the two-choice oviposition data using package lme4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). We used the simulation-based test from package DHARMa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartig, 2021</xref>) to assess the goodness of fit for the complete model. The post hoc tests were completed with the emmeans package using Tukey’s comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lenth et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Survival probabilities were calculated with Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</xref>) and the survival curves were compared using a log‐rank test between diets in package survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Therneau and Lumley, 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine–Vehn as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Despite the manuscript's emphasis on the lack of difference between maize and desmodium in oviposition, oviposition was not rigorously assessed. Considering that number of eggs varies by batch and egg batches can vary by host plants, claiming that oviposition behavior is unaffected by egg batch size is not solid evidence. Therefore, it is also necessary to provide information about the number of eggs or the size of the batch. Moreover, as biased oviposition may have occurred in a particular plant species, data comparing the ratio of plants that laid eggs and those that did not are required. Lastly, the authors should report proportion of eggs laid on plants in comparison to the cage.</p><p>2. In oviposition experiments, the difference in planting methods (co–planting and separated planting) between the cage–based bioassay and the wind tunnel–based bioassay impairs consistent interpretation of the results. Reviewer 2 pointed out that co–planting can change the secretion of volatile substances in plants, requiring further investigation of these substances. According to Reviewer 3, since co–planted plants do not reflect outdoor planting distance well, a re–experiment with separate plantings such as wind tunnels should be conducted. As both opinions are reasonable, we suggest that cage bioassays be conducted at least in separate plantings, since considering plant–plant communication goes beyond the core message of the current paper.</p><p>3. According to both reviewers, more clarification is needed regarding why and how caterpillars migrate on Desmodium rather than maize. There has been discussion that early instar caterpillars can move through hanging by thread, but it is unclear whether this can occur between maize and desmodium. To clarify this, we need to understand why and how the pest caterpillar actually prefers Desmodium (e.g., prefers a particular volatile? Do herbivores grow larger, but with lower survival rates?).</p><p>4. Explain why the total number of larvae are the lowest in Maize/Maize treatment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– It appears that the authors generally responded adequately to the points I raised during the initial submission process.</p><p>– Nevertheless, a more comprehensive comparison would be with the study by Sohby et al., which should be compared with this study. A clear analysis of the methodological differences should be conducted in order to understand why Sohby et al. and this study produced different results.</p><p>– Furthermore, adverbs that are still difficult to scientifically verify are often used, which makes reading difficult (e.g. Astoundingly).</p><p>– Pest preference mechanisms remain unclear. More discussion is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This MS reveals that plants that have long been said to push are not, in fact, doing so, but are trapping and killing pests, thereby reducing pest outbreaks. They showed the mechanism of trapping pest larvae in detail and analyzed a lot of volatiles from the plant and maize. The sample sizes are enough and static analysis are stable. However, additional experiments or additional explanations may be needed.</p><p>1) They showed the volatiles from Desmidum with different soils (including different microbes). That experiment is very important. But I think they should show also the volatiles both Desmidum and Maize when both plants sharing the soil, because it might be possible to interact both plants under the soil.</p><p>2) About the oviposition preference experiment, I think they should use the corn with Desmisum sharing soil also in the wind tunnel experiment, because of the same reason as above.</p><p>3) Please explain, why larvae prefer Desmidum, and how larvae find Desmisum.</p><p>4) I think they should mention about the possibility of plant communication between Maize and Desmoduim in the discussion.</p><p>5) Figure 4 A. I don't understand the reason the total number of larvae are the lowest in Maize/Maize among the set. Did many larvae not on the leaf disc when the Maize/Maize treatment?</p><p>6) I think they should mention the result of the soil experiment in the abstract even if there was no relation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Along these lines, some statements still need rectification so that this manuscript is placed correctly in context. For example, this statement in the summary is no longer true and needs to be rectified: &quot;Surprisingly, however, Desmodium does not constitutively release volatiles nor repels pests. Astoundingly, in spite of the massive research output on push–pull, no primary data on either volatile release or repellence of Desmodium has been published.&quot; It would now be appropriate to point out that the authors have not found abundant constitutive volatile release by Desmodium, and that primary data on Desmodium volatiles and behavioral effects on moths were published only recently despite the use of those expectations in models of push–pull (built on a system using different companion plants) for decades. Ideally, a relevant preprint could also be briefly addressed in the authors' discussion (https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs–2535302/v1), although it is appropriate that the main effort of comparison is made with the peer–reviewed study from Sobhy et al.</p><p>Similarly, the authors should be cautious to use precise language.</p><p>– Exaggerated language is sometimes used to make a point, rather than emphasizing gaps and data using accepted terminology (astoundingly, deathtrap, etc.). This can be off–putting and distracts from the scientific argument, rather than building it up.</p><p>– I have the impression that &quot;terpenoids&quot; and &quot;volatiles&quot; are used interchangeably in this manuscript.</p><p>– I have the impression that &quot;absence&quot; is used when &quot;infrequent observation&quot;, &quot;low overall abundance&quot; or similar is more accurate (volatile terpenoids from desmodium)</p><p>– The comment that active volatile collection runs the risk of accumulating more contaminants than passive sampling is not well supported, and in this context, it would be relevant to point out that the active collection system referred to uses a charcoal filter to scrub incoming air.</p><p>Some aspects of the bioassays are not standard and could be criticized, and so these need to be directly addressed and explained.</p><p>– Co–planting of maize with desmodium for the oviposition assay can be justified but seems to decrease the likelihood that moths differentiate between the plants. In push–pull fields, the two crops share soil but are commonly spaced so that they do not grow into each other when the maize is young (in part to avoid competition).</p><p>– Usually proportion of eggs laid on plants versus on walls etc. is reported – apologies if I overlooked this, but I didn't see it here.</p><p>– More critically, eggs and not only egg batches should be counted. Egg batches can vary greatly in size. This could make the difference between finding significantly less oviposition on desmodium versus maize, or not (Figure 3). It is the number of eggs (potential larvae) that is most relevant.</p><p>– To my knowledge, 12 hours is a long time to run a wind tunnel bioassay. Commonly, these are used to observe initial responses. What is the reason here, and how do the 12 h data differ from observations commonly made in wind tunnels (first choice, number of approaches within 5–10 min, and so on)? Why combine a very long wind tunnel assay with a relatively, although not uncommonly long (48 h) oviposition assay, rather than using the wind tunnel to observe early decisions?</p><p>– Similarly, many aspects of experimental design were not comparable between this study and Sobhy. Choice of plant comparisons is addressed, but not issues of animal and plant age, handling, and timing. It would be helpful to summarize these similarly as is done for the choice of plant comparisons. Generally, choices about moth age and handling and plant age and handling are critical for interpreting bioassay results and should be clearly explained (and backed by data and observations).</p><p>– Although the authors support an argument about how their results should compare to a more recent publication from Sobhy and colleagues, they do not address the electrophysiological results in the Sobhy study. Do those results affect conclusions about the different behaviors reported in this study, versus by Sobhy?</p><p>The authors should check for correct and appropriate scientific language and grammar, e.g.</p><p>– Remove some adverbs (make your point based on your evidence, not on repeating &quot;surprisingly&quot;, &quot;shockingly&quot;, etc.)</p><p>– &quot; similar to those reported in earlier (10)&quot; – reported on earlier? Reported from earlier studies?</p><p>– &quot;developmental deathrap&quot; – the preferred term in this literature is &quot;trap crop&quot;</p><p>– eight–week–old, five–week–old, etc. (not eight weeks old, five weeks old, etc.)</p><p>– &quot;let to oviposit&quot; ––&gt; &quot;allowed to oviposit&quot;</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The push–pull intercrop <italic>Desmodium</italic> does not repel, but intercepts and kills pests&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jürgen Kleine–Vehn (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Following careful review by reviewers, the authors should revise the manuscript in the following four areas:</p><p>1) The authors may not claim that Desmodium does not release terpenoids or other volatiles. Rather, they can state that in several experiments with an established method, they did not detect them or only in low amounts in comparison to maize plants.</p><p>2) They must acknowledge that there can be differences between the Desmodium measured in Kenya and what they grew in Sweden and measured in Tanzania. This is also very important for the larger discussion on push–pull. We are not working with a Desmodium inbred line and there are large environmental gradients.</p><p>3) It is almost certainly less sensitive to measure with an equilibrium technique than to quantitatively collect over time.</p><p>4) Plants in the field may be damaged and it is not unrealistic or misleading to measure volatiles from plants grown from the same stock and under similar conditions. The aim of the Sobhy study was detection in the study system, not to assess the causes of volatile emissions. So the authors should not imply that the resulting measurements are unrepresentative of push–pull because there was not strict control on the use of pristine plants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88695.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We aimed at studying spatial repellency, and we considered the number of egg batches a reasonable indicator of that, as the decision to oviposit on a plant is known to be affected by host quality, whereas the relationship between clutch size and host quality is more stochastic/tenuous (e.g. Silva et al. 2017, scientia agricola) and frequently poorly documented and therefore difficult to link to literature. In our case the number of oviposited eggs hold a par with the pattern observed in number of egg batches in our cage experiments. We added a supplementary figure to show that. We hope that the above satisfies the reviewer's comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In oviposition experiments, the difference in planting methods (co–planting and separated planting) between the cage–based bioassay and the wind tunnel–based bioassay impairs consistent interpretation of the results. Reviewer 2 pointed out that co–planting can change the secretion of volatile substances in plants, requiring further investigation of these substances. According to Reviewer 3, since co–planted plants do not reflect outdoor planting distance well, a re–experiment with separate plantings such as wind tunnels should be conducted. As both opinions are reasonable, we suggest that cage bioassays be conducted at least in separate plantings, since considering plant–plant communication goes beyond the core message of the current paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted earlier preliminary experiments that did not show any influence of co-planting on volatile emission, similar to the absence of an effect of soil inoculation on volatile emission by maize or Desmodium. When we were setting up the experiments we reasoned that co-planting would be both more practical, and more reflective of the natural situation in the field.</p><p>The recommended distance between Desmodium and maize in the field is 37.5 cm, whereas in our experiments the distance was 16-17 cm. In our experiments maize and desmodium plants were grown together for only three weeks, compared to a field situation, where the Desmodium plant is growing together with maize for the whole season. In addition, farmers tend to keep Desmodium on the field for extended periods (several years, as it is seen as an investment). These plants have larger root networks and interactions with maize roots are presumably more extensive than what we had in our pots. Thus, besides not having seen such interactions, we believe it is safe to assume that the interaction between the rhizospheres is accordingly smaller and root-root interactions are less in this laboratory setting compared to intercropping fields. However, root-root interactions deserve indeed further detailed study where the focus is on how root-root interactions shape the volatilome. We noted an error in our MATERIALS AND METHODS: the pot sizes were not 12 cm but 18 cm for the co-planted pots. The 12 cm pots were used for single plants, this misinformation was corrected accordingly.</p><p>In summary, the question of root-root interactions is an interesting factor. However we feel that it is beyond the scope of the present paper. In addition, these experiments involving the preparations, such as planting of Desmodium, rearing, and conducting behavioural experiments and analyses would take well over half a year. We unfortunately do not have these personnel resources currently (Aneth David graduated and left, while Anna Erdei received another position), and hope that the above extra data and reasoning will suffice at present statements.</p><p>We have corrected the Materials and methods section. We also highlighted toward the end of the discussion pointing out that below ground interactions, including root-root interactions, are still understudied and would deserve further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. According to both reviewers, more clarification is needed regarding why and how caterpillars migrate on Desmodium rather than maize. There has been discussion that early instar caterpillars can move through hanging by thread, but it is unclear whether this can occur between maize and desmodium. To clarify this, we need to understand why and how the pest caterpillar actually prefers Desmodium (e.g., prefers a particular volatile? Do herbivores grow larger, but with lower survival rates?).</p></disp-quote><p>When it comes to ‘migration’ we would rather use the term ‘dispersal’, which is more of a stochastic, non-directional process. It is well known that larvae of many lepidopteran species disperse. The ecological significance is that this reduces sibling competition, as egg batches, containing tens to hundreds of eggs on a single plant, are far too large to support the development of all hatching larvae. While first instar larvae also disperse on a plant through walking, dispersal between plants by first instar larvae occurs through silk threads spun on emergence. The silk thread together with the just emerged larvae is picked up and dispersed with wind. First instar S. frugiperda larvae have very well developed silk glands, which are particularly used for this purpose (Marti et Rogers, Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 1988). But instars of many other lepidopteran larvae that infest maize have also been observed to do this, including other Spodoptera species, Chilo partellus and Buseola fusca (Sokame et al., Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 2020).</p><p>Given that Desmodium is a continuous intercrop with much vegetative surface compared to maize particularly earlier in the growth season, there is a big chance of larvae ending up on Desmodium instead of maize during this non-directional dispersal. Since L1 larvae appear to prefer Desmodium, but do not develop on it, Desmodium acts as a dead-end host. We do not know the underlying causes of this phenomenon (eg secondary plant metabolites, low nutritional value etc.), and leave this interesting observation as a lead for further studies. Such studies can be highly relevant when searching for alternative intercrops to Desmodium (which is not much favoured by farmers).</p><p>Dispersal also occurs at later stages in larval life, but this is not with wind as larvae are too heavy to be carried by silk threads. The extent to which older larvae disperse over plant and ground surfaces is though less clear and arguably more difficult and dangerous and therefore an evolutionarily less stable strategy. Also in these cases, the chances of larvae ending up on Desmodium on the interrow is stochastically very high compared to finding single stalks of maize. Here again, larvae are ill fated when ending up on Desmodium, with an additional mechanism coming into play: hindrance by spines and hooks. Survival rate is likely very low, as indicated by our study.</p><p>Our paper thus covers experimentally more of the how than the why (evolutionary, ecological as well as nutritional background of dispersal and preference). This fits with the scope and hypotheses of the work. However, the points of ‘why’ raised by the reviewers are interesting and hopefully will give rise to further studies.</p><p>When it comes to larval choice: we do not know what factors culminated into a ‘preference’ for Desmodium. For instance, a likely explanation could be that the leaf surface is much softer than maize, with silicone embedded in the hairs rather than in the surface. Especially for L1 larvae the softness of the surface is a very important factor in the ability to feed and survive. Additional factors that could come into play include for instance taste compounds or volatiles that are released upon feeding, the perceived nutritional value such as protein content of leaves (Chen, Ruberson and Olson, Entomol Exp Appl. 2008, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00662.x). Possibly, the small uncinate hairs also contribute by hindering even small larvae in their movement. While the underlying mechanism of ‘choice’ thus remains unresolved at this point, the ecological significance is that larvae dispersing onto Desmodium are likely to stay and feed on this intercrop, which lowers pest pressure on maize. We hope that the above explanation, along with the extensive revision of this manuscript suffices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Explain why the total number of larvae are the lowest in Maize/Maize treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the L1 instar phase dispersing larvae are very motile. It is possible that on the Desmodium leaves larval movement is hindered or possibly even somewhat arrested by the small uncinate trichomes. This is an effect that is independent of the choice setting and presence of maize.</p><p>Earlier studies on non-glandular trichomes have shown that they decrease feeding intensity. These experiments investigated trichomes with different morphologies for example stellar and uniseriate trichome types that do not cause arrest as uncinate (hooked) trichomes. Possibly, the increased feeding is a transient phenomenon and trichomes might affect larvae in an instar-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Nevertheless, a more comprehensive comparison would be with the study by Sohby et al., which should be compared with this study. A clear analysis of the methodological differences should be conducted in order to understand why Sohby et al. and this study produced different results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially reformatted the parts of the manuscript including the comparison to the Sobhy et al. paper and improved the discussion by discussing the results of the electrophysiological recordings in that paper.</p><p>Note that after rereading our manuscript and having received comments from some extra pairs of eyes, we felt that the flow was much disrupted by the extended comparison with the Sohby paper in the middle of the Results section. We therefore fused that paragraph with the methodological comments at the end of the paper in the section 'ideas and speculations'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Furthermore, adverbs that are still difficult to scientifically verify are often used, which makes reading difficult (e.g. Astoundingly).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree.

More discussion is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially rewritten the results and discussion and included more insights on the possible mechanisms that can be involved in the observed preference and feeding pattern and also included comparison to further literature. See also answers above. Note that the ‘preference’ can be due to a large number of underlying factors (involving multiple sensory modalities – olfaction, taste, mechanical-, nutritional) acting alone or in combination and resulting in what is loosely defined as ‘preference’. We believe that the mechanism of larval preference is out of scope for this manuscript, but the reviewer is right, that this warrants further in-depth studies aimed at a better understanding of behaviour. We have attempted to point this out in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript reveals that plants that have long been said to push are not, in fact, doing so, but are trapping and killing pests, thereby reducing pest outbreaks.

That experiment is very important. But I think they should show also the volatiles both Desmidum and Maize when both plants sharing the soil, because it might be possible to interact both plants under the soil.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively addressed the concern of below ground root-root interactions above. We hope that the response and amendments in the manuscript address the point raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) About the oviposition preference experiment, I think they should use the corn with Desmisum sharing soil also in the wind tunnel experiment, because of the same reason as above.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, and in fact the below ground interactions were the start of our studies resulting in the current manuscript. We indeed tested volatile emissions from maize and Desmodium under different regimes (soils) with and without co-planting. There was no difference in the resulting headspace. In subsequent cage experiments, we tested co-planted maize and Desmodium, which tests if co-planting changes oviposition rate and preference. Based on these finding, we would not expect differences whether co-planted or not. We went on to further test preference in the wind tunnel. These tests addressed another question, that of whether oviposition on maize is influenced by the volatile background of Desmodium. Since Desmodium has a similar volatile profile whether co-planted or not, we would not expect any difference if we instead would have used co-planted Desmodium and maize. In addition, more practically, if co-planted plants would have been used, similarly to the cage experiments, it would have been impossible to separate olfaction from taste and other tactile stimuli in the ovipositing moth. Regardless of this practicality, we agree that there is room for further experiments, yet, the data presented give no indication to expect dramatic changes in preference and do not warrant more of these experiments. We do, however, indicate in the final part of the manuscript that further detailed experiments on microbe-root and root-root interactions are warranted, as literature evidence over the last decades indicates that such roles, particularly of microbiome-root interactions, may further shape plant insect interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please explain, why larvae prefer Desmidum, and how larvae find Desmisum.</p></disp-quote><p>The first instar S. frugiperda larvae are very motile and can disperse using silk threads over larger distances (several meters). This dispersion is a stochastic process that is not directed by the larval senses. In the field setting where maize and Desmodium is intercropped, the dispersion onto the Desmodium row from maize is highly likely, particularly since Desmodium is a continuous perennial interrow crop.</p><p>When it comes to feeding preference and choice in the behavioral setup, this can be driven by multiple senses such as olfaction (volatiles released particularly upon feeding), gustation (gustatory stimuli that suggest a certain quality of the plant), mechanical stimuli (the toughness of the leaf surface, which is particularly important in early larval stages), and vision (reflection of the leaf surface). Mechanical hindrance may also interplay here, as indicated above. Although L1 larvae appeared to move freely over the Desmodium leaf surface, the small uncinate trichomes could possibly slowed or arrested larvae to some extent and induce prolonged feeding. Whether the observed ‘preference’ is due to choice or due to other factors is not known, but the question is ecologically not so relevant, as L1 larvae do not have the chance of ‘choosing’ between the two host plants, as they are either located on maize or on Desmodium. What is important here is that L1 larvae are not at all inhibited to eat from Desmodium and not pressed to disperse further because of unpalatability of Desmodium. Later larval instars are much more hindered by trichomes and can be entirely arrested and killed by them. Here the question of whether they will eat from Desmodium becomes somewhat less relevant as other mechanisms exist that truncate larval development of later stages.</p><p>In other studies on non-glandular trichomes larvae appeared to decrease feeding intensity (Kariyat et el. 2017). However, these experiments investigated trichomes with different morphologies for example stellar and uniseriate trichome types that do not hinder movement as much as uncinate (hooked) trichomes. We hypothesise that the increased feeding is a transient phenomenon particularly important for first larval instars. In addition, trichomes might affect larvae in an instar-dependent manner. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of herbivore-suppression by uncinate trichomes and their physiological effects on larval development and population dynamics in the field. This we highlight in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I think they should mention about the possibility of plant communication between Maize and Desmoduim in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Plant-plant communication through volatiles is a relevant aspect of the intercropping system that is as of yet understudied. We added a line that such communication may further shape the outcome of Desmodium-maize intercropping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4 A. I don't understand the reason the total number of larvae are the lowest in Maize/Maize among the set. Did many larvae not on the leaf disc when the Maize/Maize treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>There is a stochastic effect caused by a combination of the high motility of L1 larvae, combined with a lower ‘preference’ for maize. The leaf surface of maize, even of young maize leaves used here, is tough, particularly for small larvae. As a result larvae tended to move more and therefore at any moment in time fewer larvae resided on the leaves (which is what we scored) than in Desmodium (which elicited feeding more efficiently), in spite of having the same number of larvae in the Petri dish. In addition, it may be that unicate trichomes lowered motility of larvae on Desmodium and thus increased the time spent on the leaves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I think they should mention the result of the soil experiment in the abstract even if there was no relation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We included the description of this experiment in the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Along these lines, some statements still need rectification so that this manuscript is placed correctly in context. For example, this statement in the summary is no longer true and needs to be rectified: &quot;Surprisingly, however, Desmodium does not constitutively release volatiles nor repels pests. Astoundingly, in spite of the massive research output on push–pull, no primary data on either volatile release or repellence of Desmodium has been published.&quot; It would now be appropriate to point out that the authors have not found abundant constitutive volatile release by Desmodium, and that primary data on Desmodium volatiles and behavioral effects on moths were published only recently despite the use of those expectations in models of push–pull (built on a system using different companion plants) for decades. Ideally, a relevant preprint could also be briefly addressed in the authors' discussion (https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs–2535302/v1), although it is appropriate that the main effort of comparison is made with the peer–reviewed study from Sobhy et al.</p><p>Similarly, the authors should be cautious to use precise language.</p><p>– Exaggerated language is sometimes used to make a point, rather than emphasizing gaps and data using accepted terminology (astoundingly, deathtrap, etc.).

In push–pull fields, the two crops share soil but are commonly spaced so that they do not grow into each other when the maize is young (in part to avoid competition).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in the field, Desmodium is in the interrow and does not overlap with maize in the early growth stages. Later, maize overshadows Desmodium and contact is frequent. It is indeed possible that the close proximity may have resulted in ‘oviposition errors’ by females and thus lowered the discrimination (although also demonstrating that Desmodium perse is not ‘repellent’ in the strict sense). We indeed expect that in the field the preference for maize is more pronounced due to this. We included a sentence in the Results section to highlight that. The wind tunnel studies complement the cage experiments by providing only a Desmodium odor background. No repellence was observed in these settings, complementing the cage experiments in that there was no evidence of spatial repellence by Desmodium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Usually proportion of eggs laid on plants versus on walls etc. is reported – apologies if I overlooked this, but I didn't see it here.</p></disp-quote><p>This data was only included in the public repository and we included it in this version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More critically, eggs and not only egg batches should be counted. Egg batches can vary greatly in size. This could make the difference between finding significantly less oviposition on desmodium versus maize, or not (Figure 3).

The ratio of eggs and egg batches on the plants showed a very similar pattern.

Commonly, these are used to observe initial responses. What is the reason here, and how do the 12 h data differ from observations commonly made in wind tunnels (first choice, number of approaches within 5–10 min, and so on)? Why combine a very long wind tunnel assay with a relatively, although not uncommonly long (48 h) oviposition assay, rather than using the wind tunnel to observe early decisions?</p></disp-quote><p>The wind tunnel was used to set up a choice bioassay and it was not used and interpreted as a wind tunnel assay to assess the initial responses of females. We aimed at designing an additional oviposition assay, where only the volatile emission of Desmodium plants could influence the oviposition on maize plants and the further visual, tactile or gustatory cues are excluded. We aimed at comparing the oviposition of females in the presence of Desmodium plants compared to the presence of Desmodium volatile emissions. We used this modified wind tunnel as we could fit the maize plants in the foreground and the Desmodium plants in the background, while simultaneously masking the additional visual cues.</p><p>Indeed, wind tunnel bioassays are often short of duration. In our experience, however, female oviposition choice can include a rather long response time. Animals can in some cases be more forced to make choices, e.g. through ageing, deprivation of mating, absence of stimuli following mating, lower female calorie intake (lower weight, easier flight) etc. but in our experiments we decided to provide a longer time window, such that females displayed their behavior more naturally and were not forced to display a certain behavior (which could perhaps skewing choices).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similarly, many aspects of experimental design were not comparable between this study and Sobhy. Choice of plant comparisons is addressed, but not issues of animal and plant age, handling, and timing. It would be helpful to summarize these similarly as is done for the choice of plant comparisons. Generally, choices about moth age and handling and plant age and handling are critical for interpreting bioassay results and should be clearly explained (and backed by data and observations).</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps good to reiterate here that our paper was published online before Sohby et al.’s paper. We conducted our experimental work without knowing of each other’s study. Unfortunately, however, our study‘s peer review got delayed. It is though worth to evaluate if there is anything obvious in the experimental design that could lead to different results. Compared to Sohby et al’s Materials and methods, there were no obvious differences that could be suggested as possible cause to difference in results. We added this to our description in the Results section. We insert here a table comparing the two studies. We also highlighted the sections in the Materials and methods that detail the age of the plants and insects.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>experiment</th><th>specimen</th><th>Sobhy et al.</th><th>manuscript</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">volatile collection</td><td align="left" valign="top">Desmodium</td><td align="left" valign="top">no information</td><td align="left" valign="top">6- 8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">wind tunnel oviposition</td><td align="left" valign="top">Desmodium</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">11 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">wind tunnel oviposition</td><td align="left" valign="top">Maize</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">4-5 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">cage oviposition</td><td align="left" valign="top">Desmodium</td><td align="left" valign="top">4-5 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="top">8 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">cage oviposition</td><td align="left" valign="top">Maize</td><td align="left" valign="top">2-3 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="top">3-4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">wind/cage</td><td align="left" valign="top">S. frugiperda</td><td align="left" valign="top">2 days old mated</td><td align="left" valign="top">6 days old mated</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>A personal note: we try to avoid too detailed comparison as it comes with the risk of casting doubt over some of the results of our colleagues' work, while time will show (see also below). In our opinion, it serves no purpose when there are reasonable underlying causes of the difference, namely induction: the apparent absence of terpenoid volatiles can only be explained by that the amounts are below detection thresholds(our manuscript), while there are several possible scenarios (mites, aphids or other herbivores that can cause unnoticed damage, or even remaining egg batches in cages as is commonly found in Lepidoptera, perhaps below ground herbivory), that may have resulted in the observation of volatile terpenoids (Sohby et al.). Our study demonstrated in more than 300 samples from laboratory and field that volatile emission by uninduced healthy Desmodium is very low, generally below threshold, and Desmodium displayed a low inducibility upon S. frugiperda attack, while in contrast maize was much more inducible. We respect our colleagues' work, and would like to not detail the comparison too much. We trust this comes naturally in due time. We hope you agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the authors support an argument about how their results should compare to a more recent publication from Sobhy and colleagues, they do not address the electrophysiological results in the Sobhy study. Do those results affect conclusions about the different behaviors reported in this study, versus by Sobhy?</p></disp-quote><p>The EAD data data only demonstrate sensitivity of the antennae to the compounds, which was already known from previous studies. How that translates into behavior is always a big question, as one cannot extract behavioral significance from sensory responses.</p><p>Some points of caution here: Sohby et al. did not include a positive control, making it hard to assess if the plants were indeed intact or what their level of damage was. It is interesting to note that the volatile profile of intact Desmodium plants showed a high variation, which was visible when comparing the GC-EAD recordings, even though they were described as coming from the same plant sample. In our study we have found that Desmodium plants do hardly emit detectable amounts of volatile terpenoids in the absence of herbivory, and low amounts following herbivory. This contrasted strongly with herbivore induced maize plants, both in the lab and field. The fact that the volatile profiles described by Sobhy et al. are similar to the volatile profiles of Desmodium plants under herbivory in our study, and the fact that the volatile profiles in that paper are highly variable between recordings hint that there might be an underlying effect of recent herbivory. Regardless, we do think that the GC-EAD of Sohby et al. highlight that, similar to maize, the emission of monoterpenoids by Desmodium plants during herbivory by S. frugiperda larvae can be detected by natural enemies and ovipositing females and this may have implications for pest suppression in field settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should check for correct and appropriate scientific language and grammar, e.g.</p><p>– Remove some adverbs (make your point based on your evidence, not on repeating &quot;surprisingly&quot;, &quot;shockingly&quot;, etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the text and removed the repetitive adverbs.

Rather, they can state that in several experiments with an established method, they did not detect them or only in low amounts in comparison to maize plants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We intended to clarify this in the previous version, but apparently there were some points where this was not yet clear. We went thoroughly through the whole text to make sure that we did not find any detectable amounts of terpenoid volatiles. We indeed cannot say anything about what might have been below the analytical detection limits of our methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They must acknowledge that there can be differences between the Desmodium measured in Kenya and what they grew in Sweden and measured in Tanzania. This is also very important for the larger discussion on push–pull. We are not working with a Desmodium inbred line and there are large environmental gradients.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a rather diverse genetic background in Desmodium. This was already obvious in the phenotypic diversity displayed in the seedlings in greenhouse experiments. In the field other biotic and abiotic variations interplay in this variation. To account for variation, we sampled not only from greenhouse grown Desmodium (with seeds from Simlaw, Kenya), but also from the field from three geographic locations, in East African high and lowlands. We have tried to further accentuate the importance of variation in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is almost certainly less sensitive to measure with an equilibrium technique than to quantitatively collect over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree and we addressed this point extensively in the speculations section, in response to a previous review at <italic>ELife</italic>. We changed the wording to accentuate this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Plants in the field may be damaged and it is not unrealistic or misleading to measure volatiles from plants grown from the same stock and under similar conditions. The aim of the Sobhy study was detection in the study system, not to assess the causes of volatile emissions. So the authors should not imply that the resulting measurements are unrepresentative of push–pull because there was not strict control on the use of pristine plants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, but were actually puzzled as we did not find where in the manuscript we suggested that the data presented in Sohby et al. are not representative of field conditions. We certainly do not mean to say that. We merely point out that the direct comparison of our data with those of Sohby et al. is tenuous as (1) at onset the questions in both studies were very different and accordingly the experimental protocols, and (2) Sohby et al. did not include the controls that would be necessary to make the comparisons. However, we would be happy to receive a more concrete suggestion on where it is we should modify the text.</p><p>In this context it is also important to note that, since what is observed in the greenhouse may not be representative of what happens under field conditions, we measured volatile production by Desmodium in the field in three geographic locations in East Africa. These show low and variable amounts of volatiles by Desmodium, much lower than maize, and similar to herbivore-induced Desmodium in greenhouses. The fact that there is emission of some volatiles, albeit very low, is in line with Sohby et al. that Desmodium can be induced to release volatiles.</p><p>Finally, we went through the text once more and attenuated the text where we felt it would help the flow and reduce the contrast with Sohby et al.</p></body></sub-article></article>
