nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Mechanical membrane disruption or perturbation to NPC assembly triggers an ESCRT-dependent surveillance system that seals nuclear pores: how these pores are sensed and sealed is ill defined. Using a budding yeast model, we show that the ESCRT Chm7 and the integral inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein Heh1 are spatially segregated by nuclear transport, with Chm7 being actively exported by Xpo1/Crm1. Thus, the exposure of the INM triggers surveillance with Heh1 locally activating Chm7. Sites of Chm7 hyperactivation show fenestrated sheets at the INM and potential membrane delivery at sites of nuclear envelope herniation. Our data suggest that perturbation to the nuclear envelope barrier would lead to local nuclear membrane remodeling to promote membrane sealing. Our findings have implications for disease mechanisms linked to NPC assembly and nuclear envelope integrity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45284.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>With the exception of bacteria, living cells contain most of their DNA inside a structure called the nucleus. The membranes of the nucleus form a protective wall around the DNA, while pores within this wall act as entry check-points, controlling what can and cannot get inside. Maintaining the structure of this wall is critical for cell survival. Problems can occur if the nuclear wall or its pores become disrupted, as in the case of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Thankfully cells have developed a protective surveillance system that can rapidly identify and repair any damage made to the nuclear wall. However, how this damage is found and what activates its repair is poorly understood.</p><p>Now, Thaller et al. have investigated two key proteins that they suspected were involved in the surveillance of the nuclear border in budding yeast: Chm7 and Heh1. Chm7 is part of a complex group of proteins that can cut and sculpt the shape of membranes, while Heh1 is normally embedded on the inside of the nucleus. Thaller et al. discovered that, when the nuclear wall is disrupted, Heh1 recruits Chm7 to the site of damage and activates it. Once activated Chm7 can repair the damage to the nuclear wall, by sealing over defective nuclear pores and closing gaps caused by breakages.</p><p>Thaller et al. showed that the transport system that normally moves molecules into and out of the nucleus also imports Heh1 and actively excludes Chm7, physically segregating them to opposite sides of the nuclear border. If the nuclear wall becomes damaged this leads to the local meeting of Heh1 and Chm7 at these sites. Heh1 will then activate the membrane shaping mechanisms of Chm7, rapidly repairing the nuclear border in response to the damage.</p><p>It is possible cell structures other than the nucleus use a similar surveillance system to protect their borders. Manipulating the border surveillance system of the nucleus could be used to treat the detrimental impacts of damage caused to the nuclear wall by disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ESCRT</kwd><kwd>LEM2</kwd><kwd>CHMP7</kwd><kwd>nuclear transport</kwd><kwd>surveillance</kwd><kwd>herniation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship 6885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thaller</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thaller</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship ALTF-1389-2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allegretti</surname><given-names>Matteo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM105672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lusk</surname><given-names>C Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ESCRT-driven mechanisms that sense and seal holes in the nuclear membranes directly monitor the nuclear transport system and the exposure of the inner nuclear membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular machinery that biochemically segregates the nucleus and the cytoplasm has been extensively investigated. The foundational components of this selective barrier include the double-membrane nuclear envelope with embedded nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). NPCs impose a ‘soft’ diffusion barrier to macromolecules larger than ~40 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Timney et al., 2016</xref>) while providing binding sites for the rapid and selective transport of signal-bearing (nuclear localization and nuclear export signals; NLSs and NESs) macromolecules, which are ferried through the NPC by shuttling nuclear transport receptors (NTRs; a.k.a. karyopherins/importins/exportins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Schmidt and Görlich, 2016</xref>). Directionality and energy for NTR-selective transport is imparted by the spatial segregation of the Ran-GTPase whose nuclear GTP-bound form destabilizes and stabilizes import and export complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Floch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the robustness of the nuclear envelope barrier has been shown to be compromised in several different contexts, including in diverse human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hatch and Hetzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lusk and King, 2017</xref>). For example, there is an emerging body of work linking the function of NTRs and NPCs with neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nousiainen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Freibaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jovičić et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaneb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kim and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). These studies, coupled to the observations of age-related declines in NPC function in both post-mitotic multicellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Savas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>) and also in replicative aging models like budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lord et al., 2015</xref>), support a theme in which the function of the nuclear envelope could be mitigatory of age-related disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schreiber and Kennedy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jevtić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Serebryannyy and Misteli, 2018</xref>). Of similar interest, the hallmark cellular pathophysiology of early-onset dystonia are nuclear envelope herniations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodchild et al., 2005</xref>) that emanate from NPC-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Laudermilch et al., 2016</xref>). As analogous herniations have been observed in many genetic backgrounds associated with defects in NPC biogenesis in yeast over several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Thaller and Lusk, 2018</xref>), this has contributed to the idea that the herniations might be the result of either defective NPC assembly events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Onischenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and/or the triggering of a NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wente and Blobel, 1993</xref>) or NPC assembly quality control pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). The latter could depend on the function of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), a membrane scission machinery that has been proposed to seal-off malforming NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>That there could be mechanisms to surveil the assembly of NPCs makes considerable sense as there are hundreds of NPCs, each containing hundreds of nucleoporins/nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), that are assembled during interphase in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Maul et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010</xref>). There are approximately 100 NPCs formed during a budding yeast cell cycle, which includes a closed mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Winey et al., 1997</xref>). As interphase NPC assembly likely occurs through an inside-out evagination of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) followed by membrane fusion with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>), holes are constantly being formed in the nuclear envelope. Without mechanisms to surveil this process, de novo NPC biogenesis might pose a threat to nuclear-cytoplasmic compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this idea, malformed or damaged NPCs are not passed on to daughter cells in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Makio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). Further, deletion of the ESCRT machinery in the context of genetic backgrounds where nuclear envelope herniations have been observed for example <italic>nup116Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wente and Blobel, 1993</xref>) or <italic>apq12Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>) cells require a nuclear envelope-specific ESCRT, Chm7 (the orthologue of mammalian CHMP7), for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). While we have previously proposed that a biochemical signature of malforming NPCs is surveilled by integral inner nuclear membrane proteins of the Lap2-emerin-MAN1 (LEM) domain family, specifically Heh2, it remains to be formally established what the signal that leads to ESCRT recruitment to the nuclear envelope actually comprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Evidence that the ESCRT machinery acts at holes in the nuclear envelope is further exemplified by their critical role in performing annular fusion events during the final stages of nuclear envelope reformation at the end of mitosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Olmos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Olmos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Ventimiglia et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, ESCRTs are also required for the efficient repair of nuclear ruptures that arise during the migration of cells through tight constrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Raab et al., 2016</xref>). And, it is most likely that they also act to repair nuclear envelope ruptures that are induced by intracellular mechanical stresses from either the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hatch and Hetzer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Robijns et al., 2016</xref>), or from those observed during telomere crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Maciejowski et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, recent work also suggests a role for ESCRTs in the context of turning over NPCs in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Toyama et al., 2019</xref>). It remains an open question, however, whether the mechanisms that repair nuclear ruptures, seal the nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis, and protect against defective NPC assembly respond to an identical upstream signal and proceed through the same membrane-sealing mechanism.</p><p>Clues to what might constitute the upstream signal that leads to nuclear envelope-recruitment of ESCRTs could be drawn from other contexts where ESCRTs protect membrane compartments including endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Radulovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Skowyra et al., 2018</xref>) and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Scheffer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2017</xref>). In both of these cases, there is evidence to suggest that the local release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a trigger for ESCRT recruitment, through (at least at the plasma membrane) a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, ALG-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2017</xref>). Whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a role at the nuclear envelope remains unaddressed. More generally, there are two, often redundant, recruitment mechanisms seeded by either an ESCRT-I, II complex and/or ESCRT-II and ALIX (Bro1 in yeast) that bind and activate ESCRT-III subunit polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wemmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christ et al., 2016</xref>) on specific membranes throughout the cell (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">McCullough et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>ESCRT-III polymers predominantly made up of the most abundant ESCRT-III (Snf7/CHMP4B) scaffold negative but also in at least one case, positive membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>), and directly contribute to membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schöneberg et al., 2018</xref>). The AAA +ATPase Vps4 disassembles ESCRT-III filaments by directly interacting with MIM (MIT interacting motif) domains present on a subset of ESCRT-III subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Han et al., 2015</xref>) by threading the ESCRT-III filaments through the central cavity of a hexameric ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Su et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that ESCRT-III disassembly by Vps4 directly contributes force to promote membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schöneberg et al., 2018</xref>). Whether the membrane scission reaction is different in distinct subcellular contexts like at the nuclear envelope remains to be understood.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that there might be unique ESCRT membrane remodeling mechanisms at play in distinct compartments, a step-wise recruitment and activation mechanism requiring the ESCRT-II Vps25 and the ESCRT-III Vps20 is thought to be required at budding yeast endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Saksena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Teis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), but both of these proteins are absent from the genetic and biochemical analyses of the nuclear envelope arm of the ESCRT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that other proteins likely contribute to ESCRT-III activation at the nuclear envelope. Key candidates are Chm7 and the inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins, Heh1/Src1 (orthologue of LEM2) and Heh2 (orthologue of MAN1 or other LEM-domain proteins). These proteins have collectively been shown to interact biochemically and genetically with Snf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>) and Heh1 is required for the focal accumulation of Chm7 at the nuclear envelope in genetic backgrounds where NPC assembly is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, the interactions between Heh1 and Chm7 are well conserved in both fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gu et al., 2017</xref>) but also in mammalian cells, where LEM2 is required to recruit CHMP7 to the reforming nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gu et al., 2017</xref>). It remains to be understood, however, whether LEM proteins (or Chm7) directly contribute to ESCRT-III activation at the nuclear envelope or whether additional proteins are involved.</p><p>Heh1 and Heh2 contain an N-terminal helix-extension-helix (heh) motif (the LEM domain), followed by an INM targeting sequence that (at least in the case of Heh2 but likely also Heh1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">King et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lokareddy et al., 2015</xref>]) includes an NLS and a ~ 200 amino acid unstructured region that are both required for INM targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Meinema et al., 2011</xref>). They both also contain a second nuclear-oriented domain, which likely folds into a winged helix (WH) (also called MAN1/Src1-C-terminal homology domain or MSC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caputo et al., 2006</xref>); this domain is also well conserved through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mekhail et al., 2008</xref>). The LEM domain proteins as a family have been ascribed diverse roles in gene expression either through binding to transcription factors, BAF, or the lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton et al., 2015</xref>). While yeasts lack BAF and lamins, the LEM domain proteins nonetheless directly interface with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton et al., 2015</xref>), contribute to rDNA repeat stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mekhail et al., 2008</xref>) and the mechanical robustness of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schreiner et al., 2015</xref>). This latter function is likely revealed by the observation in many diverse yeast species that loss of Heh1 leads to nuclear envelope disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Yewdell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Yam et al., 2013</xref>), however, it might also reflect Heh1’s role in recruiting ESCRTs to the nuclear envelope. Thus, the relationship between how the LEM proteins contribute to nuclear integrity and ESCRT-mediated surveillance remains to be clearly defined.</p><p>In the following, we further explore the molecular determinants of Chm7 recruitment to the budding yeast nuclear envelope by Heh1. We determine that the spatial segregation of Chm7 and Heh1 on either side of the nuclear envelope is driven by NTRs and the robustness of the nuclear transport system. Perturbations of this system, or the exposure of Heh1 to the cytosol leads to the local recruitment and Heh1 WH-dependent activation of Chm7. At sites of Chm7 hyperactivation, we observe remarkable alterations to nuclear envelope morphology including nuclear envelope herniations and intranuclear INM invaginations suggesting a role for membrane expansion and remodeling during nuclear envelope repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chm7 is actively exported from the nucleus by Xpo1</title><p>It was our previous experience that visualizing endogenous levels of Chm7-GFP was challenging due to its low level of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>), thus, to gain further insight into the localization determinants of Chm7 in budding yeast, we overexpressed Chm7-GFP behind the control of a galactose (<italic>GAL1</italic>) inducible promoter.

Interestingly, the higher scoring predicted NES (NES2) overlapped with the potential MIM1 motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, the Chm7 putative MIM1 motif stands out from that of other budding yeast ESCRT-IIIs because of an additional isoleucine that contributes the fourth hydrophobic amino acid required for an effective class 1a NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A second leucine in the middle of this region also aligns with the predictive spacing of residues in class 1b NESs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, these putative NESs were conserved in Chm7 orthologues in other species of yeast, mice, flies and humans, although are curiously absent from <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As LocNES predicts NESs specific for the major export NTR, Xpo1/Crm1, we tested whether the inhibition of Xpo1 reversed the nuclear exclusion of Chm7-GFP. For these experiments, we took advantage of the <italic>xpo1-T539C</italic> allele, which sensitizes budding yeast Xpo1 to the Xpo1 inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Neville and Rosbash, 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,</xref> 45 min LMB treatment of cells expressing Chm7-GFP led to the striking accumulation of Chm7-GFP at the periphery of the nucleus most often in highly fluorescent foci in over 60% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is an underestimate as only midplanes were quantified.</p><p>The focal accumulation of Chm7-GFP at the nuclear periphery suggested that Chm7 was able to enter the nucleus upon Xpo1 inhibition. Therefore, to distinguish whether nuclear entry was driven by an active NTR-mediated nuclear import pathway, or, whether it was the result of passive diffusion across the NPC, we generated a Chm7-GFP fused to five maltose-binding proteins (Chm7-MGM4); this ~280 kD protein would be extremely inefficient at transiting through the NPC unless it contained an NLS. Consistent with the idea that Chm7-GFP’s entry into the nucleus was governed by diffusion and not active NLS-mediated transport, the distribution of Chm7-MGM4 was indistinguishable from Chm7-GFP but, in contrast, incubation with LMB had no effect on its localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>As inhibition of Xpo1 led to Chm7-GFP accumulation at the nuclear envelope, we reasoned that it was likely that the prediction of NESs in Chm7 was likely accurate. However, as both NLS and NES prediction is of limited utility, we directly tested whether the predicted NESs were indeed sufficient to prevent an inert GFP reporter from localizing in the nucleus at steady state. We tested the localization of GFP-fusions to each predicted Chm7 NES alone, and in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To help demark the nuclear boundary, these constructs were expressed alongside dsRED-HDEL, which localizes throughout the continuous nuclear envelope/ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, when compared to GFP-alone, all three NES<sub>CHM7</sub>-GFP constructs showed a deficit of nuclear accumulation that could be reversed by treatment with LMB. Interestingly, when we compared line profiles of GFP fluorescence drawn from the cytosol and bisecting the nucleus, NES1<sub>CHM7</sub>-GFP was more obviously excluded from the nucleus than NES2<sub>CHM7</sub>-GFP with NES1-2<sub>CHM7</sub>-GFP showing the most striking absence of nuclear signal (compare the depth of the ‘valleys’ of the red lines; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that both predicted NESs contribute to the efficient export of Chm7. Consistent with this, the examination of a truncation of Chm7 (chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) lacking both NESs dramatically accumulates in one or two foci on the nuclear envelope in a way that is not impacted by LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the steady state nuclear exclusion of Chm7 in wildtype cells is determined by its passive diffusion into the nucleus and the Xpo1-mediated recognition of NESs in Chm7. That, having entered the nucleus, Chm7 accumulates in a focus along the nuclear periphery is consistent with its binding and activation at the INM. The latter being reflected in its focal accumulation, which would be consistent with a polymerization event.</p><p>That Chm7 can be recruited and activated at the INM without any perturbation to the nuclear envelope raises the possibility that there are no other upstream signals that are necessary to trigger Chm7 recruitment. While this is difficult to conclusively prove, we nonetheless tested whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> could reflect an additional signal because of its role in other ESCRT-mediated membrane repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Scheffer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Skowyra et al., 2018</xref>). As Chm7 is recruited to the nuclear envelope in <italic>apq12Δ</italic> cells when grown at elevated (37°C) temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>), we evaluated whether this recruitment was influenced by chelating Ca<sup>2+</sup> using BAPTA-AM.

To test this hypothesis, we generated deletion constructs of Heh1 coupled to the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) expressed behind the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (note that there is vacuolar autofluorescence even under repressed glucose conditions, see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Unlike many other INM proteins that tend to back up into the ER upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lusk et al., 2007</xref>), Heh1-RFP continues to accumulate at the INM even at high levels due to its use of an active NTR-dependent INM targeting pathway (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">King et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, even when overexpressed at levels that we estimate to be an order of magnitude higher than endogenous levels, the majority of Heh1 is localized to the INM and would be predicted to be inaccessible to cytosolic Chm7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, galactose, middle panels). Consistent with this, we observed no change to the steady state distribution of endogenously-expressed Chm7-GFP, which includes a minor fraction within a nuclear envelope focus in ~30% of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Shot-gun MS identification of peptides derived from bound proteins to Chm7-GFP now revealed specific interactions with several ESCRTs including Snf7 and Vps36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In addition, another low abundant (~354 molecules/cell; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>) integral INM protein, Nur1 was also detected. As Nur1 is known to interact with Heh1 within the CLIP (chromosome linkage INM proteins) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mekhail et al., 2008</xref>), these data suggest that Chm7 engages Heh1 within a broader INM platform, at least in the context of cells lacking <italic>VPS4</italic>.

Thus, we investigated whether a functional Vps4-GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adell et al., 2017</xref>) could also be specifically recruited to the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> focus at the nuclear envelope, which it was in virtually all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of Vps4-GFP could be correlated to that of the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>-mCherry focus, suggesting a close relationship between the number of Chm7 and Vps4 molecules recruited to this nuclear envelope site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We therefore next assessed the molecular determinants of Vps4-GFP recruitment to the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> site by first focusing on deleting the genes encoding ESCRT-III subunits found in the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>-GFP affinity purifications including <italic>SNF7</italic>, <italic>VPS24, VPS2</italic>, and <italic>DID2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In all these deletion strains, Vps4-GFP recruitment to chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>-mCherry foci was reduced or, in the case of <italic>snf7Δ</italic> cells completely eliminated, with minimal impact on the accumulation of chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>-mCherry itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>); although we noted that the average area encompassed by the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>-mcherry focus was increased in <italic>snf7Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data support a model in which Vps4 may be recruited to the nuclear envelope using a similar cohort of ESCRT-III interactions as those observed at endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babst et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we also tested <italic>ist1Δ</italic> and <italic>vps60Δ</italic> cells, which encode proteins that impact Vps4 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dimaano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Rue et al., 2008</xref>) and ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azmi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) at endosomes. In both of these strains, there was a modest decrease of Vps4-GFP fluorescence at the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub>-mCherry foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In marked contrast to the disruption of ESCRT-III components that act downstream of Snf7, deletion of <italic>VPS20</italic>, which acts upstream of Snf7 at endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Teis et al., 2008</xref>) and is absent from the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>), we observed a remarkable ~3 fold increase of Vps4-GFP at the nuclear chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data suggest that in the absence of the endosome ESCRT arm, there is a larger pool of Vps4 that is available to interact with the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> network at the nuclear envelope. Importantly, the total Vps4-GFP protein levels were not notably altered in any of the ESCRT deletion backgrounds tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Together, these data reinforce that there are unique components of the endosome and nuclear envelope ESCRT pathways, but Vps4 can nonetheless be recruited to the INM alongside or downstream of Snf7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Fluorescence ESCRT Targeting and Activation (FETA) Assay</title><p>Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> is able to shift the distribution of both Heh1 and Nur1 from an evenly-distributed nuclear peripheral localization to one that is co-localized with the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> focus. This raised the formal possibility that Chm7 recruitment to the nuclear envelope might in fact be independent of and precede binding to Heh1; in such a model Heh1 would be required for its focal accumulation, which we interpret to be ‘activation’. Thus, this result illustrated the need to develop a better controlled experimental system where the mechanism of Chm7 recruitment and activation can be decoupled. We thus conceived of an experimental approach that we termed the <underline>F</underline>luorescent <underline>E</underline>SCRT <underline>T</underline>argeting and <underline>A</underline>ctivation Assay (FETA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Thus, without any perturbations to the nuclear envelope barrier, we can monitor the recruitment and activation of Chm7-GFP at the nuclear envelope, the latter of which we interpret as the local clustering of Chm7 as the most logical visual outcome of Chm7 polymerization at the level of fluorescence microscopy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45284.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Heh1 is required to induce the focal accumulation of Chm7.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ‘Fluorescence ESCRT Targeting and Activation Assay’ where Heh2 is expressed as a fusion to GFP-binding protein (GBP; red).

We therefore next investigated whether deletion of <italic>CHM7</italic> impacted the prevalence of herniations in <italic>apq12Δ</italic> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and D</xref>, deletion of <italic>CHM7</italic> had little impact on the number of herniations observed in thin sections of <italic>apq12Δ</italic> cells, which were only modestly reduced (23% versus 31% of nuclei; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Similar nuclear envelope discontinuities were observed in <italic>apq12Δsnf7Δ</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Indeed, in some cases we could observe nucleoplasm escaping into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, left panel).

Thus, while these NPC-assembly-associated nuclear envelope herniations might not require <italic>CHM7</italic> or <italic>SNF7</italic> for their biogenesis, ESCRTs are nonetheless required to maintain the integrity of the nuclear membranes in the context of these herniations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While there has been considerable focus over the last few decades on mechanisms that control the targeting of proteins and lipids to distinct intracellular compartments, it is equally important to understand the protective mechanisms that maintain this compartmentalization in the face of challenges to membrane integrity and/or the specific biochemical identity of organelles. Here, we further explore the mechanism of ESCRT surveillance of the nuclear envelope. We interpret our data in a model where the nuclear envelope is surveilled by two principle components, the ESCRT Chm7 and the integral INM protein, Heh1. This surveillance system appears to be set up to respond directly to perturbations in the nuclear envelope barrier in a way that we suggest is agnostic as to whether the perturbation is a result of defectively formed NPCs or a mechanical (or other) disruption of the nuclear membranes.</p><p>The rationale behind this assertion is that the nuclear envelope surveillance system is itself directly established by a functioning nuclear transport system, which physically segregates Chm7 and Heh1 on either side of the nuclear envelope. For example, prior work has shown that Heh1 requires the function of the NTRs Kap-α and Kap-β1 in addition to the Ran-GTPase in order to be actively targeted to the INM through NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">King et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we establish that Chm7, while small enough to passively leak through the NPC diffusion barrier, is actively exported by the major export NTR, Xpo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, any perturbations that impact active nuclear transport or the diffusion barrier across the nuclear envelope would lead to increased Chm7 diffusion into the nucleus and/or a deficit in its nuclear export increasing the likelihood that it meets Heh1. While similar perturbations could also lead to Heh1 mistargeting and/or its diffusion into the ONM, we suspect that this would be kinetically slower than Chm7 diffusion into the nucleus as Heh1 is bound to chromatin at the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mekhail et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Yam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schreiner et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, it is probable that Heh1 functions in two major roles with respect to nuclear integrity: first, it provides mechanical stability to the nucleus by binding chromatin, and second, provides a binding site for Chm7 through its C-terminal WH domain. These two inter-related roles could also help to explain why both the N- and C-terminal domains of Heh1 are required to maintain viability of <italic>apq12Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and why <italic>HEH1</italic> is generally more essential in budding and fission yeasts compared to <italic>CHM7</italic>. This likely holds true in mammalian models as well as LEM2 is essential whereas CHMP7 is dispensable for viability (in cell culture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hart et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Once a perturbation occurs to the nuclear envelope barrier through defects in NPC assembly, loss of function of NPCs, or mechanical disruption of the nuclear membranes, Chm7 and Heh1 are able to come together. While we have so far been unsuccessful in reconstituting a direct biochemical interaction between Chm7 and Heh1 (although others have between LEM2 and CHMP7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gu et al., 2017</xref>]), we have nonetheless provided evidence that this interaction likely leads to Chm7 activation, thus tightly coupling recruitment and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our data support a model in which the C-terminal WH domain of Heh1 in addition to a membrane anchor are necessary and sufficient for this activation event. As our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>) and that from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Olmos et al. (2016)</xref>, support that it is the N-terminal ESCRT-II-like domain of Chm7 (which, interestingly, is also predicted to be made up of tandem WH domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Horii et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>]) that is necessary for recruitment to the nuclear envelope, it seems likely that the binding between the Heh1-WH domain and the N-terminus of Chm7 could trigger activation by removing some form of autoinhibition, which is a common theme among ESCRT-III proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zamborlini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Shim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bajorek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) that ensures polymerization in the correct compartment. Clearly, the precise molecular mechanism of Chm7 activation by Heh1 will require structural insight, which is no doubt on the horizon.</p><p>Even with structural information, there are many additional factors that need to incorporated into a nuclear envelope surveillance mechanism. For example, future work must directly address how Heh2 fits into this pathway. While Heh2 has a similar domain architecture as Heh1 including a WH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">King et al., 2006</xref>), it does not appear to impact Chm7 activation within the FETA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), nor was it detected in any of the affinity purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was surprising, as we had previously established that the N-terminus of Heh2 (that lacks the WH domain), can directly bind to both Chm7 and Snf7, at least in their ‘open’ forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we reported physical interactions between Chm7 and Snf7 with Heh2 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>). While there are many possible explanations for these results, we favor models that consider Heh2 in a regulatory role that might modulate Chm7 and/or Snf7 function at the nuclear envelope, although this remains speculative and awaits direct experimentation.</p><p>Additional downstream (of Chm7 and Heh1) components also need to be figured into any nuclear envelope surveillance mechanism including Snf7, but also Did2, Vps24 and Vps2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). That these ESCRT-IIIs impact the recruitment of Vps4 to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) raises the possibility that the sequence of their recruitment might be similar to that found at ILVs during MVB formation, which begins with Snf7 and ends with Did2, Vps24, and Vps2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Babst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Teis et al., 2008</xref>), the latter of which play important roles in Vps4 recruitment and ATPase activation required for membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azmi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Shestakova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schöneberg et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, however, while we observe Vps4 recruitment to sites of chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> at the INM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we do not have any explicit evidence for membrane scission per se. Indeed, the INM evaginations and nuclear envelope herniations appear to be stabilized by ~45 nm diameter necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>). That these necks have similar diameters to those observed at the plasma membrane or endosomes when HIV budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Morita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cashikar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>) or ILV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frankel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Wenzel et al., 2018</xref>), respectively, are stalled, is suggestive that they are stabilized by a similar ESCRT-III-like polymer. We suggest that the most likely explanation is that Chm7 itself might play a unique role in a nuclear membrane-scission step, perhaps through its potential MIM1 domain that might directly recruit Vps4 but is absent from the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> construct. Such a conclusion is supported by the presence of similar INM evaginations and nuclear envelope herniations observed in the presence of full length Chm7 but lacking Vps4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Any scission mechanism that requires a direct interaction between the MIM1 domain of Chm7 and Vps4 will also need to consider the overlap of this sequence with NES2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This clearly predicts a competition between Xpo1 and Vps4 for Chm7, which provides a potential entryway for an additional level of regulation for any polymer formation or scission reaction by this NTR (that would also be modulated by Ran-GTP). Indeed, NTRs might regulate this pathway at the level of Heh1 as well. Heh1 is synthesized and inserted into ER membranes so is exposed to the cytosol and would thus be capable of binding to Chm7 before it is targeted to the INM. Such an assumption is supported by the observation that the exposure of the WH domain of Heh1 is sufficient to recruit Chm7 to ER membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Does NTR-binding to the NLSs in the N-terminus of Heh1 inhibit Chm7 recruitment in this compartment? Answering this question will also be relevant in mammalian systems where LEM2 and CHMP7 are found in the same compartment during mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown suggesting the need for mechanisms to prevent their binding in this phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, recent work is suggesting that proteins like Lgd/CC2D1B help control the spatiotemporal timing of CHMP4B and CHMP7 activity in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Ventimiglia et al., 2018</xref>), supporting the existence of regulatory mechanisms of this pathway.</p><p>Lgd/CC2D18 acts during nuclear envelope reformation when ESCRTs play critical roles in sealing the nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis, often at sites where spindle microtubules perforate the nascent nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Olmos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Olmos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>). It will be interesting to understand the similarities and differences between how ESCRTs function at the end of mitosis (in an open mitosis) versus events that are triggered upon acute disruption of nuclear envelope integrity or NPC function during interphase. For example, two of the more interesting observations of the EM tomographic analyses are the generation of intranuclear membrane invaginations and the proximity of ER sheets and vesicles at the ONM sites of nuclear envelope herniations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Both of these observations suggest that nuclear envelope surveillance might be coupled to the delivery of new membrane at sites of rupture. It seems plausible that sealing holes in the nuclear envelope (particularly those larger than a nuclear pore) would require the local delivery of membranes. Similarly, NPC quality control mechanisms that suggest the sealing of defective NPCs would likely require some form of expansion of the pore membrane, as has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wente and Blobel, 1993</xref>). Whether such membrane is derived from new synthesis or from the mobilization of existing stores remains to be explored. Of note, recent work supports that even the INM may be metabolically active and have the capacity to generate new lipid locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Romanauska and Köhler, 2018</xref>). Further, close examination of sites of chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> accumulation reveals that the morphology of the INM extensions are both sheet-like and tubular in nature and resemble the ‘normal’ continuities between the ONM and the broader ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">West et al., 2011</xref>); together these data suggest that ER-shaping proteins and lipid synthesis pathways might also play an important role in contributing to nuclear envelope sealing - topics for the future.</p><p>Both ER remodeling proteins and lipid synthesis pathways are required for de novo NPC biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Schneiter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hodge et al., 2010</xref>). As NPC biogenesis proceeds through an INM evagination step, we also must consider whether the INM evaginations observed in the electron tomograms reflect a function for Chm7 in this process. However, while this remains a compelling hypothesis, our data do not yet support this idea. For example, the herniations observed in the context of inhibiting NPC assembly are morphologically distinct from those found in the chm7<sub>OPEN</sub> or <italic>vps4Δpom152Δ</italic> scenarios with wider necks that contain nups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Further, they arise in the absence of <italic>CHM7</italic> and are thus more likely to be formed due to a defect in NPC biogenesis (perhaps because of an inhibition of INM-ONM fusion), or, through the triggering of a NPC assembly surveillance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Webster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Thaller and Lusk, 2018</xref>). Should Chm7 be a critical component of the latter mechanism, it would be predicted that the nuclear envelope herniations associated with nups would be unsealed without <italic>CHM7</italic>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work article &quot;An ESCRT-LEM protein surveillance system is poised to directly monitor the nuclear envelope and nuclear transport system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Thaller et al. address the question of how the nuclear envelope (NE) recognizes and repairs damage that has occurred as a result of mechanical tears of the NE or as a result of mis-assembly of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The authors present evidence that nuclear transport maintains the protein Heh1 on the nuclear side of the NE, and Chm7 – a component of the ESCRT-III membrane remodeling and scission complex – in the cytoplasm. The authors' previous work (Webster et al., 2014 and 2016) established the link between Chm7 and Heh1. In the present manuscript, Heh1 is shown to be required for Chm7 accumulation at nuclear membrane foci, which is taken as an indication of Chm7 activation at the NE – the term 'activation' implies Chm7 polymerization within the larger framework of ESCRT-III, but the nature of this activation beyond accumulation of Chm7 at foci is not developed. A novel light microscopy assay developed by the authors shows that disruption of the NE or of NPC function allows Heh1 and Chm7 to meet locally at the site of disruption and initiate local membrane remodeling. Collectively, the data suggest that recruitment of Chm7 to the sites of Heh1 exposure and subsequent ESCRT-III-dependent membrane sealing represents a surveillance mechanism to repair NE damage and restore nucleocytoplasmic integrity.</p><p>Overall this is an outstanding contribution that was broadly supported by the reviewers. The data are of excellent quality, the authors develop and implement a useful new assay, and the conclusions give insight into the different membrane structures that form in response to NE perturbation. Most importantly, the findings support a mechanistic model that will guide further inquiry into this poorly understood cellular mechanism. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) The title focuses on LEM, but the action is via WH domains. Consider dropping &quot;LEM domain&quot; from the title and/or working &quot;WH domain&quot; into the title in some manner.</p><p>2) By fusing NES2 and the whole NES1-NES2 region to GFP, the authors conclude that the NES2 alone is not sufficient for efficient export, whereas the full NES1-NES2 region is export-proficient. As described in the Discussion, a potential MIM domain overlaps the NES2 in Chm7. Because MIMs are sites in ESCRT-III proteins that bind associated factors (most notably, the Vps4 ATPase that disassembles ESCRT-III polymers), the MIM-NES2 overlap raises the possibility that binding of other proteins to the Chm7 MIM could influence the binding of Xpo1? An experiment to assess if the NES1 is sufficient to exclude Chm7 from the nucleus would be important to shed light on this question.</p><p>3) The MIM motif in Chm7 was described in Bauer et al., 2015. The authors should cite this paper specifically when they describe this motif (paragraph 2 of the Results section).</p><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, please cite a reference for the consensus sequence of the MIM motif.</p><p>5) In Figure 3, interaction partners of the mutant Chm7(open) protein are described from pulldowns. Heh1 is the top hit (along with ESCRT-III components), but Heh2 is not found as an interaction partner. However, the authors' previous work in Webster et al., 2016, established that the N-terminal domain of Heh2 (a homolog of Heh1) can directly interact with the Chm7 C-terminal domain in vitro. Why is Heh2 not detected as a binding partner in vivo? Are Heh2 levels too low to detect; is there no in-vivo binding possible; or does Heh2 never meet Chm7? Additionally, in Figure 5 the authors show that the WH domain of Heh1 is required for the activation of Chm7. Because Heh2 also contains a WH domain, can we assume that (theoretically) Heh2 is also able to activate Chm7? The authors can do a better job discussing this.</p><p>6) The authors should take the opportunity here to expand upon the likely relationship between the NE herniations they observe and those implicated by the Budnik lab in no-NPC mediated RNA export? There is some significant confusion in the field on this point.</p><p>7) Figure 3D, bottom row: please indicate more clearly the channel are we looking at, red or green.</p><p>8) Figure 3E: Vps60 and Ist1 mutants were also tested according to the figure but are not mentioned anywhere in the text. Why were they chosen and what do the authors conclude from the microscopy?</p><p>9) Figure 5: the caption does not cover the contents of panel A and B of this figure at all. Please, rephrase the caption.</p><p>10) Subsection “Chm7 binds to an INM platform”, last paragraph – about Vps20: for clarity, add a sentence about why, in vps20-deleted cells, Vps4-GFP is no longer in cytosolic puncta and has increased levels at the Chm7(open) locus. Is it because Vps20 is the endosomal binding partner of Vps4, and by deleting it, more Vps4 is available for binding at the NE?</p><p>11) Subsection “Fluorescence ESCRT Targeting and Activation (FETA) Assay”, last paragraph – Figure 5C and D: When Heh1(703-834) is expressed, Chm7-GFP is cytosolic. Is it located at the ER?</p><p>12)&quot;there are obvious parallels between morphologies at INM, plasma membrane and endosomes.&quot; To make the Discussion an easier read, please explain these obvious parallels in a bit more detail. What was observed in these cited papers?</p><p>13) Discussion, fourth paragraph – please correct: accumulation of Chm7 in vps4d pom152d cells, not vps4d only.</p><p>14) Discussion, fifth paragraph: in the first line it is stated that the size of the necks at evaginations and herniations is suggestive of the presence of a spiraling polymer as observed in vitro and in vivo. To clarify this statement, it would be good to make explicit what McCullough et al. observed and with what proteins.</p><p>15) Typo, &quot;where the mechanism (of) Chm7 recruitment and activation can be decoupled.&quot;</p><p>16) How is ER distinguished from outer nuclear membrane herniations in tomograms?

We were unable to assess this possibility experimentally, however, because we simply do not understand what factors (including Vps4) actually bind to the MIM domain. Moreover, while deletion of NES1 is an important experiment, this experiment in isolation would not do justice to what is undoubtedly a complex interplay between NES1, NES2 and the MIM1 domain, which requires more in-depth study using both in vivo and in vitro tools that we feel is beyond the scope of the current work. We did recognize, however, that the figure exploring the sufficiency of the NESs was incomplete as it did not formally establish that NES1, on its own, could act as an NES. These data are now presented in a revised Figure 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The MIM motif in Chm7 was described in Bauer et al., 2015.

Ultimately, we think that the answers will have to come from in vitro reconstitution experiments that can directly tackle the potential competition and/or functional overlap between the Heh1 and Heh2 WH domains (and also their N-termini). In the meantime, we now present data in a <bold>revised</bold> Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, that Heh2 is unable to activate Chm7 in the FETA assay. Thus, there is no functional overlap between the WH domains of Heh1 and Heh2 at least with respect to Chm7 activation. We dedicate a portion of the Discussion to addressing how Heh2 might fit into this pathway, which we more effectively place in the context of our prior data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should take the opportunity here to expand upon the likely relationship between the NE herniations they observe and those implicated by the Budnik lab in no-NPC mediated RNA export?

While our data certainly support the concept that ESCRTs might be capable of budding RNPs into the lumen, we have not explicitly explored this possibility experimentally and therefore cannot be definitive for or against any such non-NPC transport model. Therefore, while we certainly consider this as a possibility in the Discussion, I worry about adding further confusion to the field if we overreach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 3D, bottom row: please indicate more clearly the channel are we looking at, red or green.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added sufficient detail to the figure legend to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3E: Vps60 and Ist1 mutants were also tested according to the figure but are not mentioned anywhere in the text.
