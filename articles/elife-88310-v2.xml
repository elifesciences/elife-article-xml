Diabetic patients have a higher risk of sustaining osteoporotic fractures than non-diabetic people. The fracture healing is usually impaired in diabetics, and our understanding of the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on fracture healing is still inadequate. Metformin is the first-line medicine for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, its effects on bone in T2D patients remain to be studied. To assess the impacts of metformin on fracture healing, we compared the healing process of closed-wound fixed fracture, non-fixed radial fracture, and femoral drill-hole injury models in the T2D mice with and without metformin treatment. Our results demonstrated that metformin rescued the delayed bone healing and remolding in the T2D mice in all injury models. In vitro analysis indicated that compromised proliferation, osteogenesis, chondrogenesis of the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from the T2D mice were rescued by metformin treatment when compared to WT controls. Furthermore, metformin could effectively rescue the impaired detrimental lineage commitment of BMSCs isolated from the T2D mice in vivo as assessed by subcutaneous ossicle formation of the BMSC implants in recipient T2D mice. Moreover, the Safranin O staining of cartilage formation in the endochondral ossification under hyperglycemic condition significantly increased at day 14 post-fracture in the T2D mice receiving metformin treatment. The chondrocyte transcript factors SOX9 and PGC1α, important to maintain chondrocyte homeostasis, were both significantly upregulated in callus tissue isolated at the fracture site of metformin-treated MKR mice on day 12 post-fracture. Metformin also rescued the chondrocyte disc formation of BMSCs isolated from the T2D mice. Taken together, our study demonstrated that metformin facilitated bone healing, more specifically bone formation and chondrogenesis in T2D mouse models.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>fracture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006732</institution-id><institution>New York University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up and Career Enhancement Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metformin selectively improves bone healing of three types of bone injuries in hyperglycemic but not in normoglycemic mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a group of chronic diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels. It is estimated that more than 347 million people worldwide currently have diabetes and many more people are estimated to become diabetic soon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danaei et al., 2011</xref>). Among the diabetic patients, more than 90% are suffering from type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is caused by insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Many tissues, including the skeleton, will be adversely affected by hyperglycemia if not controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yan and Li, 2013</xref>). Both type 1 diabetes and T2D are associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yan and Li, 2013</xref>). It is recognized that oral antidiabetic medicines affect bone metabolism and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yan and Li, 2013</xref>). As an insulin sensitizer, patients with T2D are frequently prescribed metformin. In T2D patients, metformin treatment was associated with a decreased risk of bone fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vestergaard et al., 2005</xref>). The osteogenic effects of metformin have been documented in both cellular and rodent models. Metformin promoted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited adipocyte differentiation in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2008</xref>). In rat primary osteoblasts culture, metformin increased trabecular bone nodule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). In ovariectomized mice, metformin was also shown to improve the compromised bone mass and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, in streptozotocin-induced type 1 DM model, metformin stimulated bone lesion regeneration in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Molinuevo et al., 2010</xref>). However, to date, there is no study on the skeletal effects of metformin in a T2D model. A recent study found that the incidence of total knee replacement over 4 y was 19% lower among patients with type 2 diabetes who were regular metformin users compared with non-users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to reducing glucose levels, metformin may modulate inflammatory and metabolic factors, leading to reduced inflammation and plasma lipid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2022</xref>). Better knowledge of how metformin treatment influences skeletal tissues under T2D condition is of great clinical relevance in view of the fast-growing population of patients with T2D.</p><p>MKR mouse model was generated and characterized by LeRoith and colleagues and expresses a dominant negative mutant of human IGFI receptor specifically in skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernández et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of this dominant negative mutant human IGFI receptor decreased glucose uptake and causes insulin resistance, and the MKR transgenic mouse rapidly develops severe diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernández et al., 2001</xref>). This mouse model has been widely used in T2D research. In this study, the effects of metformin on bone cell lineage determination and regeneration were characterized using the MKR mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metformin promotes healing in fracture models under hyperglycemic conditions</title><p>In order to evaluate the fracture healing that involves endochondral ossification in mice, we adapted this well-accepted Bonnarens and Einhorn fracture mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Animals were sacrificed on day 14, 23, or 31 post-fracture representing the inflammatory stage, the endochondral stage, and the remodeling stage during the femur fracture repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, 12-week-old WT and MKR mice were treated with PBS or metformin through daily intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and fasting glucose tolerant test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) showed that metformin significantly reduced glucose levels in MKR mice as anticipated. Meanwhile, metformin-treated MKR mice exhibited similar healing and remodeling speed to that of the WT groups throughout the entire healing process, and the fractured bones were completely healed on day 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, the healing process in the MKR-PBS group was much delayed, with a visible amount of callus tissue remained at the fracture site on day 31. Additionally, histological analysis of the callus area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) disclosed a postponed peak callus formation in the MKR-PBS group when compared to WT-PBS, WT-met, and MKR-met groups on day 23 post-fracture, as well as a delayed remodeling on day 31 post-fracture. A quantitative analysis of the callus at the fracture area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) confirmed that metformin significantly enhanced bone healing in the T2D mice compared to the PBS-treated MKR mice. We also harvested the callus tissue at fracture sites on days 12 and 21 post-fracture to examine the expression of genes that contribute to adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A significant reduction in adipogenesis transcription factor accompanied with a significant induction of chondrogenesis transcript factor SOX9 was detected in the callus harvested on day 12 post-fracture. SOX9 is a master transcription factor that plays a key role in chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kolettas et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, at day 21 post-fracture, PGC1α, which is required for chondrocyte metabolism and cartilage homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), was significantly upregulated in the metformin-treated MKR mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Improved healing in closed transverse fracture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental design (created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biorender.com/">BioRender.com</ext-link>).

After non-fixed radial fracture was introduced, the animal was treated with either PBS or metformin for 14 or 23 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the WT groups at 14 d post-fracture, both PBS and metformin-treated animals started to exhibit sufficient amount of callus with the sign of bridging of the fracture ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the 14-day post-fracture MKR mice, those treated with metformin exhibited more healing callus than the PBS-treated ones with a significantly greater percentage of callus bridging at the fracture site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Bone mineral density was also higher in the metformin-treated MKR mice when compared to the PBS-treated MKR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Bone volume/tissue volume ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and trabecular thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) were not regulated by metformin in either WT or MKR mice. In the 23-day post-fracture groups, only PBS-treated MKR animals failed to show callus formation and bridging at the fracture site compared to all the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), indicating a delayed healing process in the MKR PBS group. Bone mineral density levels in the metformin-treated MKR mice were similar to the PBS-treated WT mice and were significantly higher than the PBS-treated MKR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

The daily metformin treatment in MKR mice prior to cell isolation appeared to be sufficient to protect the proliferation potential of BMSCs from the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia. BMSC lineage differentiation potential was also tested by ALP staining and von Kossa staining. After 14 d under osteogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danaei et al., 2011</xref>) differentiation, in contrast to the weak ALP activity observed in the MKR-PBS group, while the MKR-met group showed compatible ALP activity to the WT groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). ALP played a critical role in calcium crystallization and mineralization during bone formation; therefore, we speculated this aberrant ALP activity of the MKR-PBS group would further lead to an impaired bone mineralization. As expected, bone mineralization was barely detected in the MKR-PBS group after 21-day osteoblast differentiation visualized by von Kossa staining and metformin significantly enhanced bone mineralization in MKR mice when compared to the PBS-treated MKR animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).

In order to examine metformin’s effect on chondrogenesis during bone healing, we compared the cartilage deposition within fracture healing sites throughout the healing process (14 d, 23 d, and 31 d post-fracture). The cartilage deposition was significantly lower in the PBS-treated MKR mice compared to the PBS-treated WT mice at 14 d post-fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), which is consistent with the observation of SOX9 and PGC1α induction in the callus on days 12 and 21, respectively, of the metformin-treated MKR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To assess the impacts of metformin on fracture healing under hyperglycemic condition, we applied several classic bone fracture models in the T2D mice. Fracture healing is complex and involves the following stages: hematoma formation, granulation tissue formation, bony callus formation, and bone remodeling. During the bone healing, chondrogenesis lays down a collagen-rich fibrocartilaginous network spanning the fracture ends and fibroblasts differentiate into osteoblasts so that cartilaginous callus eventually undergoes endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). Our results demonstrated that in all injury models tested metformin successfully rescued the delayed bone healing and remolding in the T2D mice by facilitating bone formations. Further cell culture studies demonstrated the mechanism of metformin’s action at the cellular level by promoting the proliferation, differentiation, and lineage commitment of primary BMSCs. Taken together, metformin showed its potential as an effective drug for increasing the rate and success of bone healing in diabetic patients who are not taking metformin on a regular basis.</p><p>In all the bone fracture models studied in this study, metformin significantly enhanced bone-healing parameters in MKR mice. However, in the WT animals, quantitative analysis of images showed no difference between the PBS and the metformin treatment in terms of bone healing. These data suggest that metformin is only beneficial for bone healing under hyperglycemic conditions but does not enhance bone healing in WT animals without diabetes. In all BMSC-based essays, metformin was not administered to culture media in vitro but administered to animals in vivo before the BMSCs were isolated. Administration of metformin in MKR mice successfully salvaged the BMSC proliferation capability and lineage commitment and brought it back to the equivalent level as observed in the WT group. Interestingly, metformin did not affect the proliferation and lineage commitment of BMSCs in the WT group when compared to the PBS vehicle. These data are consistent with those obtained from bone fracture models, suggesting that metformin may exert its effects by normalizing hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance, and other metabolic disturbance under diabetic conditions and does not enhance bone healing in WT animals. In ovariectomized rats, impaired bone density and quality were significantly improved by the treatment of metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, it seems that metformin does not promote further bone growth under physiological conditions but helps to maintain bone homeostasis under pathological conditions such as hyperglycemia and lack of estrogen.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is very scarce amount of research on the direct effects of metformin on BMSCs. In an in vitro study using mouse bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, metformin causes inhibition of proliferation and abnormalities of their morphology and ultrastructure and decreased IGF-2 secretion in the supernatant of the culture media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Śmieszek et al., 2015</xref>). In another paper, metformin added to culture is shown to promote the osteogenesis of BMSCs isolated from T2D patients and osseointegration when administered in rats via the AMPK/BMP/Smad signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). This discrepancy might be due to the different levels of metformin used in the culture system and different species of the experimental model. In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Śmieszek et al., 2015</xref>), inhibition of mouse BMSC proliferation was observed with 1, 5, and 10 mM of metformin. However, in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2022</xref>), 125 μM was the optimal concentration to stimulate proliferation of BMSC in humans and rats. At concentrations &gt;200 µM, metformin showed an inhibitory effect on BMSCs isolated from T2DM patients. Another possibility is that metformin does not work directly on BMSCs but requires other tissues, cells, and the in vivo context to exert its effect. Whether metformin has direct beneficial effects on BMSCs remains to be investigated.</p><p>As the most prescribed antidiabetic medicine and a drug poses benefits beyond the treatment of diabetes, the molecular and cellular mechanism of metformin demands a lot of research attention. The AMP-activated protein kinase plays a major role in its mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foretz et al., 2014</xref>); however, the exact signaling cascade and the direct molecular target of metformin remain unknown. Recently, low-dose metformin has been shown to target the lysosomal AMPK pathway through PEN2, a subunit of gamma-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Clinically relevant concentrations of metformin bind PEN2 to activate AMPK pathways following glucose starvation. Loss-of-function analysis of PEN2 blunts AMPK activation, abolishes metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, and metformin’s glucose-lowering effects. These novel findings indicate that metformin binds PEN2 directly and initiates a signaling route that intersects the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation. To our knowledge, there is no research done on the role of PEN2 in the beneficial effects of metformin on bone homeostasis and healing. It is very much worth the effort to investigate whether metformin binds PEN2 and utilizes the same signaling pathways in BMSCs. Another important aspect of the mechanism of metformin is its effects on osteoclasts. Metformin has been shown to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in various studies. Metformin inhibits osteoclastogenesis in ovariectomized mice by downregulating autophagy via E2F1-dependent BECN1 and BCL2 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). In the osteoarthritis mouse model, metformin inhibits osteoclast activation and may exert its effects through the AMPK/NF-kappaB/ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). In a rat osteonecrosis model, metformin inhibits osteoclast activity in the necrotic femoral head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2020</xref>). In an in vitro model of periodontitis, osteoclast formation as well as activity was inhibited by metformin in M-CSF and RANKL-stimulated monocyte cultures, probably by reduction in RANK expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). In another study, metformin inhibits osteoclast differentiation at a low concentration and promotes osteoclast apoptosis at a higher concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bian et al., 2021</xref>). The effects of metformin on osteoclasts in various bone fracture models warrant future research.</p><p>As reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roszer, 2011</xref>, diabetes is accompanied by increased level of pro-inflammatory factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The increased inflammatory state could result in apoptosis of osteoblasts and prolonged survival of osteoclasts, which lead to early destruction of callus tissue and impair bone fracture healing in diabetic patients. Thus, antagonizing inflammatory signal pathways and inhibition of inflammation may deserve greater attention in the management of diabetic fracture healing. There is substantial evidence supporting that metformin not only improves chronic inflammation by attenuating hyperglycemia but also has a direct anti-inflammatory effect. Targeting inflammatory pathways seems to be an important part of the comprehensive mechanisms of action of this drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bharath and Nikolajczyk, 2021</xref>). In addition to AMPK activation and inhibition of mTOR pathways, metformin acts on mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis processes such as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bharath and Nikolajczyk, 2021</xref>). Both dysregulated mitochondria and failure of the autophagy pathways affect cellular health drastically and can trigger the onset of metabolic and age-associated inflammation and diseases. For example, T-helper type 17 (Th17) cells, an important pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-cell subset secreting interleukin 17 (IL-17), has been suggested to play an essential role in the development of diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Moneim et al., 2018</xref>). Metformin can ameliorate the pro-inflammatory profile of Th17 by increasing autophagy and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, at day 21 post-fracture, the PGC1α in callus tissues isolated from the fracture site was significantly upregulated in the metformin-treated MKR mice. As reviewed by Halling and Pilegaard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Halling and Pilegaard, 2020</xref>), PGC-1α not only regulates mitochondrial biogenesis but also its function. PGC-1α-mediated regulation of mitochondrial quality may contribute to many age-related dysfunctions including insulin sensitivity. Anti-inflammation and enhancement of mitochondrial function could be very important means that metformin utilizes to facilitate bone formation and healing under hyperglycemic conditions.</p><p>Diabetic hyperglycemia has been suggested to play a role in osteoarthritis. The metabolic alterations in body fluid such as hyperglycemia could negatively affect the cartilage through direct effects on chondrocytes by stimulating the production of (AGE accumulation in the synovium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2022</xref>). PPARγ is highly expressed in adipocytes, and the downregulation of PPARγ expression in the callus of metformin-treated MKR mice reflected the shift of mesenchymal cells’ fate. In the T2DM mouse model, differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes is delayed and this delay may result from premature apoptosis of the growth plate chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wongdee and Charoenphandhu, 2015</xref>). Besides its effects on bone formation, there is also interest in studying the effects of metformin on chondrocytes, especially in the context of osteoarthritis development. Limited references show that metformin is protective against the development of osteoarthritis by reducing chondrocyte apoptosis and alleviating chondrocyte degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yan et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the above reports, our data suggest that metformin promoted the cartilage formation in the endochondral ossification at day 14 post-fracture in the T2D mice. Moreover, metformin rescued the chondrocyte disc formation in BMSCs isolated from the T2D mice when compared to the PBS-treated control. Metformin also upregulated chondrocyte transcript factor SOX9 and in callus tissue isolated at the fracture site in the metformin-treated MKR mice. Sox-9 plays an essential role in the regulation of cartilage matrix production and cartilage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kolettas et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, PGC1α was significantly upregulated in the metformin-treated MKR mice when compared to the PBS-treated MKR animals. PGC1alpha is important to maintain chondrocyte metabolic flexibility and tissue homeostasis. The loss of PGC1α in chondrocytes during OA pathogenesis resulted in the activation of mitophagy and stimulated cartilage degradation and apoptotic death of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). The activation of PGC1α is a potential strategy to delay or prevent the development of OA. The cellular signaling pathways through which metformin exerts its protective effects in chondrocytes warrant further research.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that metformin can facilitate bone healing, bone formation, and chondrogenesis in the T2D mice. The molecular mechanism of metformin’s action demands further research in the hope to identify the specific therapeutic target to facilitate bone healing and repair in diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out with the compliance of the New York University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Briefly, BMSCs from the PBS or metformin-treated mice were growing to 90% confluent, then 1.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml cells solution was obtained, and 20 µl of this cell solution was soaked in a 4 mm × 4 mm gel foam and grafted at the flank of the recipient MKR mice subcutaneously. 4 wk after the implantation, the gel foams were dissected and processed for histological assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology and image analysis</title><p>Femurs from fracture models and bone ossicles were decalcified using 10% EDTA for 2 wk. EDTA solution was refreshed every other day for the best decalcification efficacy. Tissues were then processed through an automatic tissue processor, followed by paraffin embedding. 5-µm-thick sections were cut from the paraffin-embedded tissues and subjected to H&amp;E, Safranin O, and Mason’s Trichrome staining, respectively. The total callus area and cartilage area within it were traced and analyzed using ImageJ software. The bone area ratio within the ossicles was also analyzed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Glucose test and glucose tolerance test</title><p>12-week-old WT and MKR mice were treated with PBS or metformin through daily intraperitoneal injection as previously described.

After 14-day PBS or metformin injection, animals were fasted overnight for 16 hr by transferring into a clean new cage supplied with water. 20% (W/V) glucose solution was applied to the animals through oral gavage (1.6 g of glucose/kg body weight). Blood glucose was measured at the indicated time points till 2 hr post-glucose oral gavage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>A femoral closed fracture was performed as previously described. Callus tissue at the fracture site was collected and lysate in Trizol Reagent.

hyperglycemic conditions. The evidence supporting the conclusion is convincing, using three different types of bone fracture models in type-2 diabetes (T2D) mice.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a generally well-executed set of study, the data from which are appropriate and largely supports the conclusions. The manuscript would be strengthened by (1) including more discussion/explanation on the mechanisms underlying metformin's effects on healing; and (2) improving the writing of the manuscript for clarity and accuracy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following are some specific comments:</p><p>1. Abstract can be improved in writing to clearly demonstrate the positive effects of Metformin in bone healing. What is the conclusion from bone ossicle implantation experiments?

Clinically relevant concentrations of metformin binds PEN2 to activate AMPK pathways following glucose starvation. Loss of function analysis of PEN2 blunts AMPK activation, abolishes metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, and metformin’s glucose-lowering effects. These novel findings indicate that metformin binds PEN2 directly and initiates a signaling route that intersects the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation. To our knowledge, there is no research done on the role of PEN2 in the beneficial effects of metformin on bone homeostasis and healing. It is very much worth the efforts to investigate whether metformin binds PEN2 and utilizes the same signaling pathways in BMSCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors, in their research manuscript titled 'Metformin regulates bone marrow stromal cells to accelerate bone healing in diabetic mice', dissected the role of Metformin in bone healing under type-2 diabetics conditions.

Metformin has been shown to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in various studies. Metformin inhibits osteoclastogenesis in ovariectomized mice by downregulating autophagy via E2F1-dependent BECN1 and BCL2 downregulation [20]. In osteoarthritis mouse model, metformin inhibits osteoclast activation and it may exert its effects through AMPK/NF-kappaB/ERK signaling pathway [21]. In a rat osteonecrosis model, metformin inhibits osteoclast activity in the necrotic femoral head. [22]. In an in vitro model of periodontitis, osteoclast formation as well as activity was inhibited by metformin in M-CSF and RANKL stimulated monocyte cultures, probably by reduction of RANK expression [23]. In another study, metformin inhibits osteoclast differentiation at a low concentration and promotes osteoclast apoptosis at a higher concentration [24].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
