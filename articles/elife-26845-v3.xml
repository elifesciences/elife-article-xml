protein response (UPR) transducer, initiates unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA. Unspliced and spliced mRNA are translated to produce pXBP1(U) and pXBP1(S), respectively. pXBP1(S) functions as a potent transcription factor, whereas pXBP1(U) targets pXBP1(S) to degradation. In addition, activated IRE1 transmits two signaling outputs independent of XBP1, namely activation of the JNK pathway, which is initiated by binding of the adaptor TRAF2 to phosphorylated IRE1, and regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of various mRNAs in a relatively nonspecific manner. Here, we conducted comprehensive and systematic genetic analyses of the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR using medaka fish and found that the defects observed in XBP1-knockout or IRE1-knockout medaka were fully rescued by constitutive expression of pXBP1(S). Thus, the JNK and RIDD pathways are not required for the normal growth and development of medaka. The unfolded protein response sensor/transducer IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP1 mRNA encoding its active downstream transcription factor to maintain the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum is sufficient for growth and development of medaka fish.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>molecular chaperone</kwd><kwd>mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>Oryzias latipes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26291040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K18529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishikawa</surname><given-names>Tokiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H01432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K15116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishikawa</surname><given-names>Tokiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The unfolded protein response sensor/transducer IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP1 mRNA encoding its active downstream transcription factor to maintain the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum is sufficient for growth and development of medaka fish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Essentially, all eukaryotic cells cope with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER, by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). This activation leads to maintenance of the homeostasis of the ER, where newly synthesized secretory and transmembrane proteins are folded and assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mori, 2000</xref>). Among the three signaling pathways operating in mammalian cells (IRE1, PERK and ATF6), the most evolutionarily conserved UPR transducer is IRE1, a type I transmembrane-type protein kinase and endoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>). Yeast and metazoan IRE1 activated by ER stress-induced oligomerization and <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation initiates a splicing reaction and thereby specifically removes introns of 252 and 26 nucleotides from HAC1 and XBP1 precursor mRNA, respectively, which encode their respective downstream transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mori, 2009</xref>). Because the HAC1 intron has the ability to block translation, only spliced HAC1 mRNA is translated in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawahara et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast, because XBP1 intron is too short to block translation, both unspliced and spliced XBP1 mRNA are translated to produce the unspliced form of XBP1, designated pXBP1(U), and the spliced form of XBP1, designated pXBP1(S), in metazoan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>pXBP1(U) and pXBP1(S) share the N-terminal region containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain but differ in their C-terminal regions (see Figure 6C). Since the C-terminal region of pXBP1(S) contains a transcriptional activation domain (AD), pXBP1(S) functions as a potent transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, as pXBP1(U) binds to pXBP1(S) and targets pXBP1(S) to proteasomal degradation via a domain designated degron here when the cell recovers from ER stress, pXBP1(U) functions as a negative regulator of pXBP1(S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). It should be noted that XBP1 precursor mRNA is expressed at a low level under normal conditions but is induced during ER stress with a similar time course to ER chaperone mRNAs due to the presence of the same <italic>cis</italic>-acting ER stress response element in its promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshida et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, a higher level of pXBP1(U) is produced from transcriptionally induced XBP1 mRNA when IRE1 is inactivated due to recovery from ER stress. It was also reported recently that pXBP1(U) suppresses autophagy by promoting the degradation of FoxO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26845.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction and initial characterization of IRE1α-KO, IRE1β-KO and IRE1α/β-DKO medaka.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the IRE1-mediated signaling pathways.

First, the adaptor molecule TRAF2 binds to activated and phosphorylated IRE1 and sequentially activates ASK1 (MEKK1), JNKK and JNK, leading to phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun (JNK pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urano et al., 2000</xref>). Second, activated IRE1 cleaves various mRNAs relatively non-specifically, a process called regulated IRE1-dependent decay of mRNAs (RIDD pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>). Although both are pro-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urano et al., 2000</xref>), the physiological significance of these two pathways remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we adopted a genetic approach toward a comprehensive understanding of IRE1 function using medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), in which removal of the 26-nucleotide intron, which is exactly the same size as that in mammals, from precursor XBP1 mRNA is observed in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa et al., 2011</xref>). The only difference is in the expression pattern of IRE1: although IRE1α is ubiquitously expressed and IRE1β is expressed only in the gut in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolotti et al., 2001</xref>), both IRE1α and IRE1β are expressed ubiquitously in medaka fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRE1α/β-double knockout (DKO) is detrimental to growth and development of medaka</title><p>We employed the targeting-induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) method to identify IRE1α- and IRE1β-knockout (KO) medaka, as described in Materials and methods. The N-terminally truncated fragment of IRE1α (C156X) or IRE1β (Y164X) produced from the mutated allele must have lost its functionality as its transmembrane, protein kinase and ribonuclease domains are excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We confirmed the presence of the expected mutation in IRE1α mRNA or IRE1β mRNA expressed in respective KO embryo at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Both IRE1α- and IRE1β-single KO medaka were born and developed normally, and tunicamycin-induced splicing of XBP1 mRNA was observed normally in their embryos at 4 dpf; tunicamycin elicits ER stress by blocking protein N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We therefore crossed the IRE1α-heterozygote with the IRE1β-heterozygote to obtain IRE1α/β-DKO medaka and found that tunicamycin-induced splicing of XBP1 mRNA was completely lost in the embryos of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate that IRE1α and IRE1β are redundant in medaka, unlike in mice. It should be noted that all IRE1α/β-DKO medaka die within 2 weeks after fertilization regardless of their ability or inability to hatch (data not shown here, see Figure 10A; medaka usually hatch at 7 dpf and become fertile 2 months after hatching). Thus, complete absence of IRE1 functions is detrimental to the growth and development of medaka.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>XBP1-KO medaka exhibit a more severe phenotype than IRE1α/β-DKO medaka in the hatching gland</title><p>We employed the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) method to generate XBP1-KO medaka, as described in Materials and methods.

Quantitative RT-PCR-mediated measurements revealed that the levels of Fabp10a mRNA encoding fatty-acid-binding protein 10a, a marker of liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Venkatachalam et al., 2009</xref>), were indeed reduced to one-third in IRE1α/β-DKO embryos compared with IRE1β-single KO embryos, as well as in XBP1-KO embryos compared with WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, however, although the level of LCE mRNA encoding one of the two hatching enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yasumasu et al., 1992</xref>) was reduced to one-third in IRE1α/β-DKO embryos compared with IRE1β-single KO embryos, it was reduced to less than 10% in XBP1-KO embryos compared with WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), meaning that KO of XBP1, a transcription factor downstream of IRE1α/β, produces a much more severe phenotype than DKO of IRE1α/β in the hatching gland. This notion was fully supported by the markedly decreased fluorescence of EGFP, which is under the control of the LCE promoter (P<sub>LCE</sub>-BiP), in the hatching gland of XBP1-KO medaka, compared with the mildly decreased fluorescence of EGFP in the hatching gland of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D and E</xref>), and by the fact that XBP1-KO embryos could not hatch, whereas 70% of IRE1α/β-DKO embryos hatched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

This confirms the critical importance of the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR in maintenance of the protein quality control system operating in the ER, particularly in secretory organs, similar to the case in mice; proteins circulating in blood plus proteins for hematopoiesis from liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reimold et al., 2000</xref>), immunoglobulins from plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>), digestive enzymes from exocrine pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), and lysozyme from intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaser et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that only the defect in the hatching gland of XBP1-KO medaka was substantially more severe than that of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka among the three organs, even though XBP1 is a transcription factor downstream of IRE1α/β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We obtained XBP1+/+ and XBP1-/- embryos by incrossing male and female XBP1+/− medaka, in whose eggs WT mRNA and Δ8 mRNA were expressed. We consider that maternal XBP1 (both WT and Δ8) mRNA is degraded in eggs prior to fertilization because of the absence of spliced XBP1 mRNA in embryos at 0.5 dpf of XBP1-/- medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 2), and consider that the spliced XBP1 mRNA detected in embryos at 0.5 dpf of XBP1+/+ medaka is derived from IRE1α-mediated splicing of zygotic XBP1 WT mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 1). The absence of pXBP1(S) in embryos at 0.5 dpf likely explain the very poor development of the hatching gland in XBP1-/- medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), although LCE, HCE1 and HCE2 mRNAs encoding hatching enzymes do not appear to be direct targets of pXBP1(S) because they were not up-regulated in IRE1β-KO embryos by the introduction of XBP1S<sup>C</sup> (data not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In this connection, it is known that Nodals, members of the TGFβ family, are required for induction of mesodermal and endodermal progenitors during vertebrate gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schier, 2003</xref>) and for subsequent derivation of the notochord and hatching gland from the dorsal mesoderm in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagos and Dougan, 2007</xref>). XBP1 is a direct target of Nodal signaling and is required for terminal differentiation of the hatching gland in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the presence of pXBP1(S) during vertebrate gastrulation (0.5–0.7 dpf in medaka) may be key to the development of the hatching gland. We speculate that ER stress which might be experienced in eggs would not be inherited into fertilized eggs as a form of spliced XBP1 mRNA whose translational product, pXBP1(S), may interfere developmentally regulated Nodal signaling.</p><p>We obtained IRE1α/β-DKO embryos by crossing male IRE1α+/- IRE1β+/- medaka with female IRE1α+/- IRE1β-/- medaka, in whose eggs IRE1α WT and C156X mRNA was expressed. We consider that maternal IRE1α (both WT and C156X) mRNA is transmitted to fertilized eggs because of the presence of spliced XBP1 mRNA in embryos at 0.5 dpf of both IRE1β-KO and IRE1α/β-DKO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the level of IRE1α mRNA detected in embryos at 0.5 dpf of IRE1β-KO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 11) would be the summation of maternal IRE1α (WT and C156X) mRNA and zygotic IRE1α WT mRNA, whereas the level of IRE1α mRNA detected in embryos at 0.5 dpf of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 12) would be summation of maternal IRE1α (WT and C156X) mRNA and zygotic IRE1α C156X mRNA. Because the level of IRE1α mRNA in embryos at 0.5 dpf of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka was significantly lower than that in embryos at 0.5 dpf of IRE1β-KO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare lane 12 with lane 11), both maternal and zygotic IRE1α C156X mRNA is subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Maternal IRE1α WT mRNA present in embryos at 0.5 dpf of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka is translated to produce IRE1α (protein). This initiates the splicing of zygotic XBP1 WT mRNA, resulting in the production of pXBP1(S) and better development of the hatching gland in IRE1α/β-DKO medaka than in XBP1-KO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). IRE1α (protein) translated from maternal IRE1α WT mRNA is likely to be degraded by 0.7 dpf, given that the level of spliced XBP1 mRNA was markedly decreased in embryos at 0.7 dpf of IRE1α/β-DKO medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lane 8 with lane 7). Our subsequent crossing using male and female IRE1α/β-DKO XBP1S<sup>C</sup>/+ medaka firmly supported the notion that the presence of maternal IRE1α affects development of the hatching gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D</xref>).</p><p>Yeast IRE1 is responsible for transcriptional induction of all UPR target genes, including various ER chaperone genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Travers et al., 2000</xref>).

Hollien and Weissman discovered that IRE1 also carries out degradation of a certain set of mRNA by cleaving them relatively non-specifically in Drosophila S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>), and later in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>) when treated with potent ER stress inducers, such as 500 nM thapsigargin, 3 μg/ml tunicamycin and 2 mM dithiothreitol via the process termed RIDD.

Because complete removal of the IRE1α/β genes from XBP1-KO medaka had no effect on the defects in the three organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and because the defects in the three organs observed in IRE1α/β-DKO medaka were completely rescued by introduction of XBP1S<sup>C</sup> into one XBP1 allele from which fully spliced XBP1 mRNA is constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), we concluded that the JNK and RIDD pathways are not required for normal growth and development of medaka fish. Thus, IRE1α/β-mediated splicing of XBP1 mRNA and thus production of pXBP1(S), but not of pXBP1(U) or pXBP1(AS), is sufficient to cope with the physiological ER stress that occurs during normal growth and development of medaka fish. RNA-seq analysis firmly supported this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In other words, such physiological ER stresses are manageable by IRE1α/β-mediated splicing of XBP1 mRNA, whose extent can be adjusted to the strength or duration of stress from the basal level to the maximal level (equivalent to the level of spliced XBP1 mRNA produced from the XBP1S<sup>C</sup> allele, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). It should be noted that morpholino-mediated knockdown experiments were employed previously to show XBP1-mediated development of the hatching gland in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>) and XBP1 and BBF2H7-mediated development of the notochord in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanegashima et al., 2009</xref>), with no discrimination among pXBP1(S), pXBP1(U) and pXBP1(AS). It appears that activation of the JNK and RIDD pathways is triggered by stimuli which evoke greater or different types of ER stress than those stresses encountered during normal development.</p><p>XBP1-KO causes embryonic lethality in mice due to the failure of liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reimold et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, liver specific-conditional XBP1-KO in adult mice has almost no effect on the growth of mice or secretion of proteins from hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), probably due to compensation by the ATF6 pathway, which is responsible for transcriptional induction of ER chaperone genes in response to ER stress in both mice and medaka, but not in non-vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishikawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, liver specific-conditional XBP1-KO mice showed hypolipidemia and XBP1 was found to regulate transcription of non-canonical UPR target genes which encode four enzymes involved in lipidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of XBP1 in mouse liver hyperactivated IRE1α, and hypolipidemia is accordingly accelerated by RIDD of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in lipogenesis and lipoprotein metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">So et al., 2012</xref>),</p><p>Based on these results, we consider that the protein quality control system is maintained by the IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 branches of the UPR and not by the RIDD pathway at the whole-body level of mice and medaka. Consistent with this idea, hyperactivation of IRE1α occurring in cartilage-specific conditional XBP1-KO mice was not sufficient for activation of RIDD, and synthesis and secretion of type II and type X collagen was unaffected by specific deletion of XBP1 in cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2015</xref>). The RIDD pathway may have more specific functions in vertebrates, for example regulation of lipid metabolism working together with non-canonical function of XBP1, and protection against toxins, such as acetaminophen and cholera toxin. It is important to discriminate the protein quality control system from other events that occurs in the ER in vertebrates.</p><p>Very recently, H. D. Ryoo and his colleagues investigated the requirement of the IRE1-XBP1 branch in coping with physiological ER stress which occurs during embryonic development of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and found that IRE1-mediated signaling independent of XBP1 mRNA splicing, particularly RIDD, is also functionally important in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that the advent of functional ATF6 might have mitigated the importance of RIDD in vertebrates, because ATF6-mediated rapid induction of various ER chaperones for refolding of unfolded/misfolded proteins appears to be a more sophisticated way of coping with ER stress than RIDD-mediated relatively nonspecific degradation of various mRNAs, from which no functional proteins would be produced.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish</title><p>Medaka southern strain cab was used as wild-type fish.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors have used the vertebrate model system of the medaka fish to systematically investigate the different functional outputs of the Ire1 signaling pathway on normal development. Ire1 is the most widely conserved ER stress sensor that communicates misfolding stress to the nucleus via splicing of Xbp1. In addition, signaling and mRNA degradation functions of Ire1 have been described and extensively studied. The relative contributions of the canonical Xbp1-mediated signaling versus the other Ire1 outputs to normal development or to different physiologic states is not clear. This study provides clear genetic evidence that development and early life of medaka can proceed normally with only the Xbp1 output, suggesting that the other signaling and mRNA degradation outputs are only needed under certain other conditions that remain to be explored.</p><p>In general, the study is quite straightforward in presenting the two central results: (i) knockout of Ire1 (both isoforms) can be fully rescued with constitutive modest level spliced Xbp1 expression; (ii) the Ire1/Xbp1 double knockout is no more severe than the Ire1 knockout. The conclusion is that other nuances of this system, such as non-Xbp1 mediated Ire1 outputs, a role for unspliced Xpb1, and a role for alternatively spliced Xbp1, are apparently dispensable in this organism for normal early development. In addition, it seems that constitutive Xbp1 can replace the stress-responsive regulation that would normally occur with an intact Ire1-Xbp1 axis.</p><p>The referees agreed that the above conclusion was generally well supported (with some potential improvements needed; see below). However, we initially disagreed somewhat regarding the overall impact of these observations. The major concern was that the results do not really provide new insights into which Ire1/Xbp1 functions make it essential, nor does is really speak to whether RIDD or JNK signaling even occurs during early development. In this sense, the function(s) of these latter two outputs of Ire1 activation are not illuminated beyond showing that they are non-essential for medaka development. While this is certainly a valid criticism, additional discussion among the referees led to the consensus view that the study is nevertheless important for this field and beyond. The reason is that the findings were felt to provide an important baseline for future study, and clarify exactly which aspect of the various putative Ire1 functions is actually central to normal physiology and which are more modulatory or even unnecessary. The animal models described here should also be useful in different experimental paradigms to probe the situations when these other outputs become more important. For these reasons, we concluded that if the study can indeed provide definitive evidence that the Xbp1s output is the only essential function of Ire1 activation, it will help focus the UPR field and represent an important contribution suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issues revolve around a more thorough characterization of the genotypes and phenotypes of the animals to conclusively document their mutants, and that Xbp1s fully rescues the Ire1 double knockout. As currently presented, the relatively superficial and qualitative morphological analysis was judged to be too blunt, and some confusion remains about the putative maternal effect that seems to cause different phenotypes in the Ire1 versus Xbp1 knockouts.</p><p>1) The alleles used have not been fully characterized, and stronger evidence is needed to convincingly document that the Ire1 alleles are null, and that Xbp1 alleles are behaving as expected. Blotting to assess protein levels generated from the mutant alleles is one option, but we acknowledge that suitable reagents may not be available in this system. Alternatively, analysis of the effect of each mutant on the targeted transcript (e.g., Northerns, qPCR, and/or direct sequencing) would help substantiate the authors' claims. This is a concern because the point mutants in IRE1a and IRE1b generated by TILLING mutants may not generate the truncated protein as expected, and if the alleles are not truly null, the conclusions are weakened. Similarly, it is important to verify that the Xbp1 alleles are as expected at the mRNA level.</p><p>2) There is inadequate phenotypic analysis of the mutants. The relatively qualitative description of the organs that are proposed to be affected (tail, hatching gland, liver) does not provide enough information to be fully convinced. Some type of unbiased quantitative assessment with statistical analysis would be strongly preferred, especially for the critical result showing that the Xbp1s fully rescues the Ire1 double knockout. A complementary phenotypic analysis would be a transcriptomic comparison between the wild type, Ire1 double knockout, and Xbp1s rescue strains to how complete the rescue really is. We can appreciate that this might be judged beyond the scope of this study, but such molecular analysis would significantly strengthen the claim of full rescue based on morphological criteria.</p><p>3) The final concern relates to the phenotype of IRE1a/b DKO fish. The authors argue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that there is a maternal effect in terms of production of IRE1 protein that is sufficient to splice Xbp1 RNA in early embryos. While their data are consistent with this possibility, they cannot conclude a maternal effect is present without systematically analyzing the phenotypes in crosses where the maternal genotype is varied. In addition, the authors seem a bit coy about the phenotype of IRE1a/b DKO animals. The table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> implies that such animals are not viable, yet clearly they are, as they are used in other crosses (e.g., as the females in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This discrepancy might be because of the presumed maternal effect but again, the paper seems to report no experiment done for the express purpose of testing maternal genotype. The other reason this matters is that, if IRE1a/b DKO animals are in fact viable, it is a bit difficult to reconcile that observation with the much more severe phenotype in Xbp1 KO animals. The authors need to clarify the phenotypes of animals of various genotypes, and if they wish to make strong claims about a putative maternal effect explaining differences between the Ire1 DKO and Xbp1 knockout, then the idea needs to be more directly tested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26845.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issues revolve around a more thorough characterization of the genotypes and phenotypes of the animals to conclusively document their mutants, and that Xbp1s fully rescues the Ire1 double knockout.

Thus, complete absence of IRE1 functions is detrimental to the growth and development of medaka” (subsection “IRE1α/β-double knockout (DKO) is detrimental to growth and development of medaka”).</p><p>We have then described that “Because IRE1α/β-DKO medaka die within two weeks after fertilization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and therefore cannot be used for mating, we determined whether IRE1α/β-DKO medaka become fertile if the Δ26 mutation (XBP1S<sup>C</sup>) is introduced into one allele of the XBP1 locus.
