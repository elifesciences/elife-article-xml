So far, cnidarian studies have focused on the role of different BMP signaling network components in regulating pSMAD1/5 gradient formation. Much less is known about the target genes downstream of BMP signaling. To address this, we generated a genome-wide list of direct pSMAD1/5 target genes in the anthozoan <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, several of which were conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Our ChIP-seq analysis revealed that many of the regulatory molecules with documented bilaterally symmetric expression in <italic>Nematostella</italic> are directly controlled by BMP signaling. We identified several so far uncharacterized BMP-dependent transcription factors and signaling molecules, whose bilaterally symmetric expression may be indicative of their involvement in secondary axis patterning. One of these molecules is <italic>zswim4-6</italic>, which encodes a novel nuclear protein that can modulate the pSMAD1/5 gradient and potentially promote BMP-dependent gene repression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BMP signaling</kwd><kwd>evolution of axial patterning</kwd><kwd>Cnidaria</kwd><kwd>Bilateria</kwd><kwd><italic>Nematostella</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Danio</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic></kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P26962-B21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Genikhovich</surname><given-names>Grigory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P32705-B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Genikhovich</surname><given-names>Grigory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637840</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>863952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ChIP-seq analysis reveals BMP signaling targets in a cnidarian and identifies ZSWIM4-6 as a dampener of the pSMAD1/5 gradient and a potential conveyor of the BMP-mediated gene repression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The clade Bilateria unites animals with bilaterally symmetric body plans that are determined by two orthogonally oriented body axes, termed the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis. These body axes form a Cartesian coordinate system in which the location of different morphological structures is specified by gradients of morphogen signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Niehrs, 2010</xref>). Notably, bilaterality is also observed in representatives of a single animal clade outside of Bilateria - their evolutionary sister group Cnidaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berking, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finnerty et al., 2004</xref>). Common to all cnidarians is the formation of an oral-aboral (O-A) body axis which is patterned by Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lebedeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marlow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Momose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Momose and Houliston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Niedermoser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wikramanayake et al., 2003</xref>). However, in contrast to Medusozoa (jellyfish and hydroids), Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) have an additional secondary, ‘directive’ body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is patterned by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finnerty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saina et al., 2009</xref>). While BMP signaling was also shown to regulate patterning of the D-V axis in Bilateria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt and Nübler-Jung, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozmikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lapraz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Özüak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>), it remains unclear whether this BMP-dependent body axis was a feature of the last common cnidarian–bilaterian ancestor and lost in Medusozoa, or whether it evolved independently in anthozoan Cnidaria and in Bilateria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genikhovich and Technau, 2017</xref>). To address this fundamental evolutionary question, we need to gain a better understanding of how the directive axis is established and patterned.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bilateral body symmetry of the non-bilaterian sea anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic> is BMP signaling-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bilateral body symmetry is observed in Bilateria and in anthozoan Cnidaria.

The expression of the core components of the BMP signaling network <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>chordin</italic> is initially controlled by β-catenin signaling and radially symmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirillova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rentzsch et al., 2006</xref>). During gastrulation, the embryo undergoes a BMP signaling-dependent symmetry break establishing the directive axis at a molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rentzsch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saina et al., 2009</xref>), with a BMP signaling activity gradient forming as revealed by antibody staining against phosphorylated SMAD1/5 (pSMAD1/5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère and Rentzsch, 2014</xref>). Each end of the directive axis expresses a set of BMP ligands and BMP antagonists: <italic>bmp2</italic>/<italic>4</italic> and <italic>bmp5-8</italic> are transcribed on the low BMP signaling activity side of the directive axis together with the antagonist <italic>chordin</italic>, while the BMP ligand <italic>gdf5-like</italic> (<italic>gdf5-l</italic>) and the BMP antagonist <italic>gremlin</italic> are expressed on the high BMP signaling activity side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rentzsch et al., 2006</xref>). The pSMAD1/5 gradient is maintained by the genetic interactions between these molecules, with Chordin likely acting as a shuttle for BMP2/4/BMP5-8 and Gremlin serving as a primary GDF5-like antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>). Another essential player in this network is the <italic>repulsive guidance molecule (rgm</italic>), which is necessary for the maintenance of the low BMP signaling side of the directive axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère and Rentzsch, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The graded BMP signaling activity is essential for the patterning of the endoderm and the formation of the so-called mesenteries, gastrodermal folds compartmentalizing the endoderm of the late planula into eight distinct chambers as demonstrated by knockdown (KD) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère and Rentzsch, 2014</xref>). More specifically, complete abolishment of the BMP signaling gradient by KD of <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>bmp5-8,</italic> or <italic>chordin</italic> results in embryos which are not only molecularly but also morphologically radialized, failing to form any mesenteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère and Rentzsch, 2014</xref>). In line with this, KD of <italic>gdf5-l</italic> or <italic>gremlin</italic> alter the profile of the BMP signaling gradient and lead to abnormal mesentery formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite these important insights over the last decades, our knowledge of BMP-dependent directive axis patterning mechanisms, in particular regarding effector molecules linking BMP signaling and subsequent morphological bilaterality in <italic>Nematostella,</italic> remains incomplete, precluding proper comparison of anthozoan directive and bilaterian D-V axis patterning. To address this, we performed a genome-wide search for direct BMP signaling targets at two developmental stages in <italic>Nematostella</italic> using ChIP-seq with an anti-pSMAD1/5 antibody. We demonstrate that regulatory genes, including many with previously documented bilaterally symmetric expression, are overrepresented among direct BMP signaling targets. We also identify multiple previously uncharacterized transcription factors (TFs) and signaling molecules (SMs), whose bilaterally symmetric expression suggests that these direct BMP signaling targets may be involved in the patterning of the directive axis and in endoderm compartmentalization. Several of these seem to be shared between <italic>Nematostella</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> as shown by comparison of pSMAD1/5 ChIP-seq targets at similar developmental stages. Among the targets with maximum ChIP enrichment, we find <italic>zswim4-6</italic>, a gene encoding a so far uncharacterized zinc-finger protein with a SWIM domain (ZSWIM4-6), whose paralogs are also pSMAD1/5 targets in the frog. Functional analyses show that <italic>Nematostella</italic> ZSWIM4-6 can modulate the shape of the pSMAD1/5 gradient and appears to promote BMP signaling-mediated gene repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of BMP signaling targets in <italic>Nematostella</italic></title><p>Staining with an antibody recognizing the transcriptionally active phosphorylated form of SMAD1/5 (pSMAD1/5) demonstrates that BMP signaling activity is highly dynamic during early development in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. In the early <italic>Nematostella</italic> gastrula, nuclear pSMAD1/5 can be detected in a radially symmetric domain around the blastopore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dii</xref>). Subsequently, it becomes restricted to one side of the gastrula and early planula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Diii and iv</xref>) in a symmetry breaking process, which has been shown to depend on BMP signaling itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saina et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting BMP gradient is crucial for the formation of the directive axis.

We injected <italic>Nematostella</italic> embryos with different concentrations of BMP2/4MO starting with 50 µM and going up to the regular BMP2/4MO working concentration of 300 µM in steps of 50 µM, and stained these embryos with probes against <italic>zswim4-6,</italic> a positively regulated gene, and <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, whose expression is suppressed by BMP signaling. Strikingly, within individual embryos, the response to the different concentrations of the BMP2/4MO was binary: either <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>zswim4-6</italic> expression appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>), or it was completely radialized or lost for, respectively, <italic>bmp2-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H’</xref>) and <italic>zswim4-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J’</xref>).

This is in line with an earlier observation of the binary effect of injecting iteratively decreasing concentrations of BMP2/4MO on mesentery formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère and Rentzsch, 2014</xref>). These results suggest that alterations in the BMP2/4-mediated signaling may not change the shape of the BMP signaling gradient, to which <italic>zswim4-6</italic> expression could be more or less robust, but rather define whether there is a BMP signaling gradient or not. Since the binary effect of the injection of different concentrations of the BMP2/4MO prevented us from gradually reducing the BMP signaling, these experiments did not exclude the possibility that the low level of nuclear pSMAD1/5 observed upon <italic>gdf5l</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>) was sufficient to activate the <italic>zswim4-6</italic> expression.

Thus, although BMP2/4-specific <italic>zswim4-6</italic> activation cannot be entirely ruled out by this double-KD experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H’’ and J’’</xref>), it currently seems likely that <italic>zswim4-6</italic> expression is not BMP ligand-specific but rather appears to be activated even by the slightest BMP input.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ZSWIM4-6 is a modulator of BMP-dependent patterning</title><p>Given that <italic>zswim4-6</italic> expression is bilaterally symmetric and highly dependent on BMP signaling in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, we wanted to see whether <italic>zswim4-6</italic> itself contributes to the patterning of the directive axis.

To this end, we performed anti-pSMAD1/5 immunostainings in 2d planulae and quantified pSMAD1/5 levels along the directive axis. We found that the gradient profile of pSMAD1/5 in the endoderm was flattened in <italic>zswim4-6</italic> morphants compared to controls, and that peak levels of pSMAD1/5 activity were not reached. pSMAD1/5 activity in the ectoderm was, however, strongly elevated upon <italic>zswim4-6</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–C’ and D–D’</xref>). To corroborate this, we analyzed the pSMAD1/5 gradient in embryos microinjected with <italic>zswim4-6-EGFP</italic> mRNA. Due to the very fast turnover of ZSWIM4-6-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–L</xref>), we quantified the gradient at the earliest possible stage after the symmetry break, that is, at late gastrula. <italic>zswim4-6</italic> mRNA overexpression did not result in significant changes in the shape of the pSMAD1/5 gradient in the endoderm; however, ectodermal pSMAD1/5 levels were significantly reduced in the area where BMP signaling is normally strongest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–E’ and F–F’</xref>). The expansion of the pSMAD1/5 domain upon <italic>Nematostella zswim4-6</italic> KD and its reduction upon <italic>zswim4-6</italic> overexpression suggests that SMAD1/5 may be stabilized in the absence of ZSWIM4-6. This is in line with the effect of the overexpression of zebrafish <italic>zzswim5</italic> on the pSmad1/5/9 gradient in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as with the recently reported role of the vertebrate <italic>Zswim4</italic> in frog embryos and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). There, it has been shown that Zswim4 attenuates BMP signaling by directly interacting with nuclear SMAD1 and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). To test whether <italic>Nematostella</italic> zswim4-6 may play a role in destabilizing nuclear SMAD1/5, we analyzed the shape of the nuclear pSMAD1/5 gradient in the GDF5-like morphants co-injected either with Control MO or with ZSWIM4-6MO. As we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>), pSMAD1/5 staining was drastically reduced upon GDF5lMO injection, but adding ZSWIM4-6MO to the GDF5lMO indeed led to a much milder reduction of the pSMAD1/5 gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the ZSWIM4-6-mediated pSMAD1/5 destabilization hypothesis.</p><p>We then evaluated how KD of <italic>zswim4-6</italic> affected the transcription of markers expressed on the low BMP and high BMP signaling ends of the directive axis. First, we looked at <italic>bmp2/4, chd,</italic> and <italic>rgm</italic> – the key regulators of pSMAD1/5 gradient formation in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, whose expression is repressed by high levels of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclère and Rentzsch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saina et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>chd</italic>, and <italic>rgm</italic> expression domains were expanded in <italic>zswim4-6</italic> morphants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), which was especially evident in the ectodermal expansion of <italic>chd</italic> and <italic>rgm</italic>. Similarly, the <italic>chd</italic> expression domain was also expanded in the mosaic F0 <italic>zswim4-6</italic> knockouts generated by CRISPR/Cas9, corroborating the morpholino KD results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). This was striking and unexpected since <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>chd</italic>, and <italic>rgm</italic> are repressed by BMP signaling, and their expansion was in spite of the much stronger pSMAD1/5 signal observed in the ectoderm of the ZSWIM4-6 morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D’</xref>). Next, we looked at the markers of the high BMP signaling end: <italic>zswim4-6</italic>, <italic>gdf5-like</italic>, and <italic>grm,</italic> which are positively regulated by BMP signaling. The KD of <italic>zswim4-6</italic> translation resulted in a strong upregulation of <italic>zswim4-6</italic> transcription, especially in the ectoderm, suggesting that ZSWIM4-6 might either act as its own transcriptional repressor or that <italic>zswim4-6</italic> transcription reacts to the increased ectodermal pSMAD1/5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and I’</xref>). The expression domain of <italic>gdf5-like</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and J’</xref>) and <italic>grm</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and K’</xref>) was expanded in the ectoderm, which reflects the flattening of the endodermal and the expansion of the ectodermal pSMAD1/5 gradient in the morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D’</xref>).</p><p>The overexpression of <italic>zswim4-6-EGFP</italic> by mRNA injection resulted in largely opposite effects on gene expression compared to the morpholino-mediated KD of ZSWIM4-6, although less pronounced. As expected from the analysis of the morphants, <italic>zswim4-6-egfp</italic> overexpression caused a mild reduction of the expression domains of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>chd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L–M’</xref>). Moreover, the otherwise very sharp border of the <italic>chd</italic> expression domain appeared diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M’</xref>). In situ hybridization with the <italic>zswim4-6</italic> probe detected exogenous <italic>zswim4-6</italic> throughout the injected embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N and N’</xref>). <italic>gdf5-like</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O and O’</xref>) appeared reduced on the ‘strong gdf5-like side’, and <italic>grm</italic> was reduced as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P and P’</xref>), which also reflects the behavior of the pSMAD1/5 gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and F’</xref>). Taken together, in the absence of ZSWIM4-6, changes in the expression of genes expressed on the high pSMAD1/5 side (<italic>gdf5-like</italic>, <italic>grm</italic>) appear to mimic the changes in the levels and range of the BMP signaling gradient. In contrast, genes repressed by BMP signaling and expressed on the low BMP signaling side of the directive axis (<italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>chd</italic>) seem to expand their expression domains in the absence of ZSWIM4-6 despite the increase in pSMAD1/5 levels. One possible explanation for this observation is that BMP signaling-mediated gene repression is less effective in the absence of <italic>ZSWIM4-6</italic>.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we wanted to analyze whether ZSWIM4-6 was differentially bound to pSMAD1/5 binding sites at the genes repressed by BMP signaling and at the genes activated by BMP signaling. Due to the lack of an anti-ZSWIM4-6 antibody and fast ZSWIM4-6-EGFP turnover in mRNA-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>), we microinjected <italic>EF1α::ZSWIM4-6-EGFP</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) to perform anti-GFP-ChIP on mosaic F0 embryos, where <italic>zswim4-6-egfp</italic> is transcribed under control of a ubiquitously active promoter in a small fraction of cells in each embryo. Since the amount of chromatin that could be immunoprecipitated in such an experimental setup was very low, we were limited to selecting one negatively regulated direct BMP target and one positively regulated direct BMP target for the subsequent qPCR analysis. We chose pSMAD1/5 sites in the regulatory regions of the negatively regulated direct BMP target <italic>chordin</italic> and the positively regulated direct BMP target <italic>gremlin</italic>, and checked by qPCR whether they were bound by ZSWIM4-6-EGFP. Binding to the <italic>Intergenic region IntA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schwaiger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwaiger et al., 2014</xref>) was used as a normalization control. The pSMAD1/5 binding site-containing region at the <italic>gremlin</italic> locus was depleted in both wild type and in <italic>EF1α::ZSWIM4-6-EGFP</italic>-injected embryos upon αGFP-ChIP (0.35-fold enrichment and 0.27-fold enrichment, respectively; not significant according to the two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test; p=0.496). On the other hand, the pSMAD1/5 binding site-containing region at the <italic>chordin</italic> locus was 1.82-fold enriched upon anti-GFP-ChIP in <italic>EF1α::ZSWIM4-6-EGFP</italic> embryos and 0.15-fold enriched (significant according to the two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test; p=0.00032) in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>). Thus, the enrichment of the pSMAD1/5 binding site-containing region at the <italic>chordin</italic> locus in <italic>EF1α::ZSWIM4-6-EGFP</italic> embryos in relation to wild-type embryos was 12.13-fold, in stark contrast to the 0.87-fold enrichment at the <italic>gremlin</italic> locus in <italic>EF1α::ZSWIM4-6-EGFP</italic> embryos in comparison to the wild-type embryos. This suggests an interaction of ZSWIM4-6 with the pSMAD1/5 binding site of the <italic>chordin</italic> regulatory region, but not of the <italic>gremlin</italic> regulatory region, and supports the hypothesis that ZSWIM4-6 might act as a co-repressor for pSMAD1/5 targets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>BMP signaling governs the expression of a second tier of developmental regulators</title><p>BMP signaling regulates the patterning of the anthozoan directive axis and the bilaterian D-V axis; however, the extent of conservation of downstream target genes between Bilateria and Cnidaria involved in the axial patterning has been largely unknown.

We find several <italic>hox</italic> genes as conserved direct BMP targets in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and BMP-dependent regulation of <italic>hox</italic> expression has been reported in these models.

We tested whether this apparent ligand-specific activation was due to BMP2/4 and GDF5-like using different type I BMP receptors (Alk2 vs. Alk3/6 or vice versa), but this hypothesis did not find experimental support. On the contrary, both Alk2 and Alk3/6 had to be knocked down in order to abolish <italic>zswim4-6</italic> transcription, suggesting that in our developmental context, Alk2 and Alk3/6 may need to heterodimerize to transduce BMP signal, similar to the situation reported in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tajer et al., 2021</xref>). Further analysis of the regulation of <italic>zswim4-6</italic> expression by BMP2/4 and GDF5-like suggested that <italic>zswim4-6</italic> was a highly sensitive BMP target, whose transcription could be initiated even by the residual BMP signal remaining after GDF5-like KD.</p><p>Members of the zinc-finger family with SWIM domain were found in Archaea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes, and they were suggested to be capable of interacting with other proteins or DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makarova et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Nematostella</italic> ZSWIM4-6 is a nuclear protein, whose paralogs, ZSWIM4, ZSWIM5, and ZSWIM6, are conserved in Bilateria. To date, several studies have linked ZSWIM4/5/6 with vertebrate neurogenesis and forebrain development. For instance, in the mouse, the paralogs <italic>zswim4-6</italic> were found to be expressed in the forebrain with distinct spatiotemporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Zswim6</italic> knockout mice display abnormal striatal neuron morphology and motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tischfield et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, <italic>zswim4</italic> mutations frequently occur in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Walter et al., 2012</xref>), while <italic>zswim6</italic> mutations in mammals associate with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (a rare disease characterized by craniofacial, brain and limb malformations), and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tischfield et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>zswim4/5</italic> in the frog embryo and <italic>zswim4/6</italic> in transit-amplifying mouse hair follicle cells are also direct targets of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>), and zebrafish <italic>zswim5</italic> is downregulated in gastrulating <italic>bmp7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos of <italic>D. rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenfeld et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that <italic>zswim4</italic>-6 is a conserved downstream target of BMP signaling in several species and may contribute to BMP signaling-dependent patterning events in various contexts. A recent study on frog embryos and mammalian cells provided first glimpses into the function of Zswim4 highlighting its role in attenuating BMP signaling by directly interacting with and promoting ubiquitination and degradation of the nuclear SMAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Our analyses of the effect of the up- or downregulation of the <italic>Nematostella zswim4-6</italic> and of the overexpression of the zebrafish <italic>zswim5</italic> on the shape of the pSMAD1/5 gradient in these two models appear to be in line with the vertebrate <italic>zswim4</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2022</xref>): ZSWIM4-6 may indeed have a conserved function as a destabilizer of nuclear SMAD1/5. However, beyond the effect on the pSMAD1/5 gradient, analysis of the transcriptional response of the BMP signaling targets to <italic>zswim4-6</italic> KD in <italic>Nematostella</italic> revealed a more complex picture. We showed that the genes known to be negatively regulated by BMP signaling were de-repressed and expanded their expression toward the ‘strong BMP signaling side’ of the directive axis in spite of the increased levels of nuclear pSMAD1/5, while the genes positively regulated by BMP signaling were only weakly affected. Together with the results of our ChIP analysis of EGFP-tagged <italic>Nematostella</italic> ZSWIM4-6 showing that ZSWIM4-6 can bind to the pSMAD1/5 binding site in the upstream regulatory region of one pSMAD1/5-repressed gene, <italic>chordin</italic>, but not to the pSMAD1/5 binding site in the upstream regulatory region of one pSMAD1/5-activated gene, <italic>gremlin</italic>, this suggests that ZSWIM4-6 might act as a co-repressor of pSMAD1/5 targets. Currently, this interpretation is based on the expression changes of the BMP-dependent genes as well as on a very limited ChIP analysis. In the future, the generation of a transgenic line with a tag knocked-in into the endogenous <italic>zswim4-6</italic> locus followed by ChIP-seq will challenge the role of ZSWIM4-6 as a potential conveyor of the BMP-mediated transcriptional repression at the genome-wide scale.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this article, we demonstrate that in the sea anemone <italic>N. vectensis</italic>, BMP signaling directly controls the expression of a number of previously characterized and many novel regulators of their bilaterally symmetric body plan.

After 2 hr in the blocking solution containing 5% heat-inactivated sheep serum/95% PTX-BSA (PTX-BSA = 1% BSA/PTX), the samples were incubated overnight with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-pSMAD1/5/9 [Cell Signaling, #13820; 1:200] or rat αNvHoxE antibody [1:500]) in blocking solution.

Measurements in the endodermal and the ectodermal body wall were performed separately. The nuclei were selected in the DAPI channel and measured in the pSMAD1/5 channel, starting in the middle of the domain where the pSMAD1/5 signal is strongest and moving toward the position on the opposite side of the embryo. Every nucleus in each embryo was assigned a coordinate along the 0 to π arc by dividing the sequential number of each nucleus by the total number of analyzed nuclei in that particular embryo. Anti-pSMAD1/5 staining intensities were then depicted as a function of the relative position of the nucleus.</p><p>TE wild-type zebrafish embryos were dechorionated using Pronase and injected at the one-cell stage with 20–210 pg <italic>zswim5</italic> mRNA (80 pg mRNA was injected for the quantification). Unfertilized and damaged embryos were removed ~1.5 hr post-injection, and embryos were incubated at 28°C. At 50% epiboly, embryos were fixed in cold 4% formaldehyde diluted in PBS. Uninjected embryos reached 50% epiboly 30–45 min before injected siblings. Fixed embryos were stored at 4°C overnight, washed with PBST, transferred to methanol (three PBST washes followed by three methanol washes), and stored at –20°C for at least 2 hr. Embryos were then washed 4–5 times with PBST, blocked in FBS-PBST (10% FBS, 1% DMSO, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) for at least 1 hr, and then incubated in 1:100 anti-pSmad1/5/9 (Cell Signaling, #13820) in FBS-PBST at 4°C overnight. After 5–7 PBST washes over a period of 2–6 hr, embryos were incubated again in FBS-PBST for at least 1 hr and then transferred to 1:500 goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa488 (Life Technologies, A11008) and 1:1000 DRAQ7 (Invitrogen, D15105) overnight at 4°C. Embryos were washed 5–7 times with PBST over a period of 2–6 hr and stored at 4°C overnight. pSmad1/5/9 immunofluorescence and DRAQ7 nuclear signal were imaged on a Lightsheet Z.1 microscope (ZEISS). Embryos were mounted in 1% low melting point agarose and imaged in water using a ×20 objective. Embryos were oriented with the animal pole toward the imaging objective, and 50–90 z-slices with 7 μm between each slice were acquired. Quantification was performed on maximum intensity projections as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>. Briefly, the images were manually rotated in Fiji with the ventral side to the left, an ROI was manually drawn around each embryo to exclude non-embryo background, and the ventral-to-dorsal intensity profile was determined by calculating the average intensity in each column of pixels (pixel size: 0.457 μm × 0.457 μm). The profiles were normalized to % length to account for embryo-to-embryo variability in length and divided into bins of 0.5% embryo length. For background subtraction, intensities measured as described above in four randomly oriented controls not exposed to the primary antibody were subtracted from intensity profiles. Data from the first and last 5% of the body axis length were excluded from analysis because the averages in the dorsalmost and ventralmost regions are calculated on relatively few pixels and are, therefore, less reliable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Anti-pSMAD1/5 ChIP analysis and RNA-seq analysis of BMP2/4 and GDF5-l morphants.</title><p>Supplementary data 1 contains called peaks, curated gene list, and DE analysis of putative targets identified by anti-pSMAD1/5 ChIP.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chiara Sinigaglia (Reviewer #1); Shuonan He (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should more clearly discuss the possible function of zswim4-6. There seem to 3 different proposed roles (all of which are interesting) between the two animals analyzed, but none of these is particularly well supported: (1) zswim4-6 modifies the BMP gradient (based on MO loss of function in Nv with pSmad staining lower in endoderm and higher in ectoderm), (2) zswim4-6 acts as a pSmad co-repressor (based on limited qChIP-PCR on two pSmad target genes in Nv), (3) zswim5 broadly dampens the BMP gradient (based on zebrafish gain of function showing loss of pSmad staining across the embryo and some phenotypes that may be related to BMP loss of function). Since zswim is a major focus of the manuscript, the authors should be clearer about what it is doing with respect to BMP signaling and BMP target gene regulation. They should also clearly discuss the limitations of the experiments and conclusions. Although in general not required by <italic>eLife</italic> policy, limited further experiments should help clarify the function of zswim in some of the cases, and more evidence for any one of the three possible roles would significantly improve the manuscript.</p><p>2) The conclusion that Zswim4-6 is a conserved BMP regulator is based on cross-species comparisons of BMP direct targets and the finding that Zswim4-6 is a BMP target both in Nematostella and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. However, the subsequent functional validation was done in zebrafish, whose Zswim4-6 homologs may or may not be directly regulated by BMP. As suggested by Reviewer#2, the authors should also look at published data from zebrafish during the comparison and check whether Zzswim5 is also subjected to BMP regulation.</p><p>3) The authors claim that Zzswim5 mRNA injection mimics BMP mutations. Two reviewers found that the evidence to support this was not compelling. The authors may consider a limited set of experiments such as carrying out in situ hybridization of conventional zebrafish DV marker genes such as Chd, Szl and Vent in Zzswim5 injected zebrafish larvae. Alternatively, the authors may choose to tune down the conclusion regarding the conserved function of Zswim4-6 in both the abstract as well as the discussion.</p><p>4) A major focus of the manuscript is to dissect the intimate interactions between BMP signal and Zswim4-6 during Nematostella directive axis establishment. However, the in situ patterns of Zswim4-6 are variable in control panels between figures 2, 4, 5, and 6, making it difficult to interpret the effects of different experimental manipulations. The authors should either explain the reason for this variability or provide more consistent Zswim4-6 in situ results to allow meaningful comparisons between experiments. The authors should also address the differential responses of Zswim4-6 in the ectoderm versus the endoderm, as suggested by Reviewer #2.</p><p>5) The additional comments made by the reviewers could help to improve the clarity of the manuscript and should be considered by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>i) I recommend avoiding the term &quot;Protostome&quot; (pg 11, Figure 1A), and opting for Lophotrocozoa and Ecdysozoa instead.</p><p>ii) The 3 days old planula in Figure 1D shows asymmetric staining for pSMAD1/5 activity (perpendicular to the directive axis): is this biologically relevant?</p><p>iii) Figure 2: the staging of 2d old planulae appears to vary. Is this reflecting a developmental variability?</p><p>iv) The expression patterns for zswim4-6 at the 4-day planula stage appear slightly different between Figure 2 and Figure 4F. In particular, the pattern shown in Figure 2 could be interpreted as being still bilaterally expressed.</p><p>v) The ZSWIM <italic>Xenopus</italic> sequences were not included in the phylogeny, I would suggest presenting them in Figure 4A for completeness.</p><p>vi) In Figures 6A and B, please display the level in the polyp body column at which the section was taken.</p><p>vii) With reference to Figure 6O-O' the text reads: &quot;not much change was observed in the gdf5-like expression&quot;, however from that image, it seems that the domain of expression is expanded. Could the Authors comment?</p><p>viii) Page 12: please add a reference to data after the statement &quot;Our ChiP and RNASeq data showed that Arp6 is directly suppressed by BMP&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the analysis of enrichment of different type of BMP target genes, how were the 100 random genes selected?</p><p>2. In the analysis of shared direct BMP targets between three species, I didn't follow the anchoring analysis that was able to reveal additional direct targets shared between all three species. Is this based on there being a single gene in Nematostella that was duplicated during evolution such that there are multiple homologues in other species (gata for instance)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. pSMAD1/5 ChIP-seq is a major highlight of the manuscript and serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis. In Figure 1 or the related supplemental figure, the authors should at least provide examples of genome browser views at certain target loci to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody used as well as the quality of their data. Showing representative pSMAD1/5 binding profiles at two developmental stages should also enable the audience to better visualize the dynamic changes of BMP activity at certain downstream targets and help illustrate the presence of BRE elements in relation to the pSMAD1/5 peaks.</p><p>2. Schwaiger and colleagues (2014) have systematically examined histone modifications, PolII, and p300 binding profiles at gastrula and planula stages in Nematostella. It would be informative to quantify the percentage of pSMAD1/5 peaks overlapping with previously annotated enhancer/open chromatin features.</p><p>3. The authors did not observe pSMAD1/5 peaks closely associated with BMP ligand-coding genes BMP2/4, BMP5-8, and GDF5-l, and concluded that these genes are not direct targets of BMP signal. This is surprising given previous observations using BMP MO-injected larvae in which GDF5-l expression is abolished and BMP2/4 and BMP5-8 expression increased (Genikhovich, et al., 2015). Do the authors observe similar expression changes in their RNA-seq dataset? If so, what could be the explanation? Is it possible that enhancer elements of these genes are located distally and as a result, the pSMAD1/5 peaks are assigned to other genes? Or maybe indirect gene regulation is in play here?</p><p>4. As stated in the public review section, I'm not sure if Figure 3 adds much to the overall story by forcefully comparing three datasets from different lineages at different developmental stages. As the authors stated themselves, across such large evolutionary distances, homology between genes such as Hox genes can be extremely challenging to discern. Even in cases where homology is evident, one cannot distinguish between ancestral regulatory interaction that was retained versus convergent evolution. I think a simple statement that many BMP targets identified in Nematostella have also been implicated to be regulated by BMP in different bilaterian lineages should be sufficient to convey the message. In addition, the left most and right most columns of transcription factor names in the Xla/Dme comparison are duplicated. Please correct if the authors intend to keep this figure.</p><p>5. The authors need to provide more consistent control images of Zswim4-6 in situ results in figure 5 and figure 6. In figure 5 B', H, and M, Zswim4-6 expression level and expression patterns (especially in the ectoderm) are clearly variable between control MO injection, EGFP mRNA injection, and sh_mOr injections. Is this due to stage differences when the larvae are collected or different in situ developing time? Since the goal here is to compare the effect of BMP manipulations on Zswim4-6 expression, more consistent control images are necessary. Otherwise, comparing Figure 5 panel H and I will lead to the conclusion that injecting dn_alk2 mRNA specifically activates Zswim4-6 expression in the ectoderm, opposite to what the authors are trying to claim.</p><p>6. Similar issues exist for Fig6 G to P, and the expression patterns of BMP2/4, Zswim4-6 and Gremlin are not comparable between control MO and EGFP injected larvae, which as the authors explained, is due to collection timing differences caused by rapid degradation of injected Zswim4-6 mRNA. To avoid confusion, maybe the authors can add stage labels (late gastrula versus mid-gastrula, or specific hours post fertilization) on top of these panels to guide the naïve audience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80803.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should more clearly discuss the possible function of zswim4-6.

There, using frog embryos and mammalian cells, they show that Zswim4 directly interacts with SMAD1 leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. To further address the possibility that ZSWIM4-6 may be involved in destabilizing pSMAD1/5 we co-injected ZSWIM4-6MO together with the GDF5-likeMO. GDF5-like knockdown drastically reduces pSMAD1/5 levels without abolishing it (Genikhovich et al. 2015), however, co-injection of ZSWIM4-6MO with the GDF5-likeMO partially rescues this effect, in line with the vertebrate data (Wang et al., 2022). The results of this experiment are shown in the new Figure 6 —figure supplement 3. While the precise molecular mechanism by which <italic>Nematostella</italic> ZSWIM4-6 exerts its function will require further analysis, its anti-pSMAD1/5 effect appears quite clear.</p><p>Testing the role of ZSWIM4-6 as a co-repressor of BMP-repressed genes proved to be more difficult than anticipated. An appropriate analysis of this would be at a genome-wide level by ChIP-seq identification of ZSWIM4-6-bound genes, however, this would require either raising anti-ZSWIM4-6 antibodies or knocking-in a tag into the <italic>zswim4-6</italic> locus, which is beyond the scope of this work. As a second approach, we tried to overactivate BMP signaling activity with concomitant ZSWIM4-6 knockdown to further test whether BMP-repressed targets become de-repressed in absence of</p><p>ZSWIM4-6. Unfortunately, we could not achieve a reliable, long-term upregulation of the BMP signaling activity by either injecting <italic>Nematostella bmp</italic> mRNAs or treating the embryos with human recombinant BMP2 and BMP5. In the discussion, we have stressed that the conclusion of ZSWIM4-6 being a co-repressor of pSmad5 targets is based on expression changes of the known BMP targets and on the direct ChIP analysis of two target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that Zswim4-6 is a conserved BMP regulator is based on cross-species comparisons of BMP direct targets and the finding that Zswim4-6 is a BMP target both in Nematostella and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. However, the subsequent functional validation was done in zebrafish, whose Zswim4-6 homologs may or may not be directly regulated by BMP. As suggested by Reviewer#2, the authors should also look at published data from zebrafish during the comparison and check whether Zzswim5 is also subjected to BMP regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison was done between <italic>Nematostella</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> because pSMAD1/5 ChIP-seq data only exist for these models. The functional validation was performed in zebrafish because we were planning to generate zswim5 mutants, whose analysis is currently in progress. We looked at the RNA-Seq data from zebrafish as suggested by the Reviewer 2, and found that <italic>zzswim5</italic> was downregulated in gastrulating <italic>bmp7</italic> mutant zebrafish, however, this gene was not among the 57 genes, which were considered to be direct BMP targets because their expression was affected by <italic>bmp7</italic> mRNA injection into cycloheximide-treated <italic>bmp7</italic> mutants (Greenfeld et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that Zzswim5 mRNA injection mimics BMP mutations. Two reviewers found that the evidence to support this was not compelling. The authors may consider a limited set of experiments such as carrying out in situ hybridization of conventional zebrafish DV marker genes such as Chd, Szl and Vent in Zzswim5 injected zebrafish larvae. Alternatively, the authors may choose to tune down the conclusion regarding the conserved function of Zswim4-6 in both the abstract as well as the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed in situ hybridization with the dorsal and ventral markers as suggested, but the results were not conclusive. We therefore tuned down all our zebrafish arguments limiting ourselves to noting that the effect of <italic>zzswim5</italic> overexpression reduces pSMAD1/5, as is also the case in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and, according to the work of Wang et al., 2022, in the frog.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A major focus of the manuscript is to dissect the intimate interactions between BMP signal and Zswim4-6 during Nematostella directive axis establishment. However, the in situ patterns of Zswim4-6 are variable in control panels between figures 2, 4, 5, and 6, making it difficult to interpret the effects of different experimental manipulations. The authors should either explain the reason for this variability or provide more consistent Zswim4-6 in situ results to allow meaningful comparisons between experiments. The authors should also address the differential responses of Zswim4-6 in the ectoderm versus the endoderm, as suggested by Reviewer #2.</p></disp-quote><p>The mentioned variability of in situ patterns is due to multiple changes and general optimization of the in situ protocol over the last years. To avoid confusion, we repeated the in situs for all figures mentioned above if they were performed with the old versions of the in situ protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The additional comments made by the reviewers could help to improve the clarity of the manuscript and should be considered by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see responses to the comments of the Reviewers below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>i) I recommend avoiding the term &quot;Protostome&quot; (pg 11, Figure 1A), and opting for Lophotrocozoa and Ecdysozoa instead.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the term Protostomia makes little sense embryologically, we believe that it makes sense to use the term as phylogenetically it is a convenient monophyletic group encompassing Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa under a single term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The 3 days old planula in Figure 1D shows asymmetric staining for pSMAD1/5 activity (perpendicular to the directive axis): is this biologically relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>At 3 days post fertilization, pSMAD1/5 staining is always quite variable in <italic>Nematostella</italic>. During this time <italic>chordin</italic> expression starts to dwindle and the gradient starts to disappear. We do not think that the asymmetry you mentioned is biologically relevant but rather represents a transition between the graded signaling we observe at 2 dpf and signaling in all 8 mesenteries we observe at 4 dpf.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Figure 2: the staging of 2d old planulae appears to vary.

In particular, the pattern shown in Figure 2 could be interpreted as being still bilaterally expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for noticing this. As the planula on Figure 2 was slightly overstained, we replaced the image with a better representative example.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) The ZSWIM <italic>Xenopus</italic> sequences were not included in the phylogeny, I would suggest presenting them in Figure 4A for completeness.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added <italic>Xenopus</italic> sequences to the tree as well (Figure 4A).

Could the Authors comment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for noticing this. In controls, there is a clear strong GDF5-like side, while upon <italic>zswim4-6</italic> mRNA injection, the staining becomes weaker. We repeated the in situ, replaced the control image with a more representative one and corrected the text. The reduction of <italic>gdf5-like</italic> and <italic>grm</italic> reflect the reduction of the pSMAD1/5 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>viii) Page 12: please add a reference to data after the statement &quot;Our ChiP and RNASeq data showed that Arp6 is directly suppressed by BMP&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a reference to the Supplementary table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In the analysis of enrichment of different type of BMP target genes, how were the 100 random genes selected?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following explanation:</p><p>&quot;100 random NVE models</p><p>(https://figshare.com/articles/Nematostella_vectensis_transcriptome_and_gene_models <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/Nematostella_vectensis_transcriptome_and_gene_models_v2_0/807696">_v2_0/807696</ext-link>) were selected by randomly sorting the NVE models using the sort -R command in bash and taking the top 100 entries. The models were then manually annotated based on the NCBI BLASTX result&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the analysis of shared direct BMP targets between three species, I didn't follow the anchoring analysis that was able to reveal additional direct targets shared between all three species. Is this based on there being a single gene in Nematostella that was duplicated during evolution such that there are multiple homologues in other species (gata for instance)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, exactly. We re-wrote this part of the Results section to make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. pSMAD1/5 ChIP-seq is a major highlight of the manuscript and serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis. In Figure 1 or the related supplemental figure, the authors should at least provide examples of genome browser views at certain target loci to demonstrate the specificity of the antibody used as well as the quality of their data. Showing representative pSMAD1/5 binding profiles at two developmental stages should also enable the audience to better visualize the dynamic changes of BMP activity at certain downstream targets and help illustrate the presence of BRE elements in relation to the pSMAD1/5 peaks.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We added a new Figure-1—figure supplement-1 to show examples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Schwaiger and colleagues (2014) have systematically examined histone modifications, PolII, and p300 binding profiles at gastrula and planula stages in Nematostella. It would be informative to quantify the percentage of pSMAD1/5 peaks overlapping with previously annotated enhancer/open chromatin features.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We added this information to the text and to the Supplementary Data 1 file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors did not observe pSMAD1/5 peaks closely associated with BMP ligand-coding genes BMP2/4, BMP5-8, and GDF5-l, and concluded that these genes are not direct targets of BMP signal. This is surprising given previous observations using BMP MO-injected larvae in which GDF5-l expression is abolished and BMP2/4 and BMP5-8 expression increased (Genikhovich, et al., 2015). Do the authors observe similar expression changes in their RNA-seq dataset? If so, what could be the explanation? Is it possible that enhancer elements of these genes are located distally and as a result, the pSMAD1/5 peaks are assigned to other genes? Or maybe indirect gene regulation is in play here?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of pSMAD1/5 binding may seem surprising given that expression of <italic>Nematostella</italic> BMP genes is affected by BMP knockdown, and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and frog nearly all BMP genes are directly regulated by BMP signaling.</p><p>Expression changes in the RNA-Seq dataset mostly fit previous in situ hybridization results from us and others. For example, in the BMP2/4 KD dataset, <italic>Chordin</italic>, <italic>rgm</italic>, <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>bmp5-8</italic> are upregulated, and <italic>Gremlin</italic>, <italic>Gbx</italic>, <italic>HoxE/Anthox1a</italic>, <italic>HoxD/Anthox8</italic>, <italic>HoxB/Anthox6a</italic>, <italic>Lbx</italic> are downregulated. Of all the genes with the previously documented expression change upon the BMP2/4 KD, only <italic>GDF5-like</italic> did not show a statistically significant downregulation in the RNA-Seq, although it was abolished in the in situ hybridization (Genikhovich et al., 2015). Similarly, upon GDF5-like KD, <italic>Gremlin</italic>, <italic>HoxE</italic> and <italic>HoxD</italic> were downregulated, while changes in the <italic>HoxB</italic> and <italic>Gbx</italic> were not significant, as observed also in earlier in situ results (Genikhovich et al., 2015).</p><p>Certainly, it is possible that the expression of the BMP genes is controlled by distal pSMAD1/5-bound enhancers, but the necessary chromosome conformation capture experiments to test this hypothesis are out of scope of this paper.</p><p>We believe that indirect regulation is highly probable. First of all, we have generated a transgenic <italic>bmp2/4::mCherry</italic> reporter line (Figure 6D-D’ in Schwaiger et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.162529.113), which shows expression on one side of the directive axis of the early embryo. This expression is driven by a 4.5 kb fragment of gDNA upstream of the translation start site in the <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, and our ChIP shows no significant pSMAD1/5 binding in this region. Second, once <italic>chordin</italic> stops to be expressed by 4d post fertilization, we observe BMP signaling in the mesenteries, i.e. in the same cells, which express <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>bmp5-8</italic>. Since our KD experiments clearly show that both these BMP genes are suppressed by BMP signaling in the 1d and 2d embryos, it is likely that in 1d and 2d embryos this repression is mediated not by pSMAD1/5 but by some other factor, which is positively regulated by pSMAD1/5 and which is not expressed in the mesenteries of the 4d planula.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As stated in the public review section, I'm not sure if Figure 3 adds much to the overall story by forcefully comparing three datasets from different lineages at different developmental stages. As the authors stated themselves, across such large evolutionary distances, homology between genes such as Hox genes can be extremely challenging to discern. Even in cases where homology is evident, one cannot distinguish between ancestral regulatory interaction that was retained versus convergent evolution. I think a simple statement that many BMP targets identified in Nematostella have also been implicated to be regulated by BMP in different bilaterian lineages should be sufficient to convey the message. In addition, the left most and right most columns of transcription factor names in the Xla/Dme comparison are duplicated. Please correct if the authors intend to keep this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for noticing the error in the Figure 3! We have corrected it. As to your comment regarding the content of the figure, we agree that orthology statements for the individual cnidarian and bilaterian Hox genes do not have factual support. Therefore, we removed a Hox gene from the list of targets potentially conserved between all three species. Nevertheless, given the abundance of BMP targets among <italic>Nematostella</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> Hox genes, there is a certain probability that one or more Hox genes of the last common cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor was under BMP control. The fact that the Hox co-factor Meis is also a shared target for all three species adds extra weight to this probability. For the other genes, orthology statements are less problematic, and we think it important to point out which genes are repeatedly recovered as direct BMP targets in these very distantly related species. We certainly cannot exclude the possibility that this may be a result of convergence rather than conservation, but we might see more support for either conservation or convergence hypothesis once BMP targets are identified in a wider variety of animals across Planulozoa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors need to provide more consistent control images of Zswim4-6 in situ results in figure 5 and figure 6. In figure 5 B', H, and M, Zswim4-6 expression level and expression patterns (especially in the ectoderm) are clearly variable between control MO injection, EGFP mRNA injection, and sh_mOr injections. Is this due to stage differences when the larvae are collected or different in situ developing time? Since the goal here is to compare the effect of BMP manipulations on Zswim4-6 expression, more consistent control images are necessary. Otherwise, comparing Figure 5 panel H and I will lead to the conclusion that injecting dn_alk2 mRNA specifically activates Zswim4-6 expression in the ectoderm, opposite to what the authors are trying to claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comments to the Editor. The differences are due to changes in our in situ protocol. We have repeated the experiments using the new in situ protocol and replaced the problematic images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Similar issues exist for Fig6 G to P, and the expression patterns of BMP2/4, Zswim4-6 and Gremlin are not comparable between control MO and EGFP injected larvae, which as the authors explained, is due to collection timing differences caused by rapid degradation of injected Zswim4-6 mRNA. To avoid confusion, maybe the authors can add stage labels (late gastrula versus mid-gastrula, or specific hours post fertilization) on top of these panels to guide the naïve audience.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the responses to the Essential revisions.
