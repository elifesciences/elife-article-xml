However, despite extensive studies on IgM as an ancient antiviral weapon in warm-blooded vertebrates, its role and mechanisms in combating viral infections in early vertebrates remain poorly understood. Here, significant virus-specific sIgM titers are generated in the serum and gut mucus of a teleost fish (largemouth bass) that survive infection, and fish lacking sIgM were more susceptible to viral infection. These results challenge the paradigm that IgM and IgT are specialized to systemic and mucosal immunity, respectively. More crucially, the neutralization assay provides further insight into the role of sIgM in viral neutralization and clarifies the mechanism through which teleost sIgM blocks viral infection by directly targeting viral particles. From an evolutionary perspective, sIgM in both primitive and modern vertebrates follows conserved principles in the development of specialized antiviral immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>teleost</kwd><kwd>IgM</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32225050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24A20461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32303053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Weiguang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>sIgM plays a role in viral neutralization across both primitive and modern vertebrates by following conserved principles in the development of specialized antiviral immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The origin of immunoglobulins (Ig) in jawed vertebrates can be traced back approximately 500 million years ago (Mya), marking a significant milestone in the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirano et al., 2011</xref>). Igs are highly specialized recognition glycoproteins that play a vital role in adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilal et al., 2021</xref>). All jawed vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, bony fish, and cartilaginous fish, express multiple classes of Igs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stavnezer and Amemiya, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2016</xref>). However, the specific isotypes vary across taxa due to evolutionary and selective pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stavnezer and Amemiya, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Agnathans, the most ancient vertebrate lineage, do not possess bona fide Ig but have variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) capable of mediating adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flajnik, 2018</xref>). Cartilaginous fish are the earliest vertebrates, from a phylogenetic perspective, to have evolved an adaptive immune system based on Igs. To date, three Ig isotypes have been identified in Chondrichthyes: IgM, IgW (which is homologous to IgD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edholm et al., 2010</xref>), and IgNAR (a lineage-specific isotype unique to cartilaginous fish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dooley, 2018</xref>). IgT is exclusively expressed in teleost fish and represents the most primitive Ig isotype specialized in mucosal immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, while IgT has been identified in the majority of teleost species, genomic analyses reveal its absence in some species, such as medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), channel catfish (<italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>), Atlantic cod (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>), and turquoise killifish (<italic>Nothobranchius furzeri</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BengteÌn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradshaw and Valenzano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MagadÃ¡n-MompÃ³ et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">GyÃ¶rkei et al., 2024</xref>). The prevailing perspective is that avian and mammalian IgA evolved from a precursor of amphibian IgX, whereas mammalian IgG and IgE evolved from a precursor of amphibian IgY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schaerlinger et al., 2008</xref>). For decades, IgD was thought to be sporadically present in mammals and absent in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flajnik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 1997</xref>). However, the discovery of IgD in an ostrich species (<italic>Struthio camelus</italic>) confirmed its presence across all classes of jawed vertebrates, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of Ig isotype evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flajnik and Kasahara, 2010</xref>). Similar to IgD, IgM is considered one of the most primordial Ig isotypes throughout evolution, as it is present in all extant gnathostomes, with the potential unique exception of the coelacanth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keyt et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to other Ig isotypes, an exceptionally conserved feature of IgM is its ability to form polymeric structures, which are particularly suited for binding to viral surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boes, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the assembly mechanism of IgM exhibits significant evolutionary variation across vertebrate lineages. In cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods, IgM is secreted as a J chain-linked pentamer, which may enhance multivalent antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagiwara et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hohman et al., 2003</xref>). By contrast, teleosts have undergone J chain gene loss, resulting in the stable formation of tetrameric IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bromage et al., 2004</xref>). Given the unique and intriguing features of secreted IgM (sIgM), immunologists are becoming increasingly interested in studying its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blandino and Baumgarth, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite differences in its assembly mechanisms and the degree of polymerization of its secretory form among various vertebrate groups, IgM is known for its remarkable functional stability and conservation. It is the largest Ig classes in plasma and the first antibody produced during an antiviral humoral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schroeder and Cavacini, 2010</xref>). Although previous studies have suggested that IgM is involved in maintaining mucosal tissue homeostasis, it is generally considered to be a major Ig isotype that plays a key role in the antiviral systemic immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ochsenbein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boes et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, IgM serves not only as a crucial effector molecule in the initial humoral defense against pathogens but may also contribute to mucosal protection during the early stages of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Studies in tetrapods have unveiled the pivotal role and conserved properties of IgM in combating viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun and Zhao, 2014</xref>). According to commonly held views, IgM is rapidly produced early in the humoral immune response against viral infections, providing fast and strong protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ouchida et al., 2012</xref>). For certain viruses predominantly controlled by B cells, such as polyomavirus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), IgM provides sufficient protection against fatal infection during the acute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beebe and Cooper, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>). However, recent studies in mice revealed the presence of long-lived, antigen-specific IgM plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohannon et al., 2016</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) secreted by plasma cells are the fundamental molecular armament of antiviral humoral immunity, serving as the primary mechanism through which Igs protect the body from viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, there is little evidence supporting the neutralizing capacity of IgM in mucosal tissues. New research on SARS-CoV-2 provides compelling evidence that plasma from convalescent individuals also exhibits IgM-mediated neutralization activity, with neutralization titers showing a strong correlation with IgM levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ku et al., 2021</xref>). Although sIgM functions have been extensively studied in warm-blooded animals, less is known regarding sIgM function in primitive vertebrates. The function of IgM from teleost fish is of particular interest, considering these fish represent an early evolutionary stage in the development of vertebrate adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor and Dimmock, 1985</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that IgM is the predominant Ig isotype involved in the immune response to pathogens in systemic compartments (e.g. serum, spleen, and head kidney), where significant accumulations of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells were found after infection with parasitic and bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the serum of fish that survive parasitic or bacterial infection harbors high levels of pathogen-specific IgM, coupled with negligible IgT-specific titers and no specific IgD. In contrast, IgT is the main Ig response in the mucus of the same fish. Additionally, previous studies reported that induced viral-specific sIgT within the mucus is capable of neutralizing viruses, with fish lacking IgT being significantly more susceptible to viruses compared to those with IgT, suggesting that sIgT is essential for the control of mucosal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, recent observations show that specific IgM levels were significantly increased in both serum and gut mucus upon <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> and spring viremia of carp (SVCV) infection, challenging the paradigm that pathogen-specific IgT and IgM responses are strictly compartmentalized in mucosal and systemic immunity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2024</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of teleost fish to produce specific serum and mucus sIgM recognizing viral antigens in response to viruses across a wide range of teleost species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mashoof and Criscitiello, 2016</xref>). However, the precise contribution and mechanisms through which teleost IgM provides protection against viral infection remain poorly understood. Since IgM is the most abundant Ig class in fish body fluids, it was hypothesized that teleost sIgM, similar to mammalian sIgM, plays a role in viral neutralization across both primitive and modern vertebrates.</p><p>To verify the aforementioned hypothesis, a viral infection model was established by intraperitoneally injecting largemouth bass (<italic>Micropterus salmoides</italic>) with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464820304848">largemouth bass virus (LMBV</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464820304848">)</ext-link>, which induces typical symptoms and severe pathological changes, evoking a robust immune response in both systemic and mucosal areas. The data revealed significant proliferation and accumulation of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells in the gut and head kidney, accompanied by increased viral-specific sIgM titers in serum and mucus, reinforcing the notion that sIgM participates in both mucosal and systemic immunity. To further validate the role of sIgM in antiviral defense, an IgM depletion model was employed in teleost fish, revealing that fish devoid of sIgM are more susceptible to the virus than control fish. Importantly, the induced virus-specific sIgM can neutralize viruses in vitro, thereby revealing an effector role of sIgM in both serum and gut mucus against viral infection. More importantly, teleost sIgM may neutralize viruses by directly acting on viral particles to block infection. Collectively, these data provide proof of concept that IgM serves as an ancient weapon in the adaptive immune response against viral infections, preserved throughout evolution across all vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of LMBV infection model and immune responses in largemouth bass upon LMBV infection</title><p>To investigate the dynamic immune response of largemouth bass to viral infection, a viral infection model was established using LMBV. The fish were infected by intraperitoneal injection with LMBV (100 Î¼L, 1Ã10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>), and tissue samples were collected at 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-infection (DPI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The infected fish exhibited typical symptoms, such as skin ulceration, subdermal hemorrhage, and spleen enlargement, at 4 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>), reaching a cumulative mortality of 57% within 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). qPCR analyses revealed the presence of high LMBV loads in the spleen (SP), head kidney (HK), and gut, especially at 4 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

The innate and adaptive immune responses were most intense at 4 and 28 DPI, respectively. Consequently, these two time points were chosen for RNA-Seq analysis to further characterize the immune responses in HK and gut tissues following LMBV infection. Specifically, 1237 and 1388 genes were up-regulated in the HK at 4 and 28 DPI, whereas 22 and 1413 genes were up-regulated in the gut at these time points. Additionally, 1616 and 916 genes were down-regulated in the HK, and 2004 and 143 extensive changes in immune-related genes in the HK and gut at 4 and 28 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated an antiviral immune response process occurring in the HK and gut, with enrichment in pathways such as NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and the intestinal immune network for IgA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Furthermore, key genes involved in antiviral responses and innate immunity were up-regulated at 4 DPI, whereas genes associated with adaptive immunity were up-regulated at 28 DPI in both HK and gut tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>).

Therefore, the subsequent investigation focused on exploring the specific antiviral mechanisms of IgM. To verify whether viral-specific IgM could also neutralize viruses, the virus was first incubated for 1 hr with serum or gut mucus from control and 42DPI-S fish. The role of IgM was evaluated by depleting IgM from half of the 42DPI-S serum or gut mucus to obtain IgM-depleted samples (42DPI-S-IgMDEP serum or gut mucus; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). After incubation, EPC cells were exposed to these three different LMBV-containing samples (control, 42DPI-S, and 42DPI-S-IgMDEP), and EPC cell viability, CPE, and viral loads were subsequently assessed at 2 and 4 days post-incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Lower EPC viability and significantly higher CPE were observed in the control and 42DPI-S-IgMDEP groups compared to the 42DPI-S group, regardless of whether the sample was derived from serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) or gut mucus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the protective efficacy of 42DPI-S was attributable to LMBV-specific IgM. Consistent with these findings, the expression of the LMBV-<italic>MCP</italic> gene and protein levels were notably decreased in EPC cells treated with the 42DPI-S serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, G and I</xref>) or gut mucus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, H and J</xref>) compared to control fish. However, their levels were similar to control fish when IgM was depleted in the 42DPI-S samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EâJ</xref>). Similarly, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the number of LMBV-infected EPC cells treated with 42DPI-S samples (i.e. serum and gut mucus) decreased significantly compared to the control fish, whereas the number of infected EPC cells in the 42DPI-S-IgMDEP group increased and nearly returned to the level observed in control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6KâN</xref>). To further rule out complement or other factors, specific IgM was purified from serum and gut mucus of 42DPI-S fish for neutralization assays.

Therefore, the investigation focused on identifying the specific stage of viral infection at which viral-specific IgM exerts its anti-LMBV effect. To this end, serum or gut mucus from control and 42DPI-S fish was directly added to co-incubate with the virus or EPC cells before or during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To further confirm that the anti-LMBV effect is indeed carried out by IgM, IgM depletion treatment to the serum or mucus (42DPI-S-IgMDEP serum or gut mucus) was also applied as described above. The virus infection process is roughly divided into four phases: pre-infection, virus adsorption (at 4 â), virus invasion (0â2 hours post-infection (hpi) at 28 â), and replication (2â24 hpi). After 24 hpi, samples were collected to measure the levels of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>) and viral protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7DâG</xref>).

Recent discoveries have shed new light on IgM as an ancient antiviral weapon that plays a pivotal role in antiviral humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong and Ruprecht, 2020</xref>). In mammals, IgM has been shown to neutralize viruses, such as in plasma from convalescent patients recovering from COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrington et al., 2021</xref>). Depletion of IgM in these cases resulted in a loss of neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, significantly increasing susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gasser et al., 2021</xref>). Compared to mammals, while pathogen-specific sIgM responses are highly induced in systemic and mucosal tissues of teleosts, the precise function and mechanisms of IgM in these organisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study fills significant gaps in our fundamental understanding of IgM function and evolution in the vertebrate lineage.</p><p>Here, a model of LMBV infection was developed by intraperitoneal injection in largemouth bass, an ancient teleost species. Following viral infection, the fish exhibited typical symptoms of LMBV, including hemorrhagic symptoms of the skin and fins and splenomegaly. Additionally, severe histological changes were observed in the HK, SP, and gut, including cellular shedding, erythrocyte infiltration, and intercellular space enlargement, consistent with symptoms reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, qPCR analysis demonstrates that the gut harbored higher LMBV loads compared to the HK and SP, indicating that in viral-infected fish, mucosal tissues mount a robust immune response alongside systemic immune organs. Previous studies have shown that several immune-related genes are significantly upregulated in teleost fish after infection with viral pathogens such as infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kong et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2022</xref>) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">NuÃ±ez-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, LMBV infection significantly upregulates several immune genes in both systemic immune organs (HK and SP) and mucosal tissues (gut) of largemouth bass. These immune genes are associated with inflammatory responses (i.e. IL-6, IL-10, IL-1Î², IL-8, and TNF-Î±; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shi et al., 2023</xref>), antiviral responses (i.e. IRF3, IRF7, IFN-Î³, TRIM25, and DHX58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zou and Secombes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ning et al., 2011</xref>), B cell activation (CD79a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>), B cell proliferation and antibody secretion (CD22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tedder et al., 2005</xref>), and Ig heavy chain genes (IgM, IgD, and IgT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with findings in other teleosts and mammals following viral infection. Furthermore, transcriptome data revealed an increase in IgM expression in both the HK and gut on day 28 post-LMBV infection. Therefore, these findings suggest that teleost IgM plays a role in both systemic and mucosal areas during viral infection.</p><p>To verify this hypothesis, IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells and IgM responses to the virus were further analyzed at both the cellular and protein levels. Consistent with the changes in IgM concentrations in serum and gut mucus, a large number of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells proliferated and accumulated in the HK and gut of 28DPI-S and 42DPI-S fish, indicating that these accumulated IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells resulted in a significant enhancement of the sIgM response to viral infection. Similarly, numerous IgM-secreting plasma cells and a dramatic increase in sIgM concentrations have been observed in the bone marrow and serum of mammals after influenza virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skountzou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Virus-specific IgM production has been well-documented in reptiles, birds, and mammals upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dascalu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neul et al., 2017</xref>). While current evidence confirms the capacity of cartilaginous fish and amphibians to mount specific IgM responses against bacterial pathogens and immune antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dooley and Flajnik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramsey et al., 2010</xref>), the potential for viral induction of analogous IgM-mediated immunity in these species remains unresolved. A significant increase in virus-specific sIgM titers was found in both serum and gut mucus, consistent with prior findings in common carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) infected with SVCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2024</xref>). These results suggest that sIgM contributes to immune protection at both mucosal and systemic immunity, challenging the current paradigm that IgM in fish is specialized as a systemic Ig isotype against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sunyer, 2013</xref>). Notably, 42DPI-S fish survived upon reinfection with a lower dose of LMBV in the SP, HK, and gut, indicating the development of protective immunity in these fish. Next, to assess the indispensable role of sIgM in LMBV resistance, IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells were depleted in largemouth bass using a novel strategy recently described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2023</xref>. Importantly, fish devoid of sIgM became more susceptible to LMBV infection compared to control fish. This was characterized by severe pathological manifestations in the SP, HK, and gut, accompanied by markedly higher viral loads and a notable increase in mortality. Studies on mammals have shown that IgM<sup>-/-</sup> mice, lacking sIgM, lost their resistance to West Nile virus, even following inoculation with low viral doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diamond et al., 2003</xref>). These data support the critical role of fish IgM in host defense against viral infection.</p><p>The main attribute determining the antiviral efficacy of specific antibodies lies in their ability to neutralize viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton, 2002</xref>). Extensive studies in endotherms (birds and mammals) have demonstrated that specific IgM contributes to viral resistance by neutralizing viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgarth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diamond et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ku et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the neutralizing activity of IgM in amphibians and reptiles remains largely unexplored. Although viral infections have been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in Chinese soft-shelled turtles (<italic>Pelodiscus sinensisâ</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nie and Lu, 1999</xref>), the specific Ig isotypes mediating this response have yet to be elucidated. In teleost fish, IgM has been shown to possess viral neutralizing activity similar to that observed in endotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, recent work demonstrated that secretory IgT (sIgT) in rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) can neutralize viruses, significantly reducing susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). However, whether IgM in teleost fish possesses the antiviral neutralizing capacity necessary for fish to resist reinfection remains poorly understood. To explore this, IgM-depleted serum or gut mucus was pre-incubated with EPC cell cultures, resulting in a significant reduction in their ability to protect EPC cells from viral infection. To the best of our knowledge, the present investigation provides new insights into the role of sIgM in viral neutralization, suggesting a potential function of sIgM in combating viral infections. Similarly, viral-specific sIgM in serum plays a central role in humoral immunity, providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection by neutralizing viral effects and blocking viral entry into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gasser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klingler et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Polymeric IgM mediates neutralization due to its higher avidity and steric hindrance, inhibiting virus attachment and entry into target cells with great breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). A growing body of evidence suggests that IgM mediates neutralization primarily by targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viruses, blocking virus binding to cell receptors, and effectively preventing infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Warr et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). EPC cells pre-incubated with serum or gut mucus from 42DPI-S fish, which contained high levels of virus-specific IgM, showed higher viability, a milder cytopathic effect (CPE), and lower LMBV loads. These results align with previous findings that IgM antibodies exhibit strong neutralizing activity during viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infections in trout and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chinchilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest that IgM-mediated neutralization can block virus entry into cells. In our study, neutralization assay results revealed that sIgM in teleost fish neutralizes viruses by directly targeting viral particles, rendering them non-infectious and effectively preventing infection. The mechanism through which IgM neutralizes viruses may involve the direct destruction of the virus. This is consistent with recent research suggesting that physical disruption of the virus through antibody-imposed structural collisions damages its integrity, thus reducing its infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, additional studies are needed to explore the specific antiviral mechanisms of IgM. Importantly, virus-specific IgM antibodies in teleost fish constitute a primary line of defense in the systemic humoral response against viral infections, while also providing mucosal protection. Therefore, these data further support the concept that sIgM holds an important role in both mucosal and systemic immunity.</p><p>In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that teleost fish generate specific IgM responses in both systemic and mucosal tissues upon LMBV infection, providing further insight into the potential role and underlying mechanism of sIgM in the antiviral defense of teleost fish. The specific IgM response to viral infection in teleost fish is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Upon infection, severe histological changes and robust adaptive immune responses occur in systemic (e.g. HK) and mucosal (gut) tissues. Subsequently, IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells in the HK and gut were activated, underwent local proliferation, and differentiated into plasma cells to produce virus-specific IgM. Moreover, fish lacking sIgM showed increased susceptibility to viral infection, indicating the important role of sIgM in protection against viral infection. Crucially, the neutralization assay results indicate that specific IgM possesses the capacity for viral neutralization and can directly act on viral particles to block infection. Although the definitive mechanisms of teleost sIgM in antiviral defense were not fully characterized in this study, these observations suggest that sIgM in both primitive and modern vertebrates utilize conserved mechanisms in response to viral infections. Finally, these data demonstrated that sIgM may contribute to viral resistance in fish mucosal compartments, which has significant implications for the future design of fish vaccines aimed at enhancing mucosal sIgM responses.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the proposed function and mechanism of teleost sIgM in response to LMBV infection.</title><p>In a healthy state, the gut contains few IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells and lower levels of sIgM protein.

Antigens (Ag) from LMBV are captured by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and subsequently presented to naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells then activate IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells, prompting their proliferation. Subsequently, activated B cells may differentiate into plasma cells or memory IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells. Upon secondary LMBV infection, plasma cells produce substantial quantities of LMBV-specific IgM. Critically, these virus-specific sIgM from both mucosal and systemic sources has the ability to neutralize the virus by directly binding viral particles and blocking host cell entry, thereby effectively reducing the proliferation of viruses within tissues. Consequently, the IgM-mediated neutralization confers protection against LMBV-induced tissue damage and significantly reduced mortality during secondary infection.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104465-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Largemouth bass (5â8 g) used in this study were obtained from Huangshi (Hubei, China) and maintained in a recirculating water system at 28Â±1 â.

The study employs an IgM depletion model, viral infection experiments, and complementary in vitro assays to explore the role of IgM in systemic and mucosal immunity. The authors conclude that IgM is crucial for both systemic and mucosal antiviral defense, highlighting its role in viral neutralization through direct interactions with viral particles. The study's findings have theoretical implications for understanding immunoglobulin function across vertebrates and practical relevance for aquaculture immunology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript applies multiple complementary approaches, including IgM depletion, viral infection models, and histological and gene expression analyses, to address an important immunological question. The study challenges established views that IgT is primarily responsible for mucosal immunity, presenting evidence for a dual role of IgM at both systemic and mucosal levels. If validated, the findings have evolutionary significance, suggesting the conserved role of IgM as an antiviral effector across jawed vertebrates for over 500 million years. The practical implications for vaccine strategies targeting mucosal immunity in fish are noteworthy, addressing a key challenge in aquaculture.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Several conceptual and technical issues undermine the strength of the evidence:</p><p>Monoclonal Antibody (MoAb) Validation: The study relies heavily on a monoclonal antibody to deplete IgM, but its specificity and functionality are not adequately validated. The epitope recognized by the antibody is not identified, and there is no evidence excluding cross-reactivity with other isotypes. Mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, or Western blot analysis using tissue lysates with varying immunoglobulin expression levels would strengthen the claim of IgM-specific depletion.</p><p>IgM Depletion Kinetics: The rapid depletion of IgM from serum and mucus (within one day) is unexpected and inconsistent with prior literature. Additional evidence, such as Western blot analyses comparing treated and control fish, is necessary to confirm this finding.</p><p>Novelty of Claims: The manuscript claims a novel role for IgM in viral neutralization, despite extensive prior literature demonstrating this role in fish. This overstatement detracts from the contribution of the study and requires a more accurate contextualization of the findings.</p><p>Support for IgM's Crucial Role: The mortality data following IgM depletion do not fully support the claim that IgM is indispensable for antiviral defense. The survival of IgM-depleted fish remains high (75%) compared to non-primed controls (~50%), suggesting that other immune components may compensate for IgM loss</p><p>.</p><p>Presentation of IgM Depletion Model: The study describes the IgM depletion model as novel, although similar models have been previously published (e.g., Ding et al., 2023). This should be clarified to avoid overstating its novelty.</p><p>While the manuscript attempts to address an important question in teleost immunology, the current evidence is insufficient to fully support the authors' conclusions. Addressing the validation of the monoclonal antibody, re-evaluating depletion kinetics, and tempering claims of novelty would strengthen the study's impact. The findings, if rigorously validated, have important implications for understanding the evolution of vertebrate immunity and practical applications in fish health management.</p><p>This work is of interest to immunologists, evolutionary biologists, and aquaculture researchers. The methodological framework, once validated, could be valuable for studying immunoglobulin function in other non-model organisms and for developing targeted vaccine strategies. However, the current weaknesses limit its broader applicability and impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank Reviewer for the helpful comments.

Quantitative mass spectrometry verified the antibodyâs specificity, with IgM heavy-chain peptides representing 97.3% of total signal, indicating negligible off-target reactivity. This high target specificity was further supported by the no detectable cross-reactivity to IgT/IgD (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B). Moreover, the 72% sequence coverage (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C) and confirmed LC-MS/MS spectra of IgM peptides (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D) further validated target selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Validation of anti-bass IgM MoAb by western blot and flow cytometry</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the anti-bass IgM MoAb with an isotype control (mouse IgG1) under both non-reducing and reducing serum immunoblots. The western blot results showed that the developed MoAb bound specifically to IgM in largemouth bass serum. Owing to the structural diversity of fish IgM isoforms, denatured non-reducing electrophoresis typically yields multiple bands with varying molecular weights (Rombout et al., 1993; Ye et al., 2010). Immunoblot analysis revealed multiple bands with varying molecular weights under non-reducing conditions, with the main band ranging from 700 to 800 kDa and a distinct ~70 kDa band under reducing conditions (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A). Notably, the isotype control showed no detectable bands under both non-reducing and reducing conditions (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A). Additionally, we analyzed tissue lysates from various sources (i.e., Spleen, skin, gill, and gut) and observed consistently recognized bands at identical positions and sizes, whereas the isotype control showed no detectable bands (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B-F).</p><p>Next, we performed flow cytometry analysis to confirm antibody specificity. In largemouth bass head kidney leukocytes, IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells accounted for 28.56% of the population, compared to only 0.41% for the isotype control (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2G). Following flow sorting of negative and positive cell populations, we extracted RNA from equal cell numbers. Gene expression analysis revealed high expression of IgM and IgD in the positive population, while IgT and T cell markers were absent (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2H and I).

Previous studies have demonstrated significant differences in the depletion efficiency and persistence of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells between warm-water and cold-water fish species. In Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), a warm-water species, administration of 20 Âµg of anti-IgM antibody resulted in a near-complete depletion of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells within 9 days (Li et al., 2023). In contrast, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a cold-water species, required significantly higher doses (200â300 Âµg) to achieve similar depletion, which persisted in both blood and gut from week 1 up until week 9 post-depletion treatment (Ding et al., 2023). In this study, we investigated largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), a warm-water freshwater species. Administration of 300 Î¼g of IgM antibody resulted in rapid IgM+ B cell depletion from serum and mucus within one day, indicating that the rapid depletion kinetics may be attributed to the combined effects of the elevated antibody dose and the species-specific immunological characteristics. Moreover, we provide a western blot analysis of serum and mucus after IgM depletion as shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G and H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Neutralizing Capacity Assays:</p><p>Discuss the potential role of complement or other serum/mucus factors in the neutralization assays. Consider performing neutralization assays that isolate viruses, antibody, and target cells to assess the specific role of IgM.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewerâs insightful suggestion regarding the potential influence of complement and other serum/mucus factors in our neutralization assays. We sincerely regret that the lack of clarity in our methodological description caused misunderstandings to the reviewer. In fact, prior to performing the virus neutralization assays, serum and mucus samples were heat-inactivated at 56 Â°C to eliminate potential complement interference. Now, we added the related description of heat-inactivation of serum and mucus samples in the revised manuscript (Lines 727-729). Moreover, our results showed that selective IgM depletion from high LMBV-specific IgM titer mucus and serum samples resulted in significantly increased viral loads and enhanced cytopathic effects (CPE), while no significant difference was observed compared to the control group (shown in Figure 6 of the manuscript).</p><p>To further rule out complement or other factors, we purified IgM from serum and gut mucus of 42DPI-S fish for neutralization assays. Briefly, anti-bass IgM MoAb was coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose 4B beads and used for purification of IgM from both serum and gut mucus of 42DPI-S fish. After that, 100 ÂµL of LMBV (1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) in MEM was incubated with PBS and purified IgM (100 Âµg/mL) at 28 Â°C for 1 hour and then the mixtures were applied to infect EPC cells. Medium or bass IgM was added to EPC cells as controls. We added the new text in Materials and methods of the revised manuscript in Lines 735-741. Our result showed that a significant reduction in both LMBV-MCP gene expression and protein levels was observed in EPC cells treated with purified IgM from serum (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A, C, and D) or gut mucus (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B, E, and F). Moreover, significantly lower CPE were observed in the IgM treated group, while no CPE was observed in medium and bass IgM group (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2G). Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that the neutralization process is a potential mechanism of IgM, serving as a key molecule in adaptive immunity against viral infection. Here, we have incorporated these new findings in the Results section of the revised manuscript (Lines 382-388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>IgT Depletion Model:</p><p>To fully establish the role of IgM and IgT in antiviral defense, consider including an experimental group where IgT is depleted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewerâs suggestion.

Moreover, we deleted the description of VLRs for &quot;candidates&quot; and rewrote the relevant sentence in the revised manuscript (Lines 37-39) as âAgnathans, the most ancient vertebrate lineage, do not possess bona fide Ig but have variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) capable of mediating adaptive immune responses (Flajnik, 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results and Discussion:</p><p>Address inconsistencies between data and claims, such as the statement that IgM plays a &quot;crucial role&quot; in protection against LMBV, which is not fully supported by mortality data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment.

While current evidence confirms the capacity of cartilaginous fish and amphibians to mount specific IgM responses against bacterial pathogens and immune antigens (Dooley and Flajnik, 2005; Ramsey et al., 2010), the potential for viral induction of analogous IgM-mediated immunity in these species remains unresolved.â in the revised manuscript (Lines 498-504) and âExtensive studies in endotherms (birds and mammals) have demonstrated that specific IgM contributes to viral resistance by neutralizing viruses (Baumgarth et al., 2000; Diamond et al., 2013; Ku et al., 2021; Hagan et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2022). In contrast, the neutralizing activity of IgM in amphibians and reptiles remains largely unexplored. Although viral infections have been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies in Chinese soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) (Nie and Lu, 1999), the specific Ig isotypes mediating this response have yet to be elucidated. In teleost fish, IgM has been shown to possess viral neutralizing activity similar to that observed in endotherms (Castro et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2013). Furthermore, our recent work demonstrated that secretory IgT (sIgT) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) can neutralize viruses, significantly reducing susceptibility to infection (Yu et al., 2022). However, whether IgM in teleost fish possesses the antiviral neutralizing capacity necessary for fish to resist reinfection remains poorly understood.â in the revised manuscript (Lines 521-534)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Include a description of the Western blot procedure shown in Figures 7D and 7F in the Methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. A detailed protocol for the western blot experiments presented in Figures 7D and 7F has been added to the Methods section (Western Blot Analysis) in the revised manuscript (Lines 684-687). The details are as follows: Gut mucus, serum, and cells samples were analyzed by western blot as described by Yu et al (2022). Briefly, the samples were separated using 4%â15% SDS-PAGE Ready Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and subsequently transferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, USA). The membranes were blocked using a 8% skim milk for 2 hours and then incubated with monoclonal antibody (MoAb). For IgM concentration detection, the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-bass IgM MoAb (clone 66, IgG1, 1 Î¼g/mL) and then incubation with HRP goat-anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 hour. IgM concentrations were determined by comparing the signal strength values to a standard curve generated with known amounts of purified bass IgM. For neutralizing effect detection, the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-LMBV MCP MoAb (4A91E7, 1 Î¼g/mL) followed by incubation with HRP goat-anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 hour. The Î²-actin is used as a reference protein to standardize the differences between samples. Immunoblots were scanned using the GE Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, USA) with ECL solution (EpiZyme, China).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ensure all figures are labeled appropriately (e.g., replace &quot;Morality&quot; with &quot;Mortality&quot; in Figure 5A).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
