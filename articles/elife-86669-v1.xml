It has been implicated in several diseases such as congenital anomalies of the kidney where its activity is diminished and cancer where it participates in oncogenic fusion protein events. ZMYM2 is thought to function through promoting transcriptional repression and here we provide more evidence to support this designation. Here we studied ZMYM2 function in human cells and demonstrate that ZMYM2 is part of distinct chromatin-bound complexes including the established LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 corepressor complex. We also identify new functional and physical interactions with ADNP and TRIM28/KAP1. The ZMYM2-TRIM28 complex forms in a SUMO-dependent manner and is associated with repressive chromatin. ZMYM2 and TRIM28 show strong functional similarity and co-regulate a large number of genes. However, there are no strong links between ZMYM2-TRIM28 binding events and nearby individual gene regulation. Instead, ZMYM2-TRIM28 appears to regulate genes in a more regionally defined manner within TADs where it can directly regulate co-associated retrotransposon expression. We find that different types of ZMYM2 binding complex associate with and regulate distinct subclasses of retrotransposons, with ZMYM2-ADNP complexes at SINEs and ZMYM2-TRIM28 complexes at LTR elements. We propose a model whereby ZMYM2 acts directly through retrotransposon regulation, which may then potentially affect the local chromatin environment and associated coding gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transposable element</kwd><kwd>ZMYM2</kwd><kwd>TRIM28</kwd><kwd>ADNP</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103857/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owen</surname><given-names>Danielle J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V000403/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In this context, the N-terminal portion of ZMYM2 promotes the oligomerisation and activation of FGFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>). Further disease links have recently been uncovered where heterozygous loss of function ZMYM2 mutations lead to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connaughton et al., 2020</xref>). The latter observation suggests a potential developmental role and ZMYM2 has been shown to play important roles in the early stages of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and commitment. ZMYM2 promotes the transition from totipotency to pluripotency in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in human cells, ZMYM2 plays a key role in determining ESC identity by allowing the transition to and maintenance of the primed pluripotent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lezmi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, ZMYM2 has been shown to play a key role in opposing reprogramming in human fibroblasts where ZMYM2 loss increases reprogramming efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawrence et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Molecularly, ZMYM2 has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor and can bind to the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 corepressor complex (LCH) via its zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke and Yu, 2008</xref>). It is through this repressive complex that ZMYM2 promotes pluripotency in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). However, ZMYM2 has been shown to have an increasingly complex set of interaction partners such as the transcription factors TBX18 with a potential role in ureter development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lüdtke et al., 2022</xref>) and B-MYB and hence a potential link to cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cibis et al., 2020</xref>). Proteomic screens have also revealed multiple ZMYM2 binding partners, either from using ZMYM2 itself as a bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connaughton et al., 2020</xref>) or through detection as a component of other repressive complexes by using baits such as LSD1/KDM1A and HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hakimi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 2005</xref>). The range of interaction partners solidifies ZMYM2 as a potential transcriptional repressor protein, but additional roles are hinted at such as DNA repair, exemplified by its ability to antagonise 53BP1 function at DNA double strand breaks to favour repair by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We identified ZMYM2 in a screen for multi-SUMO binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>) which builds on the complex interplay previously observed between ZMYM2 and SUMO. Additional work supports the non-covalent SUMO binding activity of ZMYM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzzo et al., 2014</xref>) although the two studies differed in mapping of the SUMO interacting motifs, with the former mapping them to the N-terminal part of the protein and the latter mapping them to the centrally located zinc finger region. Furthermore, ZMYM2 itself is covalently modified with SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunapuli et al., 2006</xref>) suggesting a complex and important role for SUMO in determining ZMYM2 activity. Indeed, SUMO binding is needed for recruitment of ZMYM2 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>) and the ability of ZMYM2 to recruit SUMOylated HDAC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke and Yu, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we further investigated the molecular activities of ZMYM2 and demonstrated that it is associated with two distinct chromatin-bound complexes containing either ADNP or TRIM28. Both types of ZMYM2 chromatin binding regions are associated with different subclasses of retrotransposons. We focussed on TRIM28 and demonstrated widespread functional cooperativity with ZMYM2 in gene regulation. However, ZMYM2-TRIM28 binding regions are directly associated with ERV retrotransposable elements rather than with protein coding genes, suggesting an indirect mechanism for transcriptional control of the coding genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ADNP is a coregulatory binding partner for ZMYM2</title><p>To investigate the molecular function of ZMYM2, we used the mass spectrometry approach RIME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohammed et al., 2013</xref>) to identify proteins co-binding with ZMYM2 on chromatin. We performed several independent experiments using an anti-flag antibody for immunoprecipitation of ZMYM2 from a U2OS cell line containing a Flag-tagged version of ZMYM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>) or using an antibody against endogenous ZMYM2 in U2OS cells. We identified 27 proteins in all three experiments with an average of &gt;4 spectral counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among these, the highest scoring interactors were the transcriptional co-regulators TRIM28 and ADNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ZMYM2 and ADNP are part of a larger interacting network of proteins identified in the RIME analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which includes the other two components of the ChAHP complex, CHD4 and CBX1/HP1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaaij et al., 2019</xref>). Another prominent complex identified was the GTF3C complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) which is consistent with a previous study that identified ZMYM2 from reciprocal RIME experiment using GTF3C2 as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>). A large proportion of the interactors were previously identified in two proteomic screens for ZMYM2 binding proteins from mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) and/or human HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connaughton et al., 2020</xref>). They are also often found as binding partners in proteomic screens for other chromatin regulators as exemplified by BEND3, whose homologue BEND2 binds to ZMYM2 in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). However, 10 ZMYM2 binding proteins were uniquely identified here, including SUMO2 and SUMO3. The latter discovery is consistent with findings from screens for SUMO binding proteins where ZMYM2 was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brüninghoff et al., 2020</xref>). We validated interactions between endogenous ZMYM2 and ADNP by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and also confirmed interactions of ADNP with the closely related ZMYM3 paralogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This data is consistent with the identification of ZMYM2 and ZMYM3 in other mass spectrometry datasets along with ADNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostapcuk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connaughton et al., 2020</xref>).

First, we performed two independent ChIP-seq experiments for ADNP in U2OS cells and uncovered 5108 peaks found in both datasets. These ADNP peaks showed enrichment of binding motifs for several transcription factors with the top two motifs for HBP1 and IRF both found in over 35% of target regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The top scoring motif for ADNP previously identified from ChIP-seq in mouse embryonic stem cells CGCCCYCTNSTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostapcuk et al., 2018</xref>), was not identified in this unbiased analysis. We therefore searched for the motif in the ADNP peaks and found 775 in 5108 peaks (15%) which was a substantially higher frequency than in a background dataset (9.5%) but well below the 63% frequency found in mouse embryonic stem cells. This motif was therefore present but at a relative low frequency and lowly enriched, suggesting an alternative chromatin recruitment mechanism. Co-binding on chromatin with ZMYM2 is inferred as there is a significant overlap in chromatin occupancy of ZMYM2 with the ADNP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Example loci show clear co-binding of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Given this co-occupancy on chromatin we asked whether ZMYM2 and ADNP shared gene regulatory activity. We depleted each protein individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and performed RNA-seq to monitor transcriptional changes. Depletion of either factor alone gave roughly equivalent numbers of up and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). However, there was a highly significant overlap in the genes upregulated following depletion of either factor, and also a highly significant overlap in the genes downregulated following reductions in either protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Conversely, in contrast to these similarities, gene regulation showing reciprocal directionality following either ADNP or ZMYM2 depletion showed a very small and insignificant overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and this is further emphasised by a scatter plot depicting this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, there is a strong overlap in gene regulatory activity for ZMYM2 and ADNP, although the large numbers of genes directionally co-regulated by these two proteins (ie either positively or negatively) indicates no clear common role as either an activator or repressor.</p><p>Together these results demonstrate that ZMYM2 can function through a transcriptional regulatory complex containing ADNP to co-ordinately control gene activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ZMYM2 binds to molecularly distinct chromatin regions</title><p>Next, we turned to the potential interplay between ZMYM2 and TRIM28. Previous studies demonstrated that many zinc finger transcription factors can recruit TRIM28 to chromatin to repress transcription (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2019</xref>). However this activity has previously been attributed to TRIM28 binding to the KRAB repression domain associated with many zinc finger proteins, but ZMYM2 lacks such a domain. To explore whether TRIM28 could be found in the same regions of chromatin as ZMYM2 we compared ChIP-seq data for TRIM28 in U2OS cells with our ZMYM2 binding profile. We also included ChIP-seq for SUMO2/3 and a SUMO binding defective version of ZMYM2, ZMYM2-mutSIM2 (as we previously showed that SUMO is needed for recruitment of ZMYM2 to chromatin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>), markers of active chromatin including ChIP-seq data for H3K18ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) and ATAC-seq data. We took a ZMYM2-centric view of the data and plotted the signal for the other chromatin binding/modification events centred on the ZMYM2 binding peaks and then clustered the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Three distinct clusters were revealed. Cluster 3 exhibits ZMYM2 binding but little evidence of any other binding/modification events. However, cluster 1 is enriched for both wild-type ZMYM2 and TRIM28 binding. This cluster is relatively depleted of ATAC-seq and H3K18ac signal, suggesting that regions occupied by both ZMYM2 and TRIM28 are not areas of active chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Indeed, when we mapped H3K9me3 signal for H1 ESCs to the ZMYM2 binding regions, stronger levels of this repressive mark were observed in cluster 1 despite the differing cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We validated H3K9me3 occupancy at ZMYM2 binding sites from cluster 1 in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). SUMO2/3 is also strongly detected in cluster 1 and SUMO has often been associated with transcriptional repressive activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Dominguez and Reyes, 2009</xref>). We also interrogated ChIP-seq data from mouse ESCs and found that a cluster of ZMYM2 binding regions (cluster B) was strongly associated with TRIM28, SUMO and H3K9me3, further validating our results from human U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and D). In contrast, ZMYM2 cluster 2 shows little TRIM28 binding and higher levels of ATAC-seq and H3K18ac signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggestive of more active chromatin. Conversely, binding of the SUMO binding defective ZMYM2(SIM2mut) is strong and SUMO occupancy is weaker suggesting that ZMYM2 activity at this cluster is independent of its SUMO binding activity.

First, we attempted to co-precipitate ZMYM2 and TRIM28 but were unable to detect co-binding under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 4–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, cluster 1 is also enriched for SUMO occupancy but depleted for binding of ZMYM2 containing a mutation in a critical SUMO interacting motif (SIM). The latter mutant was previously used to demonstrate the requirement for SUMO binding for ZMYM2 recruitment to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore repeated the co-precipitation experiment in the presence of NEM (an isopeptidase inhibitor and critical to preserve protein SUMOylation) and observed ZMYM2 binding to TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 1–3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, NEM addition stabilised high molecular weight SUMO conjugates and revealed the binding of ZMYM2 to SUMOylated protein(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further evidence for SUMO-dependent interactions was derived from co-IP studies where the SUMO binding defective ZMYM2(SIM2mut) showed weaker interactions with TRIM28 than wild-type ZMYM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interactions between ZMYM2 and TRIM28 in a cellular context were further validated using PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These findings are consistent with the SUMO-dependent enrichment of TRIM28 occupancy on chromatin in ZMYM2 cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and this shared binding profile was validated by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This co-binding suggests that ZMYM2 might be responsible for recruiting TRIM28 to chromatin but we found no evidence for this as ZMYM2 depletion did not affect TRIM28 binding to a panel of its binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also further validated our RIME experiments and examined whether interactions with the ZMYM2 paralog ZMYM3 could be verified.

We therefore depleted each one in turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and performed RNAseq analysis to identify their target gene repertoires. For TRIM28, roughly equal numbers of genes were up and downregulated, and a similar phenomenon was observed for ZMYM2 following depletion, albeit more skewed to downregulation in the case of ZMYM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). However, there was a substantial and highly significant overlap between ZMYM2 and TRIM28 regulated genes irrespective of the directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, in contrast to these similarities, gene regulation showing reciprocal directionality following either TRIM28 or ZMYM2 depletion showed a very small and insignificant overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This is further emphasised by a scatter plot depicting this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Thus, functionally there is a strong concordance between the gene regulatory events controlled via ZMYM2 and TRIM28, although the large numbers of genes directionally co-regulated by these two proteins (ie either positively or negatively) indicates no particular preference for activation or repressive activity. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed different pathways associated with genes up and downregulated by both ZMYM2 and TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Terms such as ‘ossification’ and ‘skeletal system development’ were associated with the downregulated genes suggesting a disassembly of the core transcriptome associated with the cell identity (U2OS cells are derived from osteosarcomas), whereas upregulated genes contributed to more general GO terms, mainly associated with metabolism and cell responses such as ‘positive regulation of phosphorylation’.</p><p>Together these results demonstrate that ZMYM2 and TRIM28 interact physically and functionally to control gene expression. However, these gene regulatory properties create a conundrum, as there is no obvious directionality in their effects, despite the fact that the proteins co-occupy regions of the chromatin with inactive/repressive features.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ZMYM2 regulates protein coding genes from a distance</title><p>To further explore how ZMYM2 and TRIM28 work together to control gene expression, we tried to associate ZMYM2 cluster 1 peaks with genes commonly up- or down-regulated following ZMYM2 and TRIM28 depletion by using the nearest gene model. However, very few of these peaks are associated with the co-regulated genes identified from RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggested that ZMYM2 might orchestrate gene activity from a distance. We further investigated this possibility by comparing the number of genes deregulated following ZMYM2 depletion that are associated with ZMYM2 peaks across the entire ZMYM2 binding dataset. Very few differentially expressed genes are found within 20 kb of a ZMYM2 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but there is an increasing association as the window size is increased. The distance-dependent distribution of ZMYM2 binding regions is virtually the same as a randomly selected set of genes when considering genes that are downregulated following ZMYM2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). However, in contrast, significantly more differentially upregulated genes are associated with ZMYM2 peaks across all of the peak-gene distance brackets compared to a control set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). This suggests a more direct role for ZMYM2 in transcriptional repression, albeit at a distance to target genes. Indeed when we focussed on ZMYM2 cluster 1 peaks (ie potentially ZMYM2-TRIM28 co-regulated) and the genes whose expression increased following either TRIM28 or ZMYM2 depletion (ie repressed by these factors), we found a more significant distance-based association of ZMYM2 peaks with upregulated rather than downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that cluster 1 is predicted to be repressive in nature. To further explore this association, we examined the expression of all ZMYM2/TRIM28 co-regulated genes located within the TADs containing ZMYM2 binding peaks according to the three molecularly distinct clusters we identified. For this purpose, we used TADs from human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>) on the well-established assumption that the majority of these will be conserved across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stadhouders et al., 2018</xref>). TADs containing cluster 1 binding regions contained a significantly higher number of upregulated genes compared to downregulated genes compared to TADs which lacked ZMYM2 binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Although there was a weak tendency for more upregulated genes with TADs containing cluster 2 peaks, this was insignificant. A similar trend was observed if genes were analysed based on their response to individual depletion of ZMYM2 or TRIM28, with TADs containing cluster 1 peaks being more associated with upregulated genes in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, we also tested whether a gene is more likely to be negatively regulated by ZMYM2 when located in the same TAD as a cluster 1 peak rather than being located in other TADs lacking such peaks. The observed frequency of co-localisation was significantly higher than by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although there is an association of ZMYM2 peaks with ZMYM2 regulated genes in the same TAD, we asked whether ZMYM2 might affect gene expression at a certain distance irrespective of whether the TSS of the gene is in the same TAD. To test this we took all of the ZMYM2 regions associated with genes upregulated by ZMYM2 depletion that resided in the same TAD and calculated the peak to TSS distance. Then we searched in the opposite direction for the TSS of genes at a similar distance (+/-25%) that resided in an adjacent TAD. We then asked whether these genes were upregulated by ZMYM2 depletion. 102 ZMYM2 peaks were positioned within these distance constraints with at least one gene in an adjacent TAD (716 genes in total). Of these genes, only 11 were upregulated following ZMYM2 depletion. There is therefore not a general spreading of transcriptional deregulation around ZMYM2 peaks in a distance-dependent manner. We further probed the association with TAD boundaries by comparing the distances of the ZMYM2 peaks in each of the clusters to TAD boundaries with randomly selected genomic regions. In all cases, the ZMYM2 peaks were significantly closer to a TAD boundary than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ZMYM2 location and gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Numbers of differentially expressed genes following ZMYM2 depletion (left upregulated, right downregulated) whose TSS lies within the indicated distances of a ZMYM2 binding peak (black bars).

Zinc finger transcription factors, chiefly of the KRAB domain-containing subclass, have been associated with repetitive element repression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore asked whether ZMYM2 binding regions mapped to any repetitive elements. All three clusters of ZMYM2 binding regions showed a high degree of overlap with repetitive elements, with 80% of the regions in cluster 1 showing close proximity to these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the distribution of retrotransposon classes differed among ZMYM2 clusters, with cluster 3 and cluster 1 in particular favouring long terminal repeats (LTRs) whereas cluster 2 regions are mainly associated with short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE). The latter is consistent with the higher levels of ADNP binding found in cluster 2 regions, as ADNP has been implicated in SINE control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaaij et al., 2019</xref>). We further examined the distribution of subtypes of LTR elements in clusters 1 and 3 and found that cluster 3 is dominated by endogenous retrovirus (ERV)-L elements whereas cluster 1 is dominated by ERV-1 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). An example locus illustrates ZMYM2 and TRIM28 binding to a MER11A ERV-1 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top). Given the association of ZMYM2 with LTRs, we next asked whether ZMYM2 represses their activity as predicted. We depleted ZMYM2 and examined the regulation of LTR expression, and found that the LTRs showed upregulation following ZMYM2 loss, consistent with a repressive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also examined the distribution of subclasses of SINEs associated with cluster 2 ZMYM2 peaks and found equal numbers of Alu repeats and MIR elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Importantly, depletion of either ZMYM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) or ADNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) both caused increased activity of several SINEs, consistent with our designation of these retroviral elements as co-regulated by ZMYM2 and ADNP from our ChIP-seq analysis (eg <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom). We also examined our RNA-seq data for more widespread activation of transposable elements beyond those we have tested, but were unable to detect expression of large numbers of additional elements.

Genetic disruptions of ZMYM2 function have been linked to disease. Here, we provide further insights into the gene regulatory activities of ZMYM2 and demonstrate its physical and functional association with different corepressor complexes containing either ADNP or TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>We identify three distinct clusters of chromatin regions where ZMYM2 binds. One has chromatin characteristics related to transcriptional repression, one appears to be associated with more active chromatin regions and a third set of regions has no distinguishing chromatin features. It remains unclear what function, if any, ZMYM2 has at the latter set of binding regions. Our main focus was on cluster 1 ZMYM2 binding regions that are also bound by a novel binding partner, TRIM28. Interestingly, ZMYM2 binding to TRIM28 is SUMO-dependent, as retention of SUMOylation is required to detect binding by co-IP and ZMYM2 binding to cluster 1 regions require the SUMO interaction motifs in ZMYM2. This is consistent with the preponderance of SUMO at cluster 1 binding regions. It is not currently clear what SUMO modified protein(s) are the direct binding target of ZMYM2, although ZMYM2 is itself SUMOylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunapuli et al., 2006</xref>), as is TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), which can also act as a SUMO E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>). Earlier studies may have missed the ZMYM2-TRIM28 interactions by performing ZMYM2 immunoprecipitations in the absence of SUMO stabilising agents or sample fixation as we used in our initial RIME experiments. However, ZMYM2 was identified in reciprocal co-IP experiments with TRIM28, as a glycosylated interaction partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boulard et al., 2020</xref>) suggesting that multiple post-translational modifications govern the assembly and function of this complex.</p><p>Previous studies have focussed on the role of ZMYM2 in the context of its association with the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC corepressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hakimi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gocke and Yu, 2008</xref>). Indeed, we identify all three of these proteins in our proteomics dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), further substantiating this functional interaction. Here we find a broader occurrence of ZMYM2 in chromatin binding complexes, both as part of the ChAHP complex centred on ADNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostapcuk et al., 2018</xref>) and also independently in a complex with TRIM28. The latter observation is interesting, as TRIM28 has been shown to act as a widespread repressor of retrotransposons where it is recruited by KRAB domain containing zinc finger proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2019</xref>). ZMYM2 is also a zinc finger protein but lacks the KRAB domain but still binds to TRIM28, suggesting that a broader swathe of zinc finger proteins may be involved in repetitive element epigenetic repression. However, our results rule out a simple model that ZMYM2 is responsible for the recruitment of TRIM28 to chromatin. Whether KRAB-zinc finger proteins are also involved in ZMYM2 complexes and act as the relevant recruitment factor is currently unknown although we identified four such proteins in our lower confidence proteomics dataset, with ZNF202 being the most prominent consistently detected protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). It is also not clear what the chromatin recruitment mechanism is, although recent studies do not rule out a direct role for TRIM28 in the process as it has been shown to be able to engage directly with unmodified histone H4 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The identification of TRIM28 as a chromatin-associated interaction partner further supports a role for ZMYM2 in transcriptional repression, and suggests that it can do so via a variety of different means. Indeed a recent study identified ZMYM2 as an important regulator of silencing of imprinting control regions which are under the control of the zinc finger protein ZFP57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butz et al., 2022</xref>). In terms of global transcriptional regulation, the role of ZMYM2 is more ambivalent as we identified substantial numbers of genes that are either up- or down-regulated. However, ZMYM2 binding regions are generally more associated with genes that it represses rather than activates, suggesting that the latter may be indirectly affected. In contrast to TRIM28 co-bound regions, ZMYM2 also binds to chromatin regions occupied by ADNP, where more active characteristics are found. ZMYM2 functions in a repressive manner rather than in gene activation in the latter context and suggests that it dampens down the activity of a region rather than the complete repression which would be mediated through TRIM28 and its coregulatory partners.</p><p>The association of ZMYM2 with transposons and its ability to regulate their expression suggests several possible modes of subsequent effects on broader gene expression programmes. Retrotransposons have been shown to exhibit a multitude of different molecular mechanisms to control gene regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fueyo et al., 2022</xref>). For example, the ERV-H LTRs demarcate TADs in human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), and it is possible that ZMYM2-TRIM28 complexes control ERV LTR activity which in turn influence local chromatin topology. This would help explain how ZMYM2 appears to regulate gene expression in a locally defined region rather than one ZMYM2 binding event acting to regulate expression of one specific gene. This might apply in particular to the ZMYM2-ADNP co-bound regions, as ADNP has previously been shown to play an active role in controlling chromatin domain boundary elements at SINE B2 transposable elements by blocking CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaaij et al., 2019</xref>). It is also noteworthy that ZMYM2 interacts with the GTF3C complex which has previously been implicated in controlling retrotransposon transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, ZMYM2 may contribute important regulatory activities to many different chromatin complexes associated with transposable elements. However, further extensive work will be needed to address the precise interplay between ZMYM2, retrotransposon activity, and local chromatin structure in determining ZMYM2-dependent gene regulatory outcomes.</p><p>In summary, our work adds to the growing repertoire of ZMYM2 associated chromatin regulatory proteins and complexes and provides a molecular framework for understanding the role of this protein in cell fate commitment and maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>U2OS and HEK293T cells and derivatives were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The equivalent volume for 50,000 nuclei was made up to 22.5 μl with nuclease free water. Nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, 300 rpm, with 25 μl of 2 x TD buffer and 2.5 μl tagmentation enzyme (Illumina transposase FC-121–1030). DNA was purified using a Qiagen mini elute kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Library fragments were amplified using standard PCR and Nextera primers (Illumina) by adding 25 μl of 2 x NEBnext master mix, 2.5 μl forward primer, 2.5 μl reverse primer and 20 μl transposased DNA. PCR was run for 5 cycles, 72 °C, 5 min; 98 °C 30 s; cycle of 98 °C 10 s, 63 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min, paused at 4 °C. To determine the total number of cycles needed for the amplified library, 5 μl of the PCR mix were taken and added to a new mix containing 5 μl 2 X master mix, 1 ml of each primer, 0.6 μl of 10 X SYBR green and 2.4 μl H<sub>2</sub>O. In a qPCR machine, 20 cycles were run, the total number of cycles for the ATAC library was chosen according to qPCR cycle that gave 1/3 of saturation. DNA was purified using Ampure XP beads following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>The reads in the ATAC-seq data were mapped to the human genome hg19 using Bowtie2 with the same settings as those described below for the ChIP-seq data, and only the uniquely mapped reads were used in the analysis.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and ChIP-seq assays</title><p>ChIP-qPCR was performed using primers to detect <italic>TXNL4A</italic>, <italic>EMX2</italic>, and <italic>FAM109A</italic>, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>MSTB</italic> (ADS6541, <named-content content-type="sequence">GACCAGCCTGACCAAAACG</named-content> and ADS6542, <named-content content-type="sequence">ACTCAGGCCAAGTCTCTCTC</named-content>), and <italic>THE1C-int</italic> (ADS6543, <named-content content-type="sequence">CCAACCCGACATTTCCCTTC</named-content> and ADS6544, <named-content content-type="sequence">AGGGGCCAAGGTACATTTCA</named-content>).</p><p>5x10<sup>7</sup> U2OS cells were used in each ChIP-seq experiment, which was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2012</xref>) with anti-TRIM28 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) as indicated.

The R method <italic>kmeans</italic> with the option ‘centers = 3’ was used to cluster the 1180 ZMYM2 peaks into three clusters.</p><p>For TRIM28, ADNP and SUMO ChIP-seq analysis, two biological replicates were generated for each protein and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. The paired-end reads were aligned to the human genome hg19 using Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with the setting 'very sensitive' and all other default settings. The uniquely aligned reads were selected for the further analysis. Duplicate reads were removed using Picard tools, version 1.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) and the reads mapped to the mitochondrial chromosome were also removed. The correlation coefficients between the two replicates of the read counts was between 0.85 and 0.95 for the two replicates in our ChIP-seq data. The reads in the two replicates were then pooled, and with the pooled reads from the two input replicates as control, peaks were called from the pooled ChIP-seq using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) with the options ‘-g hs -f BAMPE’. To identify overlapping peaks between two samples, one peak was considered to overlap with another peak if they overlap by at least 30% of each of their lengths. Venn diagrams showing the overlapping of peaks from different ChIP-seq datasets were created using the R package Vennerable, version 1.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/js229/Vennerable">https://github.com/js229/Vennerable</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">js229, 2016</xref>). Average tag density plots were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The genomic distribution of the ChIP-seq peaks was calculated using all the transcripts in the Ensembl human gene annotation database v75 with the human genome hg19. The genome was divided into five types of regions; promoter or TSS regions [–1 kb to 0.1 kb relative to TSS], TTS regions [–0.1 kb to 1 kb relative to TTS], exonic regions containing all exons within [TSS +0.1 kb to TTS-0.1 kb], intronic regions containing all introns within [TSS +0.1 kb to TTS-0.1 kb], and all other regions were classified as ‘distal intergenic’ regions. A peak was linked to a region if its summit is located in the region.</p><p>The software HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) was used with default settings for the motif enrichment analysis within a set of peaks (in 101 bp windows centred on the peak summits).

The statistical test for the ATAC-seq data signal (Fig. S2E) and the distance of the ZMYM2 peaks in different clusters to the nearest TAD domains were also performed using the Student t test. Fisher Exact test was used for testing the significance of the overlaps between different sets of DE genes.

They tried to identify chromatin bound complexes containing ZMYM2 and identified known and novel protein partners, including ADNP and the newly described partner TRIM28. Focusing mainly on these two proteins, they show that ZMYM2 physically interacts with ADNP or TRIM28, and co-occupies an overlapping set of genomic regions with ADNP and TRIM28. By generating a large set of knockdown and RNA-seq experiments, they show that ZMYM2 co-regulates a large number of genes with ADNP and TRIM28 in U2OS cells. Interestingly, ZMYM2-TRIM28 do not appear to repress genes directly at promoters, but the authors find that ZMYM2/TRIM28 repress LTR elements and suggest that this leads to gene deregulation at distance by affecting the chromatin environment within TADs.</p><p>A strength of the study is that, compared to previous studies of ZMYM2 protein partners, it investigates binding partners of ZMYM2 using the RIME method on chromatin. The RIME method makes it possible to identify low-affinity protein-protein interactions and proteins interactions occurring at chromatin, therefore revealing partners most relevant for gene regulation at chromatin. This allowed the identification of novel ZMYM2 partners not identified before, such as TRIM28.</p><p>The authors present solid interaction data with appropriate controls and generated an impressive amount of datasets (ChIP-seq for TRIM28 and ADNP, RNA-seq in ZMYM2, ADNP and TRIM28 knockdown cells) that are important to understand the molecular functions of ZMYM2. These datasets were generated with replicates and will be very useful for the scientific community. This study provides important novel insights into the molecular roles of ZMYM2 in human U2OS cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86669.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study the authors investigate functional associations made by transcription factor ZMYM2 with chromatin regulators, and the impact of perturbing these complexes on the transcriptome of the U2OS cell line. They focus on validating two novel chromatin-templated interactions: with TRIM28/KAP1 and with ADNP, concluding that via these distinct chromatin regulators, ZMYM2 contributes to transcriptional control of LTR and SINE retrotransposons, respectively.</p><p>Strengths of the study:</p><p>-The co-localization of ZMYM2 with ADNP and TRIM28 is validated through RIME, ChIP-seq and co-IP. Since TRIM28 is a highly abundant nuclear protein, the use of multiple methods is important to add confidence in particular for the novel SUMO-dependent interaction identified between ZMYM2 and TRIM28. That TRIM28 pulls down less of the ZMYM2-SIM mutant is reassuring.</p><p>-It is good that uniquely-mapped reads are used in the ChIP-seq analysis given the interest in repetitive elements. Likewise, though the RT-qPCR data in Fig 6 should be complemented by analysis of the RNA-seq data that the authors already have, it seems that the primers are carefully designed such that a single retrotransposon copy is amplified.</p><p>-The paper is generally written very clearly, the experiments well done and the different datasets appear to be robust.</p><p>Weaknesses of the study:</p><p>-The transcriptional response using bulk RNA-seq in ZMYM2-depleted cells remains gene-centric despite the title of the paper being about TE transcription. In fact, the only panels about TE transcription are the RT-qPCR data in Fig 6D, F. During the revision the authors said that their RNA-seq data is unfortunately too shallow to retrieve TEs. Fair enough - however, it remains the case that the central claim is control of TE transcription by ZMYM2. Thus, without additional transcriptomic analysis we are left with only a few qPCRs, even if they are nicely done! Perhaps the title could be modified a bit in that case?</p><p>-The mechanism by which ZMYM2 and TRIM28 work together does remain a mystery. Following review the authors performed TRIM28 ChIP on ZMYM2-depleted cells, but identified no changes over three transposons. It remains unclear if H3K9me3 levels are altered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86669.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>ZMYM2 is a transcriptional repressor known to bind to the post-translational modification SUMO2/3. It has been implicated in the silencing of genes and transposons in a variety of contexts, but lacking sequence-specific DNA binding, little is known about how it is targeted to specific regions. At least two reports indicate association with TRIM28 targets (Tsusaka 2020 Epigenetics &amp; Chromatin, Graham-Paquin 2023 NAR) but no physical association with TRIM28 targets had been demonstrated. Tsusaka 2020 theorizes an indirect, potentially SUMO-independent, interaction via ATF7IP and SETDB1.</p><p>Here, Owen and colleagues show that a subset of ZMYM2-binding sites in U2OS cells are clearly TRIM28 sites, and further find that hundreds of genes are silenced by both ZMYM2 and TRIM28. They next demonstrate that ZMYM2 homes to chromatin, and interacts with TRIM28, in a SUMOylation-dependent manner, suggesting that ZMYM2 is recognizing SUMOylation on TRIM28 or a protein associated with TRIM28. ZMYM2 separately homes to SINE elements bound by the ChAHP complex in an apparently SUMOylation independent manner. Although this is not the first report to show physical interaction between ZMYM2 and ChAHP, it is the first to show that ZMYM2 homes to ChAHP-binding sites and functions as a corepressor at these sites.

I have included a revised version of our manuscript in which we have addressed all of the required editorial and referees’ comments as requested. In summary, we have added substantial amounts of new data and analysis (new Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figures S1E, S3C, S3E, S3I, S4C), amended several figures (Figures 2 and 3), added a new supplementary Table (Table S2) and we have changed the text and figure labelling/presentation in appropriate places to clarify or correct the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>In summary, we firmly believe that we have addressed all the outstanding issues in a positive manner and that the manuscript is now suitable for publication in eLife. I look forward to receiving your final editorial decision on this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment:</bold></p><p>ZMYM2 is a transcriptional corepressor but little was known about how it is recruited to chromatin. This study reveals that ZMYM2 homes to distinct classes of retrotransposons bound by the TRIM28 and ChAHP complexes in human cells, an important finding in the field of transcriptional regulation. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, although inclusion of more functional data would have strengthened the original model proposed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken all the comments on board and provided additional new experimental data where requested and more data analysis to substantiate our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Owen D et al. investigated the protein partners and molecular functions of ZMYM2, a transcriptional repressor with key roles in cell identity and mutated in several human diseases, in human U2OS cells using mass spectrometry, siRNA knockdown, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. They tried to identify chromatin bound complexes containing ZMYM2 and identified known and novel protein partners, including ADNP and the newly described partner TRIM28. Focusing mainly on these two proteins, they show that ZMYM2 physically interacts with ADNP or TRIM28, and co-occupies an overlapping set of genomic regions with ADNP and TRIM28. By generating a large set of knockdown and RNA-seq experiments, they show that ZMYM2 co-regulates a large number of genes with ADNP and TRIM28 in U2OS cells. Interestingly, ZMYM2-TRIM28 do not appear to repress genes directly at promoters, but the authors find that ZMYM2/TRIM28 repress LTR elements and suggest that this leads to gene deregulation at distance by affecting the chromatin environment within TADs.</p><p>A strength of the study is that, compared to previous studies of ZMYM2 protein partners, it investigates binding partners of ZMYM2 using the RIME method on chromatin. The RIME method makes it possible to identify low-affinity protein-protein interactions and proteins interactions occurring at chromatin, therefore revealing partners most relevant for gene regulation at chromatin. This allowed the identification of novel ZMYM2 partners not identified before, such as TRIM28.The authors present solid interaction data with appropriate controls and generated an impressive amount of datasets (ChIP-seq for TRIM28 and ADNP, RNA-seq in ZMYM2, ADNP and TRIM28 knockdown cells) that are important to understand the molecular functions of ZMYM2. These datasets were generated with replicates and will be very useful for the scientific community. This study provides important novel insights into the molecular roles of ZMYM2 in human U2OS cells.</p><p>The authors could have been more precise in the manuscript title and abstract to emphasize that these findings apply to human cells, as indeed there is no demonstration yet that the findings presented here can be transposed to mouse cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have slightly changed the title and abstract to emphasise that the findings are in human cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript's main conceptual advance is that the authors propose a novel model of gene regulation whereby transcriptional repressors of transposable elements could regulate genes at distance by modulating the local chromatin environment within TADs. Additional experiments would be needed to strengthen this model. For example the authors could have performed TRIM28 ChIP in ZMYM2-kd cells to test if ZMYM2 favors the recruitment of TRIM28 to its genomic targets, as well as ChIP-seq of repressive chromatin marks (such as H3K9me3) in ZMYM2-kd cells to investigate if the loss of ZMYM2 leads to reduced H3K9me3 in ERVs and over large regions surrounding the ERVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested whether ZMYM2 is required for TRIM28 binding at several loci and find no evidence for this (new Supplementary Fig. S3E). We now discuss this in the results text and discussion where we already suggested that TRIM28 is likely recruited by KRAB-zinc finger proteins and ZMYM2 is subsequently recruited to this complex. Future extensive work is required to understand the mechanistic functions of ZMYM2 in these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study the authors investigate functional associations made by transcription factor ZMYM2 with chromatin regulators, and the impact of perturbing these complexes on the transcriptome of the U2OS cell line. They focus on validating two novel chromatin-templated interactions: with TRIM28/KAP1 and with ADNP, concluding that via these distinct chromatin regulators, ZMYM2 contributes to transcriptional control of LTR and SINE retrotransposons, respectively.</p><p>Strengths and weakness of the study:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The co-localization of ZMYM2 with ADNP and TRIM28 is validated through RIME, ChIP-seq and co-IP. (Notably, since both RIME and ChIP-seq rely on crosslinking, and the co-IP with TRIM28 required crosslinking due to being SUMO-dependent, only the ZMYM2-ADNP co-IP experiment demonstrates an interaction in the absence of crosslinking).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>This is not correct as the co-IP experiments between endogenous ZMYM2 and TRIM28 were not performed in the presence of cross linkers. They did have NEM added, but this was to inactivate SUMO proteases rather than to cross link proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is good that uniquely-mapped reads are used in the ChIP-seq analysis given the interest in repetitive elements. Likewise, though the RT-qPCR data in Fig5 should be complemented by analysis of the RNA-seq data that the authors already have, it seems that the primers are carefully designed such that a single retrotransposon copy is amplified.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We re-analysed our RNA-seq data using the TEtranscripts tool and looked at TE transcription genome-wide. However very few TEs were expressed at high enough levels to get any statistically significant additional data beyond a few additional transposable elements. This likely results from the relatively low read depth we used and the lack of specific protocols being followed to preserve TE transcripts. We will return to the genome-wide effects in future studies where we plan to switch cell types and will generate more bespoke datasets (the current ones were designed for analysing effects on protein coding gene expression before we made the connection to TEs). We added additional text to the results section to indicate that we could not see widespread deregulation of subclasses of TEs but that this needs further work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The top-scoring interactors are highly-abundant nuclear proteins: for example, data from the contaminant repository for affinity purification mass-spec data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reprint-apms.org/">https://reprint-apms.org/</ext-link>) show that TRIM28 is identified in 466 / 716 AP-MS experiments with a mean spectral count of 16. While this does not indicate that the ZMYM2-TRIM28 interaction is not 'true', it would have been helpful to further dissect the interaction to strengthen this conclusion. For example, it would be nice to see the co-IP (fig 3A) repeated from the cells expressing the ZMYM2 mutant that is no longer competent to bind SUMO (used in the ChIP-seq data of Fig 2). Alternatively - if the model is that ZMYM2 recruits SUMOylated TRIM28 with well-characterized TRIM28 mutants that lack SUMOylation.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We are aware that TRIM28 is often present as an apparent contaminant in many mass spec studies. However we have provided co-IP, PLA and ChIP-seq data to support their co-association on chromatin. We also convincingly show that ZMYM2 and TRIM28 functionally converge on regulating the same gene expression programmes. As requested by the referee, we have added further data showing that the ZMYM2 protein that is defective in SUMO binding (ZMYM2(SIM2mut); new Supplementary Fig. S3C) shows reduced binding to TRIM28 in co-IP assays. This further strengthens the (SUMO-dependent) association between ZMYM2 and TRIM28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The transcriptional response using bulk RNA-seq in ZMYM2-depleted cells is rather gene-centric despite the title of the paper being about TE transcription. In fact the only panels about TE transcription are the RT-qPCR data in Fig 5D,F. I may be missing something (and there aren't many details given about the RNA-seq experiments) but why not look at TE transcription in an unbiased way with the transcriptomic data at hand? I appreciate potential hazards of multi-mapping etc but it would be interesting to see at least some subfamily analysis (e.g. using the TEtranscripts tool). On a similar point, why not show some RNA-seq in the genome browser snapshots of the epigenomics - together with a RepeatMasker annotation track of TEs...</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>See response to the same point above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the results broadly support the authors' conclusions, I have the overall impression that the central claim of TE transcriptional regulation by ZMYM2 could be strengthened a lot with some fairly straightforward additional experiments and analyses.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>ZMYM2 is a transcriptional repressor known to bind to the post-translational modification SUMO2/3. It has been implicated in the silencing of genes and transposons in a variety of contexts, but lacking sequence-specific DNA binding, little is known about how it is targeted to specific regions. At least two reports indicate association with TRIM28 targets (Tsusaka 2020 Epigenetics &amp; Chromatin, Graham-Paquin 2022 bioRxiv) but no physical association with TRIM28 targets had been observed.

However, they also felt that the model presented at the end of the manuscript seems preliminary and would deserve additional experiments to be really supported, the essential ones being listed below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1 - Despite the claimed scope of the manuscript on TE regulation, their expression analysis is limited to RT-qPCR and targeted to a few families or copies. Please use the RNA-seq data generated in U2OS cells depleted for ZMYM2 to assess retrotransposon expression genome-wide, performing both family-level and copy-level analyses, and compare with TRIM28-depleted U2OS cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-analysed our RNA-seq data using the TEtranscripts tool and looked at TE transcription genome-wide.

New bioinformatics analysis has been done which is incorporated into the paper in Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 - Perform TRIM28 ChIP-seq in ZMYM2-kd cells, to prove that ZMYM2 indeed participates to TRIM28 recruitment to TE loci. This could be complemented by H3K9me3 ChIP-seq, to see if ZMYM2 depletion reduces H3K9me3 at retroytransposons, and over the regions surrounding ERVs. This last experiment seems also important for reinforcing the distant regulation model of nearby genes through ZMYM2-mediated repression of retrotransposons.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the referees below, we have tested whether ZMYM2 is required for TRIM28 binding at several loci and find no evidence for this (new Supplementary Fig. S3E).

The authors want to investigate if ADNP and ZMYM2 regulate gene expression in the same directionality. They compare the genes down in siADNP and up in siZMYM2 (or vice versa) and show very small overlaps. If I understand correctly, this shows that very few genes are regulated in opposite directions by ADNP and ZMYM2 and consequently that they tend to regulate genes in the same directionality. This is not what is said in the text page 19 (&quot;with no clear common roles as either an activator or repressor&quot;) and should be clarified. Furthermore, to compare if ADNP and ZMYM2 regulate genes in the same directionality, there are better ways to represent this, for example scatter plots of log2 FC in ADNP kd vs ZMYM2 kd. Similar criticisms apply to Fig S3F.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We agree that the text could be clearer and have rewritten it as “….although the large numbers of genes directionally co-regulated by these two proteins (ie either positively or negatively) indicates no clear common role as either an activator or repressor”. We have also added a scatter plot to the supplementary data (Fig. S1E) to further emphasise the common directionality of effect as suggested by the reviewer. Similarly, we changed the text and have added a scatter plot to support the conclusions on ZMYM2 and TRIM28 functional interactions (new Fig. S3I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors suggest an indirect control of genes by ZMYM2 within TADs (Fig 4C). Yet Fig 4C does not seem to address this point. Fig 4C shows that TADs with a ZMYM2/cluster 1 peak contain more upregulated than downregulated genes, but the key question should be: are upregulated genes significantly enriched in TADs containing a ZMYM2/cluster 1 peak compared to other TADs or other genomic regions?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We have taken this suggestion on board and determined the frequency distribution of the number of TADs containing a gene upregulated (fold change &gt;1.6; Padj &lt;0.01) following ZMYM2 depletion. 10,000 iterations were performed by randomly selecting 216 TADs across all 3062 TADs. The observed number of TADs containing an upregulated gene (42) from 216 TADs containing a cluster 1 ZMYM2 peak is a clear outlier in this distribution (P-value = 0.0002) (see Supplementary Fig. S4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A key question not addressed in the manuscript is whether ZMYM2 participates in the recruitment of TRIM28 to ERVs.

Upon ZMYM2 depletion, the authors observe simultaneous upregulation of genes within TADs more often than would be expected by chance, but this analysis does not distinguish &quot;proximal to&quot; from &quot;in the same TAD&quot;. If a ZMYM2 binding site is X bases from a gene TSS, is it more likely to regulate that gene if it is in the same TAD? This can and should be tested bioinformatically.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The basic question the referee is asking is whether ZMYM2 affects gene expression at a certain distance irrespective of whether the TSS of the gene is in the same TAD. We have now tested this and added text to the results section. Basically we took all of the ZMYM2 regions associated with genes upregulated by ZMYM2 depletion that resided in the same TAD and calculated the peak to TSS distance. Then we searched in the opposite direction for the TSS of genes at a similar distance (+/-25%) that resided in an adjacent TAD. We then asked whether these genes were upregulated by ZMYM2 depletion. 102 ZMYM2 peaks were positioned within these distance constraints with at least one gene in an adjacent TAD (716 genes in total). Of these genes, only 11 were upregulated following ZMYM2 depletion. There is therefore not a general spreading of deregulation around ZMYM2 peaks in a distance-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors note in the text and discussion that LTRs can demarkate TAD boundaries, but this is a distinct concept from the idea that they regulate genes within a TAD. Is there evidence that ZMYM2 binding sites are found at TAD boundaries?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided more evidence to support the associations of ZMYM2 peaks with TADs and now show that they are closer than randomly expected to TAD boundaries (Fig. 4D).
