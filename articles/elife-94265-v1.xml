This study demonstrates that deficiency of TG-interacting factor 1 (Tgif1) in osteoblasts results in altered cell morphology, reduced adherence to collagen type I-coated surfaces, and impaired migration capacity. Tgif1 is essential for osteoblasts to adapt a regular cell morphology and to efficiently adhere and migrate on collagen type I-rich matrices in vitro. Furthermore, Tgif1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of p21-activated kinase 3 (<italic>Pak3</italic>), an important regulator of focal adhesion formation and osteoblast spreading. Absence of Tgif1 leads to increased <italic>Pak3</italic> expression, which impairs osteoblast spreading. Additionally, Tgif1 is implicated in osteoblast recruitment and activation of bone surfaces in the context of bone regeneration and in response to parathyroid hormone 1–34 (PTH 1–34) treatment in vivo in mice. These findings provide important novel insights in the regulation of the cytoskeletal architecture of osteoblasts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoblast

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone remodeling is a highly coordinated and continuously ongoing process involving osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, that interact with each other and function in concert to maintain bone mass and preserve the integrity of the skeletal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baron and Hesse, 2012</xref>). This process is essential for bone development, growth, maintenance, and repair as well as for the functionality of pharmacological interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenkre and Bassett, 2018</xref>). Osteoblasts, derived from mesenchymal stem cells, play a pivotal role in synthesizing and depositing collagen type I-rich bone matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ponzetti and Rucci, 2021</xref>). To achieve this, osteoblasts undergo changes in cell shape and migrate on bone surfaces to lay down matrix at places where new bone needs to be formed, necessitating the regulation of cell movement and shape acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones and Boyde, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eleniste et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Migration of osteoblasts involves movement from their origin to specific locations within the bone tissue and occurs during both embryonic development and adult bone remodeling. Multiple factors influence osteoblast migration, including growth factors, cytokines, signaling pathways like bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) as well as interactions with other cells and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). These signals not only promote migration but also regulate the expression of adhesion molecules, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and cellular contractility.</p><p>Osteoblasts exhibit various morphological shapes based on their differentiation stage and the local microenvironment, ranging from elongated spindle-like morphology to cuboidal appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsuji et al., 2022</xref>). The cytoskeleton, primarily composed of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, plays a central role in determining cell shape. Actin filaments, among other cytoskeletal elements, are involved in cell polarization, protrusion formation, and contractility during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schaks et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang and Gerlach, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>). Signaling molecules, including Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, regulate the cytoskeleton by controlling actin polymerization and organization, contributing to the formation of structures like lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schaks et al., 2019</xref>). These structures are essential for cell migration, enabling attachment to the extracellular matrix and generating the necessary force for movement. Integrins, transmembrane proteins mediating cell-extracellular matrix interactions, also play a critical role in osteoblast migration and cell shape regulation. They anchor cells to the matrix, transmit signals regulating migration and cytoskeletal dynamics, and activate intracellular pathways affecting cell shape, migration speed, and adhesion strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kechagia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SenGupta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hood and Cheresh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, osteoblast migration and cell shape acquisition are interconnected processes crucial for bone development, growth, remodeling, and repair. Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying osteoblast migration and cell shape regulation is, therefore, important to better understand bone mass maintenance, treatment of bone-related disorders, and bone repair.</p><p>Fractures occur in the context of high-energy trauma but also due to bone fragility and represent a severe damage of bone integrity, requiring subsequent tissue regeneration. In response to fracture, inflammatory cells including neutrophils and macrophages are recruited to the site, releasing signaling molecules such as cytokines and growth factors. These molecules create a favorable environment for osteoblast migration and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). Osteoblast precursors derived from mesenchymal stem cells, or the periosteum migrate alongside sprouting vessels towards the fracture gap and differentiate into mature bone-forming osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maes et al., 2010</xref>). Once osteoblasts have reached the fracture site, production and deposition of new bone matrix is initiated to facilitate fracture repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>). During this process, chemotactic signals released by surrounding tissues and cells, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), TGF-β, and BMPs guide osteoblast migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the migration of osteoblasts is facilitated by the dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, primarily composed of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Structures like lamellipodia and filopodia, enriched with actin, enable osteoblasts to extend and protrude in the direction of migration, interacting with the extracellular matrix and providing necessary traction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jafari et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Movement of osteoblasts is an important but often underestimated component of the pharmacologically induced gain in bone mass in response to the treatment with bone anabolic drugs. Teriparatide, a recombinant form of the first 34 amino acids of human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH1-34; hereafter PTH), is a bone anabolic drug used to treat severe osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mineral density and an increased fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black and Rosen, 2016</xref>). PTH treatment stimulates bone formation by increasing the number, differentiation, and activity of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pettway et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogita et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, PTH promotes the recruitment of osteoblast precursor cells and activates quiescent lining cells on bone surfaces, transforming them into active matrix-forming osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobnig and Turner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, PTH increases the migration of mesenchymal precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lv et al., 2020</xref>) and augments bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>), which attracts osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>). During osteoblast migration, cytoskeletal dynamics promote actin filament remodeling and the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lomri and Marie, 1990</xref>). These structures are essential for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix during migration. By enhancing cytoskeletal dynamics, PTH facilitates osteoblast movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). PTH also increases the expression and activation of integrins, which mediate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gronthos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaiser et al., 2001</xref>). These combined pharmacological effects of PTH treatment result in an increase in bone formation and bone mineral density, which improves bone strength and ultimately reduces fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black and Rosen, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we reported the important role of the homeodomain protein TG-interacting factor 1 (Tgif1) in osteoblast differentiation, activity, and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Tgif1</italic> was identified as PTH target gene, and in the absence of Tgif1, PTH treatment failed to increase bone mass in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>). These findings demonstrate the importance of Tgif1 as a novel regulator of bone remodeling and emphasize its essential involvement in mediating the full bone anabolic effect of PTH treatment. Building upon these observations, we investigated the role of Tgif1 in osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration. Our findings demonstrate that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts display an altered morphology, reduced adherence to collagen type I-coated surfaces, impaired migration capacity, and decreased spreading compared to control cells. These deficits are associated with a compromised formation of focal adhesions and an upregulated expression of p21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3), which we further investigated due to its implication in cell migration and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Mechanistically, Tgif1 exerts control over <italic>Pak3</italic> expression through transcriptional repression. Thus, elevated PAK3 levels contribute to the observed defects in osteoblast spreading of Tgif1-deficient cells. By using translational approaches, we demonstrate that in the absence of Tgif1, the activation of bone surfaces by osteoblasts in response to bone repair and PTH treatment is diminished. Furthermore, we uncovered that PTH facilitates osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling.</p><p>Collectively, these findings increase the knowledge on processes governing osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration. These novel insights are important to better understand mechanisms underlying bone remodeling and repair as well as the pharmacological effects of PTH treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tgif1-deficiency alters osteoblast morphology, adherence and migration</title><p>Recently, we reported that in Tgif1-deficient mice the number and activity of osteoblasts are reduced, which contributes to a low turnover bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>). Further histological examination revealed that bone surfaces were scarcely occupied by small and flat osteoblasts in mice bearing a germline deletion of <italic>Tgif1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) or a deletion of <italic>Tgif1</italic> targeted to osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) compared to control littermates. This finding suggested that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts might, in addition to an impaired bone matrix-producing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>) be compromised in acquiring a physiological osteoblast morphology. This deficit could contribute to the low turnover bone phenotype of Tgif1-deficient mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of TG-interacting factor 1 (Tgif1) reduces osteoblast size in vivo and impairs osteoblast adhesion and migration in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of the femora from 12-week-old <italic>Tgif1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (n=4) and <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/<bold>-</bold></sup></italic> (n=4) mice stained with Toluidine blue.

Active osteoblasts produce an extracellular matrix and have the capacity to migrate to sites of bone remodeling and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>). These features require the ability to adhere to surfaces and to change cell morphology to facilitate cell migration. In support of our hypothesis that Tgif1-deficiency compromises morphological plasticity of osteoblasts, calvarial- and long bone-derived osteoblasts obtained from Tgif1-deficient mice were impaired in their ability to attach to collagen type I-coated surfaces throughout a 4 hr time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). To determine the ability of Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts to migrate, we performed live cell video microscopy of osteoblasts seeded on collagen type I-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dang and Gautreau, 2018</xref>). This analysis revealed that osteoblasts lacking Tgif1 were impaired in their migration capacity reflected by a shorter track length, a reduced velocity, and a less straight and, therefore, more meandering track path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, these in vivo and in vitro data indicate that Tgif1 is important for osteoblasts to adhere and migrate on collagen type I-rich surfaces. To confirm these findings in a three-dimensional functional context, we obtained long bone osteoblasts from Tgif1-defcient mice and control littermates and seeded them on a collagen type I matrix placed over a porous membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In support of the previous observations, osteoblasts lacking Tgif1 adhered less to collagen type I matrix and were impaired in their capacities to migrate into the matrix compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The experiment also confirmed that Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts were rather flat in morphology and smaller in size as determined by reduced cell area and perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–M</xref>). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that Tgif1 is indispensable for osteoblasts to adapt a regular cell morphology and to adhere and migrate on collagen type I-rich matrices in vitro and on bone surfaces in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts are impaired in spreading and in forming focal adhesions</title><p>Adherence on osseous matrices and migration alongside bone surfaces towards sites of remodeling or repair are crucial functional features of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>).

The findings further demonstrate that Tgif1 regulates <italic>Pak3</italic> expression through transcriptional repression and that elevated PAK3 abundance contributes to the impaired osteoblast spreading observed in Tgif1-deficient cells. Additionally, Tgif1 is shown to participate in the activation of bone surfaces in the context of bone regeneration and PTH treatment since in the absence of Tgif1, bone regeneration- and PTH-induced activation of bone surfaces is attenuated. Mechanistically, PTH promotes osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling, with <italic>Pak3</italic> expression being reduced by PTH treatment in a Tgif1-dependent manner. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of Tgif1 in regulating osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration through the modulation of PAK3 expression, providing novel, and translationally relevant mechanistic insights into the regulation of the cytoskeletal architecture of osteoblasts.</p><p>Both, bone repair and PTH treatment are frequent and clinically relevant events. Fractures often occur in the context of high-energy accidents, however, bone fragility syndromes such as osteoporosis also cause fractures upon minimal or no trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malluche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Löfman et al., 2007</xref>). Bone regeneration, a complex process involving osteoblast recruitment, matrix production, and tissue regeneration, is compromised in Tgif1-deficient mice. Activation of bone surfaces by osteoblasts, a critically important aspect of bone repair, is significantly reduced in the absence of Tgif1, leading to a reduced callus ossification. In addition, Tgif1-deficient mice also have a reduced number and activity of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>) and, therefore, an attenuated bone remodeling which might also contribute to an impaired bone healing. Nevertheless, the results presented here indicate that Tgif1 is important for osteoblast recruitment to the site of repair and subsequent bone surface activation, which extends the established function of Tgif1 beyond the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and activity.</p><p>Albeit mechanistically distinct, bone repair and PTH treatment have in common that osteoblasts are an important component for the successful execution of bone regeneration and the PTH pharmacological effects. In particular, the guided spatial relocation of activated osteoblasts is a critical feature to exert the respective functions at the right sites in a three-dimensional context since the formation of new bone, regardless of whether in the cortical- or trabecular compartment, occurs in a timely but also in a spatially controlled manner to yield structurally supportive newly formed bone tissue. Various types of cells and tissues of the local microenvironment produce a plethora of signaling factors, which are induced by fractures or PTH treatment. However, little is known about signaling pathways in osteoblasts that receive and integrate these diverse external cues to facilitate the adherence, spreading, and movement of osteoblasts in a coordinated manner. In this context, this study identified the functional importance of PAK3 in Tgif1-deficient osteoblasts. PAK3 expression was increased in the absence of Tgif1, leading to impaired focal adhesion formation and reduced osteoblast spreading. Silencing <italic>Pak3</italic> expression restored osteoblast spreading in Tgif1-deficient cells, demonstrating that PAK3 plays a critical role in mediating the effects of Tgif1 on osteoblast morphology. This work, therefore, contributes to the better understanding of osteoblast dynamics by identifying Tgif1 and PAK3 as downstream signaling regulators that are important for osteoblasts to fulfill motility. Furthermore, the work underscores the physiological relevance of spatial osteoblast dynamics as an integral component of bone remodeling and maintenance of skeletal integrity.</p><p>Tgif1 recently emerged as a key determinant of osteoblast activity, bone mass maintenance and an essential component of the bone anabolic PTH signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haider et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>) This study also focused on investigating the role of PTH in regulating osteoblast spreading and revealed that PTH treatment facilitated osteoblast spreading via Tgif1-PAK3 signaling. PTH treatment reduced PAK3 expression and increased Tgif1 expression, leading to enhanced osteoblast spreading. Silencing <italic>Tgif1</italic> expression impaired PTH-induced osteoblast spreading, which was restored by simultaneously silencing <italic>Pak3</italic> expression. These new findings on PTH-Tgif1-PAK3 signaling provide novel insights into the function of PTH treatment of bone remodeling and the implication of Tgif1 in this process. As part of being required for bone mass accrual in response to PTH treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2019</xref>), Tgif1 also contributes to the PTH-induced osteoblast recruitment and subsequent movement to sites where new bone needs to be formed. This adds a spatial component to a functional feature and demonstrates the complexity of bone remodeling and PTH anabolic actions.</p><p>This work has the limitation that the findings on the role of Tgif1 in osteoblast spreading and migration were obtained by in vitro assays, which do not necessarily fully reflect in vivo situations. Furthermore, limited evidence exists that the role of Tgif1-PAK3 signaling uncovered in vitro also plays a crucial role in vivo. Thus, future in vivo studies need to further validate our findings for instance by determining <italic>Pak3</italic> expression in <italic>Tgif1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in fractures and upon PTH treatment as well as by pharmacologically suppressing <italic>Pak3</italic> expression in Tgif1-deficient mice.</p><p>In summary, these findings highlight the pivotal role of Tgif1 in regulating osteoblast morphology, adherence, and migration. Notwithstanding the possibility that other mechanisms exist, our data reveal the involvement of PAK3 in mediating the effects of Tgif1 on osteoblast spreading. The dysregulation of these processes due to Tgif1 deficiency has profound implications for bone remodeling, bone regeneration, and the pharmacological effects of PTH. Reaching a better understanding of the intricate interplay between PTH, Tgif1 and PAK3, provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing osteoblast function and could have translational relevance in bone-related disorders and therapies targeting bone health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models</title><p>Mice with germ-line deletion of <italic>Tgif1</italic> or loxP-flanked <italic>Tgif1</italic> loci have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen and Walsh, 2005</xref>).

ChIP-qPCR data were first normalized to the input of each precipitation (2 <sup>(Ct 100% input- Ct sample)</sup>), and then to the relative IgG sample. The gene <italic>Rarα</italic> was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The oligonucleotides used to amplify the Tgif1 binding site and as negative control were the following:</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable3" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">BS # 1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCAGGAAAATCCTGTTATGCTTCC</named-content></td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Neg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GAAATTCTGTGTTGGCCGCA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rev</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGGTTAAAACAGTAGCTACATCCC</named-content></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rev</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCAGCACCTACAATTCTGACCA</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed minimum of three times.

Towards this end, germ-line Tgif1 deletion (Tgif1-/-) mice or male mice lacking expression of Tgif1 in mature osteoblastic and osteocytic cells (Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl) and corresponding controls were studied in physiological, bone anabolic, and bone fracture-repair conditions. Both Tgif1-/- and Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl exhibited decreased osteoblasts on cancellous bone surfaces and adherent to collagen I-coated plates. Tgif1-/- mice exhibit impaired healing in the tibial midshaft fracture model, as indicated by decreased bone volume (BV/Cal.V), osteoid (OS/BS), and low osteoblasts (number and surface). Likewise, both Tgif1-/- and Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl show impaired PTH 1-34, (100 µg/kg, 5x/wk for 3 wks) osteoblast activation in vivo, as detected by increases in quiescent bone surfaces. Mechanistic in vitro studies then utilized primary osteoblasts isolated from Tgif1-/- mice and siRNA Tgif1 knockdown OCY454 cells to further investigate and identify the downstream Tgif1 target driving these osteoblastic impairments. In vitro, Tgif1-/- osteoblastic and Tgif1 knockdown OCY454 cells exhibit decreased migration, abnormal morphology, and decreased focal adhesions/cell. Unexpectantly though, localization assays revealed Tgif1 to primarily concentrate in the nucleus and not to co-localize with focal adhesions (paxillin, talin). Also, expression of major focal adhesion components (paxillin, talin, FAK, Src etc.) or the Cdc42 family was not altered by loss of Tgif1 expression. In contrast, PAK3 expression is markedly upregulated by loss of Tgif1. In silico analysis followed by mechanistic molecular assays involving ChIP, siRNA (Tgif1, PAK3), and transfection (rat PAK3 promoter) techniques show that Tgif1 physically binds to a specific site in the PAK3 promoter region. Further, the knockdown of PAK3 rescues the Tgif1-deficient abnormal morphology in OCY454 cells. This is the first study to identify the novel transcriptional repression of PAK3 by Tgif1 as well as the specific Tgif1 binding site within the PAK3 promoter.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work has a plethora of strengths. The co-authors achieved their aim in eliciting the role of Tgif1 expression to osteoblastic cellular functions (morphology, spreading/attachment, migration). Further, this work is the first to depict the novel mechanism of Tgif1 transcriptional repression of PAK3 by a through usage of mechanistic molecular assays (In silico analysis, ChIP, siRNA, transfection etc.). The conclusions are well supported and justified by these findings, as the appropriate controls, sample sizes (statistical power), statistics, and assays were fully utilized.</p><p>Claims and conclusions justified by data? Yes. absolutely</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>None. All reviewer comments were fully addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94265.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bolamperti</surname><given-names>Simona</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>LMU Klinikum</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heerdmann</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hesse</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>LMU Klinikum</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Taipaleenmäki</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>LMU Klinikum</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We are very grateful to both Reviewers, the Reviewing Editor and the Senior Editor for carefully reviewing our manuscript and for providing useful comments and suggestions that further improved the quality of our work.

Towards this end, germ-line Tgif1 deletion (Tgif1-/-) mice or male mice lacking expression of Tgif1 in mature osteoblastic and osteocytic cells (Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl) and corresponding controls were studied in physiological, bone anabolic, and bone fracture-repair conditions. Both Tgif1-/- and Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl exhibited decreased osteoblasts on cancellous bone surfaces and adherent to collagen I-coated plates. Tgif1-/- mice exhibit impaired healing in the tibial midshaft fracture model, as indicated by decreased bone volume (BV/Cal.V), osteoid (OS/BS), and low osteoblasts (number and surface). Likewise, both Tgif1-/- and Dmp1-Cre+; Tgif1fl/fl show impaired PTH 1-34, (100µg/kg, 5x/wk for 3 wks) osteoblast activation in vivo, as detected by increases in quiescent bone surfaces. Mechanistic in vitro studies then utilized primary osteoblasts isolated from Tgif1-/- mice and siRNA Tgif1 knockdown OCY454 cells to further investigate and identify the downstream Tgif1 target driving these osteoblastic impairments. In vitro, Tgif1-/- osteoblastic and Tgif1 knockdown OCY454 cells exhibit decreased migration, abnormal morphology, and decreased focal adhesions/cells. Unexpectantly though, localization assays revealed Tgif1 to primarily concentrate in the nucleus and not to co-localize with focal adhesions (paxillin, talin). Also, the expression of major focal adhesion components (paxillin, talin, FAK, Src, etc.) or the Cdc42 family was not altered by loss of Tgif1 expression. In contrast, PAK3 expression is markedly upregulated by loss of Tgif1. In silico analysis followed by mechanistic molecular assays involving ChIP, siRNA (Tgif1, PAK3), and transfection (rat PAK3 promoter) techniques show that Tgif1 physically binds to a specific site in the PAK3 promoter region. Further, the knockdown of PAK3 rescues the Tgif1-deficient abnormal morphology in OCY454 cells. This is the first study to identify the novel transcriptional repression of PAK3 by Tgif1 as well as the specific Tgif1 binding site within the PAK3 promoter.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work has a plethora of strengths. The co-authors achieved their aim of eliciting the role of Tgif1 expression in osteoblastic cellular functions (morphology, spreading/attachment, migration).</p><p>Further, this work is the first to depict the novel mechanism of Tgif1 transcriptional repression of PAK3 by a thorough usage of mechanistic molecular assays (in silico analysis, ChIP, siRNA, transfection etc.). The conclusions are well supported and justified by these findings, as the appropriate controls, sample sizes (statistical power), statistics, and assays were fully utilized.The claims and conclusions are justified by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: We are grateful to this reviewer for recognizing the novelty, strengths, and rigor of our study and for acknowledging that the data convincingly support the conclusions drawn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The discussion section could be expanded with a few sentences regarding limitations to the current study and potential future directions.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: In the revised manuscript, we are discussing limitations of the work and describe possible future directions (page 18, line 9-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The cell spreading and migration assay is quite artificial. Trypsinized osteoblasts and quiescent osteoblasts are totally different. The authors need to cite papers from other groups to justify whether the cell spreading and migration assay is appropriate to achieve the goals of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: The reviewer is right that in vitro assays are often artificial and do not necessarily fully reflect in vivo situations. We have taken this aspect into account and discuss it in the revised manuscript (page 18, lines 9-10). In addition, we have included references from other groups who have used similar assays to study cell spreading and migration (Dejaeger M et al., 2017 and Dang et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 13 Line 15: The statement &quot;Osteoblasts are greatly impaired in the ability to migrate into the repair zone&quot; is an overstatement. The experiments in Figure 5 do not necessarily reflect osteoblast migration activities. The authors need to rephrase the sentence or need to show observation of earlier time points (e.g., 1 week after fracture) in their bone healing experiments. The number of osteoblasts/surface in Tgif1+/+ and Tgif1-/- mice at different time points during bone healing should be a good indicator for the migration of osteoblasts to the repair site.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: We understand the critique that a time course or lineage tracing experiments would provide better evidence for the statement of osteoblast migration into the repair zone. To avoid overinterpretations we have removed the sentence from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Page 14, Line 24: Regarding the sentence &quot;The observation that Tgif1 is crucial for osteoblast adherence, spreading, and migration&quot;, the authors need to clearly mention this statement is based on the in vitro experiments. The animal studies are not enough to claim that the mechanism is crucial for adherence, spreading, and migration.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this limitation. We have clarified that the finding that Tgif1 is crucial for osteoblast adherence, spreading and migration was made in vitro (page 14, line 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors need to demonstrate the suppression of Pak3 expression in PTH-treated mice in vivo, in addition to the in vitro culture system (Fig. 7C and 7D).</p></disp-quote><p>Re: We agree with the reviewer that this experiment would be very insightful. However, this is beyond the scope of the current work. Nevertheless, to take this valid point into consideration, we mention it in the discussion as potential future direction (page 18, lines 11-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors need to demonstrate that the pharmacologic suppression of Pak3 in Tgif1-/- mice reduces the % of quiescent surface/BS in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: This point is also well taken, and we agree that a suppression of Pak3 in Tgif1-deficient mice would be very informative to support our in vitro findings. However, this may also be part of future investigations. This is emphasized in the discussion of the revised manuscript (page 18, lines 11-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures (Minor)</p><p>Fig. 1:</p><p>Fig. 1A</p><p>Arrows need to indicate a more precise position.</p></disp-quote><p>Re: The position of the arrows has been optimized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 1DE</p><p>What are blue/red bars (genotypes)?</p></disp-quote><p>Re: The colors indicate the genotypes.

Would it be possible to perform micro-CT imaging with some of these samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Re: There is no difference in non-mineralized callus size between Tgif1+/+ and Tgif1-/- mice. However, there is less mineralized bone per callus area in Tgif1-/- mice, confirming an impaired osteoblast phenotype. As suggested by the reviewer, we added representative micro-CT images and the respective information to the revised manuscript (Fig 5F; pages 19-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fracture repair experiment-is PAK3 expression downregulated with fracture injury; and/or, is PAK3 upregulated by loss of Tgif1 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Re: Unfortunately, we do not have data to answer this very interesting question and it would need to be addressed in future studies. This is mentioned in the revised discussion (page 18, lines 12-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig 7F. within PTH treated cells, is the light blue SCR sphericity statistically different than the light green siTgif1 + siPAK3 ? While the statement of the &quot;lack of both, Tgif1 and PAK3 prevented PTH-induced decrease in cell sphericity&quot; is supported by the lack of differences between dark green vs. light green; is it also possible that this is due to the siPAK3 returning sphericity to control (scr) levels? (i.e. hitting a floor limit of detection).</p></disp-quote><p>Re: We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful question. There is no statistically significant difference between light blue and light green. Silencing PAK3 restores the impaired capacity to spread that occurs in the absence of Tgif1 to the level of scr controls (significant difference between dark and light red vs. dark and light green and no difference between either dark or light blue vs. dark or light green). However, unlike in the (scr) controls, in the absence of both Tgif1 and PAK3, the cells do not respond to PTH (statistically significant difference between dark and light blue, no difference between dark and light green). Based on the data, cells can reach sphericity of less than 0.2 and thus it is unlikely that sphericity is “hitting the floor level of detection” in these groups.</p></body></sub-article></article>
