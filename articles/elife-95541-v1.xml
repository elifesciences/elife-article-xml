In rodents and humans, most of the components of semen are supplied by the seminal vesicles, and they support male reproductive ability, but there are many unknown details. This study focused on metabolic changes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and investigated how testosterone affects seminal plasma composition. A factor improving the linear motility of sperm was secreted from the seminal vesicles, and it was produced in an androgen-dependent manner. Bioassays, gene expression, and flux analysis studies demonstrated that testosterone promotes glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells via GLUT4, resulting in fatty acid synthesis. ACLY was a critical factor in this metabolic change, which produced fatty acids, especially oleic acid. In conclusion, the critical role of testosterone-induced metabolic changes in the seminal vesicles is to ensure the synthesis of fatty acids. These findings suggest that testosterone-dependent lipid remodeling may contribute to sperm straight-line motility, and further functional verification is required.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>semen</kwd><kwd>seminal vesicles</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>ATP-citrate lyase</kwd><kwd>sperm motility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hhkn466</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23K14069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umehara</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hhkn466</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23H00361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Testosterone promotes the conversion of glucose to fatty acids by increasing the expression of ACLY in seminal vesicle epithelial cells, thereby regulating the seminal plasma components.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the failure to conceive within 12 months despite contraceptive-free sexual intercourse. Its prevalence has increased over the decades and is observed in 17.5% of couples worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">World Health Organization, 2023</xref>). The male partner is thought to be solely or in combination responsible for 50% of infertility cases, and the male factor in the etiology of infertility is highly recognized. Male fertility depends largely on the quality of semen composed of sperm and seminal plasma and decreases with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kidd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mumcu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Sperm that have completed spermatogenesis in the testis acquire the potential to fertilize during maturation in the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elbashir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cosentino and Cockett, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howarth, 1983</xref>). The physiological changes of sperm during the fertilization process are collectively referred to as ‘capacitation’. This change is characterized by large-amplitude flagellar beating (called hyperactivation) and developing the capacity to undergo the acrosome reaction and can be induced by culturing sperm collected from the epididymis in a medium containing bicarbonate and cholesterol acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagimachi, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yanagimachi, 1994</xref>). However, once capacitation is complete, sperm cannot maintain this state for a long time. Therefore, even if epididymal sperm that have not been exposed to seminal plasma are artificially inseminated into the cervix or uterus, the fertilization rate remains low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaddum-Rosse, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shalgi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>). This is because, in vivo, during ejaculation, exposure of epididymal sperm to seminal plasma masks the unintended capacitation as they pass through the female reproductive tract and ensures fertilization of sperm that reaches the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noda and Ikawa, 2019</xref>). In other words, seminal plasma plays an important role in fine-tuning the timing of sperm capacitation and in maintaining the sustained sperm motility required to reach the oviduct.</p><p>Seminal plasma is mainly produced in the seminal vesicles (approximately 65–75%), with approximately 20–30% produced by the prostate, and small amounts secreted by the bulbourethral and urethral glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verze et al., 2016</xref>). The mixing of seminal fluid with accessory reproductive gland fluid during ejaculation causes semen to clot and liquefy in humans and causes vaginal plug formation in rodents. Vaginal plugs not only inhibit continuous mating but also play a role in maintaining sperm in the uterus and ensuring male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noda and Ikawa, 2019</xref>). TGFβ, a component of seminal plasma, increases antigen-specific Treg cells in the uterus of mice and humans, which induces immune tolerance, resulting in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balandya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shima et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, SVS2, secreted from the seminal vesicle, is also known to be required for sperm to escape attack by the female immune system in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, seminal plasma contains various biochemical components that support sperm metabolism, including lipids and organic acids. Differences in the relative size of the accessory reproductive glands reflect differences in the seminal plasma composition. Accordingly, there are considerable differences in the properties of seminal plasma among animal species. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosecrans et al., 1987</xref> found significant differences in the levels of most biochemical components in seminal plasma compared to those in blood, with specific factors like fructose being rarely detected in blood but abundant in seminal plasma. Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umehara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Islam et al., 2021</xref>) documented that seminal plasma also contains creatine and fatty acids taken up by sperm within minutes. These substances play crucial roles in regulating sperm metabolic pathways and enhancing sperm motility. These observations indicate that seminal plasma not only alters the female immune system to protect sperm but also directly influences sperm metabolic pathways, facilitating the transformation of sperm capable of in vivo fertilization.</p><p>Several specific factors produced by the male accessory glands that contribute to seminal plasma and impact male fertility have been elucidated. For example, surgical removal of seminal vesicles in male mice and rats was associated with infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Queen et al., 1981</xref>). The observations that fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mann, 1946</xref>) and citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Humphrey and Mann, 1949</xref>) concentrations in seminal plasma of control mice and rats are higher than in castrated animals suggest that the specific metabolism of the accessory glands might be affected by testosterone derived from the testes, which activate intracellular androgen receptors (AR; NR3C4) required for gene regulation of transcription. AR-deficient mice have been found to be infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), and long-term administration of androgen receptor antagonists, like flutamide, abolished male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fix et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagaosa et al., 2007</xref>). AR-deficient mice and transcriptome analyses have identified specific targets of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith and Walker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooke and Walker, 2021</xref>). In both mice and humans, androgen levels decrease with aging, and their concentrations have been reported to cause a decrease in male fertility, especially ejaculated sperm motility. In addition to impairments in spermatogenesis, a decline in androgen levels may also disrupt the metabolic functions of the accessory glands and alter the composition of seminal plasma. Therefore, the intricate interplay between testosterone and seminal plasma synthesis in the accessory glands requires further investigation.</p><p>In this study, various bioassays were done to identify which accessory glands are essential for sperm fertility. Subsequently, comparative in vivo and in vitro analyses were performed using a hypoandrogenic model. In addition, biochemical and molecular techniques such as RNA-seq, flux analysis, mass spectrometry, and knockdown experiments were employed. These analyses revealed that testosterone promotes the synthesis of oleic acid in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and its secretion into seminal plasma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The effect of androgen-dependent changes in mouse seminal vesicle secretions on the linear motility of sperm</title><p>A direct comparison was conducted to clarify the effects of secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles on the motility parameters of epididymal sperm.

However, the curvi-linear velocity (VCL) did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). Meanwhile, the secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles did not affect the viscosity of the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Furthermore, JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, which is important for sperm linear motility, showed a significantly lower percentage of high mitochondrial membrane potential in sperm treated with the secretions of seminal vesicles from flutamide-treated mice and mice over 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Since flutamide treatment and aging also affect spermatogenesis and sperm motility, it should be noted that epididymal sperm donors differ from seminal vesicle donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Due to the strong effect of the decapacitation factor, it was found that seminal vesicle fluid, regardless of the presence or absence of androgens, reduces the fertilization rate in in vitro fertilization (IVF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The baseline information for the epididymal sperm used in the experiment showed that the sperm were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicated that androgen-dependent changes in seminal vesicle functions alter the levels/activity of seminal vesicle secretion factors, which regulate sperm linear motility. The changes in seminal vesicle functions were also induced by aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Testosterone–androgen receptor activity suppresses the proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title><p>To understand the difference between seminal vesicles that secrete factors for enhancing sperm linear motility and those that are impaired in this function, we performed histological analysis of seminal vesicles recovered from mice treated and non-treated with flutamide. In control mice, the seminal vesicle epithelial cells were in a single layer, and androgen receptors were localized in the nuclei of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in mice treated with continuous administration of flutamide, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were multilayered, and the strong accumulation of androgen receptors in the nucleus was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate the cause of this multilayering of cells, we performed Ki67 staining, a marker of cell proliferation, and apoptosis detection by TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The results showed that the percentage of Ki67-positive cells increased significantly after treatment with flutamide, but the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells did not change, suggesting that the testosterone–androgen receptor pathway is responsible for the inhibition of proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These changes of abnormal morphology and high proliferation activity were also observed in seminal vesicles of mice older than 12 months that showed low serum testosterone levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Therefore, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were collected and cultured in primary culture, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. The changes in cell number were counted, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. When cultured without testosterone (c), the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells increased in a time-dependent manner. However, the addition of testosterone significantly decreased the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells during the 8-day culture period in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Flow cytometry on day 7 revealed a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and a corresponding decrease in the G2/M phase. The G2/M phase was significantly decreased by the addition of testosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>).

These data indicate that testosterone enhances glucose utilization. This leads to the interpretation that testosterone increases the flow of glycolysis by increasing glucose uptake and alters metabolic flux distribution. To determine the metabolic fate of glycolytic end products, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were cultured with and without testosterone. Subsequently, the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate in the culture supernatant normalized by the total number of live cells were measured. The addition of testosterone significantly decreased the pyruvate concentration; however, the lactate concentration did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). We therefore examined cellular energy metabolism with a flux analyzer, anticipating that testosterone would elevate glycolytic flux, thereby producing more pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate. Because extracellular pyruvate levels simultaneously declined, we inferred that the cells had an increased pyruvate demand and, at that time, hypothesized that the excess pyruvate would enter the mitochondria to support enhanced oxidative metabolism. Unexpectedly, when measuring mitochondrial respiratory metabolism normalized by the total number of live cells with the flux analyzer, the basal respiratory rate (the electron transport chain activity) was significantly decreased by testosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–J</xref>). Oligomycin-sensitive respiration was also significantly suppressed by exposure to testosterone. Furthermore, the FCCP uncoupled respiration and spare respiration capacity were also significantly decreased in response to testosterone treatment. Overall, these data indicate that testosterone promotes the redistribution of metabolic flux. In other words, testosterone increased glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells while decreasing mitochondrial respiration. To determine whether these changes were accompanied by changes in gene expression of specific metabolic-related enzymes, we analyzed gene expression levels.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Testosterone regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial ATP production in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) analysis by an extracellular flux analyzer in seminal vesicle epithelial cells cultured with 100 ng/ml testosterone (Testo) or vehicle (Ctrl) for 7 days: (<bold>A</bold>) ECAR kinetics of seminal vesicle epithelial cells using an extracellular flux analyzer.

Therefore, we performed shRNA knockdown experiments on ACLY to clarify the impact of ACLY on the cellular metabolic shift. The addition of testosterone significantly increased the amount of ACLY protein in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Viral infection with shRNAs encoding <italic>Acly-</italic>targeted shRNAs markedly decreased the amount of ACLY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). When ACLY was knocked down using shRNA, the proliferation arrest caused by testosterone was released, and the cells began to proliferate again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This knockdown of ACLY increased the oxygen consumption of seminal vesicle epithelial cells in the control and testosterone-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>). Thus, ACLY expression is associated with mitochondrial metabolic pathway activity in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of ACLY also significantly suppressed testosterone-induced fatty acid synthesis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). According to the GC–MS quantification results, the amount of fatty acids secreted into the culture medium was also reduced by ACLY knockdown. In particular, the enhancement of oleic acid secretion by testosterone was inhibited by ACLY knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–J</xref>). Supernatants from epithelial cells of the testosterone-added group induced motility and linear motility (highest VSL and LIN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K–N</xref>). However, the knockdown of ACLY significantly reduced the effects of the culture supernatant on sperm motility and LIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K–N</xref>). These results indicate that cell proliferation stops when a metabolic shift mediated by ACLY occurs, and glucose is reallocated to fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthesis is an important function of the seminal vesicles, and it was found that when testosterone is present, fatty acid synthesis enhancement and cell proliferation stop simultaneously. However, it is not known what effects occur when cell proliferation stops.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Testosterone-regulated ACLY induces metabolic shifts in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot images of ACLY and α/β-tubulin in three sets of seminal vesicle epithelial cells cultured with 100 ng/ml testosterone (Testo) or in vehicle (Ctrl) for 7 days.

Mammalian seminal plasma is secreted mainly from the seminal vesicle and is rich in cytokines, prostaglandins, and SVS family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonzales, 2001</xref>). For this reason, recent studies have focused on the immunomodulatory function of seminal plasma in the female reproductive tract. On the other hand, fructose and lipids in seminal plasma are the major energy sources for sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lenzi et al., 1996</xref>). However, although metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have shown that metabolic substrates are present at higher concentrations in seminal plasma than in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosecrans et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mann, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Humphrey and Mann, 1949</xref>), how these substrates are synthesized and specifically how they alter sperm motility has not been determined. Moreover, though the motility of ejaculated spermatozoa is known to decrease with aging, few reports have revealed age-related changes in the seminal vesicles, which are responsible for seminal plasma synthesis.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the reproductive organs that synthesize seminal plasma as target organs for testosterone and found that factors formed by testosterone-dependent metabolic changes in seminal vesicles activate sperm mitochondria and enhance their linear motility. Testosterone is known to activate intracellular ARs and alter intracellular metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haren et al., 2011</xref>), prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costello and Franklin, 2002</xref>) and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). ARs are known to directly regulate the expression of glycolytic and lipid metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonthier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Troncoso et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, the nuclear localization of AR in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (i.e., functioning as a transcription factor) and the activation of the glycolytic system by testosterone were similar to those in the above cell types. In seminal vesicle epithelial cells, an increased trend in the expression of <italic>Slc2a3</italic> and an enhancement of GLUT4 function were observed in a testosterone-dependent manner. Such effects of testosterone on glucose metabolism have also been reported in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, where testosterone leads to the phosphorylation of GLUT4 and enhances its translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with the results of our metabolic flux analyses, which show that testosterone increases the rate of glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by increasing glucose uptake. We further confirmed that GLUT4 is the transporter that mediates this glucose uptake using indinavir, a GLUT4-specific inhibitor.</p><p>This study suggests that fatty acid synthesis is an important function of the seminal vesicles, which provide an environment where the ejaculated sperm can carry out active metabolism. The shift to fatty acid synthesis was consistent with the cessation of cell proliferation in the presence of testosterone. This mechanism could prevent the seminal vesicles from excessively consuming the substrates necessary for sperm motility. Manipulation of ACLY expression in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells has been shown to alter the TCA cycle into a ‘non-normal cycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2022</xref>). One advantage of the non-normal TCA cycle is its ability to retain carbon instead of combusting it and to regenerate the cytosolic NAD+ needed to maintain glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luengo et al., 2021</xref>). It suggests that ACLY, activated by testosterone, may suppress proliferation by skipping several steps in the mitochondrial TCA cycle and minimizing ATP production associated with aerobic respiration in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p><p>Testosterone has been reported to cause hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yeap, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsh et al., 1998</xref>). Cell hypertrophy is partly due to the accumulation of fatty acids in the cytoplasm, which causes significant damage to cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grabner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mittendorfer, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, normal cell hypertrophy, especially in myofibers, involves the activation of signaling molecules such as Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor, and Pi3k–Akt–mTor, which regulate metabolic reprogramming in cancer by increasing glucose uptake in the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wackerhage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Semenza, 2012</xref>). In the present study, induction of ACLY expression by testosterone not only decreased cycling in the TCA cycle but also promoted glucose assimilation, which played an important role in fatty acid synthesis. Thus, in tissues where fatty acid synthesis is promoted, either β-oxidation-dependent ATP production in mitochondria or the secretion of fatty acids occurs to maintain cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morant-Ferrando et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duta-Mare et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2014</xref>), providing evidence to explain why the presence of fatty acids in the cell has no adverse effect. In accessory reproductive glands, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, glucose uptake is activated in a testosterone-dependent manner. However, mitochondrial respiration is not enhanced, cell proliferation is not induced, and the metabolites are used as a substrate for sperm motility. This may be because, in the prostate, pyruvate synthesized by the glycolytic system in response to testosterone is converted to acetyl CoA, which is then converted to citrate in the TCA cycle, citrate is released as the main component of seminal plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costello and Franklin, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The testosterone-dependent growth of cancerous prostate epithelial cells may be due to genetic mutations, such as elevated expression of the gene encoding aconitase, which converts citrate to isocitrate, which blocks the TCA cycle and inhibits citrate secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsui et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, in the analysis of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, testosterone treatment induced the expression of <italic>Acc</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, which elongates C16:0 to C18:0, thereby supplying substrate for oleic acid production, significantly increasing total saturated fatty acid and oleic acid content. Therefore, testosterone promotes glucose conversion into fatty acids, especially oleic acid, in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. Although there is a commonality in the activation of the glycolytic system in testosterone target tissues, the different expression patterns of genes involved in metabolism in mitochondria may exert their specific functions in each tissue. Among fatty acid synthesis genes, <italic>Acc</italic>, <italic>Fasn</italic>, and <italic>Acly</italic> are localized to syntenic regions on human chromosome 17q and mouse chromosome 11, respectively, suggesting that this chromosomal locus is a coordinated regulatory hub that promotes expression of lipogenic genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. The co-regulation of these genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells leads to the synthesis of fatty acids.</p><p>Decreased testosterone synthesis in the testes is a phenomenon observed with aging associated with decreased spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2017</xref>). However, the probability of obtaining sperm without ICSI or IVF is extremely low, despite the presence of sufficient numbers of sperm with normal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frattarelli et al., 2008</xref>). This indicates that testosterone plays a major role not only in spermatogenesis but also in the functional maturation of sperm. In this study, metabolic abnormalities induced by inhibition of androgen receptor function caused abnormal proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells in aged mice. In other words, the findings of the seminal vesicle epithelial cell culture experiments and flutamide treatment may mimic the changes that occur with aging. Oleic acid synthesis by testosterone-dependent metabolic pathways was regulated in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. It could be assumed that a decrease in testosterone levels causes abnormalities in the components of human semen. In particular, the results open up the possibility of a translational study to detect low testosterone levels in men by testing for oleic acid in semen.</p><p>Because seminal plasma contains components specific to certain male reproductive organs, differences in protein composition may reflect pathological processes in these specific organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drabovich et al., 2014</xref>). However, although proteomic and metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smyth et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drabovich et al., 2014</xref>), the functional changes in seminal plasma, especially the effects on in vivo fertilization potential, are not fully understood. This is because there are many challenges to measuring the direct relationship between sperm metabolism and movement patterns. Although our findings and previous studies suggest that oleic acid may play an important role in improving fertility, it is still too early to draw a definitive conclusion from this study. If a direct causal relationship between fatty acid composition and improved sperm motility is established, differences in the concentration of fatty acids in the seminal plasma will become a predictive marker of the fertilizing ability of semen. The interspecies differences between humans and mice should be interpreted with caution, and the translational aspects to humans are speculative, but this study revealed a testosterone-dependent mechanism of oleic acid production in seminal vesicle epithelium.</p><p>Overall, the results of the studies described herein strongly support the hypothesis that testosterone-dependent glucose to oleic acid conversion processes are required for normal seminal plasma functions in the seminal vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Sections were incubated with 3% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase and then incubated with Normal Goat Serum Blocking Solution for rabbit antibody (S-1000, Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, USA) to block nonspecific sites. The sections were then incubated overnight with primary rabbit antibodies: anti-AR antibody (1:100; ab133273; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-Ki67 antibody (1:1000; ab15580; Abcam), or anti-ACLY antibody (1:200; ab40793; Abcam). Positive signals were visualized by DAB (3,3′-Diaminobenzidine, 040-27001, Fujifilm Wako, Osaka, Japan) using the VECTASTAINE LifeABC kit (PK-6101, Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Apoptotic cells (including fragmented DNA) were detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit POD (11684817910, Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). To avoid false-positive or false-negative results, DNase-treated sections were used as positive controls, and TdT-untreated sections were used as negative controls for apoptosis.</p><p>Nuclei were visualized with hematoxylin (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan). Ki67 and apoptotic positive cells were quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), with software version 2.1.0/1.53u. Randomly selected sections were stained, and images were obtained from randomly selected fields in each section. The positive percentage is defined as the percentage of positively stained cells in the total number of epithelial cells evaluated. Only positive staining was considered, regardless of staining intensity. For immunofluorescence, after blocking nonspecific sites, the sections were incubated with a primary antibody: anti-GLUT4 antibody (1:200; ab33780; Abcam). After washing with 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in PBS (-), Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, C-2306, Sigma) and DAPI (VECTESHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI, H-1200, Vector Laboratories) were used to visualize the antigen and nuclei. Digital images were taken using an APX100 Digital Imaging System and CellSens imaging software (EVIDENT, Tokyo, Japan), with software version 4.1.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Isolation and culture of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title><p>Seminal vesicles were removed from euthanized mice, cut open vertically to expose the seminal vesicle cavity, and incubated with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS; CaCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O 0.185 g/l, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 0.098 g/l, KCl 0.400 g/l, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.060 g/l, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 0.350 g/l, NaCl 8.000 g/l, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> 0.048 g/l, <sc>d</sc>-glucose 1.0 g/l, dissolved in ultrapure water).

Based on limited evidence in previous versions of the report, the authors softened the claim that oleic acid derived from seminal vesicle epithelium strongly affects linear progressive motility in isolated cauda epididymal sperm in vitro. Though the report still contains somewhat ambiguous references to the strength of the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Often, reported epidydimal sperm from mice have lower percent progressive motility compared with sperm retrieved from the uterus or by comparison with human ejaculated sperm. The findings in this report may improve in vitro conditions to overcome this problem, as well as add important physiological context to the role of reproductive tract glandular secretions in modulating sperm behaviors. The strongest observations are related to the sensitivity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells to testosterone. The revisions include the addition of methodological detail, modified language to reflect the nuance of some of the measurements, as well as re-performed experiments with more appropriate control groups. The findings are likely to be of general interest to the field by providing context for follow-on studies regarding the relationship between fatty acid beta oxidation and sperm motility pattern.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The connection between media fatty acids and sperm motility pattern remains inconclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the judges for their cooperation in reviewing the manuscript and for your helpful comments, which were instrumental in improving manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Using a combination of in vivo studies with testosterone-inhibited and aged mice with lower testosterone levels as well as isolated mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells the authors show that testosterone induces an increase in glucose uptake. They find that testosterone induces a difference in gene expression with a focus on metabolic enzymes. Specifically, they identify increased expression of enzymes regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to increased production of 18:1 oleic acid. The revised version strengthens the role of ACLY as the main regulator of seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolic programming. The authors propose that fatty acids are secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells and are taken up by sperm, positively affecting sperm function. A lipid mixture mimicking the lipids secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells, however, only has a small and mostly non-significant effect on sperm motility, suggesting the authors were not apply to pinpoint the seminal vesicle fluid component that positively affects sperm function.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comments and time spent reviewing this manuscript. The relationship between lipids such as fatty acids and sperm motility remains unclear in the current dataset. Therefore, before finalizing the manuscript, we revised the title and text, as suggested by the reviewers, to express this conclusion more cautiously and consistently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Some additional comments are provided below to aid the authors in improving the quality of the work:</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>(1) In the newly added supplemental figure 5, the authors note that the percentage data were arcisine transformed prior to statistical analysis without providing any other justification. This seems strange, especially for such a small sample size. It seems more appropriate for the authors to use a nonparametric test. Forcing symmetry without knowing what the shape of the true distribution is makes the ANOVA hard to interpret. Additionally, why use pairwise comparisons rather than comparing each group to the control (LM 0%). Also, note that the graphs are not individually labeled to distinguish them in the legend (A, B, C, etc.). Ultimately, the treatment differences don't seem that meaningful, even if the authors were able to observe statistical significance with the somewhat over-manipulated method of analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Ultimately, the conclusion of this experiment (Supplemental figure 5) remains unchanged, but we agree that the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility remains unclear. Therefore, before finalizing the manuscript, we revised the title and text as pointed out by the reviewers to express this conclusion more cautiously and consistently throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Arcsin transform is commonly used for percentage data [Zar, J.H. 2010. Biostatistical analysis., McDonald, J.H. 2014. Handbook of biological statistics.]. If the values are low or high, such as 0 to 30% or 70 to 100%, without arcsine transformation will result in a large deviation from the normality of the data. However, even if such a conversion is performed, it does not necessarily mean that the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, which are prerequisites for parametric statistical analysis methods, are satisfied.</p><p>Given the small sample size and the possibility of non-normal data, we performed Shapiro–Wilk tests for each group (n = 6) and found no departure from normality (all p &gt; 0.1). Q–Q plots and Levene’s test (p &gt; 0.1) likewise supported the assumptions of ANOVA. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we repeated the analysis with a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni corrected). Both approaches led to the same conclusions, with non-parametric p-values equal to or smaller than the parametric ones. In the revised manuscript we now report ANOVA as the primary analysis. The author response image includes effect sizes with 95 % confidence intervals, and provide the non-parametric results for transparency.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Results of reanalysis of supplementary Figure 5 using nonparametric tests and effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals.</title><p>Upper part; Differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal–Wallis test, differences among values were analyzed by Dunn’s post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) for multiple comparisons.

Additionally, phosphoenolpyruvate has three acid ionizable groups, two of which have pKa's well below physiological pH, so phosphoenolpyruvate is the correct intermediate rather than phosphoenolpyruvic acid.

The publications cited by the author do not support that statement and this reviewer also does not agree. Lower fertilization efficiency from in vitro capacitated epidydimal sperm does not have to mean capacitation is reversed, it can simply mean in vitro capacitation conditions not accurately mimic capacitation in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and would like to clarify our position. Our statement does not suggest a &quot;reversal&quot; of active capacitation. Rather, it reflects the well-documented fact that capacitation is a transient process. Sperm that undergo capacitation too early cannot maintain that state for long enough to retain their ability to fertilize at the moment and location of fertilization in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How do the authors explain the discrepancy between the results shown in Fig. S1E, the increase in sperm motility upon mixing of sperm with SVF and the results reported in Li et al 2025. Mentioning decapacitating factors without further explanation is insufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback pointing out the need for a clearer explanation.</p><p>Seminal plasma is inherently binary, containing both decapacitation factors that delay or inhibit capacitation and nutrient substrates that promote sperm motility.</p><p>In vivo, it is believed that the coating of sperm by decapacitation factors is removed by uterine fluid and albumin as it passes through the female reproductive tract [PMID: 22827391, PMID: 24274412]. In contrast, standard fertilization culture media lack a clearance pathway, so decapacitating factors are retained throughout the culture period. As a result, the cleavage rate after in vitro fertilization using sperm exposed to seminal vesicle fluid decreased dramatically.</p><p>Lipids, such as fatty acids, increased sperm motility without directly inducing markers of fertilization. These results suggest that the enhancement of motility by lipids is functionally distinct from the capacitation-inhibiting function of seminal plasma proteins. The data from this study are consistent with the biphasic model. Specifically, decapacitation factors temporarily stabilize the sperm membrane, preventing early capacitation. Meanwhile, lipids enhance sperm motility, enabling them to rapidly pass through the hostile uterine environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This reviewer does not see the merit in including a lipid mixture motility experiment compared to using OA alone. The increase in motility is still small and far from comparable to the motility increase with seminal vesicle fluid. In this reviewer's opinion the experiment is still inconclusive and should not be highlighted in the manuscript title.</p></disp-quote><p>The wording has been softened overall.
