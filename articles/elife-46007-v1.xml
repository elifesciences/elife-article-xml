MicroRNAs are important post-transcriptional regulators during development. Here, we use high throughput small RNA sequencing to identify miR-204, a highly conserved microRNA dramatically enriched in lymphatic vs. blood endothelial cells in human and zebrafish. Suppressing miR-204 leads to loss of lymphatic vessels while endothelial overproduction of miR-204 accelerates lymphatic vessel formation, suggesting a critical positive role for this microRNA during developmental lymphangiogenesis. We also identify the NFATC1 transcription factor as a key miR-204 target in human and zebrafish, and show that NFATC1 suppression leads to lymphatic hyperplasia. The loss of lymphatics caused by miR-204 deficiency can be largely rescued by either endothelial autonomous expression of miR-204 or by suppression of NFATC1. Together, our results highlight a miR-204/NFATC1 molecular regulatory axis required for proper lymphatic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>miR-204</kwd><kwd>nfatc1</kwd><kwd>lymphangiogenesis</kwd><kwd>lymphatic vessel</kwd><kwd>lymphatic development</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA-HD008808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinstein</surname><given-names>Brant M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA-HD001011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinstein</surname><given-names>Brant M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lymphatic-enriched microRNA miR-204 is required for lymphatic development through its effects on the key lymphatic transcription factor NFATC1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lymphatic system is important for fluid and protein homeostasis, lipid transport, and immunity. Lymphatic malfunction is linked to many pathologies including lymphedema, cancer metastasis, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrova and Koh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venero Galanternik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alitalo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). Primitive lymphatic vessels are derived from lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) progenitors that transdifferentiate from venous blood endothelial cells (BECs) and subsequently migrate away from the veins to form lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabin, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koltowska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicenboim et al., 2015</xref>). A variety of factors have been identified that are required for proper regulation of lymphangiogenesis during development and disease, including PROX1, SOX18, COUPTFII, VEGFC/VEGFR3, NRP2, CCBE1, CLEC2, YAP/TAZ, and NFATC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wigle and Oliver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumont et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karkkainen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">François et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Srinivasan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uhrin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulkarni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sweet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2019</xref>). Some of our current knowledge regarding development of the lymphatic system has come from research using the zebrafish, a superb model for studying vertebrate organogenesis with optically clear, externally developing embryos ideal for high-resolution live imaging. The development of the zebrafish lymphatic vascular system is highly conserved and stereotyped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yaniv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okuda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Küchler et al., 2006</xref>), and the availability of transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorescent reporters in lymphatic endothelium makes it straightforward to monitor lymphatic development at the single cell level in vivo and visualize even subtle lymphatic defects using optimized high-resolution microscopy technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs are important posttranscriptional regulators that play crucial roles in developmental, physiological, and disease-related processes in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebert and MacRae, 2019</xref>). They are noncoding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotide long that guide Argonaute proteins for gene silencing by mRNA degradation and/or translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>). Targeting of microRNAs is accomplished by binding of the key nucleotides 2–8 (the ‘seed’ sequence) and additional microRNA sequences to complementary sequences in target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>). The majority of microRNA target sites are located in the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, although some microRNA targeting also occurs in 5’UTR and coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lytle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2013</xref>). MicroRNA regulatory networks are thought to confer robustness to biological processes by reinforcing transcription programs and attenuating aberrant transcripts by either switching off or fine-tuning gene expression, helping to buffer against random fluctuations in transcript copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Staton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2007</xref>). Although we know a great deal about the roles of protein-coding genes during lymphangiogenesis, we still have limited insight into how post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate lymphatic development. Profiling of microRNAs in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and blood endothelial cells (BECs) has identified BEC-specific microRNAs such as miR-31 and miR-181a that target Prox1 and prevent lymphatic specification in BECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leslie Pedrioli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazenwadel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunworth et al., 2014</xref>). These studies suggest some microRNAs can help BECs retain their identity by negatively regulating lymphatic development. Manipulation of endothelial microRNAs has also been shown to result in defective lymphatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kontarakis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Although these studies have begun to shed light on the role of microRNAs during lymphangiogenesis, our understanding of the role lymphatic microRNAs play during lymphatic vessel development is still limited.</p><p>Here, we characterize miR-204, a highly conserved lymphatic-enriched microRNA isolated via small RNA sequencing of human endothelial cells, and demonstrate its critical function during lymphangiogenesis in vivo using the zebrafish. MicroRNA-204-deficient zebrafish display severe defects in lymphatic vessel formation, while excess mir-204 expression in endothelium drives precocious lymphangiogenesis. We identify NFATC1 as a conserved miR-204 target in both human lymphatic endothelial cells and in the zebrafish, with loss of miR-204-mediated silencing resulting in increased NFATC1 transcript levels. As in mammalian lymphatics, attenuating nfatc1 in the zebrafish promotes abnormal lymphatic expansion, and suppressing nfatc1 rescues lymphatic development in mir-204-deficient zebrafish. Our results thus identify a miR-204/NFATC1 molecular pathway critical for lymphatic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>miR-204 is enriched in human and zebrafish lymphatic endothelial cells</title><p>We performed small RNA sequencing on human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and human blood endothelial cells (BEC) to identify microRNAs enriched in LECs compared to BECs. We used triplicate samples of total RNA isolated from human dermal lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dLy, representing LEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, representing BEC) for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Prior to sequencing, we used TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR to verify that HMVEC-dLy and HUVEC are enriched for markers representing lymphatic or blood vessel identity, respectively. We tested the expression of lymphatic vascular markers PROX1, FLT4 (also known as VEGFR3), and PDPN, and blood vascular markers NR2F2 (also known as COUP-TFII), KDR (also known as VEGFR2), CDH5 (also known as VE-Cadherin), and EGFL7. HMVEC-dLy express higher levels of PROX1, FLT4, and PDPN, while HUVEC showed enrichment for NR2F2, KDR, CDH5, and EGFL7, showing that these cell types appropriately express genes representative of lymphatic or blood vessel identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A total of ~10 million reads were collected for each RNAseq sample and the sequences were aligned using the miRbase v22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>). We excluded from further analysis any microRNAs that were represented by less than 10 reads in three or more of the six (two triplicate) sequenced samples, resulting in 445 annotated microRNAs. 98 of these microRNAs showed a significant difference between the LEC and BEC samples (p&lt;0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01). The normalized sequencing data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus repository with accession number GSE126679. From the 98 microRNAs we identified 30 that were highly enriched in LECs (fold change (FC) &gt;4) and 20 that were highly enriched in BECs (FC &gt;4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Using the TaqMan microRNA qPCR assay, we confirmed that miR-204–5 p is very highly enriched in LEC compared to BEC, in contrast to previously reported vascular microRNAs miR-126 and miR-31 that are more highly enriched in BEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46007.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of lymphatic microRNAs enriched in human and zebrafish lymphatic endothelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram of the workflow for small RNA sequencing from lymphatic (HMVEC-dLy) and blood (HUVEC) endothelial cells and selection of microRNAs enriched in lymphatic endothelial cells.

Knocking down microRNA function using MOs is an excellent targeting strategy for microRNAs because unlike protein-coding genes the functional products of microRNA genes are RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flynt et al., 2017</xref>). Four different MOs were designed to use different strategies to block mir-204 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The pan-204 MO targets the mature mir-204 sequence and knocks down all mir-204s. Precursor hairpin structures must be properly cleaved by Dicer to permit maturation of functional microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flynt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kloosterman et al., 2007</xref>). We designed specific MOs targeting the dicer-cleavage sites of <italic>mir-204–1</italic>, <italic>mir-204–2</italic>, and <italic>mir-204–3</italic>, respectively, to individually block the maturation of each of the three precursor mir-204 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Injection of 0.5 ng of pan-204 MO led to highly efficient suppression of mature mir-204 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). At the 0.5 ng dose there were no noticeable morphological anomalies, although slightly higher doses (0.75 ng) resulted in some pericardial edema, jaw defects, mild microcephaly and reduced eye development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). To avoid potential secondary effects on lymphatics caused by these other abnormalities, we used the 0.5 ng dose for all experiments with the pan-204 MO. At around 36 hpf, vascular ‘secondary sprouts’ emerge from the cardinal vein, migrate dorsally, pause half-way up the trunk, and then contribute to formation of the parachordal lines (an early transient lymphatic progenitor structure) along the horizontal myoseptum at 2–3 dpf. From 3–5 dpf dorsal and ventral sprouts emerge from the parachordals to give rise to trunk lymphatic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>), including the intersegmental lymphatic vessels, dorsal longitudinal lymphatic vessels (DLLV), and thoracic duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yaniv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, the secondary sprouts in wild type control animals migrated dorsally to the horizontal myoseptum, turned laterally, and formed the parachordal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Although initial secondary sprout formation and dorsal growth was normal in mir-204-deficient animals, secondary sprouts in these animals failed to stop at the horizontal myoseptum and form the parachordal line, but instead continued to grow dorsally and contributed to veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Examination of the parachordal line at three dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–h,m</xref>) showed that compared to control MO-injected animals that had parachordal lines in most somitic segments at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f,m</xref>), pan-204 MO-injected animals formed parachordals in only about 2 segments per 10 somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h,m</xref>). Similarly, examination of the thoracic duct at five dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i–l,n</xref>) showed that control MO-injected animals had a thoracic duct in virtually all segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,j,n</xref>) while mir-204-deficient animals displayed nearly complete loss of thoracic duct formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k,l,n</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46007.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Defective lymphangiogenesis in mir-204 deficient zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequence alignment of the three zebrafish precursor mir-204 sequences (<italic>mir-204–1, mir-204–2,</italic> and <italic>mir-204–3</italic>) and a schematic diagram showing four morpholinos (pan-204 MO, MO1, MO2, and MO3) targeting them.

The NFATC1 3′UTR was cloned downstream of a luciferase reporter and this plasmid DNA construct was co-transfected into HEK293 cells together with either miR-204 or (as a negative control) miR-126. Luciferase reporter activity was significantly suppressed in the presence of miR-204 but not in the presence of the miR-126 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). To confirm the specificity of NFATC1 miR-204 target site recognition, we mutated four nucleotides in the seed binding sequence of the NFATC1 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and demonstrated that this rendered the construct insensitive to suppression by miR-204 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), confirming that this binding site is critical for direct targeting.

In this study, we identified LEC-enriched microRNAs by comparing the small RNA profiles of human primary blood (HUVEC) or lymphatic (HMVEC-dLy) endothelial cells. Both of these cells have been previously well-validated as having representative blood endothelial cell (BEC) and or lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leslie Pedrioli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunworth et al., 2014</xref>), and we confirmed that they have appropriate differential expression of well-characterized markers of blood and lymphatic endothelial identity. The majority of the 30 highly significantly LEC-enriched microRNAs we identified were specific to mammals, with only seven microRNAs conserved in other vertebrate species. This suggests that most of these LEC microRNAs have diverged and/or evolved for mammalian-specific functions. The most highly LEC-enriched microRNA was miR-204, a microRNA with 100% sequence identity across a broad swath of vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), suggesting it plays an important conserved role during lymphatic development. In addition to miR-204 and a number of other newly identified LEC-enriched microRNAs, we also uncovered microRNAs such as miR-326, miR-139, miR-338, miR-148a, and miR-30d that had been previously reported to be LEC-enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leslie Pedrioli et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, miR-204 was not identified in the previous study by Pedrioli et al, despite its being the most highly enriched lymphatic microRNA in our study, while the most enriched LEC microRNA reported by Pedrioli et al, miR-95, was excluded from our analysis due to a low number of sequence reads. The reasons for the disparate results obtained from our data set and that of Pedrioli et al. are not clear, but they may reflect differences in the starting material for sequencing, the profiling methods used, or the bioinformatic tools and filters employed. We would note that out study used three biological replicates for both the LEC and BEC sequencing, and that we sequenced to a relatively high depth and applied very stringent filtering to our data set. Our FACS sorting data confirmed very strong enrichment of miR-204 in zebrafish lymphatic vs. blood endothelial cells. Although we were not able to detect this microRNA in zebrafish using previously reported whole mount in situ hybridization methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wienholds et al., 2005</xref>), detection of microRNAs in zebrafish using this method is difficult and frequently unsuccessful, especially for mid- or low-copy microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koshiol et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The remarkable evolutionary conservation of the miR-204 sequence throughout the vertebrates suggests that this microRNA likely plays an important conserved function. Indeed, our zebrafish findings show that suppression of mir-204 leads to strong defects in developmental lymphangiogenesis. Although the sequence of mature zebrafish mir-204 is identical to human miR-204, human miR-204 is encoded by only a single locus in intron 6 of the TRPM3 gene, while zebrafish mir-204 is encoded by three separate loci within the introns of the <italic>trpm3, trpm1a,</italic> and <italic>trpm1b</italic> genes. Interestingly, however, the mammalian <italic>TRPM1</italic> gene has a related microRNA encoded within a similar intron to zebrafish <italic>trpm1a</italic> and <italic>trpm1b,</italic> that may have evolved from mir-204. We demonstrated the essential role of miR-204 in developmental lymphangiogenesis using multiple complementary loss-of-function approaches, including (i) a ‘pan-204’ morpholino targeting the mature mir-204 sequence produced by all three zebrafish mir-204 loci, (ii) morpholinos individually targeting sequences required for the maturation of each of the three zebrafish mir-204’s (MO1, MO2, and MO3), and (iii) a CRISPR-Cas9-generated genetic mutant ablating the <italic>mir-204–1</italic> locus, which caused a lymphatic defect in combination with MO2 (targeting miR-204–2). Our results revealed that treatments that target at minimum <italic>mir-204–1</italic> and <italic>mir-204–2</italic> result in comparable dramatic loss-of-lymphatic phenotypes, including loss of the parachordal line at three dpf and loss of the thoracic duct and other trunk lymphatic vessels at five dpf.</p><p>Our endothelial-specific transgenic miR-204 expression experiments confirm the important role of miR-204 in lymphatic development in the zebrafish, and further indicate that this role reflects endothelial-autonomous function of this microRNA. Wild type animals injected with mrc1a:mir204-1-eGFP transgene display precocious thoracic duct development, as do germline transgenic animals carrying the transgene inserted into the genome. Importantly, the mrc1a:mir204-1-eGFP transgene also ‘rescues’ thoracic duct formation when introduced into miR-204–1<sup>-/-</sup> mutants injected with MO2 (targeting miR-204–2) that would otherwise lack lymphatics, demonstrating that re-introduction of miR-204 exclusively in the endothelium is sufficient to restore normal lymphatic development in miR-204-deficient animals. Despite all of these interlocking findings strongly arguing for a key role for miR-204 in lymphatic development, triple mutants disrupting all three zebrafish miR-204 loci do not display a significantly measurable lymphatic defect. Although the reasons for this are unclear, there is precedent in the literature for zebrafish microRNA mutants failing to exhibit the full phenotypes noted in microRNA knockdown studies. Suppression of the evolutionarily conserved endothelial-enriched microRNA mir-126 causes blood vessels defects in mir-126 morpholino-injected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fish et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zou et al., 2011</xref>), although lower dose morpholino injections cause mainly lymphatic defects with relatively minor effects on blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, mir-126 mutant zebrafish also lack the vascular phenotype described in the previous morpholino studies and display only the defects in lymphatic vessel development seen with partial knockdowns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kontarakis et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting compensation may be taking place in miR-126 mutants.</p><p>In addition to uncovering an important function for miR-204, our study also identified a key downstream target of miR-204 regulation during lymphangiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) protein family member NFATC1 is important for lymphatic vessel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norrmén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulkarni et al., 2009</xref>). Nfatc1 is co-expressed with Prox1-, Vegfr3-, and Pdpn-positive LEC progenitors originating from the cardinal vein indicating their potential involvement in lymphatic specification, and Nfatc1 null mice develop lymphatic hyperplasia suggesting a role in lymphatic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norrmén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulkarni et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with these previous data, we showed that nfatc1 mutation, nfatc1 knockdown, or pharmacologically blocking nfatc1 activity results in similar lymphatic enlargement in the zebrafish. We identified NFATC1 as a probable miR-204 target based on conserved miR-204 binding sites in the 3’ UTRs of both human and zebrafish NFATC1 transcripts and the expression of NFATC1 was suppressed by miR-204 mimic and increased by miR-204 antagomir in human LECs. We were able to verify targeting of the NFATC1 3’ UTR by miR-204 using firefly/renilla dual luciferase NFATC1 3’ UTR reporter assays, and demonstrate up-regulation of zebrafish nfatc1 upon mir-204 knockdown, confirming that miR-204 suppresses NFATC1 levels in vivo. Finally, we showed that knocking down nfatc1 could rescue lymphatic development in mir-204-deficient zebrafish, suggesting that balanced expression of mir-204 and nfatc1 is critical for proper developmental lymphangiogenesis.</p><p>Since microRNAs often regulate many targets, and miR-204 does have potential target binding sites in other genes, further investigation will be required to characterize some of these additional genes and determine whether some of the lymphatic effects of miR-204 are mediated via regulation of other targets in addition to nfatc1. Nevertheless, since (i) NFATC1 has already been shown to play an important role in lymphangiogenesis in mammals, (ii) suppression of nfatc1 in the zebrafish causes lymphatic hyperplasia, and (iii) nfatc1 knockdown effectively rescues the effects of miR-204 knockdown, our results suggest that nfatc1 is a major, key downstream target regulated by miR-204 in developing lymphatic endothelial cells.</p><p>In summary, our work establishes an important role for miR-204 in regulating lymphatic vascular network formation during embryonic development via modulation of its conserved target NFATC1. Our findings provide important new insight into the role of lymphatic-enriched microRNAs during developmental lymphangiogenesis, and by unveiling microRNA-regulated pathways provide new opportunities to understand lymphatic development and associated disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(mrc1a:eGFP<sup>y251</sup>;

Specifically, more expression analyses and better genetic evidence are required.

A stable Nfatc1 mutant instead of a morphant or CsA treatment would be a key control that is also essential. Double-knockout of mir-204-2 and mir-204-3 is also required to demonstrate the indispensable roles of mir-204.

This is because it is still challenging to analyze phenotypes and investigate molecular mechanisms in miRNA-deficient model organisms. In this study, the authors successfully uncovered lymphatic-enriched miRNAs by small RNA sequencing analysis. In addition, they found interesting lymphatic phenotypes in the miR-204-deficient zebrafish and unveiled a target transcriptional factor regulated by miR-204, NFATC1. With this data and their pipeline for validating the functionality of lymphatic-enriched miRNAs, this study is expected to contribute to follow-up studies to determine post-transcriptional mechanisms in lymphatic vessel formation.</p><p>However, the role of miR-204 in lymphatic vessel formation is not yet conclusive and requires further clarification and investigation. It is still uncertain whether miR-204/NFATC1 interaction contributes to lymphatic vessel formation or patterning. Furthermore, how the expression of miR-204 is regulated during lymphatic vessel development needs to be investigated.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, how is the expression of miR-204 being regulated during lymphatic vessel development? Is miR-204 always highly expressed in developing lymphatic endothelial cells (i.e. zebrafish lymphatic endothelial cells at 5dpf) and mature lymphatic endothelial cells (i.e. HMVEC-dLy), or is it dynamically regulated in a time-dependent manner?</p><p>2) In Figure 2C, what is the authors' opinion on the cause of different phenotypes depending on the dose of morpholinos?</p><p>3) It is still uncertain whether miR-204/NFATC1 molecular pathway contributes to lymphatic vessel formation or patterning. In Figure 2E-N, Figure 3 and Figure 4, authors showed that miR-204 contributes to lymphatic vessel formation by loss-of and gain-of-function experiments. On the other hand, in Figure 6, nfatc1 seems to be required for lymphatic vessel patterning, not lymphatic vessel formation. According to the references the authors provided (Norrmen et al., 2009, Kulkarni et al., 2009), nfatc1 in mice also plays roles in lymphatic vessel patterning, not lymphatic vessel formation. Overall, miR-204 seems to work not only with nfatc1 signaling pathway but also with other signaling pathways, especially in lymphatic vessel formation. The authors need to clarify this issue.</p><p>4) In line with comment 3, in Figure 7, it is unclear how deficient 'lymphatic vessel formation' by Pan-204 MO could be rescued by 'lymphatic enlargement' induced by nfatc1 MO. Careful analysis is required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Jung et al. identify miR-204 as highly expressed in cultured human LECs and in sorted populations of early developing LECs from the zebrafish. They go on to show that morpholino knockdown of the 3 different mir-204 transcripts (from 3 genes) can lead to a loss of lymphatic vessel development. Importantly, they generate a miR-204-1 mutant animal and show that some combinations of MOs injected into this mutant can lead to a phenotype specific to the mutant embryos. They go onto identify NFATC1 as a possible target of miR-204 and to suggest a mechanism whereby miR-204 functions to suppress NFATC1 expression and that NFATC1 is itself a negative regulator of lymphatic vessel size.</p><p>While the work is interesting and may offer up an unexpected new mechanism controlling lymphatic development. There are several questions remaining and loose ends that should be better completed to give more confidence in the central findings.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) miR-204 has been previously analysed in zebrafish and medaka and prominent expression reported in epithelia and the eye (retinal epithelia and lens). In these previous studies using LNA in situ hybridisation (Conte et al., 2010, Weinholds et al., 2005) there was no indication of vascular expression. The authors should provide evidence with a similar approach that miR-204 is expressed autonomously in intact embryos in the vasculature.</p><p>It is possible that the function of miR-204 may be non-autonomous in the current report and so at least showing in situ expression in tissues would improve confidence in the current data.</p><p>2) The paper relies heavily on the use of MO knockdown which has become increasingly controversial in the zebrafish field. Having one mutant in miR-204-1 is welcome and does improve confidence. However, while this reviewer appreciates that asking for triple mutants is perhaps too much, there are some inconsistencies that are concerning. For example, MO1 + MO2 gives a loss of lymphatics but the mutant for 204-1 + MO2 does not. How can this be explained? Can additional evidence such as transient CRISPR for 204-2 or -3 in the miR-204-1 mutant or similar be provided to further improve confidence in these data with multiple overlapping approaches?</p><p>3). The analysis of phenotype is very superficial. Is specification of LECs impacted? Is LEC cell number at the parachordal line or thoracic duct quantitatively reduced? Is there signalling induced downstream of Vegf-c and Vegf-r3? Eg. pERK such as shown in Shin et al., 2016.</p><p>Along the same lines the phenotypic analysis of the overexpression transgenic for miR-204 and in the NFATC1 vessels should include cell number counts for LECs. This is important as scoring vessel area in 2D images could indicate increased LECs or increased vessel dilation (more luminal content). The NFATC1 mutant could be a fluid imbalance phenotype and unrelated to the miR-204 overexpression phenotype or miR-204 mutant/MO phenotype without further more careful phenotypic analysis.</p><p>4). The overexpression of miR-204 gives premature thoracic duct development but the embryo shown looks older than the control (increased distance between DA and PCV). The experiment is also under-controlled. Please provide analysis of markers of other tissues to control for staging differences (eg. rag1 expression in thymus is a useful marker that comes on progressively from around 2.5 dpf). Please also show how much the endothelial levels of miR-204 are increased in the transgenic – miRNA's are typically highly expressed and Figure 1 suggests very high levels of miR-204 already in LECs, so why would one expect such a phenotype upon over-expression?</p><p>5) Is NFATC1 expressed in LECs and the PCV in zebrafish by ISH? Is the expression increased upon progressive loss of miR-204 in the mutants and MO scenarios?</p><p>6) The analysis of NFATC1 phenotype to correlate with miR-204 phenotypes relies exclusively upon MO knockdown and the use of CsA, an inhibitor commonly considered to have broad impact on embryos. Unlike the miR targeting, where it is difficult to expect generation of triple mutants, analysis of a stable NFATC1 mutant does not seem an unreasonable thing to ask for. It is likely that a mutant may be available already. The authors should provide more confidence in their increased lymphangiogenesis phenotype upon NFATC1 loss of function by including the analysis of a mutant strain. Alternatively (or additionally), they could consider targeting the miR-binding site in the 3'UTR to definitively demonstrate their mechanism.</p><p>7) The honing in on NFATC1 as a target came without explanation of how many miR-204 targets are predicted in vasculature. Providing additional bioinformatic prediction would improve the study. How many LEC transcripts have predicted miR-204 target sites? Is this statistically enriched over other cell types? How does NFATC1 rank as a predicted target taking into account the number of predicted sites, homology etc?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Jung HM, et al. report a potential mir-204-dependent regulation of lymphatic vessel (LV) growth through NFATC1. First, the authors identified mir-204 as a lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)-enriched miRNA compared to vascular endothelial cells (VECs). There were three mir-204 in zebrafish: mir-204-1, (in the intron of 5 of trpm3), mir-204-2 (in the intron of trp1ma), and mir-204-3 (in the intron of 4 of trp1mb). They demonstrated the requirement of miR-204 in lymphatic vessel development by using mir-204-1 mutants treated with both mir-204-2 and -3 morpholinos and mir-204-1, -2, -3 morphants (total morphants). Furthermore, NFATC1 was reported to be a potential target of mir-204, because the transcription of nfatc1 was increased in the mir-204 total morphants and was decreased in the reporter assay using mir-204. They also demonstrated the potential involvement of NFATC1 in LV growth by showing nfatc1 morphants and a calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A. The hierarchical gene regulation between mir-204 and nfatc1 for LV development was validated by the restoration of LV impairment found in mir-204 morphants in the mir-204 morphants treated with nfatc1 morpholinos.</p><p>This study is well organized and written in a logical manner. There are still several points that should be addressed to support their claim.</p><p>1) It is unclear why the authors need to compare zebrafish and human? The conservation of mir-204-dependent regulation of NFATC1 among zebrafish and human might be interesting: however, the authors could identify mir-201 using mir-RNAs from the <italic>Tg(mrc1a:eGFP)<sup>y251</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg(kdrl:mCherry)<sup>y171</sup></italic> as shown in Figure 1F. Because the importance of mir-204 in zebrafish is focused in this study, the list of mir using the mir from the FACS-sorted cells should be used as an initial material. The authors might do this experiment easily using their Tg fish.</p><p>The result shown in Figure 1A, B, C should become Figure supplement.</p><p>2) In addition to #1, time course of mir expression should be demonstrated at least at two points when the secondary sprout starts and when thoracic duct formation is completed. The authors merely showed the expression of mir-204 in the zebrafish embryos at 5 dpf.</p><p>3) The requirement of mir-204 is partially proven in this study. As the authors explained in Figure 3, they need to do the similar experiments using mir-204-<sup>2 -/-</sup> + MO1, 3 and mir-204-3 <sup>-/-</sup> + MO1, 2. It is not so difficult to complete these experiments by establishing mir-204-2 mutant and mir-204-3 mutant. They describe the detail of mir-204-2 and mir-204-3 in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>4) The potential target of mir-204 is not described well. The authors described this in the Discussion. The reason why Nfatc1 was picked up is not clearly described in the present manuscript. The authors examined Nfatc1 following the prediction of RNA22 database. There are several microRNA target databases beside RNA22. Thus, targets expected in other database should be examined as a negative control.</p><p>5) To more precisely show the hierarchical regulation of mir-204 and nfatc1, the authors can examine the expression of nfatc1 using FACS-sorted LECs of <italic>Tg8mrc1a:eGFP)<sup>y251</sup></italic> total morphants (mir-204-1, -2,-3 morphants).</p><p>6) It is unclear whether secondary sprout is affected in mir-204 deficient embryos. Although there are no parachordal lines in the scheme of Figure 7L, there is no evidence of impairment of secondary sprout followed by parachordal line development in the present study. Although the authors focused on thoracic duct formation, prior to this, secondary sprout and parachordal lines could be analyzed. No description in Figure 3.</p><p>7) The authors mentioned &quot;lymphatic specification&quot; in Discussion. They can interpret their data when carefully examine the effect of depletion of mir-204 and nfatc1 on secondary sprout and subsequent parachordal lines.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46007.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comments of all three reviewers are in good agreement.

That is, combined targeting of miR-204-1 and miR-204-2 gives a lymphatic phenotype, but combined targeting of miR-204-1 and miR-204-3 does not, regardless of whether a mutant or a morpholino is used to target miR204-1. The symmetry of these results again supports a specific role for miR-204 in lymphatic development. Perform miR-204 transplant/transgene mosaic knockdown and “rescue” experiments to validate and examine their endothelial- cell specific phenotypes</p><p>As promised, we carried out experiments demonstrating that endothelial-specific expression of miR-2041 “rescues” the lymphatic defects in miR-204-1<sup>-/-</sup> mutants injected with a morpholino blocking maturation of miR-204-2 (Figure 4E-K). These new data strongly confirm that the lymphatic phenotype of miR-204deficient animals is due to loss of endothelial miR-204 function, and that miR-204 is required autonomously in the endothelium for generating lymphatics. We also now show that endothelial-specific mosaic expression of miR-204-1 in wild-type animals causes precocious thoracic duct development (Figure 4A-D), further confirming that this phenotype can manifest itself in an endothelial-autonomous manner in otherwise normally developing animals.</p><p>Examine early stages of lymphatic development in miR-204-deficient animals</p><p>As further promised, we carried out time-lapse imaging of “secondary sprouts” (early pre-lymphatic sprouts that emerge from the cardinal vein) to examine whether initial specification and sprouting is defective, or later patterning and growth. Our results show that secondary sprouts in miR-204 deficient animals emerge and grow up to the level of the horizontal myoseptum normally. However, while secondary sprouts in control animals stop at the myoseptum, turn laterally, and form the parachordal lines (Figure 2C), secondary sprouts in miR-204 deficient animals fail to stop at the level of the myoseptum but continue growing dorsally, in many cases eventually contributing to the venous circulation (Figure 2D, Figure 2—video 1, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We would note that we have not observed this unusual and unique phenotype in any of our previous studies where we functionally manipulated genes important for lymphatic development in the zebrafish.</p><p>Analyze NFATC mutants</p><p>As also promised, we generated and analyzed CRISPR mutants in <italic>nfatc1</italic>, including a frameshift mutation creating a premature stop codon (Figure 6F). Our new <italic>nfatc1</italic><sup>△</sup><italic><sup>8/</sup></italic><sup>△</sup><italic><sup>8</sup> </italic>mutants exhibit the same enlarged thoracic duct phenotype (Figure 6G-K) observed in animals injected with nfatc1 splice-blocking morpholinos (Figure 6A-E). Furthermore, we have also analyzed the phenotypes of animals injected with a separate nfatc1 translation-blocking (ATG) morpholino, and this second morpholino also gives the same enlarged thoracic duct phenotype observed in nfatc1 splice-blocking morphants (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-E). Thus, the new nfatc1 mutant and nfatc1 ATG morphants phenocopy the lymphatic phenotypes we noted previously in animals injected with splice blocking morpholino (Figure 6) or treated with cyclosporine A (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F-J).</p><p>Explain our focus on NFATC as a key miR-204 target</p><p>As also promised, we have added an explanation to our Results section detailing the reasons for our focus on NFATC as a key miR-204 target. As we write:</p><p>“Based on our observation that miR-204 plays role during lymphatic development, we began our search for potential important target genes by (i) starting with a list of human genes previously implicated in lymphatic development, then (ii) bioinformatically identifying which genes in this set had potential miR204 target sites using TargetScan, and then (iii) bioinformatically identifying which of these genes also had corresponding zebrafish orthologs with potential miR-204 target sites (in order to ensure that we were looking at key, conserved targets that we could functionally study in both human cell culture and in zebrafish (Supplementary file 1). The Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 (NFATC1) gene immediately came to our attention as a strong candidate.”</p><p>As we noted previously, we recognize of course that microRNAs can have hundreds of potential targets, and our original goal in testing nfatc1 had been mainly to validate that miR-204 did indeed target and regulate at least one gene important for lymphatic development. It was a bit of a surprise to us that nfatc1 knockdown (or mutants) gave us a nice lymphatic phenotype, and a big (but very gratifying!) surprise that we could so effectively rescue miR-204 deficiency by knocking down nfatc1.</p><p>Analyze mir-204 mutants</p><p>As promised, we generated and analyzed miR-204 triple mutants (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Generating triple mutants was very challenging given the extremely limited genomic targets available for disrupting the microRNAs, but we succeeded in generating animals with CRISPR mutants deleting all or part of the seed sequences at the miR-204-1, miR-204-2, and miR-204-3 loci (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). Homozygous triple mutant animals lack detectable expression of qPCR-amplifiable mature miR-204 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C), but they do not exhibit a quantifiably significant loss of thoracic duct formation (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D). The latter result was unexpected, but for reasons detailed below involving a large amount of other newly generated data in this revision, our findings strongly suggest that miR-204 function is indeed regulating lymphatic development and that an unknown compensatory mechanism limits the phenotype in our triple mutants.</p><p>Newly generated data in this revision supporting a lymphatic role for miR-204 include:</p><p>i) Combined loss of miR-204-1 and miR-204-2 (but not miR-204-1 and miR-204-3) results in identical lymphatic phenotypes regardless of whether miR-204-1 is being knocked down using a morpholino (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) or eliminated using a genetic mutant (Figure 3). Our new findings using the miR204-1 mutant injected with either miR-204-2 or miR-204-3 morpholinos (Figure 3) replicate and fully confirm our previous morpholino-only results (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) showing that miR-204-3 is dispensable.</p><p>ii) The loss-of-lymphatic phenotype of miR-204-1<sup>-/-</sup> mutants injected with miR-204-2 morpholinos is “rescued” by endothelial-specific expression of miR-204-1 (Figure 4E-K). These new data strongly confirm that the lymphatic phenotype of miR-204-deficient animals is due to loss of endothelial miR-204 function, and that miR-204 is required autonomously in the endothelium for generating lymphatics. These data further support our results indicating that the phenotype is not due to nonspecific morpholino effects.</p><p>iii) miR-204-deficient animals do not have a defect in either the formation or the initial growth of the secondary sprouts derived from the cardinal vein. Secondary sprouts in these animals fail to halt at the horizontal myoseptum and form the parachordal line as they do in control animals (Figure 2C), but instead continue to grow dorsally and in many cases contribute to veins (Figure 2D; Figure 2—video 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The unusual phenotype of abnormal ongoing dorsal growth of secondary sprouts, together with the otherwise normal overall development of miR-204 deficient animals, suggests that failure to form the parachordal and subsequently thoracic duct is not a result of nonspecific developmental problems in these animals. The abnormal secondary sprout growth and patterning phenotype we have now demonstrated in miR-204 deficient animals is a unique phenotype that we have not observed in the many other lymphatic-defective mutants and morphants we have examined over the years.</p><p>We would note again that knockdown with the single pan-204 morpholino targeting all mature miR-204 sequences or knockdown with a combination of two distinct morpholinos blocking maturation of miR204-1 and miR-204-2 (but not miR-204-3) gives the same very unique lymphatic phenotype described in iii) above.</p><p>There is precedent in the literature for zebrafish microRNA mutants failing to exhibit the full phenotypes noted in microRNA knockdown studies. Suppression of the evolutionarily conserved endothelial-enriched microRNA mir-126 causes blood vessel defects in mir-126 morpholino-injected animals (Fish et al., 2008) Zou et al., 2011), although lower dose morpholino injections cause mainly lymphatic defects with relatively minor effects on blood vessels (Chen et al., 2016). Interestingly, mir-126 mutant zebrafish also lack the vascular phenotype described in the previous morpholino studies and display only the defects in lymphatic vessel development seen with partial knockdowns (Kontarakis et al., 2018), suggesting some compensation may be taking place in miR-126 mutants.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] However, the role of miR-204 in lymphatic vessel formation is not yet conclusive and requires further clarification and investigation. It is still uncertain whether miR-204/NFATC1 interaction contributes to lymphatic vessel formation or patterning. Furthermore, how the expression of miR-204 is regulated during lymphatic vessel development needs to be investigated.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, how is the expression of miR-204 being regulated during lymphatic vessel development? Is miR-204 always highly expressed in developing lymphatic endothelial cells (i.e. zebrafish lymphatic endothelial cells at 5dpf) and mature lymphatic endothelial cells (i.e. HMVEC-dLy), or is it dynamically regulated in a time-dependent manner?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, we observed high levels of miR-204 expression in both developing zebrafish lymphatics (Figure 1F) and in mature human endothelial cells (Figure 1C), suggesting that miR-204 is maintained at high levels from initial lymphatic development. The mechanisms responsible for establishing the lymphatic vs. blood endothelial expression of miR-204 would certainly be a topic of great interest for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2C, what is the authors' opinion on the cause of different phenotypes depending on the dose of morpholinos?</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid potential off-target effects from morpholino injections we conducted careful dose response curves to select doses that do not generate obvious gross morphological or other abnormalities. At the 0.5 ng Pan-204 MO dose we detect no noticeable non-vascular abnormalities, while at the higher 0.75 ng dose we see additional effects including smaller eyes, pericardial edema, and craniofacial deformation. While these phenotypes may be associated with reduced miR-204 function, we decided to use the 0.5 ng to avoid potential secondary effects on lymphatics caused by these other abnormalities. This panel was moved to Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is still uncertain whether miR-204/NFATC1 molecular pathway contributes to lymphatic vessel formation or patterning. In Figure 2E-N, Figure 3 and Figure 4, authors showed that miR-204 contributes to lymphatic vessel formation by loss-of and gain-of-function experiments. On the other hand, in Figure 6, nfatc1 seems to be required for lymphatic vessel patterning, not lymphatic vessel formation. According to the references the authors provided (Norrmen et al., 2009, Kulkarni et al., 2009), nfatc1 in mice also plays roles in lymphatic vessel patterning, not lymphatic vessel formation. Overall, miR-204 seems to work not only with nfatc1 signaling pathway but also with other signaling pathways, especially in lymphatic vessel formation. The authors need to clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this and other comments we carried out additional experiments to provide more information on how suppressing the miR-204 pathway is interfering with proper lymphatic vascular development. As noted above, we carried out time-lapse imaging of “secondary sprouts,” early prelymphatic sprouts that emerge from the cardinal vein. Our results show that secondary sprouts initially form normally in miR-204 deficient animals and grow normally up to the level of the horizontal myoseptum. However, while secondary sprouts in control animals stop at the myoseptum, turn laterally, and form the parachordal lines (Figure 2C), secondary sprouts in miR-204 deficient animals fail to stop at the level of the myoseptum but continue growing dorsally, in many cases eventually contributing to the venous circulation (Figure 2D, Figure 2—video 1, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). As also noted above, while nfatc1 axis is not the only gene downstream from miR204, knocking down nfatc1 in the mir-204-deficient animals successfully rescues the lymphatic phenotype. This result suggests that nfatc1 pathway is at least a major important downstream target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In line with comment 3, in Figure 7, it is unclear how deficient 'lymphatic vessel formation' by Pan-204 MO could be rescued by 'lymphatic enlargement' induced by nfatc1 MO. Careful analysis is required.</p></disp-quote><p>From our data it appears that increased levels of NFATC1 (in miR-204-deficient animals) lead to failure of secondary sprouts to form parachordals and subsequently lymphatics, while reduced NFATC1 leads to lymphatic enlargement. The relationship between these phenotypes is indeed unclear – they may reflect differential engagement of the same or different downstream pathways. Clearly understanding the molecular pathways and cellular processes activated or suppressed by too little or too much NFATC1 will be a very interesting area for future research investigation, but this is beyond the scope of the present study, which already goes from an unbiased in vitro screen identifying lymphatic microRNAs, to identification of a functionally important microRNA, to the identification and initial functional study of a key target for this microRNA.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Major issues:</p><p>1) miR-204 has been previously analysed in zebrafish and medaka and prominent expression reported in epithelia and the eye (retinal epithelia and lens). In these previous studies using LNA in situ hybridisation (Conte et al. 2010, Weinholds et al., 2005 paper) there was no indication of vascular expression. The authors should provide evidence with a similar approach that miR-204 is expressed autonomously in intact embryos in the vasculature.</p><p>It is possible that the function of miR-204 may be non-autonomous in the current report and so at least showing in situ expression in tissues would improve confidence in the current data.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this and other reviewer comments, we have now carried out additional experiments that show that endothelial cell-autonomous expression of mir-204 “rescues” the lymphatic defects in miR-204-1<sup>-/-</sup> mutants injected with a morpholino blocking maturation of miR-204-2 (Figure 4E-K), and causes precocious thoracic duct development in wild type animals (Figure 4A-D). These new data strongly confirm that miR-204 function is required autonomously in the endothelium for lymphatic development.</p><p>We attempted LNA in situ for miR-204 but the sensitivity in our experiments was not sufficient to detect vascular expression, unlike the eye where miR-204 is more highly expressed. LNA in situ hybridization is an excellent method for detecting highly abundant transcripts, but very challenging and not always successful for relatively low copy number transcripts, particularly when dealing with small RNAs where options for design of the probe are extremely limited. However, our qPCR on the FACS-sorted arterial, venous, and lymphatic endothelial cells from transgenic zebrafish shows that miR-204 is highly enriched in the lymphatic endothelial cell population (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The paper relies heavily on the use of MO knockdown which has become increasingly controversial in the zebrafish field. Having one mutant in miR-204-1 is welcome and does improve confidence. However, while this reviewer appreciates that asking for triple mutants is perhaps too much, there are some inconsistencies that are concerning. For example, MO1 + MO2 gives a loss of lymphatics but the mutant for 204-1 + MO2 does not. How can this be explained? Can additional evidence such as transient CRISPR for 204-2 or -3 in the miR-204-1 mutant or similar be provided to further improve confidence in these data with multiple overlapping approaches?</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out a variety of additional experiments for this revision to further substantiate the important role of miR-204 in lymphatic development (as also discussed in detail above), including showing that a mutant for 204-1 + MO2 gives the same loss of lymphatics phenotype as MO1 + MO2:</p><p>We now show that combined targeting of miR-204-1 and miR-204-2 gives a lymphatic phenotype but combined targeting of miR-204-1 and miR-204-3 does not, regardless of whether miR-204-1 is targeted using a mutant or a morpholino (Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 3). Although in our original submission we targeted both miR-204-2 and miR-204-3 together with morpholinos in the miR204-1 mutant, we had not actually previously done the experiment noted above by the reviewer of targeting only miR-204-2 with a morpholino in the miR-204-1 mutant.</p><p>We now show that transgenic endothelial-specific expression of miR-204 can both rescue the lymphatic defect in mir-204 deficient animals (Figure 4E-K) and cause precocious thoracic duct development in wild type animals (Figure 4A-D).</p><p>We now show that miR-204 deficient animals have a striking and unusual phenotype of misdirected secondary sprouts that fail to stop at the horizontal myoseptum to form the pre-lymphatic parachordal line (Figure 2C), but instead continue to grow dorsally and in many cases contribute to veins (Figure 2D; Figure 2—video 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3). The analysis of phenotype is very superficial. Is specification of LECs impacted? Is LEC cell number at the parachordal line or thoracic duct quantitatively reduced? Is there signalling induced downstream of Vegf-c and Vegf-r3? Eg. pERK such as shown in Shin et al., 2016.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to these and other comments, we have carried out a more detailed analysis of the miR204 deficient phenotype, showing that secondary sprouts form and grow to the horizontal myoseptum as in wild type animals, but instead of forming the pre-lymphatic parachordal line at the horizontal myoseptum they continue to grow dorsally and at least some contribute to veins (Figure 2C, D; Figure 2—video 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 1). While a more detailed molecular characterization of the role of miR-204 would be of interest for future studies, we believe it is beyond the scope of the present study, which already goes from an unbiased in vitro screen identifying lymphatic microRNAs to identification of a functionally important microRNA, to the identification and functional validation of a key target for this microRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines the phenotypic analysis of the overexpression transgenic for miR-204 and in the NFATC1 vessels should include cell number counts for LECs. This is important as scoring vessel area in 2D images could indicate increased LECs or increased vessel dilation (more luminal content). The NFATC1 mutant could be a fluid imbalance phenotype and unrelated to the miR-204 overexpression phenotype or miR-204 mutant/MO phenotype without further more careful phenotypic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not observed an increase in the number of LEC in the thoracic ducts of nfatc1-deficient animals using counts of endothelial cell nuclei. The reason for the lymphatic hyperplasia phenotype (also noted in mice) remains unclear at this point, but we have not observed defects in flow through the thoracic duct in preliminary lymphatic drainage experiments (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4). The overexpression of miR-204 gives premature thoracic duct development but the embryo shown looks older than the control (increased distance between DA and PCV). The experiment is also under-controlled. Please provide analysis of markers of other tissues to control for staging differences (eg. rag1 expression in thymus is a useful marker that comes on progressively from around 2.5 dpf). Please also show how much the endothelial levels of miR-204 are increased in the transgenic – miRNA's are typically highly expressed and Figure one suggests very high levels of miR-204 already in LECs, so why would one expect such a phenotype upon over-expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully repeated the miR-204 germline transgenic overexpression experiment together with measurement of the distance between DA and PCV, and observed precocious thoracic duct formation without change in the DA/PCV distance (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We measured an approximately 2-fold increase in miR-204 levels in these germline transgenic animals (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>To address this question experimentally in another and perhaps more direct way, we also showed that mosaic endothelial-specific expression of miR-204 in otherwise wild type, normally-developing animals also leads to precocious thoracic duct formation (Figure 4A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is NFATC1 expressed in LECs and the PCV in zebrafish by ISH? Is the expression increased upon progressive loss of miR-204 in the mutants and MO scenarios?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous reports have noted nfatc1 expression in the endothelium in various species including zebrafish (e.g. Coxam et al., Cell Reports 7:623, 2014), and we and others have shown that NFATC1 is differentially expressed at higher levels in LEC. We show that miR-204 mimic decreases and miR-204 inhibitor increases NFATC1 expression in HUVEC in vitro(Figure 5C) and that miR-204 deficient zebrafish have increasedin vivonfatc1 expression (Figure 5F), clearly demonstrate that NFATC1 is a target of miR-204 regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The analysis of NFATC1 phenotype to correlate with miR-204 phenotypes relies exclusively upon MO knockdown and the use of CsA, an inhibitor commonly considered to have broad impact on embryos. Unlike the miR targeting, where it is difficult to expect generation of triple mutants, analysis of a stable NFATC1 mutant does not seem an unreasonable thing to ask for. It is likely that a mutant may be available already. The authors should provide more confidence in their increased lymphangiogenesis phenotype upon NFATC1 loss of function by including the analysis of a mutant strain. Alternatively (or additionally), they could consider targeting the miR-binding site in the 3'UTR to definitively demonstrate their mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this and other reviewer comments, we now demonstrate that <underline>two</underline> separate nfatc1 morpholinos, cyclosporine treatment targeting NFAT signaling, <underline>and</underline> a newly generated nfatc1 mutant all result in the same lymphatic enlargement phenotype (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The honing in on NFATC1 as a target came without explanation of how many miR-204 targets are predicted in vasculature. Providing additional bioinformatic prediction would improve the study. How many LEC transcripts have predicted miR-204 target sites? Is this statistically enriched over other cell types? How does NFATC1 rank as a predicted target taking into account the number of predicted sites, homology etc?</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a detailed response to this comment in the “Explain our focus on NFATC as a key miR-204 target” section (under “New experimental data provided for revision”) above. As we noted previously, we recognize of course that microRNAs can have hundreds of potential targets, and our original goal in testing nfatc1 had been just to validate that miR-204 did indeed target and regulate at least one gene known to be important for lymphatic development. It was a bit of a surprise to us that nfatc1 knockdown or mutants gave us a nice lymphatic phenotype, and a big surprise that we could so effectively rescue miR-204 deficiency by knocking down nfatc1.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] This study is well organized and written in a logical manner. There are still several points that should be addressed to support their claim.</p><p>1) It is unclear why the authors need to compare zebrafish and human? The conservation of mir-204-dependent regulation of NFATC1 among zebrafish and human might be interesting: however, the authors could identify mir-201 using mir-RNAs from the Tg(mrc1a:eGFP)<sup>y251</sup> and Tg(kdrl:mCherry)<sup>y171</sup> as shown in Figure 1F. Because the importance of mir-204 in zebrafish is focused in this study, the list of mir using the mir from the FACS-sorted cells should be used as an initial material. The authors might do this experiment easily using their Tg fish.</p><p>The result shown in Figure 1A, B, C should become Figure supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We used both human and zebrafish models for several reasons, but mainly (i) to ensure that we were looking at important evolutionarily conserved microRNA regulators of lymphatic development, and (ii) to provide complementary in vitroand in vivo models enabling a full range of experimental paradigms to be employed. We began by carrying out the small RNAseq using human cells mainly for technical reasons (eg, obtaining ample starting material for preparation of highly representative and replicated sequencing libraries), but also to permit comparison to previous screens carried out using human cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition to #1, time course of mir expression should be demonstrated at least at two points when the secondary sprout starts and when thoracic duct formation is completed. The authors merely showed the expression of mir-204 in the zebrafish embryos at 5 dpf.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not technically possible to obtain sorted lymphatic/lymphatic progenitor cells from our double transgenic animals at early stages when secondary sprouting begins – there are extremely few lymphatic progenitor cells at this stage to begin with and these cells are not yet “single labeled” with only GFP, so they cannot be sorted out as a separate population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The requirement of mir-204 is partially proven in this study. As the authors explained in Figure 3, they need to do the similar experiments using mir-204-2 <sup>-/-</sup> + MO1, 3 and mir-204-3 <sup>-/-</sup> + MO1, 2. It is not so difficult to complete these experiments by establishing mir-204-2 mutant and mir-204-3 mutant. They describe the detail of mir-204-2 and mir-204-3 in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in the “Analyze mir-204 mutants” section (under “New experimental data provided for revision”) above, we have added a large amount of new data reinforcing our conclusion that miR-204 is required cell-autonomously for proper lymphatic development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The potential target of mir-204 is not described well. The authors described this in the Discussion. The reason why Nfatc1 was picked up is not clearly described in the present manuscript. The authors examined Nfatc1 following the prediction of RNA22 database. There are several microRNA target databases beside RNA22. Thus, targets expected in other database should be examined as a negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the “Explain our focus on NFATC as a key miR-204 target” section (under “New experimental data provided for revision”) above, where we provide a more complete explanation of how and why we selected NFATC1 for further analysis. Again, our original intent was merely to demonstrate that miR-204 modulated a factor previously shown to be important for lymphatic development. The nfatc1 morphant/mutant phenotypes and especially the successful rescue of miR-204 deficient animals by inhibiting nfatc1 expression were welcome surprises!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To more precisely show the hierarchical regulation of mir-204 and nfatc1, the authors can examine the expression of nfatc1 using FACS-sorted LECs of Tg8mrc1a:eGFP)<sup>y251</sup> total morphants (mir-204-1, -2,-3 morphants).</p></disp-quote><p>We report that miR-204 deficient zebrafish have increasedin vivonfatc1 expression (Figure 5F). We also show that miR-204 mimic decreases and miR-204 inhibitor increases NFATC1 expression in HUVEC in vitro(Figure 5C). These results demonstrate that NFATC1 is a target of miR-204 regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear whether secondary sprout is affected in mir-204 deficient embryos. Although there are no parachordal lines in the scheme of Figure 7L, there is no evidence of impairment of secondary sprout followed by parachordal line development in the present study. Although the authors focused on thoracic duct formation, prior to this, secondary sprout and parachordal lines could be analyzed. No description in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this and other comments from our reviewers, and as described in detail in the “Examine early stages of lymphatic development in miR-204-deficient animals” section (under “New experimental data provided for revision”) above, we now include new time-lapse imaging data showing that secondary sprouts in miR-204 deficient animals emerge and grow to the level of the horizontal myoseptum as in normal animals but then fail to form the pre-lymphatic parachordal lines and instead continue to grow dorsally, in at least some cases contributing to veins (Figure 2C, D; Figure 2—video 1; and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors mentioned &quot;lymphatic specification&quot; in Discussion.

In addition to the new data we have added new text to our manuscript discussing these findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
