Here, in a mouse model for youth-onset T2D, we show that both trabecular and cortical bone mass is reduced due to diminished osteoblast activity. Stable isotope tracing in vivo with <sup>13</sup>C-glucose demonstrates that both glycolysis and glucose fueling of the TCA cycle are impaired in diabetic bones. Similarly, Seahorse assays show suppression of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation by diabetes in bone marrow mesenchymal cells as a whole, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing reveals distinct modes of metabolic dysregulation among the subpopulations. Metformin not only promotes glycolysis and osteoblast differentiation in vitro, but also improves bone mass in diabetic mice. Finally, osteoblast-specific overexpression of either Hif1a, a general inducer of glycolysis, or Pfkfb3 which stimulates a specific step in glycolysis, averts bone loss in T2D mice. The study identifies osteoblast-intrinsic defects in glucose metabolism as an underlying cause of diabetic osteopenia, which may be targeted therapeutically.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>type II diabetes</kwd><kwd>diabetic osteopenia</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK125498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Fanxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Osteoblast glucose metabolism is impaired in a mouse model for type II diabetes and can be boosted pharmacologically or genetically to alleviate diabetic osteopenia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone quality is maintained by the coordinated functions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. During bone formation, polarized osteoblasts secrete extracellular matrix (ECM), consisting of type I collagen and non-collagenous matrix proteins, that mineralize over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eriksen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Long, 2012</xref>). The production of ECM by osteoblasts is an energy-demanding process and likely requires metabolic reprogramming, but the metabolic regulation of osteoblast differentiation and function is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buttgereit and Brand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, prominent signaling pathways that promote or suppress osteogenesis alter glucose metabolism. For instance, parathyroid hormone (PTH), Wnt, insulin-like growth factors (Igf), and Hif1a stimulate glycolysis while promoting osteogenesis, whereas Notch signaling suppresses glycolysis and osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Esen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Regan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee and Long, 2018</xref>). In addition, a number of studies have identified glucose as the main energy substrate for osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guntur et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, accumulating evidence to date supports an important role of glucose metabolism in the regulation of osteoblast development and function.</p><p>T2D is characterized by insulin insensitivity in target tissues resulting in hyperglycemia. Adults with T2D have increased fracture risk despite having normal or increased areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonds et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sellmeyer et al., 2016</xref>). The poor bone quality has been often attributed to abnormal accumulation of advanced glycation end products in the bone matrix, but could also result from reduced bone turnover as indicated by suppression of both bone resorption and formation in T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farr and Khosla, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moseley et al., 2021</xref>). Youth-onset T2D has emerged as a significant and increasing health burden in adolescents and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nadeau et al., 2016</xref>). Distinct from adult T2D, T2D in youth has been reported to reduce bone mass due to impaired bone anabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kindler et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, both types of T2D diminish bone formation, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.</p><p>Here, we have established and interrogated a mouse model for youth-onset T2D. We show that suppression of glucose metabolism in osteoblasts is the main cause of impaired bone formation in T2D. Importantly, activation of glycolysis in osteoblasts restores bone formation in T2D mice. Together, we identified osteoblast-intrinsic defects in glucose metabolism as an underlying cause of diabetic osteopenia which may be targeted therapeutically.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modeling youth-onset T2D in the mouse</title><p>To generate a mouse model for human youth-onset T2D, 6-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks and then injected with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) once daily for three consecutive days, followed by continuous HFD feeding until harvest at 22 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Random glucose levels were checked two weeks after the first STZ injection and mice with a glucose level lower than 200 mg/dL were excluded from the study. At harvest, the T2D mice had a significantly higher body weight due to increased fat mass with no change in lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). They exhibited notable hyperglycemia and significant impairment in glucose handling when compared to the controls, as revealed by the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>). Fasting serum insulin and Igf1 concentrations were significantly higher in the T2D mice, confirming that they were less sensitive to insulin and reflecting an early phase of T2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>). Their insulin resistance was further demonstrated by the elevated index of the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Overall, the mouse model exhibits key features of T2D including obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia (early feature), and insulin resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Combination of HFD and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) induces Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic for experimental design.

The body length from nose tip to the tail base and the femur length were slightly longer in T2D than normal, perhaps due to increased Igf1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Imaging and quantification with µCT revealed that T2D significantly reduced trabecular bone volume (BV) and its ratio over tissue volume (BV/TV) in the femur, without altering the tissue volume (TV) itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> upper, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The trabecular bone loss was due to reduced trabecular number (Tb. N) and connectivity (Conn. Dens) concurrent with increased trabecular spacing (Tb.

Serum P1NP (procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide) and CTX-1 (collagen type I C- telopeptide) levels were both lower in T2D than in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that T2D suppressed the overall bone turnover whereas reduced bone formation was responsible for the net bone loss. To further quantify osteoblast activity, we performed dynamic histomorphometry with dual dyes (calcein followed by alizarin red) that labeled active bone-forming surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Quantification within the trabecular bone region of the distal femur detected a marked decrease in both mineralizing surface relative to bone surface (MS/BS) and the mineralization apposition rate (MAR), resulting in an 80% suppression of the bone formation rate (BFR/BS) in the T2D mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Similarly, MS/BS and BFR/BS were both reduced at the endosteum of the bone shaft whereas MS/BS was also decreased at the periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). These results indicate that T2D impairs osteoblast activity in both trabecular and cortical bone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>T2D impairs glucose metabolism in bone in vivo</title><p>To explore the metabolic basis for impaired osteoblast activity in T2D, we conducted stable isotope tracing in bone with uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc). Catabolism of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc was expected to produce fully labeled pyruvate Pyr(m+3) through glycolysis, which could then convert to fully labeled lactate Lac(m+3) in the cytosol or enter mitochondria to produce m+2 labeled TCA cycle metabolites in the first cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For the experiment, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc was injected into conscious mice (22 weeks of age) via tail vein at 60 min before the mice were harvested for detection of metabolites in bone or plasma by mass spectrometry. The glycolysis and TCA metabolite pool sizes in both bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) were similar between T2D and CTRL, while glucose was increased in T2D as expected. The fractional enrichment of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc in bone reached approximately 20% with no difference between T2D and CTRL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, among the bone metabolites detected, the labeling enrichments of Glu(m+2) and Gln(m+2) were significantly reduced in T2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, when normalized to bone Glc(m+6), the relative enrichments of bone Pyr(m+3), Glu(m+2), and Gln(m+2) were decreased in T2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Further examination of the TCA cycle metabolites in bone revealed substantial enrichment of the m+1 isotopomers, among which Suc(m+1), Asp(m+1), Glu(m+1), and Gln(m+1) were diminished in T2D, with or without normalization to Glc(m+6) in bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, to capture the overall contribution of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc, we calculated the total carbon enrichment ((m0*0+m1*1+m2*2+….mn*n)/n) for each of the TCA cycle metabolites in bone. The result showed that <sup>13</sup>C enrichments in succinate, glutamate, and glutamine, with or without normalization to bone Glc(m+6), were significantly reduced in T2D compared to the CTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The bone-intrinsic metabolic defect was further supported by Western blot analyses showing a marked decrease in Glut1 and Hk2 in the bone extracts of T2D mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Overall, T2D suppresses glucose metabolism in bone through both glycolysis and the TCA cycle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) suppresses glucose metabolism in bone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram for carbon tracing with <sup>1313</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc.

Evidence from multiple approaches including stable isotope tracing in vivo, scRNA-seq of bone marrow mesenchymal cells, as well as in vitro flux assays supports that T2D causes metabolic dysregulation intrinsic to osteoblast lineage cells. Importantly, activation of glycolysis either pharmacologically or by genetic means effectively enhances bone formation and preserves bone mass in diabetic mice. The results, therefore, support osteoblast-intrinsic impairment of glucose metabolism as a pathogenic mechanism for diabetic osteopenia in T2D.</p><p>Although adult-onset T2D differs from youth-onset T2D in that the net bone mass is either normal or even increased in adults, they both suppress bone formation. Multiple mechanisms including hyperglycemia and decreased signaling by Wnt, adipokine, insulin, or Igf1 have been proposed to impair osteoblast differentiation and function in diabetes, but their functional relevance in vivo remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Napoli et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, as Wnt and Igf1 signaling has been shown to promote glycolysis directly in osteoblast lineage cells, it is reasonable to speculate that the downregulation of the aforementioned signals may be a proximate cause for impaired glycolysis in diabetic bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Esen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esen et al., 2015</xref>). Our mouse model recapitulates the low bone turnover as seen in human patients, but we have chosen to focus on the bone anabolic defect as it drives the osteopenia phenotype. The model can be further studied in the future to determine the mechanism for impaired bone resorption in T2D and its potential contribution to impaired bone formation through a coupling mechanism. It is worth noting that others have previously reported increased osteoclasts and bone resorption in HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the osteoclast defect observed here is caused by diabetes instead of HFD feeding per se. In any case, the current study shows that osteoblast glycolysis can be selectively targeted to increase bone mass without causing ‘coupled’ activation of bone resorption in T2D.</p><p>We have focused on glucose metabolism here, but hyperlipidemia is expected to occur in the T2D mice not only because of the HFD feeding but also because hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can increase lipid accumulation in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Winhofer et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have linked hyperlipidemia with bone loss in both humans and rodents, and have further indicated that the effect is partly mediated through suppression of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tintut and Demer, 2014</xref>). However, the intracellular mechanism mediating the anti-osteogenic effect of lipids has not been elucidated. Our finding that activation of glycolysis can restore bone formation in the face of hyperlipidemia argues that impaired glycolysis could be a major driver for the bone pathology downstream of hyperlipidemia. It should be interesting then to test whether hyperlipidemia suppresses glycolysis in osteoblasts in the future. The potential effect could be caused by either bioactive lipids signaling through putative receptors, or interruption of normal fatty acid metabolism previously implicated in osteoblast bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tintut and Demer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our study shows that stimulation of glycolysis either pharmacologically or by genetic activation promotes bone formation in T2D. In keeping with its bone anabolic function in vivo, metformin increased the mRNA levels of multiple genes directly or indirectly involved in glycolysis, including Slc2a1, Slc2a3, Pgm1, and Hif1a, during osteoblast differentiation in vitro. However, as metformin also improved the overall diabetic phenotype in the T2D mice, the rescue of osteoblasts could potentially be an indirect effect. Thus, targeted activation of glycolysis in osteoblasts was necessary to demonstrate a direct effect in vivo. While Hif1a is well documented to stimulate glycolysis, its target genes are numerous and include Vegf which could induce angiogenesis to secondarily promote bone formation. Pfkfb3 overexpression, on the other hand, is presumed to target a single step of glycolysis and, therefore, provides more definitive evidence for a cell-autonomous role of increased glycolysis in osteoblasts.</p><p>Overexpression of either Hif1a or Pfkfb3 did not affect bone formation in the normal mice, indicating that osteoblast glycolysis is unlikely to be rate-limiting for bone homeostasis in healthy adult mice. We previously showed that overexpression of a different form of stabilized Hif1a in osteoblasts increased trabecular bone mass in young healthy mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Regan et al., 2014</xref>). However, there are important differences between the two studies. In the earlier study, Hif1a-PPN carrying three alanine substitutions (P402A, P564A, and N803A) was expressed from a tetO promoter in the transgene in response to Dox. Here, Hif1dPA (P402A, P564A) was expressed from the Rosa26 endogenous locus upon removal of a stop cassette by Cre in response to Dox. The differences in promoter strength and the point mutations could lead to variable activity levels for Hif1a in osteoblasts between the two models. Moreover, the earlier study analyzed the bone mass at 5 weeks of age when the mice were actively accruing bone, but the current analysis was performed with 5-month-old adult mice which had a considerably lower basal bone formation rate.</p><p>Overexpression of Glut1 failed to rescue bone formation, indicating that glucose uptake was not responsible for the impaired bone anabolic activity in T2D. The result further supports the notion that the downregulation of Glut1 in diabetic bones likely represents a protective mechanism against cellular damage, as an intracellular accumulation of glucose is known to be cytotoxic through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownlee, 2001</xref>). In particular, activation of the polyol pathway could deplete both NADPH and NAD<sup>+</sup> in osteoblasts. Whereas NADPH is critical for glutathione homeostasis and oxidative stress control, NAD<sup>+</sup> is required as a co-factor for glycolysis. On the other hand, hyperactivation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway could impair protein functions via abnormal glycosylation. It’s important to note that both pathways branch off the core glycolysis pathway upstream of the step stimulated by Pfkfb3. Thus, Pfkfb3 overexpression may diminish the flux into the harmful side pathways while boosting core glycolysis in osteoblasts of the T2D mice. Future experiments are necessary to determine the potential flux changes in vivo.</p><p>In conclusion, the study identifies impaired glucose metabolism in osteoblasts as a key mediator for the bone anabolic defect in T2D. Furthermore, osteoblast glycolysis offers a promising target for developing future bone therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal experiments were conducted with approval from the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (IACUC NO: IAC 21–001296).

evidence to demonstrate that suppression of glucose metabolism in osteoblasts is the main cause of impaired bone formation in T2D. Particularly, the authors uncovered that activation of glycolysis in osteoblasts restores bone formation in T2D mice as an essential mechanism. This study fundamentally demonstrated osteoblast-intrinsic defects in glucose metabolism as an underlying cause of diabetic osteopenia with therapeutical potential.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85714.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.01.16.524248">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.16.524248v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Hyperglycemia in diabetes is known to cause pathological activation of the polyol pathway and the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) inside the cell, both of which branch off from the core glycolysis pathway upstream of the step stimulated by Pfkfb3. Indeed, our scRNA-seq data from the bone marrow cells show that Gfpt1, encoding the first and rate-limiting enzyme for HBP, is upregulated by T2D in multiple clusters including CAR cells (clusters #0, 1, 2) and osteoblasts (#3), whereas the paralogous gene Gfpt2 is less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, increasing glucose uptake in osteoblasts by Glut1 overexpression may exacerbate the polyol and HBP pathways already activated in diabetes. Hif1a is known to activate multiple key enzymes throughout the glycolysis pathway. Pfkfb3 overexpression stimulates a step downstream of the branch-off point of either the polyol pathway or HBP. Therefore, overexpression of either Hif1a or Pfkfb3 likely diminishes the detrimental side pathways by boosting the core glycolytic flux.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>scRNA-seq detects increased expression of Gfpt1 in multiple mesenchymal cell clusters in the bone marrow of T2D mice compared to control.</title><p>Violin plots show relative gene expression levels in each cell cluster (x-axis) in control (red) versus T2D (green) mice.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85714-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) HFD-fed obese and T2D mice had more periosteal reactive bone, osteolysis, and osteoclast activation.

Those effects however were the results of heightened inflammation in response to the bacterial infection, and therefore not relevant to this study which deals with bone homeostasis. In fact, our study shows that bone resorption as reflected by serum CTX-I levels is reduced in the T2D mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper is generally excellent with an interesting scientific premise, that the effects of T2DM on bone could be mediated through osteoblast metabolic dysfunction and particularly dysfunction in glucose uptake, especially since it is already known that bone is partly responsible for glucose tolerance and a relative lack of response to insulin in T2DM patients.

We acknowledge that the use of STZ is irrelevant to the etiology of T2D in humans. However, because HFD alone was generally not sufficient to induce a frank T2D phenotype in the mouse, we adopted the method of combining HFD feeding with low dose TZD, which, as we demonstrated in the paper, was effective in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The second figure needs some sort of checks to see if osteoblast numbers are affected by the T2DM model. This could be done using staining for ALP and counting osteoblast numbers per surface area of the bone.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that static histomorphometry based on cell morphology or ALP staining (marking both immature and mature osteoblasts) could reveal overall changes in the osteoblast lineage, but they do not distinguish active bone-forming osteoblasts from precursors or inactive cells. We therefore have relied on dynamic histomorphometry to provide an integrated assessment of active osteoblast number and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The fourth figure is very short on material and could use considerable expansion here and in/or in the supplemental information.

Further analyses of osteoblast and other mesenchymal cells did not reveal any significant changes in the expression levels of Glut transporters. We have now expanded this figure to include additional results from pathway analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The fifth figure needs confirmation of the alizarin red staining and qPCR for osteoblast activity with two methods – there needs to be staining with Von Kossa staining for osteoblast activity measurement as well as western blotting for changes in gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thoroughness of the reviewer but feel that the data from qPCR and alizarin red staining, together with the in vivo findings, already provide strong evidence that osteoblast differentiation is impaired in the diabetic mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The investigators used HFD to induce T2D and discussed the impact of glucose metabolism on osteoblast activity and osteopenia. However, lipid metabolism is also important to the osteoblast activity and is relevant in this animal model but was neither studied nor discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. Hyperlipidemia is expected in the T2D mice because of the HFD feeding. Moreover, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia may increase lipid accumulation in bone as it has been shown in the heart (PMC3331780). Previous studies have linked hyperlipidemia with bone loss in both humans and rodents, and have further indicated that the effect is partly mediated through suppression of osteoblast differentiation (PMC3946677). However, the intracellular mechanism mediating the anti-osteogenic effect of lipids has not been elucidated. Our finding that activation of glycolysis can restore bone formation in the face of hyperlipidemia argues that impaired glycolysis is a major driver for the bone pathology. It should be interesting then to test whether hyperlipidemia suppresses glycolysis in osteoblasts in the future. The potential effect could be caused by either bioactive lipids which has been postulated to signal through putative receptors, or interruption of normal fatty acid metabolism previously shown to participate in energy production in osteoblasts (PMC3946677, PMC5621897). We now include these comments in Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) HFD-fed obese and T2D mice had more periosteal reactive bone, osteolysis, and osteoclast activation.

The different results about bone resorption between this and the previous study as cited by the reviewer could be explained by the fact that the previous study used HFD alone which did not lead to overt T2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6 showed several glycolysis-related gene expressions increased by metformin including Hif1a. It is interesting to further explore the role of Hif1a in metformin's effects on BMSC glycolysis. Whether metformin effects are abolished in the absence of Hif1a needs to be studied. The in vivo result of Hif1a OE mice is not conclusive in Figure 7 as the baseline data of WT and HifOE mice fed on a normal diet is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point that metformin might stimulate glycolysis through Hif1a in BMSC; we plan to investigate this possibility in the future. We now provide the baseline data of WT and HifOE mice on a normal diet and show no difference in cortical or trabecular bone mass (Figure 7). Thus, the rescue effect of Hif1aOE is specific to the T2D bones, indicating that osteoblast glycolysis becomes rate limiting for bone formation in T2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Pfkfb3 is not regulated by metformin thus the result in Figure 8 on the Pfkfb3OE mice needs to be discussed in the context of the whole study.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not examine whether Pfkfb3 is regulated by metformin in BMSC, but others have shown that metformin stimulates Pfkfb3 expression in adipocytes (PMC5512603). Regardless, in the current study we target Pfkfb3 because it stimulates a specific step of glycolysis (conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate). The findings from the Pfkfb3OE mice further buttress the conclusion that boosting glycolysis is sufficient to improve bone formation in the T2D mice. We have expanded the discussion to integrate the results from both metformin and the genetic studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
