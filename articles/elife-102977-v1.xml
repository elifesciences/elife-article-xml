However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this translational burst and the involvement of initiation factors remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) in early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Using Quick-irCLIP and alternative polyadenylation (APA) Seq, we show eIF3 crosslinks predominantly with 3’ untranslated region (3’-UTR) termini of multiple mRNA isoforms, adjacent to the poly(A) tail. Furthermore, we find that eIF3 engagement at 3’-UTR ends is dependent on polyadenylation. High eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTR termini of mRNAs correlates with high translational activity, as determined by ribosome profiling, but not with translational efficiency. The results presented here show that eIF3 engages with 3’-UTR termini of highly translated mRNAs, likely reflecting a general rather than specific regulatory function of eIF3, and supporting a role of mRNA circularization in the mechanisms governing mRNA translation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eIF3</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>3'-UTR</kwd><kwd>quick-irCLIP</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EDUC4-12790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mestre-Fos</surname><given-names>Santi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM065050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cate</surname><given-names>Jamie HD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM148352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cate</surname><given-names>Jamie HD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM139008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ingolia</surname><given-names>Nicholas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1-HL156819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bakar Fellows Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The extent of human eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3 interaction with the 3' ends of mRNA 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) correlates with the level of translation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells are a group of diverse cells that are characterized by their ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types. This remarkable plasticity enables them to contribute to tissue development, maintenance, and repair. In their quiescent state, stem cells present low protein synthesis levels, conserving energy and resources while maintaining their undifferentiated state. However, upon receiving differentiation signals, they exhibit a global increase in protein synthesis that results in a drastic change in the proteome composition to meet the demands of newly specialized progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Signer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>). Since initiation is translation’s rate-limiting step, it must be highly regulated to maintain quiescence and to promote the global increase in translation that occurs during the initial steps of stem cell differentiation. Despite its importance, the roles that initiation factors play in quiescent and newly differentiated stem cells are poorly understood.</p><p>eIF3 is the largest of all initiation factors in eukaryotes and plays a pivotal role in the initiation of translation. In humans, eIF3 is composed of 13 subunits and helps position ribosomes at the start codon of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, recent discoveries have highlighted several non-canonical functions of eIF3 that extend beyond its general role in translation initiation. For instance, photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>) performed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells uncovered regulatory roles of eIF3 in the translation of a specific pool of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). These studies also revealed that eIF3 subunit d (EIF3D) activates the translation of <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA by binding to its 5’ cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, the pool of mRNAs regulated by eIF3 varies dramatically across different cell types and physiological conditions. PAR-CLIP experiments performed in Jurkat T cells showed that robust T cell activation requires the direct interaction of eIF3 with the mRNAs encoding for the human T cell receptor subunits α and β, a phenomenon that was also observed in primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Silva et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, eIF3 modulates the translation of mRNAs critical for adaptation and survival under stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamper et al., 2020</xref>). Beyond its established functions in translation initiation, eIF3 has been shown to also be involved in translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>) and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beznosková et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Valásek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valášek et al., 2017</xref>). These findings indicate that eIF3 serves distinct regulatory roles depending on specific cellular environments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of Quick irCLIP of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) to RNAs in undifferentiated and differentiated neural progenitor cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the human eIF3 complex as part of the 48 S initiation complex.

NPCs are considered more committed to the neural lineage than NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oikari et al., 2016</xref>) and hence are likely to present higher protein synthesis levels than quiescent NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baser et al., 2019</xref>). Despite their commitment, NPCs maintain the self-renewal and multipotent characteristics of NSCs and, therefore, are widely used to study stem-like properties in vitro. Our study focused on identifying the mRNAs that crosslink to eIF3 during the translational burst observed upon NPC differentiation. Instead of identifying specific regulatory roles for eIF3, we discovered that eIF3 predominantly crosslinks to the 3’-UTRs of mRNAs. Using next-generation sequencing to map polyadenylation events in NPCs, we found that eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTRs occurs at the termini of multiple mRNA isoforms, adjacent to polyadenylated (polyA) tails. Transcriptome-wide analysis further demonstrated that increased eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTR termini correlates with an increased level of ribosome footprint (RPF) levels on mRNAs. Interestingly, the binding of eIF3 to 3’-UTR termini was observed only in polyadenylated transcripts and is independent of interactions between eIF3 and polyA-binding proteins, as inferred from eIF3 immunoprecipitation experiments. These findings show that high levels of active translation drive eIF3 engagement at mRNA 3’-UTR termini. Given eIF3’s known role in associating with 5’-UTRs to promote translation initiation, our observation of eIF3 interactions with 3’-UTR ends points to an unexpected role for eIF3 in mRNA circularization, potentially facilitating communication between the 5’ and 3’ ends of actively translated mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of hPSC-derived NPCs</title><p>We differentiated hPSCs toward NPCs by embryoid body (EB) formation followed by neural rosette selection, giving rise to NPCs after ~3 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Given that we observe similar eIF3 crosslinking levels in undifferentiated and differentiated NPCs, we did not perform APA-Seq in differentiated NPCs. APA-Seq creates sequencing libraries by amplifying the region upstream of a polyadenylation event, allowing the identification of all 3’-UTR mRNA isoforms being expressed for any given gene. Comparing our Quick-irCLIP and APA-Seq experiments, we observe that the eIF3 peaks located in 3’-UTRs map to the same location as APA peaks, indicating that the predominant eIF3 crosslinking peaks in 3’-UTRs identified by Quick-irCLIP localize to 3’-UTR termini, adjacent to the poly(A) tail. For instance, the eIF3 crosslinking peaks located in the 3’-UTR of the <italic>MAP1B</italic> mRNA correspond to APA-Seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

As another example, our irCLIP experiment shows that eIF3 crosslinks to both the 5’- and 3’-UTRs of the <italic>S100B</italic> mRNA, which encodes for a calcium-binding protein highly expressed in brain cells and that is commonly used as a glial marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockes et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferri et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwin et al., 1976</xref>). Within <italic>S100B</italic>’s 3’-UTR, we observe 2 major eIF3 crosslinking peaks at the 3’-UTR termini of 2 distinct <italic>S100B</italic> mRNA isoforms expressed in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that eIF3 exhibits different crosslinking levels to the 3’-UTR termini of various 3’-UTR isoforms that are similarly expressed.

In agreement with the translational burst that we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), our monosome profiles show an increase in RPFs around the start codon in differentiated NPCs, indicating an increase of initiating ribosomes in differentiated NPCs with respect to the undifferentiated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Indeed, regardless of whether we examined undifferentiated or differentiated NPCs, we found genes which had an increase in 3’-UTR irCLIP crosslinking tended to have an increase in ribosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

Overall, our ribosome profiling data combined with our eIF3 irCLIP data suggest that, in both undifferentiated and differentiated NPCs, there is a global increase in eIF3 engagement at 3’-UTR termini that correlates with an overall increase in protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>eIF3 interactions with 3’-UTR termini requires polyadenylation but is independent of poly(A) binding proteins</title><p>eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTR termini suggests that it must be in close proximity to the poly(A) tail and poly(A) tail binding proteins (PABPs). To determine whether the presence of eIF3 at 3’-UTR ends requires polyadenylation, we looked at histone mRNAs. Canonical histone mRNAs are the only known cellular non-polyadenylated mRNAs in eukaryotes due to their cell-cycle dependency and their need to be degraded rapidly. On the other hand, several variant histone mRNAs are not cell-cycle dependent and are polyadenylated. In non-polyadenylated canonical histone mRNAs (<italic>H2AC11</italic>, <italic>H3C1</italic>, and <italic>H4-16</italic>), we see no traces of eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTR termini nor APA events, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We also carried out a global comparison of the eIF3 Quick-irCLIP and APA-Seq crosslinking peaks, and observed that eIF3 crosslinking to the 3’-UTR termini had a positive association with polyadenylation (Methods). These data indicate that eIF3 only interacts with 3’-UTR termini of mRNAs that are polyadenylated, and thus should be in close proximity to the poly(A) tail.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Crosslinking of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) to polyadenylated mRNAs and model for mRNA circularization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crosslinking of eIF3 across the canonical non-polyadenylated histone H2AC11 mRNA and the variant polyadenylated histone H3-3B mRNA in undifferentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs).

Since we observe eIF3 crosslinks adjacent to the poly(A) tail, it is conceivable that this eIF3-mediated mRNA circularization is stabilized through interactions between eIF3 and poly(A)-binding proteins. eIF3 has been reported to interact with the poly(A)-binding protein interacting protein 1 (PAIP1) in HeLa cells through the EIF3G subunit to promote closed loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martineau et al., 2008</xref>). As in our Quick-irCLIP experiment, we immunoprecipitated assembled eIF3 complexes using an anti-EIF3B antibody from UV-crosslinked undifferentiated NPCs and immunoblotted against PAIP1 and against the major cytoplasmic isoform of the PABPs (PABPC1). Our results indicate that despite eIF3 being in close proximity to the location of the PABPs, these do not elute with it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of eIF3 complexes from UV-crosslinked HEK293T gave the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is possible that the eIF3 interactions with poly(A)-binding proteins are transient and eIF3 immunoprecipitation results in the disruption of these complexes. Therefore, to maintain the integrity of these potentially transient interactions, we treated NPCs with the protein-protein crosslinker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) before cell collection and eIF3 immunoprecipitation. DSP is a thiol-cleavable crosslinker so eluates can be treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) to cleave the disulfide bond in the spacer arm of DSP as a way to separate eIF3 from its polypeptide interactors. Our results show that even when protein-protein transient interactions are covalently linked by DSP treatment, PABPC1 and PAIP1 do not elute with eIF3 in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The same experiments performed in HEK293T gave the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that eIF3 engagement with 3’-UTR termini in highly translated transcripts requires polyadenylation but is independent of interactions with poly(A)-binding proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we identified the transcripts that interact with eIF3 in hPSC-derived NPCs. NPCs that have undergone differentiation toward forebrain neurons exhibit a global increase in protein synthesis that we identified to occur 2 hr post differentiation treatment. Our Quick-irCLIP experiment shows that eIF3 predominantly crosslinks to 3’-UTRs in NPCs. By performing APA-Seq, we discovered that these eIF3 3’-UTR crosslinks map to 3’-UTR termini of multiple mRNA isoforms, adjacent to poly(A) tails and where the polyadenylation signal is located. Interestingly, we have also identified eIF3 irCLIP peaks within mRNA coding regions such as in <italic>NES</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) that colocalize with APA-Seq peaks, indicating that different nestin protein isoforms are expressed in NPCs. Therefore, in addition to providing mRNA isoform-specific expression information, our APA-Seq experiment could potentially be used to investigate the expression of specific protein isoforms in NPCs.</p><p>Here, we also observe that early NPC differentiation results in eIF3 engagement with the 3’-UTR terminus of the mRNA encoding the transcription regulator ID2. By ribosome profiling, we determined that this increase in eIF3 engagement on <italic>ID2</italic> mRNA is correlated with an increase in the levels of active transcription and translation of ID2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At a global level, we also observe in both undifferentiated and differentiated NPCs mRNAs with higher levels of eIF3 crosslinks to 3’-UTRs exhibit higher levels of active translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that these two phenomena are correlated. For example, we observe that the highest levels of eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTR ends are observed on the most actively translated mRNAs (e.g. <italic>EEF1A</italic> and <italic>ACTB</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that actively translated mRNAs engage eIF3 at their 3’-UTR termini, likely reflecting eIF3’s general role in translation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the eIF3 engagement with the 3’-UTR terminus remain to be determined.</p><p>Our APA-Seq experiment performed in NPCs maps all polyadenylation events and it infers mRNA expression at isoform level. We found several instances where eIF3 CLIP peaks that colocalize with polyadenylation events have different peak heights with respect to those of the APA-Seq experiment. For instance, our APA-Seq data suggests that the proximal and distal 3’-UTR isoforms of the <italic>S100B</italic> mRNA are expressed at similar levels in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, we observe higher eIF3 engagement levels with the distal isoform than with the proximal isoform. Given that our ribosome profiling experiment indicates eIF3 engagement at 3’-UTR termini is observed on actively translated mRNAs, our eIF3 irCLIP and APA-Seq datasets could potentially be used in combination to determine active translation levels at mRNA isoform level, a feature that cannot be determined by ribosome profiling alone since RPF counts cannot be mapped to multiple mRNA isoforms.</p><p>eIF3 is an initiation factor that is usually associated with 5’-UTRs, where it organizes interactions between other initiation factors and the 40 S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation. Its presence at the very end of 3’-UTRs of actively translated mRNAs supports the mRNA circularization model, where the 5’ and 3’ ends of highly translated mRNAs are proposed to be brought in close proximity to each other by the interactions of multiple proteins that bridge 5’-UTRs with 3’-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). It is possible that our observation of eIF3 at 3’-UTR termini is due to the recycling of eIF3 from 3’-UTRs to 5’-UTRs for successive rounds of translation. However, this would require eIF3 association with translating ribosomes until translation termination and subsequently scanning through the entire length of 3’-UTRs either by direct interactions with mRNAs or through binding with post-termination 40 S ribosomal subunits scanning through 3’-UTRs until the poly(A) tail is encountered. If that were the case one would expect to observe higher eIF3 levels at the ends of short 3’-UTRs than at those of long 3’-UTRs, and we observe no evidence of this (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, recent results indicate that eIF3 associates with elongating ribosomes but it dissociates after ~60 codons from the start codon, before termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, given the large size of eIF3 (800 KDa in humans), it is possible that during mRNA circularization eIF3 interactions with 3’-UTR termini are accomplished by a specific eIF3 module while performing its canonical role as a scaffold protein during translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In the closed loop model of translation it is proposed that the 5’ and 3’ ends of translated mRNAs are connected via the multiprotein-RNA interactions composed of the mRNA 5’ cap - eIF4E - eIF4G - PABP - poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wells et al., 1998</xref>), which are conserved across phylogeny. The disruption of these interactions results in a decrease in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imataka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kahvejian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tarun and Sachs, 1996</xref>). mRNA circularization promoted by the canonical closed loop model has been observed in vitro by atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). Circular polysomes have also been observed on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 1987</xref>). These studies remain the only structural evidence for the model to date.</p><p>Since these studies, additional interactions between proteins regularly associated with 5’-UTRs and proteins commonly associated with 3’-UTRs have been discovered. For example, EIF3H has been shown to interact with METTL3, which binds to <italic>N</italic>6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified sites near the stop codon, an interaction proposed to enhance translation, indicating a role in looping highly translated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2018</xref>). Another eIF3 subunit, EIF3G, has also been reported to be involved in mRNA circularization. Studies performed in HeLa cells showed EIF3G coimmunoprecipitates with PAIP1, suggesting a role in bridging 5’-UTRs with poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martineau et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we immunoprecipitated the eIF3 complex from NPCs and HEK293T using an anti-EIF3B antibody but did not observe PAIP1 or other poly(A)-associated proteins in the eIF3 eluates. It is possible that these divergent results are due to the fact that HeLa extracts present high levels of EIF2α phosphorylation, which are not observed in other cell extracts such as HEK293T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksashin et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that protein translation is highly dysregulated in HeLa cells and, therefore, the mechanisms of translation regulation might be significantly different than in other cells. Furthermore, the EIF3G-PAIP1 interaction is reported to be RNA independent, while our observations reveal an interaction of eIF3 with 3’-UTRs of polyadenylated mRNAs, so it is also possible that these are two independent mechanisms. Future studies will be needed to identify the proteins that may contact eIF3 when it resides at the end of the 3’-UTR adjacent to the poly(A) tail.</p><p>It is worth noting that the eIF3 3’-UTR termini crosslinking pattern was not observed in the two previous studies that used PAR-CLIP to identify the eIF3 mRNA-binding sites in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>) and Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Silva et al., 2021</xref>). Quick-irCLIP uses a short UV wavelength (254 nm) to crosslink RNA to proteins, whereas PAR-CLIP is performed at 365 nm and requires the cellular internalization of 4-thiouridine (4SU). These different UV wavelengths lead to different chemical susceptibilities for amino acid-nucleotide crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>). eIF3 is a large multisubunit complex so it is possible that different UV wavelengths capture transcript interactions through different eIF3 modules containing different amino acid propensity to crosslink to mRNAs at the two wavelengths. Using a different UV crosslinking method with respect to the previous work performed in HEK293T and Jurkat is a caveat when it comes to comparative studies such the one reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, in which eIF3-crosslinked mRNAs in NPCs are nearly disjoint from those crosslinked to eIF3 in HEK293T and Jurkat cells. However, it is striking that we were still able to identify some common 5’-UTR eIF3 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our results provide new insights into the broad repertoire of roles that eIF3 plays during translation initiation. Besides its canonical role as a scaffold protein for initiation complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>) and its non-canonical roles in translation activation/repression by direct mRNA interactions at 5’- and 3’-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), our study reveals a role in which eIF3 interacts with 3’-UTR termini of highly translated mRNAs and suggests eIF3 assists in the communication between 5’ and 3’ mRNA ends, supporting the mRNA circularization model to promote efficient recycling of ribosomes and translation factors for successive rounds of translation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cells (WTC-11 cells) and HEK293T cells were obtained from the UC Berkeley Biosciences Cell Culture Facility.

Samples were then incubated at 80 °C for 5 min, briefly centrifuged, and loaded onto a 4–12% SDS NuPAGE Bis-tris gel. The gel was run for 50 min at 180 V. Protein-RNA complexes were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 90 min at 30 V and then were visualized using a near infrared imager (Li-COR Odyssey CLx). The membrane was then put in a light-protected box. A grayscale image of the membrane was printed on acetate film, the membrane was wrapped in a plastic wrap and then the membrane and grayscale image were aligned using the ladder as reference.</p><p>Using a razor blade per sample, a box corresponding to the molecular weight range of eIF3 subunits EIF3A, EIF3B, EIF3C, and EIF3D (140–65 kDa) was cut into small pieces and transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. Proteins in the cut box were then digested by adding 10 μL Proteinase K (20 ug/μL) and 200 μL PK buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min while shaking at 1100 rpm. Then, 200 μL PK-Urea buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 7 M urea) and incubated for an additional 20 min while shaking at 37 °C at 1100 rpm. Supernatants were then transferred to phase lock heavy columns along with 400 μL neutral phenol-chloroform and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C while shaking at 1100 rpm.

The reason we only picked these subunits for this comparison study is because in our Quick-irCLIP experiment we only isolated the RNAs bound to these subunits. This rendered a list of 175 RNA-eIF3 common clusters between subunits EIF3A, EIF3B, and EIF3D in HEK293T. We then picked the top 400 transcripts that interact with activated Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Silva et al., 2021</xref>) and performed the same analysis to find the common RNAs that bind to subunits EIF3A, EIF3B, and EIF3D, giving a total of 209 transcripts. Next, we identified the common transcripts between the two studies by comparing the 175 common in HEK293T with the 209 common in activated Jurkat cells, giving a total of 27 transcripts. Finally, we picked the top 210 transcripts (common in the three replicates) identified by eIF3 Quick-irCLIP in differentiated NPCs and compared them to the 175 common RNAs in HEK293T cells (resulting in eight NPC-HEK293T common RNAs) and to the 209 common RNAs in activated Jurkat cells (resulting in 12 NPC-Jurkat common RNAs). Performing the same analysis with the top 210 common transcripts that bind eIF3 in undifferentiated NPCs gave the same results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Alternative polyadenylation (APA)-seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent from NPCs that were seeded at an initial concentration of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL and incubated at 37 °C for 48 hr in STEMdiff Neural Progenitor Medium.

The analysis yielded a p-value of 9.993×10<sup>–43</sup> and an odds ratio of 5.616, indicating a significant positive association between eIF3 3’-UTR binding and polyadenylation. To address the fact that APA-Seq and irCLIP were performed separately and each method cannot be used to distinguish between distinct mRNA isoforms, we focused the analysis on reproducible peaks within non-overlapping 3'-UTRs of expressed transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Ribosome profiling</title><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Preparation of NPC lysates</title><p>Ribosome profiling was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferguson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>), with the following modifications.

The authors provide solid evidence to support their conclusions, although this study may be enhanced by addressing potential biases of techniques employed to study eIF3:mRNA binding and providing additional mechanistic detail. This work will be of significant interest to researchers exploring post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, including cellular, molecular, and developmental biologists, as well as biochemists.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive views of the results we present, along with the constructive feedback regarding the strengths and weaknesses of our manuscript, with which we generally agree. We acknowledge our results will require a deeper exploration of the molecular mechanisms behind eIF3 interactions with 3'-UTR termini and experiments to identify the molecular partners involved. Additionally, given that NPC differentiation toward mature neurons is a process that takes around 3 weeks, we recognize the importance of examining eIF3-mRNA interactions in NPCs that have undergone differentiation over longer periods than the 2-hr time point selected in this study. Finally, considering the molecular complexity of the 13subunit human eIF3, we agree that a direct comparison between Quick-irCLIP and PAR-CLIP will be highly beneficial and will determine whether different UV crosslinking wavelengths report on different eIF3 molecular interactions. Additional comments are given below to the identified weaknesses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors perform irCLIP of neuronal progenitor cells to profile eIF3-RNA interactions upon short-term neuronal differentiation. The data shows that eIF3 mostly interacts with 3'-UTRs - specifically, the poly-A signal. There appears to be a general correlation between eIF3 binding to 3'-UTRs and ribosome occupancy, which might suggest that eIF3 binding promotes protein</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study provides a wealth of new data on eIF3-mRNA interactions and points to the potential new concept that eIF3-mRNA interactions are polyadenylation-dependent and correlate with ribosome occupancy.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A main limitation is the correlative nature of the study. Whereas the evidence that eIF3 interacts with 3-UTRs is solid, the biological role of the interactions remains entirely unknown. Similarly, the claim that eIF3 interactions with 3'-UTR termini require polyadenylation but are independent of poly(A) binding proteins lacks support as it solely relies on the absence of observable eIF3 binding to poly-A (-) histone mRNAs and a seeming failure to detect PABP binding to eIF3 by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In contrast, LC-MS data in Supplementary File 1 show ready co-purification of eIF3 with PABP.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosslinking between eIF3 and the end of mRNA 3’-UTRs remains to be determined. We also agree that the lack of interaction seen between eIF3 and PABP in Westerns, even from HEK293T cells, is a puzzle. The low sequence coverage in the LC-MS data gave us pause about making a strong statement that these represent direct eIF3 interactions, given the similar background levels of some ribosomal proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Another question concerns the relevance of the cellular model studied. irCLIP is performed on neuronal progenitor cells subjected to neuronal induction for 2 hours. This short-term induction leads to a very modest - perhaps 10% - and very transient 1-hour-long increase in translation, although this is not carefully quantified. The cellular phenotype also does not appear to change and calling the cells treated with differentiation media for 2 hours &quot;differentiated NPCs&quot; seems a bit misleading. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the minor &quot;burst&quot; of translation coincides with minor effects on eIF3-mRNA interactions most of which seem to be driven by mRNA levels. Based on the ~15-fold increase in ID2 mRNA coinciding with a ~5-fold increase in ribosome occupancy (RPF), ID2 TE actually goes down upon neuronal induction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it will be interesting to look at eIF3-mRNA interactions at longer time points after induction of NPC differentiation. However, the pattern of eIF3 crosslinking to the end of 3’-UTRs occurs in both time points reported here, which is likely to be the more general finding in what we present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The overlap in eIF3-mRNA interactions identified here and in the authors' previous reports is minimal. Some of the discrepancies may be related to the not well-justified approach for filtering data prior to assessing overlap. Still, the fundamentally different binding patterns - eIF3 mostly interacting with 5'-UTRs in the authors' previous report and other studies versus the strong preference for 3'-UTRs shown here - are striking. In the Discussion, it is speculated that the different methods used - PAR-CLIP versus irCLIP - lead to these fundamental differences. Unfortunately, this is not supported by any data, even though it would be very important for the translation field to learn whether different CLIP methodologies assess very different aspects of eIF3-mRNA interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the more interesting aspect of what we observe is the difference in location of eIF3 crosslinking, i.e. the end of 3’-UTRs rather than 5’-UTRs or the pan-mRNA pattern we observed in T cells. The reviewer is right that it will be important in the future to compare PAR-CLIP and Quick-irCLIP side-by-side to begin to unravel the differences we observe with the two approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper documents the role of eIF3 in translational control during neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation. eIF3 predominantly binds to the 3' UTR termini of mRNAs during NPC differentiation, adjacent to the poly(A) tails, and is associated with efficiently translated mRNAs, indicating a role for eIF3 in promoting translation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is strong in addressing molecular mechanisms by using a combination of nextgeneration sequencing and crosslinking techniques, thus providing a comprehensive dataset that supports the authors' claims. The manuscript is methodologically sound, with clear experimental designs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The study could benefit from further exploration into the molecular mechanisms by which eIF3 interacts with 3' UTR termini. While the correlation between eIF3 binding and high translation levels is established, the functionality of these interactions needs validation. The authors should consider including experiments that test whether eIF3 binding sites are necessary for increased translation efficiency using reporter constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the molecular mechanism by which eIF3 interacts with the 3’UTR termini remains unclear, along with its biological significance, i.e. how it contributes to translation levels. We think it could be useful to try reporters in, perhaps, HEK293T cells in the future to probe the mechanism in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors mention that the eIF3 3' UTR termini crosslinking pattern observed in their study was not reported in previous PAR-CLIP studies performed in HEK293T cells (Lee et al., 2015) and Jurkat cells (De Silva et al., 2021). They attribute this difference to the different UV wavelengths used in Quick-irCLIP (254 nm) and PAR-CLIP (365 nm with 4-thiouridine). While the explanation is plausible, it remains a caveat that different UV crosslinking methods may capture different eIF3 modules or binding sites, depending on the chemical propensities of the amino acid-nucleotide crosslinks at each wavelength. Without addressing this caveat in more detail, the authors cannot generalize their findings, and thus, the title of the paper, which suggests a broad role for eIF3, may be misleading. Previous studies have pointed to an enrichment of eIF3 binding at the 5' UTRs, and the divergence in results between studies needs to be more explicitly acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the two methods of crosslinking will require a more detailed head-to-head comparison in the future. However, we do think the title is justified by the fact that we see crosslinking to the termini of 3’-UTRs across thousands of transcripts in each condition. Furthermore, the 3’-UTR crosslinking is enriched on mRNAs with higher ribosome protected fragment counts (RPF) in differentiated cells, Figure 3F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the manuscript concludes that eIF3's interaction with 3' UTR termini is independent of poly(A)-binding proteins, transient or indirect interactions should be tested using assays such as PLA (Proximity Ligation Assay), which could provide more insights.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea, but would require a substantial effort better suited to a future publication. We think our observations are interesting enough to the field to stimulate future experimentation that we may or may not be most capable of doing in our lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript by Mestre-Fos and colleagues, authors have analyzed the involvement of eIF3 binding to mRNA during differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPC). The authors bring a lot of interesting observations leading to a novel function for eIF3 at the 3'UTR.</p><p>During the translational burst that occurs during NPC differentiation, analysis of eIF3-associated mRNA by Quick-irCLIP reveals the unexpected binding of this initiation factor at the 3'UTR of most mRNA. Further analysis of alternative polyadenylation by APAseq highlights the close proximity of the eIF3-crosslinking position and the poly(A) tail. Furthermore, this interaction is not detected in Poly(A)-less transcripts. Using Riboseq, the authors then attempted to correlate eIF3 binding with the translation efficacy of mRNA, which would suggest a common mechanism of translational control in these cells. These observations indicate that eIF3-binding at the 3'UTR of mRNA, near the poly(A) tail, may participate to the closed-loop model of mRNA translation, bridging 5' and 3', and allowing ribosomes recycling. However, authors failed to detect interactions of eIF3, with either PABP or Paip1 or 40S subunit proteins, which is quite unexpected.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The well-written manuscript presents an attractive concept regarding the mechanism of eIF3 function at the 3'UTR. Most mRNA in NPC seems to have eIF3 binding at the 3'UTR and only a few at the 5'end where it's commonly thought to bind. In a previous study from the Cate lab, eIF3 was reported to bind to a small region of the 3'UTR of the TCRA and TCRB mRNA, which was responsible for their specific translational stimulation, during T cell activation. Surprisingly in this study, the eIF3 association with mRNA occurs near polyadenylation signals in NPC, independently of cell differentiation status. This compelling evidence suggests a general mechanism of translation control by eIF3 in NPC. This observation brings back the old concept of mRNA circularization with new arguments, independent of PABP and eIF4G interaction. Finally, the discussion adequately describes the potential technical limitations of the present study compared to previous ones by the same group, due to the use of Quick-irCLIP as opposed to the PAR-CLIP/thiouridine.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) These data were obtained from an unusual cell type, limiting the generalizability of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that unraveling the mechanism employed by eIF3 at the mRNA 3’-UTR termini might be better studied in a stable cell line rather than in primary cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) This study lacks a clear explanation for the increased translation associated with NPC differentiation, as eIF3 binding is observed in both differentiated and undifferentiated NPC. For example, I find a kind of inconsistency between changes in Riboseq density (Figure 3B) and changes in protein synthesis (Figure 1D). Thus, the title overstates a modest correlation between eIF3 binding and important changes in protein synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Riboseq data and RNASeq data are not on absolute scales when comparing across cell conditions. They are normalized internally, so increases in for example RPF in Figure 3B are relative to the bulk RPF in a given condition. By contrast, the changes in protein synthesis measured in Figure 1D is closer to an absolute measure of protein synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This is illustrated by the candidate selection that supports this demonstration. Looking at Figure 3B, ID2, and SNAT2 mRNA are not part of the High TE transcripts (in red). In contrast, the increase in mRNA abundance could explain a proportionally increased association with eIF3 as well as with ribosomes. The example of increased protein abundance of these best candidates is overall weak and uncertain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that using TE as the criterion for defining increased eIF3 association would not be correct. By “highly translated” we only mean to convey the extent of protein synthesis, i.e. increases in ribosome protected fragments (RPF), rather than the translational efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Despite several attempts (chemical and UV cross-linking) to identify eIF3 partners in NPC such as PABP, PAIP1, or proteins from the 40S, the authors could not provide any evidence for such a mechanism consistent with the closed-loop model. Overall, this rather descriptive study lacks mechanistic insight (eIF3 binding partners).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it will be important to identify the molecular mechanism used by eIF3 to engage the termini of mRNA 3’-UTRs. Nevertheless, the identification of eIF3 crosslinking to that location in mRNAs is new, and we think will stimulate new experiments in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Finally, the authors suspect a potential impact of technical improvement provided by QuickirCLIP, that could have been addressed rather than discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree a side-by-side comparison of eIF3 crosslinks captured by PAR-CLIP versus QuickirCLIP will be an important experiment to do. However, NPCs or other primary cells may not be the best system for the comparison. We think using an established cell line might be more informative, to control for effects such as 4-thiouridine toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The Western blot signals for SLC38A2 and ID2 are close to the membrane background and little convincing. Size markers are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these antibodies are not great. They are the best we could find, unfortunately. We have included originals of all western blots and gels as supplementary information. It’s important to note that the Riboseq data for ID2 and SLC38A2 are consistent with the western blots. See Figure 3C and Figure 3–figure supplement 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1 appears to present data from a single experiment. This is far less than ideal considering the minor differences measured.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. This is a representative experiment showing the early time course. We have added a second experiment with two different treatments that show the same pattern in the puromycin assay, in Figure 1–figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3F: One wonders what this would look like if TE was plotted instead of RPF. Figure 3 - Figure Supplement 4 seems to show something along those lines. However, the data are not mentioned in the main results section are quite unclear. Why are data separated into TE high and low? Doesn't TE high in differentiated cells equal TE low in undifferentiated cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Note that in Figure 3B, n=6300 genes show no change in TE upon differentiation, compared to a total of n=2127 that show a change in TE, with most of those changes not very large. We have now replotted Figure 3F comparing irCLIP read counts in 3’-UTRs to RPF read counts, which shows a significant positive correlation, regardless of whether we look at undifferentiated or differentiated NPCs (See Figure 3F and a new Figure 3– figure supplement 4A). We also compare irCLIP reads in 3’-UTRs to TE values, which show no correlation (See Figure 3G and Figure 3–figure supplement 4B).</p><p>Figure 3-figure supplement 4 was actually a response to a previous round of review (at PLOS Biology) to a rather technical question from a reviewer. We think this figure and associated text should be removed. Instead, we now include supplementary tables with the processed RPF and TE values, for reference (Supplemental files 4-6). We omitted these in the original submission when they should have been included. We also abandoned comparing undifferentiated and differentiated NPCs, and instead look directly at irCLIP reads vs. RPFs or TE, regardless of NPC state, as noted above (Figure 3F, G, and Figure 3–figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 3C: The data should be plotted on the same y-axis scale. This would make a visual assessment of the differences in mRNA and RFP levels more intuitive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have rescaled the plots as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The quality of the Western blots in several figures is quite poor. Notably, Figure 1C seems to be a composite gel, as each blot appears to come from a different gel. Additionally, in Supplementary Figure 1A, there is only a single data point, yet the authors indicate that this image is representative of multiple assays. The lack of error bars in this figure raises a question vis-a-vis the reproducibility of the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We now include all the original gels as supplementary information. As noted above, the antibodies for ID2 and SLC38A2 are not great, we agree. And as we noted above, the Riboseq data for ID2 and SLC38A2 are consistent with the western blots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For the top 500 targets of undifferentiated and differentiated NPCs in the Quick-irCLIP assay, the manuscript does not clarify how many targets are common and how many are unique to each condition. This information is important for understanding the extent of overlap and differentiation-specific interactions of eIF3 with mRNAs. Providing this data would strengthen the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>There are 449 of the top 500 hits in common between undifferentiated and differentiated NPCs. We have now added this information to the text, to add clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript does not provide detailed percentages or numbers regarding the overlap between iCLIP and APA-Seq peaks. Clarifying this overlap, particularly in terms of how many of the APA sites are also targets of eIF3, would bolster the understanding of how these two datasets converge to support the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a difficult calculation to make, due to the fact that APA-Seq reads are generally much longer than the Quick-irCLIP reads. This is why we focused instead on quantifying the percent of Quick-irCLIP peaks (which are more narrow) overlap with predicted polyadenylation sequences, in Figure 2-figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Perform Quick-irCLIP in HEK293 cells to infer technical limitations and/or to generalize the model. The authors will then compare again eIF3 binding site in Jurkat, HEK293, and NPC.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an experiment we plan to do for a future publication, given that we would want to repeat both Quick-irCLIP and PAR-CLIP at the same time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Select mRNA candidates with high or low TE changes and analyze eIF3 binding and RPF density and protein abundance along NPC differentiation to support the role of eIF3 binding in stimulating translation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree looking at time courses in more depth would be interesting. However, this would require substantial experimentation, which is better suited to a future study. Furthermore, now that we have moved away from comparing undifferentiated NPCs and differentiated NPCs when examining TE and RPF values (Figure 3 and Figure 3–figure supplement 4), we think the results now support a more general mechanism of translation reflected in the irCLIP 3’-UTR vs. RPF correlation, independent of NPC state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Analyze the interaction of eIF3 with eIF4G and other known partners. This will really provide an improvement to the manuscript. The lack of interaction between eIF3 and the 40S is quite surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree more work needs to be done on the mechanistic side. These are experiments we think would be best to carry out in a stable cell line in the future, rather than primary cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Perform Oligo-dT pulldown (or cap column if possible) and analyze the relative association of PABP, eIF3, and eIF4F on mRNA in NPC versus HEK293. This will clarify whether this mechanism of mRNA translation is specific to NPC or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We are uncertain how it would be possible to deconvolute all the possible ways to interpret results from such an experiment.
