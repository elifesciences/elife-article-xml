pulmonary TB. We developed a genetically defined sst1-susceptible mouse model that uniquely reproduces a defining feature of human TB: the development of necrotic lung granulomas and determined that the sst1-susceptible phenotype was driven by the aberrant macrophage activation. This study demonstrates that the aberrant response of the sst1-susceptible macrophages to prolonged stimulation with TNF is primarily driven by conflicting Myc and antioxidant response pathways leading to a coordinated failure (1) to properly sequester intracellular iron and (2) to activate ferroptosis inhibitor enzymes. Consequently, iron-mediated lipid peroxidation fueled superinduction of Ifnβ and sustained the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway hyperactivity that locked the sst1-susceptible macrophages in a state of unresolving stress and compromised their resistance to Mtb. The accumulation of the aberrantly activated, stressed, macrophages within the granuloma microenvironment led to the local failure of anti-tuberculosis immunity and tissue necrosis. The upregulation of the Myc pathway in peripheral blood cells of human TB patients was significantly associated with poor outcomes of TB treatment. Thus, Myc dysregulation in activated macrophages results in an aberrant macrophage activation and represents a novel target for host-directed TB therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group

pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Orgeur and Brosch, 2018</xref>). It currently colonizes approximately a quarter of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). Most Mtb-infected people develop latent TB, in which the host responses either eliminate or sequester the bacteria inside a granuloma structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). However, about 5–10% of Mtb-infected individuals will eventually develop active TB either within a year after the primary infection or later in their life after re-activation of persistent bacteria or re-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Behr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Drain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horsburgh and Rubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Reichler et al., 2018</xref>). A plethora of genetic, developmental, and environmental factors contribute to TB progression in individuals that initially resisted the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Simmons et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Infection of the lung is central to Mtb’s evolutionary success because it allows the pathogen to spread among human hosts via aerosols.

Necrotic lesions are the major pathologic manifestation of pulmonary TB ranging from central necrosis in organized granulomas during primary TB to massive necrotizing pneumonia and the formation of cavities in post-primary pulmonary TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hunter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). The necrotic lung lesions develop in immunocompetent hosts despite the presence of active T-cell-mediated immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Existing mechanistic concepts explaining the lesion necrosis fall into two main categories: (i) <italic>inadequate</italic> local immunity that allows exuberant bacterial replication and production of virulence factors that drive tissue necrosis, vs. (ii) <italic>excessive</italic> effector immunity that results in immune-mediated tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ernst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">O’Garra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ogongo and Ernst, 2023</xref>). Although both scenarios are credible, they are mechanistically distinct and would require different therapeutic strategies. Therefore, in-depth understanding of mechanisms of pulmonary TB progression in immunocompetent hosts is necessary for accurate patient stratification and for the development of personalized approaches to immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">DiNardo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Mouse models have been successfully used for mechanistic studies of Mtb infection, although classical inbred mouse strains routinely used in TB research, such as C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c, do not develop human-like necrotic TB lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apt and Kramnik, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, even in these models, Mtb predominantly replicates in the lungs irrespective of the route of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">North and Jung, 2004</xref>). Mouse models that recapitulate the necrotization of pulmonary TB lesions have also been developed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kramnik and Beamer, 2016</xref>).

Of note, the hyperactivity of the IFN-I pathway has been associated with TB susceptibility and the disease progression both in human patients and experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Donovan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">O’Garra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stanley et al., 2007</xref>). However, mechanisms that underlie the IFN-I hyperactivity and their roles in susceptibility to TB were insufficiently elucidated. Thus, the <italic>sst1</italic>-mediated susceptibility recapitulates the morphologic and mechanistic hallmarks of human TB disease and provides a genetically defined mouse model to study both the upstream mechanisms responsible for the IFN-I pathway hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>) and its downstream consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kotov et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>sst1</italic> locus encodes the Sp110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pan et al., 2005</xref>) and Sp140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ji et al., 2021</xref>) proteins – known as interferon-inducible chromatin binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020a</xref>).

It was suggested that Sp140 plays a dominant role in TB susceptibility, via direct regulation of the interferon beta gene (<italic>Ifnb1</italic>) mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Witt et al., 2024</xref>).

The naive macrophage populations of both backgrounds were similar.

Subpopulations sp1 and sp2 of the B6 and B6.Sst1S macrophages were closely related and were characterized by the upregulation of cell division pathways in both backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Quantitative microscopy confirmed that at 12 hr of TNF stimulation, the cytoplasmic and nuclear Nrf2 levels significantly increased in B6 but not in B6.Sst1S BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, the levels of <italic>Nfe2l1/2</italic> mRNA induced by TNF were higher in the mutant macrophages, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, we measured the rates of Nrf2 protein degradation 6–8 hr after TNF stimulation but found no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).</p><p>Using EMSA, we demonstrated that binding activity of nuclear Nrf2 to its target DNA at 8 and 12 hr after TNF stimulation was greater in the resistant B6 BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). To identify core pathways controlled by the <italic>sst1</italic> locus during this critical period, we compared global mRNA expression profiles of the B6 and B6.Sst1S macrophages after 12 hr of TNF stimulation using bulk RNA-seq. This analysis confirmed that the <italic>Sp110</italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic> genes were strongly upregulated by TNF stimulation exclusively in the B6 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of genes differentially expressed between TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S and B6 macrophages at this critical junction revealed that the IFN response, Myc, E2F target gene, Hypoxia, UV response, and DNA repair pathways were upregulated in the mutant macrophages, while the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, cholesterol homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome, and lysosome pathways were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Functional pathway profiling using KEGG and Reactome databases also highlighted the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and cellular senescence in mutant macrophages. In contrast, the wild-type macrophages upregulated genes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of ferroptosis, and peroxisome function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Supporting these findings, the total antioxidant capacity of the B6 macrophages after TNF stimulation increased to significantly higher levels, as compared to the B6.Sst1S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factor binding site analysis of genes specifically upregulated by TNF in B6, but not B6.Sst1S, macrophages (B6-specific cluster) revealed an enrichment of Nfe2l1/Nfe2l2, Bach1, and Mafk sequence motifs, that is binding sites of transcription factors regulating AOD. In contrast, overrepresentation of E2F, Egr1, and Pbx3 transcription factor binding sites was found for genes in the Sst1S-specific cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). A master regulator analysis using Virtual Inference of Protein Activity by Enriched Regulon Analysis (VIPER) algorithm also revealed a key role for Nfe2l1/2 (NF-E2-like) transcription factors (TFs) as regulators of genes differentially induced by TNF in B6 and B6.Sst1S BMDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate this inference, we analyzed the expression of a gene ontology set ‘response to oxidative stress’ (GO0006979, 416 genes) and observed clear separation of these genes in two clusters in a <italic>sst1</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This analysis demonstrated that the response to oxidative stress in the <italic>sst1</italic> mutant macrophages was dysregulated, but not paralyzed. For example, the upregulation of well-known Nrf2 target genes Heme oxygenase 1 (<italic>Hmox1</italic>) and (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1) (<italic>Nqo1</italic>) was similar in B6 and B6.Sst1S BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>, respectively).</p><p>A subset of antioxidant defense genes whose expression was concordant with <italic>Sp110</italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic> in B6 macrophages represented genes that are known to be involved in iron storage (ferritin light and heavy chains, <italic>Ftl</italic> and <italic>Fth</italic>), ROS detoxification and maintenance of redox state (<italic>Cat, G6pdx, Sod2, Gstm1, Gpx4, Prdx6, Srxn1, Txn2,</italic> and <italic>Txnrd1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).

Both the ferritin light (<italic>Ftl</italic>) and heavy (<italic>Fth</italic>) chain genes were dysregulated in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S BMDMs. While the <italic>Fth</italic> mRNA was upregulated by TNF in B6 BMDMs, it remained at a basal level in the B6.Sst1S cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The <italic>Ftl</italic> mRNA level was significantly reduced after TNF stimulation in B6.Sst1S macrophages but remained at the basal level in B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Accordingly, the expression of Ftl protein was reduced in B6.Sst1S BMDMs after 12 hr of TNF stimulation, and both Ftl and Fth proteins were reduced at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In parallel, the levels of Gpx1 and Gpx4 proteins were also substantially reduced by 24 hr in B6.Sst1S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) protein plays a central role in preventing ferroptosis because of its unique ability to reduce hydroperoxide in complex membrane phospholipids and, thus, limit self-catalytic lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S BMDMs had reduced intracellular iron storage capacity accompanied by the decline of the major lipid peroxidation inhibitor Gpx4. Accordingly, we observed increases in an intracellular labile iron pool (LIP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), an intracellular accumulation of oxidized lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>)<bold>,</bold> a toxic terminal lipid peroxidation (LPO) products malondialdehyde (MDA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The levels of the LIP and LPO remained significantly elevated in B6.Sst1S macrophages after 48 hr of TNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that their deficiency in the TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S mutants may lead to the upregulation of silenced transposons and, thus, trigger the Ifnβ upregulation via intracellular RNA sensors, that is by an autonomous mechanism unrelated to the AOD dysregulation. We examined the transcriptomes of B6 and B6.Sst1S macrophages before and after TNF stimulation for the presence of persistent viruses or transposons using a custom bioinformatics pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). No exogenous mouse viral RNAs were detected. A select set of mouse LTR-containing endogenous retroviruses (ERVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jayewickreme et al., 2021</xref>), and non-retroviral LINE L1 elements were expressed at a basal level before and after TNF stimulation, but their levels in the B6.Sst1S BMDMs were similar to or lower than those seen in B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). We also tested the accumulation of dsRNA using deep sequencing of macrophage small RNAs and failed to detect evidence of transposon-derived dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We concluded from these findings that the majority of the basal transposon RNAs in macrophages exist primarily as single-stranded mRNAs that evade triggering interferon pathway. The above analyses allowed us to exclude the overexpression of persistent viral or transposon RNAs as a primary mechanism of the IFN-I pathway hyperactivity.</p><p>Taken together, the above experiments allowed us to reject the hypothesis that IFN-I hyperactivity caused the <italic>sst1</italic>-dependent AOD dysregulation. In contrast, they established that the hyperactivity of the IFN-I pathway in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages was itself driven by the <italic>initial</italic> dysregulation of AOD and iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. During prolonged TNF stimulation, however, the IFN-I pathway was upregulated, possibly via ROS/LPO-dependent JNK activation, and acted as a potent amplifier of lipid peroxidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hyperactivity of Myc in susceptible macrophages after TNF stimulation fuels lipid peroxidation</title><p>We wanted to determine whether the AOD genes were regulated by the <italic>sst1</italic>-encoded genes directly or indirectly via an intermediary regulator. Previously, we identified two transcription factors whose binding activities were exclusively upregulated in the susceptible macrophages after 12 hr of TNF stimulation: Myc and HSF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>). The bulk RNA-seq analysis at this timepoint (12 hr) also demonstrated the upregulation of Myc pathway along with E2F target genes and stress responses specifically in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S BMDMs, as compared to B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Of note, the scRNA-seq analysis above also demonstrated the association of Myc and stress response pathways in the mutant cells at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that in susceptible macrophages, Myc might be involved in the dysregulation of AOD and iron storage.</p><p> First, we observed that Myc was regulated in an <italic>sst1</italic>-dependent manner: in TNF-stimulated B6 wild-type BMDMs, <italic>c-Myc</italic> mRNA was downregulated, while in the susceptible macrophages, c-<italic>Myc</italic> mRNA was upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The c-Myc protein levels were also higher in the B6.Sst1S cells in unstimulated BMDMs and 6–12 hr of TNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Next, we tested whether suppression of Myc activity could ‘normalize’ the susceptible phenotype using Myc-Max dimerization inhibitor 10058-F4 (F4). Indeed, this treatment increased the levels of Fth and Ftl proteins in TNF-stimulated susceptible macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and decreased the LIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Here, we found that the prolonged TNF stimulation of the <italic>sst1</italic> mutant macrophages led to the IFN-I-dependent accumulation of toxic low-molecular-weight lipid peroxidation products MDA and 4-HNE adducts. The <italic>Ifnb1</italic> superinduction also resulted in the downstream activation of the integrated stress response markers Trb3 and Chac1. Thus, the IFN-I pathway did not initiate, but amplified the AOD dysregulation.</p><p>Among pathways upregulated in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages was the Myc pathway. In actively growing cells, Myc promotes ribosome biogenesis, cap-dependent protein translation, and also suppresses expression of ferritins, most likely to provide labile iron for anabolic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Torti and Torti, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). Myc hyperactivity is associated with cell senescence and maladaptive activity in the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alic and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hofmann et al., 2015</xref>). In macrophages, Myc promotes the development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pello et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have shown that Myc hyperactivity was responsible for the initiation of the aberrant macrophage activation trajectory leading to increased intracellular labile iron pool (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) and lipid peroxidation. Myc inhibition also prevented the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> superinduction and activation of the integrated stress response markers <italic>Trb3</italic> and <italic>Chac1</italic>.</p><p>The above findings allowed us to reconstruct the regulatory cascade driving the aberrant macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). During prolonged TNF stimulation of the B6.Sst1S macrophages, Myc hyperactivity and the impairment of AOD lead to a coordinated downregulation of the Ferritin heavy and light chains and lipid peroxidation inhibitor genes. In the absence of terminators, the intracellular peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is catalyzed by ferrous iron (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) via the Fenton reaction and proceeds in an autocatalytic manner damaging cell membranes containing tightly packed PUFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mortensen et al., 2023</xref>). This autocatalytic lipid peroxidation fuels persistent oxidative stress and, likely, sustains the activity of JNK. Downstream, <italic>Ifnb1</italic> superinduction in B6.Sst1S macrophages leads to the upregulation of interferon-inducible genes, including PKR. The subsequent PKR-dependent ISR activation leads to the upregulation of Chac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>) - a glutathione degrading enzyme gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Crawford et al., 2015</xref>) that further compromises the AOD. This stepwise escalation eventually locks the susceptible macrophages in a state of unresolving stress, which is maintained by continuous stimulation with TNF and boosted by IFN-I signaling. Thus, during prolonged stimulation of the B6.Sst1S macrophages with TNF, the autocatalytic lipid peroxidation and IFN-I hyperactivity form a positive feedback loop sustaining the unresolving oxidative stress. Unlike ferroptosis, however, this did not immediately result in massive cell death but sustained a state of the aberrant macrophage activation that reduced their ability to control Mtb both in a cell-autonomous and a T-cell-dependent manner. In contrast, in the wild type B6 macrophages, Myc was inhibited more readily, and ferritin proteins were upregulated to sequester free iron in parallel with the upregulation of Nrf2. Their combined effects increased stress resilience of activated macrophages. Recent in vivo studies also demonstrated that ferritins and antioxidant pathways were upregulated in inflammatory macrophages isolated from Mtb-infected wild type B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pisu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of B6 and B6.Sst1S macrophage responses to TNF.</title><p>Common for B6 and B6.Sst1S: 1.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that a specialized translation machinery is involved in context-dependent regulation of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shi and Barna, 2015</xref>). Ribosome modifications, such as protein composition and rRNA methylation, were shown to be involved in control of selective IRES-dependent translation in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mazumder et al., 2003</xref>) and regulation of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Basu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Poddar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Poddar et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, enrichment of Sp100 and Sp110 proteins in ribosomes was observed during B6 macrophage activation with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Susanto et al., 2023</xref>). These findings suggest that the Sp110 protein may be involved in fine-tuning of protein biosynthesis in activated macrophages favoring the IRES-dependent Nrf2 translation.</p><p>More generally, the Sp110 and Sp140 proteins may serve as context-dependent regulators (possibly, both as sensors and tunable controllers) of macrophage activation and stress resilience via a coordinated upregulation of AOD and downregulation of Myc and IFN-I pathways. Hypothetically, downregulating this mechanism may also play physiological roles in eliminating infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rothchild et al., 2019</xref>) or transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gorbunova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Leonova et al., 2013</xref>). By coordinately increasing the free iron pool for non-enzymatic free radical generation and simultaneously decreasing the buffering capacity of intracellular antioxidants, this activation state promotes generation and unopposed spread of free radicals. However, the inappropriate activation of its built-in amplification mechanisms, such as IFN-I, may drive immunopathologies in the face of chronic stimulation, as occurs with Mtb infection.</p><p>In the mouse model of chronic TB infection, lipid peroxidation products did not appear to significantly affect the long-term Mtb survival: the mycobacterial cell wall and multiple mycobacterial antioxidant pathways exist to allow for the survival of, at least, a fraction of mycobacterial population in highly oxidative environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pacl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Piddington et al., 2001</xref>). The accumulation of stressed macrophages and LPO products within TB lesions, however, gradually degraded local immunity that allowed for Mtb replication and provided a fodder for growing mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mahamed et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in the mouse model that recapitulates key pathomorphological features of pulmonary TB in human patients, the aberrant macrophage activation state was responsible for both the inflammatory tissue damage and the failure of local immunity.</p><p>The above mechanistic dissection of the aberrant macrophage activation drivers provides therapeutic targets for interrupting their vicious cycle in vivo. For example, monocytes recruited to inflammatory lesions may be particularly vulnerable to the dysregulation of Myc. Prior to terminal differentiation within an inflammatory milieu, these immature cells undergo several cycles of replication. Cell growth requires labile iron that is provided by Myc via downregulation of ferritins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Torti and Torti, 2002</xref>). Recently, we found that lung epithelial cells embedded within TB lesions express CSF1 – a macrophage growth factor known to stimulate Myc expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yabaji et al., 2025b</xref>). Thus, the coincidence of TNF and CSF1 – Myc stimulation may initiate and propagate the aberrant activation state in monocytes recruited to chronic pulmonary TB lesions. Similarly, growth factors produced locally within inflamed tissues may sustain Myc hyperactivity and the aberrant activation state of monocytes/macrophages in other chronic inflammatory pathologies.</p><p>Further understanding of the specific roles of the SP100 family proteins, as well as other signals and checkpoints that regulate the pathological macrophage activation state transitions, will allow for their rational therapeutic modulation - to boost host defenses and mitigate the collateral tissue damage.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Igor Kramnik (ikramnik@bu.edu).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Mouse strains (B6J.C3-<italic>Sst1<sup>C3HeB/Fej</sup></italic>Krmn, B6.Sst1S,<italic>Ifnb1</italic>-YFP) and all unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.

In brief, tyramide signaling amplification (TSA) was used in an iterative approach to covalently bind Opal fluorophores (Akoya Bioscience, Marlborough, MA) to tyrosine residues in tissue sections, with subsequent heat stripping of primary-secondary antibody complexes until all antibodies were developed. Before multiplex-IHC was performed, each antibody was individually optimized using a single-plex-IHC assay using an appropriate positive control tissue. Optimizations were performed to determine ideal primary antibody dilution, sequential order of antibody development, assignment of each primary antibody to an Opal fluorophore, and fluorophore dilution. Once an optimal protocol was established, 5 µm tissue sections were cut from FFPE lung arrays. All Opal TSA-conjugated fluorophore reactions took place for 20 min. Fluorescent slides were counterstained with spectral DAPI (Akoya Biosciences) for 16 min before being mounted with ProLong gold antifade (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Antibodies utilized in 4-plex 5 color (DAPI counterstained) analysis included: Iba1, iNOS, YFP, Chac1, and P-c-Jun.

After optimizing view settings, annotations around the entire tissue were created to define analysis area using the flood tool, and artifacts were excluded using the exclusion pen tool. To analyze lesions independently, a tissue classifier that uses a machine-learning approach was utilized to identify lesions. The outputs from this classifier were annotations for each lesion, which were then isolated into independent layers, which were analyzed separately from other layers. For quantifying myeloid markers in multiplexes, an algorithm called the HALO (v3.4.2986.151, Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM, USA) Area Quantification (AQ) module was created and finetuned to quantify the immunoreactivity for all targets. Thresholds were set to define positive staining based on a real-time tuning feature. AQ outputted the percentage of total area displaying immunoreactivity across the annotated whole slide scan in micrometers squared (μm²). AQ output the total percentage positive for each phenotype. AQ and HP algorithms were run across all layers for each individual lesion and exported as a.csv file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-32"><title>Spatial transcriptomics</title><p>To perform spatial transcriptomics analysis, we used the Nanostring GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) system (Nanostring, Seattle, WA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Danaher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Merritt et al., 2020</xref>). To identify pathways dominating early vs. late (advanced) lesions, we selected lungs from 2 mice with paucibacillary early lesions and 2 mice with advanced multibacillary lesions with necrotic areas. Slides were stained with fluorescent CD45-, pan-keratin-specific antibodies, and Iba1-specific antibodies (sc-32725, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) and DAPI. Diseased regions of interest (ROI) for expression profiling of Iba1 + cells were selected to focus on myeloid-rich areas avoiding areas of micronecrosis and tertiary lymphoid tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Eight ROI each of normal lung, early and late lesions (respectively) were studied. The profiling used the Mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) panel which targets ~21,000 + transcripts for mouse protein coding genes plus ERCC-negative controls to profile the whole transcriptome, excluding uninformative high expressing targets such as ribosomal subunits. A subsequent study focused on gene expression within macrophages identified by Iba1 labeling in lung sections showing uncontrolled (advanced multibacillary) lesions in comparison to controlled (paucibacillary stage). Samples from each ROI were packaged into a library for sequencing (NextSeq550, Illumina) following the procedure recommended by Nanostring. After sequencing, the data analysis workflow began with QC evaluation of each ROI based on thresholds for number of raw and aligned reads, sequencing saturation, negative control probe means, and number of nuclei and surface area. Background correction is performed using subtraction of the mean of negative probe counts. Q3 normalization (recommended by Nanostring) results in scaling of all ROIs to the same value for their 3rd quartile value. The count matrix was imported into the Qlucore Genomics Explorer software package (Qlucore, Stockholm, Sweden) and log2 transformed for further analysis. Statistical analysis was then performed to identify differentially expressed genes (typically unpaired t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg control for FDR rate at q&lt;.05). Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from comparisons of distinct stages were further analyzed for enrichment of pathways or predicted transcription factors using the Enrichr online tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Xie et al., 2021</xref>).

This locus is known to affect expression of IFN and synergizes with Myc to potentiate infectivity. Using a variety of molecular expression and imaging techniques, the authors demonstrate that mice harboring an sst1 transgene (compared to B6 controls) are highly susceptible to TB infection via a mechanism involving loss of antioxidant defense systems, the down regulation of key antioxidant genes and ferritin controlling intracellular iron levels. The combination of increased iron plus decreased antioxidant defense systems in turn increases lipid peroxidation and downstream sequelae. Inhibition of peroxidation diminishes infectivity increases ferritin levels. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that Myc activation potentiates this process and that down regulation of NRF2 antioxidant defenses accompany potentiated infectivity. Increased peroxidation products (4-HNE) may activate the ASK1/JNK system leading to IFNb superinduction and diminished macrophage viability thereby diminishing ability to withstand TB infection. Extending these findings, additional mouse models plus some work in humans supports the peroxidation hypothesis. Overall, the work is significant for it introduces a molecular basis for TB infectivity and presents a potential novel therapeutic opportunity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Strengths of this study include a multi-omic analysis of infectivity combining gene expression analysis with biochemical and cell biological evaluation.</p><p>(2) Novel identification of an iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation based mechanism for why the sst1 locus is linked to TB infection.</p><p>(3) Parallels to human biology are included via analysis of Myc upregulation in peripheral blood from patients.</p><p>(4) Appropriate statistical analysis</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Lipid peroxidation is a broad phenotype process and the authors honed in on 4-HNE dependent processes as a likely mechanism because they can measure 4-HNE conjugated proteins. However, lipid peroxidation is a complex phenomenon and the work presented herein is largely descriptive.</p><p>(2) The authors continually refer to increased 4HNE while they do not measure this 9 carbon lipid, they actually measure 4-HNE conjugated proteins immunochemically.</p><p>(3) The authors do not distinguish between increased protein-HNE adducts and increased membrane peroxidation (or both) as mechanistically linked to infectivity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

Extending previous work, the authors specifically focus on delineating the molecular mechanisms driving aberrant oxidative stress in TNF-activated B6.Sst1S macrophages that has been associated with impaired control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The authors use scRNAseq of bone marrow-derived macrophages to further characterize distinctions between B6.Sst1S and control macrophages and ascribe distinct trajectories upon TNF stimulation. Combined with results using inhibitory antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in in vitro experimentation, the authors propose that TNF-induced protracted c-Myc expression in B6.Sst1S macrophages disables the cellular defense against oxidative stress, which promotes intracellular accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, fueled at least in part by overexpression of type I IFNs by these cells. Using lung tissue sections from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected B6.Sst1S mice, the authors suggest that the presence of a greater number of cells with lipid peroxidation products in lung lesions with high counts of stained <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> are indicative of progressive loss of host control due to the TNF-induced dysregulation of macrophage responses to oxidative stress. In patients with active tuberculosis disease, the authors suggest that peripheral blood gene expression indicative of increased Myc activity was associated with treatment failure.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>The authors describe differences in protein expression, phosphorylation or binding when referring to Fig 2A-C, 2G, 3D, 5B, 5C. However, such differences are not easily apparent or very subtle and, in some cases, confounded by differences in resting cells (e.g. pASK1 Fig 3L; c-Myc Fig 5B) as well as analyses across separate gels/blots (e.g. Fig 3K, Fig 5B). Quantitative analyses across different independent experiments with adequate statistical analyses are required to strengthen the associated conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated our Western blots as follows:</p><p>(1) Densitometery of normalized bands is included above each lane (Fig.2A-C; Fig.3C-D and 3K; Fig.4A-B; Fig.5B,C,I,J). New data in Fig.3K is added to highlight differences between B6 and B6.Sst1S at individual timepoints after TNF stimulation. In Fig.5I we added new data comparing Myc levels in B6 and B6.Sst1S with and without JNK inhibitor and updated the results accordingly. New Fig.3K clearly demonstrates the persistent activation of p-cJun and pAsk1 at 24 and 36h of TNF stimulation. In Fig.5B we clearly demonstrate that Myc levels were higher in B6.Sst1S after 12 h of TNF stimulation. At 6h, however, the basal differences in Myc levels are consistently higher in B6.Sst1S and the induction by TNF is 1.6-fold similar in both backgrounds. We noted this in the text.</p><p>(2) A representative experiment is shown in individual panels and the corresponding figure legend contains information on number of biological repeats. Each Western blot was repeated 2 – 4 times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The representative images of fluorescence microscopy in Fig 3H, 4H, 5H, S3C, S3I, S5A, S6A seem to suggest that under some conditions the fluorescence signal is located just around the nucleus rather than absent or diminished from the cytoplasm. It is unclear whether this reflects selective translocation of targets across the cell, morphological changes of macrophages in culture in response to the various treatments, or variations in focal point at which images were acquired. Control images (e.g. cellular actin, DIC) should be included for clarification. If cell morphology changes depending on treatments, how was this accounted for in the quantitative analyses? In addition, negative controls validating specificity of fluorescence signals would be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusion of higher LPO production is based on several parameters: 4-HNE staining, measurements of MDA in cell lysates and oxidized lipids using BODIPY C11. Taken together they demonstrate significant and reproducible increase in LPO accumulation in TNFstimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages. This excludes imaging artefact related to unequal 4-HNE distribution noted by the reviewer. In fact, we also noted that the 4-HNE was spread within cell body of B6.Sst1S macrophages and confirmed it using co-staining with tubulin, as suggested by the reviewer (new Suppl.Fig.3A). Since low molecular weight LPO products, such as MDA and 4-HNE, traverse cell membranes, it is unlikely that they will be strictly localized to a specific membrane bound compartment. However, we agree that at lower concentrations, there might be some restricted localization, explaining a visible perinuclear ring of 4-HNE staining in B6 macrophages. This phenomenon may be explained just by thicker cytoplasm surrounding nucleus in activated macrophages spread on adherent plastic surface or by proximity to specific organelles involved in generation or clearance of LPO products and definitively warrants further investigation.</p><p>We also included images of non-stimulated cells in Fig.3H, Suppl.Fig.3A and 3E. We used multiple fields for imaging and quantified fluorescence signals (Suppl. Fig.3D and 3F, Suppl.Fig.4G, Suppl.Fig.6A and B).</p><p>We used negative controls without primary antibodies for the initial staining optimization, but did not include it in every experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To interpret the evaluation on the hierarchy of molecular mechanisms in B6.Sst1S macrophages, comparative analyses with B6 control cells should be included (e.g. Fig 4C-I, Fig 5, Fig 6B, E-M, S6C, S6E-F). This will provide weight to the conclusions that the dysregulated processes are specifically associated with the susceptibility of B6.Sst1S macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>Understanding the <italic>sst1</italic>-mediated effects on macrophage activation is the focus of our previously published studies Bhattacharya et al., JCI, 2021 and this manuscript. The data comparing B6 and B6.Sst1S macrophage are presented in Fig.1, Fig.2, Fig.3, Fig.4, Fig.5A-C, I and J, Fig.6A-C, 6J and corresponding supplemental figures 1, 2, 3, 4A and B, Suppl.Fig.5, Suppl.Fig.6C, Suppl.Fig.7A-D,7F.</p><p>Once we identified the aberrantly activated pathways in the B6.Sst1S, we used specific inhibitors to correct the aberrant response in B6.Sst1S.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All experiments using inhibitory antibodies require comparison to the effect of a matched isotype control in the same experiment (e.g. Fig 3J, 4F, G, I; 6L, 6M, S3G, S6F).</p></disp-quote><p>Isotype control for IFNAR1 blockade were included in Fig.3M, Fig.4C-E, Fig.6L-M Suppl.Fig.4F-G, 7I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments using inhibitors require inclusion of an inhibitor-only control to assess inhibitor effects on unstimulated cells (e.g. Fig 4I, 5D-I)</p></disp-quote><p>Inhibitor effects on non-stimulated cells were included in Fig.5 D-H, Suppl.Fig.6A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 3K and Fig 5J appear to contain the same images for p-c-Jun and b-tubulin blots.</p></disp-quote><p>Fig.3K and 5J partially overlapped but had different focus – 3K has been updated to reflect the time course of stress kinase activation.

There is contradicting information on whether these tissues were collected at the same time post infection (week 14?) or whether the pauci-bacillary lesions were in lungs collected at earlier time points post infection (see Fig S8A). If the former, how do the authors conclude that multi-bacillary lesions are a progression from paucibacillary lesions and indicative of loss of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> control, especially if only one lesion type is observed in an individual host? If the latter, comparison between lesions will likely be dominated by temporal differences in the immune response to infection.</p><p>In either case, it is relevant to consider density, location, and cellular composition of lesions (see also comments on GeoMx spatial profiling). Is the macrophage number/density per tissue area comparable between pauci-bacillary and multi-bacillary lesions?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not collect lungs at the same time point. As described in greater detail in our preprints (Yabaji et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.28.640830">https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.28.640830</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695</ext-link>) pulmonary TB lesions in our model of slow TB progression are heterogeneous between the animals at the same timepoint, as observed in human TB patients and other chronic TB animal models. Therefore, we perform analyses of individual TB lesions that are classified by a certified veterinary pathologist in a blinded manner based on their morphology (H&amp;E) and acid fast staining of the bacteria, as depicted in Suppl.Fig.8. Currently it is impossible to monitor progression of individual lesions in mice. However, in mice TB is progressive disease and no healing and recovery from the disease have been observed in our studies or reported in literature. Therefore, we assumed that paucibacillary lesions preceded the multibacillary ones, and not vice versa, thus reflecting the disease progression. In our opinion, this conclusion most likely reflects the natural course of the disease. However, we edited the text : instead of disease progression we refer to paucibacillary and multibacillary lesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does 4HNE staining align with macrophages and if so, is it elevated compared to control mice and driven by TNF in the susceptible vs more resistant mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional staining and analyses to demonstrate the 4-HNE accumulation in CD11b+ myeloid cells of macrophage morphology. Non-necrotic lesions contain negligible proportion of neutrophils (Fig.7B, Suppl.Fig.9B). B6 mice do not develop advanced multibacillary TB lesions containing 4-HNE+ cells. Also, 4-HNE staining was localized to TB lesions and was not found in uninvolved lung areas of the infected mice, as shown in Suppl.Fig.9A (left panel).</p><p>It is well established that TNF plays a central role in the formation and maintenance of TB granulomas in humans and in all animal models. Therefore, TNF neutralization would lead to rapid TB progression, rapid Mtb growth and lesions destruction in both B6 and B6.Sst1S genetic backgrounds.</p><p>Pathway analysis of spatial transcriptomic data (Suppl.Fig.11) identified TNF signaling via NFkB among dominant pathways upregulated in multibacillary lesions, suggesting that the 4-HNE accumulation paralleled increased TNF signaling. In addition, in vivo other cytokines, including IFN-I, could activate macrophages and stimulate production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and lead to the accumulation of LPO products as shown in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be relevant to state how many independent lesions per host were sampled in both the multiplex IHC as well as the GeoMx data. Can the authors show the selected regions of interest in the tissue overview and in the analyses to appreciate within-host and across-host heterogeneity of lesions. The nature of the spatial transcriptomics platform used is such that the data are derived from tissue areas that contain more than just Iba1+ macrophages. At later stages of infection, the cellular composition of such macrophage-rich areas will be different when compared to lesions earlier in the infection process. Hence, gene expression profiles and differences between tissue regions cannot be attributed to macrophages in this tissue region but are more likely a reflection of a mix of cellular composition and per-cell gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We used Iba1 staining to identify macrophages in TB lesions and programmed GeoMx instrument to collect spatial transcriptomics probes from Iba1+ cells within ROIs. Also, we selected regions of interest (ROI) avoiding necrotic areas (depicted in Suppl.Fig.10). We agree that Iba1+ macrophage population is heterogenous – some Iba1+ cells are activated iNOS+ macrophages, other are iNOS-negative (Fig.7C and D, and Suppl.Fig.13A). Multibacillary lesions contain larger areas occupied by activated (iNOS+) macrophages (Fig.7D),</p><p>(Suppl.Fig.13B and 13F). Although the GeoMx spatial transcriptomic platform does not provide single cell resolution, it allowed us to compare populations of Iba1+ cells in paucibacillary and multibacillary TB lesions and to identify a shift in their overall activation pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is stated that loss of control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in multibacillary lesions was associated with &quot;downregulation of IFNg-inducible genes&quot;. If the authors base this on the tissue expression of individual genes, this requires further investigation to support such conclusion (also see comment on GeoMx above). Furthermore, how might this conclusion be compatible with significantly elevated iNOS+ cells (Fig 7D) in multibacillary lesions?</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrated that <italic>Ciita</italic> gene expression is specifically induced by IFN-gamma and is suppressed by IFN-I (Fig.6M).

The authors indicate that they have no information on disease severity, but it should perhaps not be assumed that treatment failure is indicative of poor host control of the infection. Perhaps independent analyses in separate cohort/data set can add strength and provide -additional insights (e.g. PMID: 35841871; PMID: 32451443, PMID: 17205474, PMID: 22872737).

On Y axis is area under curve (AUC) score for each gene set. The Myc upregulated gene set myc_up was identified among top gene sets associated with treatment failure using unbiased ssGSEA algorithm.

The upregulation of these pathways in human patients with poor TB treatment outcomes correlates with our findings in TB susceptible mice.

I am familiar with the interpretation of RNAseq analyses in human and mouse cells/tissues, but can provide only limited assessment of appropriateness of algorithms and analysis frameworks.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p><p>Yabaji et al. investigated the effects of BMDMs stimulated with TNF from both WT and B6.Sst1S mice, which have previously been identified to contain the sst1 locus conferring susceptibility to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. They identified that B6.Sst1S macrophages show a superinduction of IFNß, which might be caused by increased c-Myc expression, expanding on the mechanistic insights made by the same group (Bhattacharya et al. 2021). Furthermore, prolonged TNF stimulation led to oxidative stress, which WT BMDMs could compensate for by the activation of the antioxidant defense via NRF2. On the other hand, B6.Sst1S BMDMs lack the expression of SP110 and SP140, co-activators of NRF2, and were therefore subjected to maintained oxidative stress. Yabaji et al. could link those findings to in vivo studies by correlating the presence of stressed and aberrantly activated macrophages within granulomas to the failure of Mtb control, as well as the progression towards necrosis. As the knowledge regarding Mtb progression and necrosis of granulomas is not yet well understood, findings that might help provide novel therapy options for TB are crucial. Overall, the manuscript has interesting findings with regard to macrophage responses in <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>However, in its current form there are several shortcomings, both with respect to the precision of the experiments and conclusions drawn.</p><p>In particular (a) important controls are often missing, e.g. T-cells form non-immune mice in Fig. 6J, in F, effectivity of BCG in B6 mice in 6N; (b) single experiments are shown throughout the manuscript, in particular western blots and histology without proper quantification and statistics, this is absolutely not acceptable; (c) very few repetitions are shown in in vitro experiments, where there is no evidence for limitation in resources (usually not more than 3), it is not clear what &quot;independent experiment means&quot; - i.e. the robustness of the findings is questionable; (d) data are often normalized multiple times, e.g. in the case of qPCR, and the methods of normalization are not clear (what house-keeping gene exactly?);</p><p>Moreover, experiments regarding IFN I signaling (e.g. short term TNF treatment of BMDMs to analyze LPO, making sure that the reporter mouse for IFNß works in vivo) and c-Myc (e.g. the increase after M-CSF addition might impact on other analysis as well and the experiments should be adjusted to control for this effect; MYC expression in the human samples) should be carefully repeated and evaluated to draw correct conclusions.</p><p>In addition, we would like to strongly encourage the authors to more precisely outline the experimental set-ups and figure legends, so that the reader can easily understand and follow them. In other words: The legends are - in part very - incomplete. In addition, the authors should be mindful of gene names vs. protein names and italicize where appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate a very thorough evaluation of our manuscript by this reviewer. Their insightful comments helped us improve the manuscript. As outlined below in point-by-point responses (1) we added important controls including isotype control antibodies in IFNAR blocking experiments and non-vaccinated T cells in T cell – macrophage interactions experiments; updated figure legends to indicate number of repeated experiment where a representative experiment is shown, numbers of mouse lungs and individual lesions, methods of data normalization, where it was missing. We also explained our in vitro experimental design and how we analyzed and excluded effects of media change and fresh CSF1 addition, by using a rest period before TNF stimulation and Mtb infection. The data shown in Suppl. Fig. 6C (previously Suppl. Fig. 5B) demonstrate that Myc levels induced by CSF1 return to the basal level at 12 h after media change. Our detailed in vitro protocol that contains these details has been published (Yabaji et al., STAR Protocols, 2022). We added new data demonstrating the ROS and LPO production at 6h of TNF stimulation, while the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA super-induction occurred at 16 – 18 h, and edited the text to highlight these dynamics. The upregulation of Myc pathway in human samples does not necessarily mean the upregulation of Myc itself, it could be due to the dysregulation of downstream pathways. The upregulation of Myc pathway in the blood transcriptome associated with TB treatment failure most likely reflects greater proportion of immature cells in peripheral blood, possibly due to increased myelopoiesis. The detailed analysis of this cell populations in human patients is suggested by our findings but it is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>The reviewer’s comments also suggested that a summary of our findings was necessary. The main focus of our study was to untangle connections between oxidative stress and <italic>Ifnb1</italic> superinduction. It revealed that Myc hyperactivity caused partial deficiency of antioxidant defense leading to type I interferon pathway hyperactivity that in turn amplifies lipid peroxidation, thus establishing a vicious cycle driving inflammatory tissue damage.</p><p>Our laboratory worked on mechanisms of TB granuloma necrosis over more than two decades using genetic, molecular and immunological analyses in vitro and in vivo.

However, their upregulation was maintained exclusively in the <italic>sst1</italic>-susceptible macrophages from 24 to 36 h of TNF stimulation, while in the resistant macrophages their upregulation was transient.

There we studied the time course of responses of B6 and B6.Sst1S macrophages to TNF at 2h intervals and demonstrated the divergence between their activation trajectories starting at 12 h of TNF stimulation Therefore, to reveal the underlying mechanisms we focus our analyses on this critical timepoint, i.e. as close to the divergence as possible. However, the difference between the strains in <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA expression achieved significance only by 16h of TNF stimulation. That is why we have used this timepoint for the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> and <italic>Rsad2</italic> analyses.

The revised Fig.4D and E include responses of B6 in addition to the B6.Sst1S to demonstrate that the IFNAR blockade does not reduce the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA levels in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S mutant to the B6 wild type levels. A slight reduction can be explained by a known positive feedback loop in the IFN-I pathway (see above). In this experiment we emphasized that the effect of the <italic>sst1</italic> locus is substantially greater, as compared to the effect of the IFNAR blockade (Fig.4D), and updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 4F: To what does the fold induction refer to? If it is again to unstimulated cells, then why is the induction now so much higher than in (E) where it was only 50x (now to 100x).</p><p>- Figure 4G: Again to what is the fold induction referring to? It seems your Fer-1 treatment only contains 2 data points. This needs to be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the fold induction was calculated by normalizing mRNA levels to untreated control incubated for the same time. Regarding the variation in <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA levels - a two-fold variation is not unusual in these experiments that may result in the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA superinduction ranging from 50 -200-fold at this timepoint (16h). The graph in Fig.4G was modified to make all datapoints more visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;These data suggest that type I IFN signaling does not initiate LPO in our model but maintains and amplifies it during prolonged TNF stimulation that, eventually, may lead to cell death&quot;. Data for a short term TNF stimulation are not shown, however, so it might impact also on the initiation of LPO.</p><p>- The overall conclusion drawn from Fig. 3 and 4 is not really clear with regard that IFN does not initiate LPO. Where is that shown? Data on earlier stimulation time points should be added to make this clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrated ROS production (new Suppl.Fig.3G) and the rate of LPO biosynthesis (new Suppl.Fig.4E-F) at 6 h post TNF stimulation, while the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> superinduction occurs between 12-18 h post TNF stimulation. This temporal separation supports our conclusion that IFN-β superinduction does not initiate LPO. We clarified it in the text:</p><p>“Thus, <italic>Ifnb1</italic> super-induction and IFN-I pathway hyperactivity in B6.Sst1S macrophages follow the initial LPO production, and maintain and amplify it during prolonged TNF stimulation”. (Previously: These data suggest that type I IFN signaling does not initiate LPO in our model). We also edited the conclusion in this section to explain the hierarchy of the <italic>sst1</italic>-regulated AOD and IFN-I pathways better:</p><p>“Taken together, the above experiments allowed us to reject the hypothesis that IFN-I hyperactivity caused the <italic>sst1</italic>-dependent AOD dysregulation. In contrast, they established that the hyperactivity of the IFN-I pathway in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages was itself driven by the initial dysregulation of AOD and iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. During prolonged TNF stimulation, however, the IFN-I pathway was upregulated, possibly via ROS/LPOdependent JNK activation, and acted as a potent amplifier of lipid peroxidation”.</p><p>We believe that these additional data and explanation strengthen our conclusions drawn from Figures 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;A select set of mouse LTR-containing endogenous retroviruses (ERV's) (Jayewickreme et al, 2021), and non-retroviral LINE L1 elements were expressed at a basal level before and after TNF stimulation, but their levels in the B6.Sst1S BMDMs were similar to or lower than those seen in B6&quot;. This sentence should be revised as the differences between B6 and B6.Sst1S BMDMs seem small and are not there after 48h anymore. Are these mild changes really caused by the mutation or could they result from different housing conditions and/or slowly diverging genetically lines. How many mice were used for the analysis? Is there already heterogeneity between mice from the same line?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the data presented in Suppl.Fig.4 (Suppl.Fig.5 in the revised version) indicated no increase in single- and double-stranded transposon RNAs in the B6.Sst1S macrophages. The purpose of these experiment was to test the hypothesis that increased transposon expression might be responsible for triggering the superinduction of type I interferon response in TNF-stimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages. In collaboration with a transposon expert Dr. Nelson Lau (co-author of this manuscript) we demonstrated that transposon expression was not increased above the B6 level and, thus, rejected this attractive hypothesis. We explained the purpose of this experiment in the text and adequately described our findings as “the levels in the B6.Sst1S BMDMs were similar to or lower than those seen in B6”…and concluded that ” the above analyses allowed us to exclude the overexpression of persistent viral or transposon RNAs as a primary mechanism of the IFN-I pathway hyperactivity” in the <italic>sst1</italic>-mutant macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 5A: Indeed, it even seems that Myc is upregulated for the mutant BMDMs. Yet, there are only 2 data points for B6 12h.</p><p>These experiments need repetitions and quantification and statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed these differences in c-Myc mRNA levels by independent methods: RNAseq and qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR experiments were repeated 3 times. A representative experiment in Fig.5A shows 3 data points for each condition. We reformatted the panel to make all data points clearly visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 5B: Why would the protein level decrease in the controls over 6h of additional cultivation? Is this caused by fresh M-CSF? In this case maybe cells should be left to settle for one day before stimulating them to properly compare c-Myc induction. Comment on two c-Myc bands is needed. At 12h only the upper one seems increased for TNF stimulated mutant BMDMs compared to B6 BMDMs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that cells need to be rested after media change that contains fresh CSF-1. Indeed, in Suppl.Fig.6C, we show that after media change containing 10% L929 supernatant (a source of CSF1) there is an increase in c-Myc protein levels that takes approximately 12 hours to return to baseline.</p><p>Our protocol includes resting period of 18-24 h after medium change before TNF stimulation.</p><p>We updated Methods to highlight this detail. Thus, the increase in c-Myc levels we observe at 12 h of TNF stimulation (Fig.5B) is induced by TNF, not the addition of growth factors, as further discussed in the text.</p><p>The two c-Myc bands observed in Fig.5B,I and J, are similar to patterns reported in previous studies that used the same commercial antibodies (PMIDs: 24395249, 24137534, 25351955). Whether they correspond to different c-Myc isoforms or post-translational modifications is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 5A,B: It seems that not all the RNA is translated into protein, as c-Myc at 12h in the mutant BMDMs seems to be lower than at 6h, while the gene expression implicates it vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to Fig.5B, the time course of Myc protein expression up to 24 h is presented in new panels Fig. 5I-5J. It demonstrates the gradual decrease of Myc protein levels. The observed dissociation between the mRNA and protein levels in the <italic>sst1</italic>-mutant BMDMs at 12 and 24 h is most likely due to translation inhibition as a result of the development of the integrated stress response, ISR (as shown in our previous publication by Bhattacharya et al., JCI, 2021). Translation of Myc is known to be particularly sensitive to the ISR (PMID18551192, PMID25079319, PMID28490664). Perhaps, the IFN-driven ISR may serve as a backup mechanism for Myc downregulation. We are planning to investigate these regulatory mechanisms in greater detail in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 5J: Indeed, the inhibitor seems to cause the downregulation of the proteins. Explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was repeated twice and the average normalized densitometry values are presented in the updated Fig.5J. The main question addressed in this experiment was whether hyperactivity of JNK in TNF-stimulated <italic>sst1</italic> mutant macrophages contributed to Myc upregulation, as had been previously shown in cancer. Comparing effects of JNK inhibition on phospho-cJun and c-Myc protein levels in TNF stimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages (updated Fig.5J), we rejected the hypotghesis that JNK activity might have a major role in c-Myc upregulation in <italic>sst1</italic> mutant macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;TNF stimulation tended to reduce the LPO accumulation in the B6 macrophages and to increase it in the B6.Sst1S ones&quot; However, this is not apparent in Sup.

Are the mycobacteria cleared at MOI1, since it looks that there are fewer than that? How does this look like for the B6 BMDMs? Are there even less mycobacteria?</p></disp-quote><p>We included B6 infection data to the updated Fig.6B and added Suppl.Fig.7C and 7D that address this reviewer’s comment. The data represent day 5 of Mtb infection as indicated in the updated Fig.6B and Suppl.Fig.7C and 7D legends. New Suppl.Fig.7D shows quantification of replicating Mtb using Mtb replication reporter stain expressing single strand DNA binding protein GFP fusion, as described in Methods. We observed fewer Mtb and a lower percentage of replicating Mtb in B6 macrophages, but we did not observe a complete Mtb elimination in either background.</p><p>We used red fluorescence for both Mtb::mCherry and 4-HNE staining to clearly visualize the SSB-GFP puncta in replicating Mtb DNA. In the revised manuscript, we have included the relevant channels in Suppl. Fig.7C and D to demonstrate clearly distinct patterns of Mtb::mCherry and 4-HNE signals. We did not aim to quantify the 4-HNE signal intensity in this experiment. For the 4-HNE quantification we use Mtb that expressed no reporter proteins (Fig.6A-B and Suppl.Fig.7A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 6E: In the context of survival a viability staining needs to be included, as well as the data from day 0. Then it needs to be analyzed whether cell numbers remain the same from D0 or if there is a change.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated Fig.6 legend to indicate that the cell number percentages were calculated based on the number of cells at Day 0 (immediately after Mtb infection). We routinely use fixable cell death staining to enumerate cell death to exclude artifacts due to cell loss. Brief protocol containing this information is included in Methods section. The detailed protocol including normalization using BCG spike has been published – Yabaji et al, STAR Protocols, 2022. Here we did not present dead cell percentage as it remained low and we did not observe damage to macrophage monolayers. The fold change of Mtb was calculated after normalization using Mtb load at Day 0 after infection and washes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The 3D imaging demonstrated that YFP-positive cells were restricted to the lesions, but did not strictly co-localize with intracellular Mtb, i.e. the Ifnb promoter activity was triggered by inflammatory stimuli, but not by the direct recognition of intracellular bacteria. We validated the IFNb reporter findings using in situ hybridization with the Ifnb probe, as well as anti-GFP antibody staining (Suppl.Fig.8B - E).&quot; The colocalization is not present within the tissue sections. It seems that the reporter line does not show the same staining pattern in vivo as the IFNß probe or the anti GFP antibody staining. The reporter line has to be tested for the specificity of the staining. Furthermore, to state that it was restricted to the lesions, an uninvolved tissue area needs to be depicted.</p></disp-quote><p>The Ifnb secreting cells are notoriously difficult to detect in vivo using direct staining of the protein. Therefore, lineage tracing of reporter expression are used as surrogates. The Ifnb reporter used in our study has been developed by the Locksley laboratory (Scheu et al., PNAS, 2008, PMID: 19088190) and has been validated in many independent studies. The reporter mice express the YFP protein under the control of the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> promoter. The YFP protein accumulates within the cells, while Ifnb protein is rapidly secreted and does not accumulate in the producing cells in appreciable amounts. Also, the kinetics of YFP protein degradation is much slower as compared to the endogenous <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA that was detected using in situ hybridization. Thus, there is no precise spatiotemporal coincidence of these readouts in Ifnb expressing cells in vivo. However, this methodology more closely reflect the Ifnb expressing cells in vivo, as compared to a Cre-lox mediated lineage tracing approach. In the revised manuscript we demonstrate that both YFP and mRNA signals partially overlap (Suppl.Fig.12B). In Suppl.Fig.12B. we also included a new panel showing no YFP expression in the uninvolved area of the reporter mice infected with Mtb. The YFP expression by activated macrophages is demonstrated by co-staining with Iba1- and iNOS-specific antibodies (new Fig.7D and Suppl.Fig.13A). Our specificity control also included TB lesions in mice that do not carry the YFP reporter and did not express the YFP signal, as reported elsewhere (Yabaji et al., BioRxiv, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Are paucibacillary and multibacillary lesions different within the same animal or does one animal have one lesion phenotype? If that is the case, what is causing the differences between mice?

In our model of chronic pulmonary TB (described in detail in Yabaji et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.28.640830">https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.28.640830</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695</ext-link>) the development of pulmonary TB lesions is not synchronized, i.e. the lesions are heterogeneous between the animals and within individual animals at the same timepoint. Therefore, we performed a lesion stratification where individual lesions were classified by a certified veterinary pathologist in a blinded manner based on their morphology (H&amp;E) and acid fast staining of the bacteria, as depicted in Suppl.Fig.8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;Among the IFN-inducible genes upregulated in paucibacillary lesions were Ifi44l, a recently described negative regulator of IFN-I that enhances control of Mtb in human macrophages (DeDiego et al, 2019; Jiang et al, 2021) and Ciita, a regulator of MHC class II inducible by IFNy, but not IFN-I (Suppl.Table 8 and Suppl.Fig.10 D-E).&quot; Why is Sup.

We also edited the figure legend to refer to the list of IFN-inducible genes compiled from the literature that is discussed in the text. We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion that helped us improve the text clarity. The inputs for the Hallmark pathway analysis are presented in Suppl.Tables 7 and 8, as described in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 7C: Single channel pictures are required as it is hard to see the differences in staining with so many markers. Why is there no iNOS expression in the bottom row? What does the rectangle indicate on the bottom right? As black is chosen for DAPI, it is not visible at all. In case the signal is needed a visible a color should be chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We thoroughly revised this figure to address the reviewer’s concern about the lack of clarity. We provide individual channels for each marker in Fig.7D – E and Suppl.Fig.13F. We have to use DAPI in these presentation in gray scale to better visualize other markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;In the advanced lesions these markers were primarily expressed by activated macrophages (Iba1+) expressing iNOS and/or Ifny (YFP+)(Fig.7D)&quot; Iba1 is needed in the quantification. Based on the images, iNOS seems to be highly produced in Iba1 negative cells. Which cells do produce it then? Flow cytometry data for this quantification are required. This would allow you to specifically check which cells express the markers and allow for a more precise analysis of double positive cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently these data demonstrating the co-localization of stress markers phospho-c-Jun and Chac1 with YFP are presented in Fig.7E (images) and Suppl.Fig.13D (quantification). The co-localization of stress markers phospho-cJun and Chac1 with iNOS is presented in Suppl.Fig.13F (images) and Suppl.Fig.13E (quantification). We agree that some iNOS+ cells are Iba1-negative (Fig.7D). We manually quantified percentages of Iba1+iNOS+ double positive cells and demonstrated that they represent the majority of the iNOS+ population(Suppl.Fig.13A). Regarding the required FACS analysis, we focus on spatial approaches because of the heterogeneity of the lesions that would be lost if lungs are dissociated for FACS. We are working on spatial transcriptomics at a single cell resolution that preserves spatial organization of TB lesions to address the reviewer’s comment and will present our results in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Results part 6: In general, can you please state for each experiment at what time point mice were analyzed? You should include an additional macrophage staining (e.g. MerTK, F4/80), as alveolar macrophages are not staining well for Iba1 and you might therefore miss them in your IF microscopy. It would be very nice if you could perform flow cytometry to really check on the macrophages during infection and distinguish subsets (e.g. alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages, monocytes).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the details of time post infection in figure legends for Fig.7, Suppl.Figures 8, 9, 12B, 13, 14A of the revised manuscript. We have performed staining with CD11b, CD206 and CD163 to differentiate the recruited and lung resident macrophages and determined that in chronic pulmonary TB lesions in our model the vast majority of macrophages are recruited CD11b+, but not resident (CD206+ and CD163+) macrophages. These data is presented in another manuscript (Yabaji et al., BioRxiv <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.17.562695</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Spatial sequencing: The manuscript would highly profit from more data on that. It would be very interesting to check for the DEGs and show differential spatial distribution. Expression of marker genes should be inferred to further define macrophage subsets (e.g. alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages, recruited macrophages) and see if these subsets behave differently within the same lesion but also between the lesions. Additional bioinformatic approaches might allow you to investigate cell-cell interactions. There is a lot of potential with such a dataset, especially from TB lesions, that would elevate your findings and prove interesting to the TB field.</p><p>- &quot;Thus, progression from the Mtb-controlling paucibacillary to non-controlling multibacillary TB lesions in the lungs of TB susceptible mice was mechanistically linked with a pathological state of macrophage activation characterized by escalating stress (as evidenced by the upregulation phospho-cJUN, PKR and Chac1), the upregulation of IFNβ and the IFN-I pathway hyperactivity, with a concurrent reduction of IFNγ responses.&quot; To really show the upregulation within macrophages and their activation, a more detailed IF microscopy with the inclusion of additional macrophage markers needs to be provided. Flow cytometry would enable analysis for the differences between alveolar and interstitial macrophages, as well as for monocytes. As however, it seems that the majority of iNOS, as well as the stress associated markers are not produced by Iba1+ cells. Analyzing granulocytes and T lymphocytes should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. Indeed, our model provides an excellent opportunity to investigate macrophage heterogeneity and cell interactions within chronic TB lesions. We are working on spatial transcriptomics at a single cell resolution that would address the reviewer’s comment and will present our results in the future.</p><p>In agreement with classical literature the overwhelming majority of myeloid cells in chronic pulmonary TB lesions is represented by macrophages. Neutrophils are detected at the necrotic stage, but our study is focused on pre-necrotic stages to reveal the earlier mechanisms predisposing to the necrotization. We never observed neutrophils or T cells expressing iNOS in our studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It's mentioned in the method section that controls in the IF staining were only fixed for 10min, while the infected cells were fixed for 30min. Consistency is important as the PFA fixation might impact on the fluorescence signal. Therefore, controls should be repeated with the same fixation time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully considered the impact of fixation time on fluorescence and have separately analyzed the non-infected and infected samples to address this concern. For the non-infected samples, we examined the effect of TNF in both B6 and B6.Sst1S backgrounds, ensuring that a consistent fixation protocol (10 min) was applied across all experiments without Mtb infection.</p><p>For the Mtb infection experiments, we employed an optimized fixation protocol (30 min) to ensure that Mtb was killed before handling the plates, which is critical for preserving the integrity of the samples. In this context, we compared B6 and B6.Sst1S samples to evaluate the effects of fixation and Mtb infection on lipid peroxidation (LPO) induction.</p><p>We believe this approach balances the need for experimental consistency with the specific requirements for handling infected cells, and we have revised the manuscript to reflect this clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Reactive oxygen species levels should be determined in B6 and B6.Sst1S BMDMs (stimulated and unstimulated), as they are very important for oxidative stress.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted experiments to measure ROS production in both B6 and B6.Sst1S BMDMs and demonstrated higher levels of ROS in the susceptible BMDMs after prolonged TNF stimulation (new Fig.3I-J and Suppl.

This 2-4 fold difference between same treatments in separate experiments, as compared to 30 – 100 fold and higher induction by TNF does not affect the data interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Sup. Fig. 5C, D: The data seems very interesting as you even observe an increase in gene expression. Data for the B6 mice should be evaluated for increase to a similar level as the TNF treated mutants. Data on the viability of the cells are necessary, as they no longer receive MCSF and might be dying at this point already.</p></disp-quote><p>To ensure that the observed effects were not confounded by cytotoxicity, we determined non-toxic concentrations of the CSF1R inhibitors during 48h of incubation and used them in our experiments that lasted for 24h. To address this valid comment, we have included cell viability data in the revised manuscript to confirm that the treatments did not result in cell death (Suppl. Fig. 6D). This experiment rejected our hypothesis that CSF1 driven Myc expression could be involved in the <italic>Ifnb</italic> superinduction. Other effects of CSF1R inhibitors on type I IFN pathway are intriguing but are beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Sup. Fig 12: the phospho-c-Jun picture for (P) is not the same as in the merged one with Iba1. Double positive cells are mentioned to be analyzed, but from the staining it appears that P-c-Jun is expressed by other cells. You do not indicate how many replicates were counted and if the P and M lesions were evaluated within the same animal. What does the error bar indicate? It seems unlikely from the plots that the double positive cells are significant. Please provide the p values and statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this inadvertent field replacement in the single phospho-cJun channel to our attention. However, the quantification of Iba1+phospho-cJun+ double positive cells in Suppl.Fig.12 and our conclusions were not affected. In the revised manuscript, images and quantification of phospho-cJun and Iba1 co-expression are shown in new Suppl.Fig.13B and C, respectively. We have also updated the figure legends to denote the number of lesions analyzed and statistical tests. Specifically, lesions from 6–8 mice per group (paucibacillary and multibacillary) were evaluated. Each dot in panels Suppl.Fig.13 represent individual lesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Sup. Fig. 13D (suppl.Fig.15D now): What about the expression of MYC itself? Other parts of the signaling pathway should be analyzed(e.g. IFNb, JNK)?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA expression tended to be higher in TB patients with poor outcomes, but it was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. The upregulation of Myc pathway in the blood transcriptome associated with TB treatment failure most likely reflects greater proportion of immature cells in peripheral blood, possibly due to increased myelopoiesis. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that treatment failures were associated with the following pathways relevant to this study: NF-kB Signaling, Flt3 Signaling in Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (indicative of common myeloid progenitor cell proliferation), SAPK/JNK Signaling and Senescence (possibly indicative of oxidative stress). The upregulation of these pathways in human patients with poor TB treatment outcomes correlates with our findings in TB susceptible mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the mfIHC you he usage of anti-mouse antibodies is mentioned.

Unfortunately, blocking Myc using neutralizing antibodies in vivo is not currently achievable. Specifically blocking Myc using small molecule inhibitors in vivo is notoriously difficult, as recognized in oncology literature.

Using WT B6 macrophages or sst1B6 macrophages, the authors seek to understand the how the sst1 locus affects macrophage response to prolonged TNFa exposure, which can occur during a pro-inflammatory response in the lungs. Using single cell RNA-seq, revealed clusters of mutant macrophages with upregulated genes associated with oxidative stress responses and IFN-I signaling pathways when treated with TNF compared to WT macs. The authors go on to show that mutant macrophages have decreased NRF2, decreased antioxidant defense genes and less Sp110 and Sp140. Mutant macrophages are also more susceptible to lipid peroxidation and ironmediated oxidative stress. The IFN-I pathway hyperactivity is caused by the dysregulation of iron storage and antioxidant defense. These mutant macrophages are more susceptible to M.tb infection, showing they are less able to control bacterial growth even in the presence of T cells from BCG vaccinated mice. The transcription factor Myc is more highly expressed in mutant macs during TNF treatment and inhibition Myc led to better control of M.tb growth. Myc is also more abundant in PBMCs from M.tb infected humans with poor outcomes, suggesting that Myc should be further investigated as a target for host-directed therapies for tuberculosis.</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>Isotypes for IF imaging and confocal IF imaging are not listed, or not performed. It is a concern that the microscopy images throughout the manuscript do not have isotype controls for the primary antibodies.</p><p>Fig 4 (and later) the anti-IFNAR Ab is used along with the Isotype antibody, Fig 4I does not show the isotype. Use of the isotype antibody is also missing in later figures as well as Fig 3J. Why was this left off as the proper control for the Ab?</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the comment in revised manuscript as described above in summary and responses to reviewers 1 and 2. Isotype controls for IFNAR1 blockade were included in Fig.3M (previously 3J), Fig. 4I, Suppl.Fig.4G (previously Fig.4I), and updated Fig.4C-E, Fig.6L-M, Suppl.Fig.4F-G, 7I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusions drawn by the authors from some of the WB data are worded strongly, yet by eye the blots don't look as dramatically different as suggested. It would be very helpful to quantify the density of bands when making conclusions. (for example, Fig 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>We added the densitometry of Western blot values after normalization above each lane in Fig.2A-C, Fig.3C-D and 3K; Fig.4A-B, Fig.5B,C,I,J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 5A is not described clearly. If the gene expression is normalized to untreated B6 macs, then the level of untreated B6 macs should be 1. In the graph the blue bars are slightly below 1, which would not suggest that levels &quot;initially increased and subsequently downregulated&quot; as stated in the text. It seems like the text describes the protein expression but not the RNA expression. Please check this section and more clearly describe the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and modified the text to specify the mRNA and protein expression data, as follows:</p><p>“We observed that Myc was regulated in an <italic>sst1</italic>-dependent manner: in TNF-stimulated B6 wild type BMDMs, <italic>c-Myc</italic> mRNA was downregulated, while in the susceptible macrophages c-<italic>Myc</italic> mRNA was upregulated (Fig.5A). The c-Myc protein levels were also higher in the B6.Sst1S cells in unstimulated BMDMs and 6 – 12 h of TNF stimulation (Fig.5B)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, why look at RNA through 24h but protein only through 12h? If c-myc transcripts continue to increase through 24h, it would be interesting to see if protein levels also increase at this later time point.</p></disp-quote><p>The time-course of Myc expression up to 24 h is presented in new panels Fig. 5I-5J It demonstrates the decrease of Myc protein levels at 24 h. In the wild type B6 BMDMs the levels of Myc protein significantly decreased in parallel with the mRNA suppression presented in Fig.5A. In contrast , we observed the dissociation of the mRNA and protein levels in the _sst1_mutant BMDMs at 12 and 24 h, most likely, because the mutant macrophages develop integrated stress response (as shown in our previous publication by Bhattacharya et al., JCI, 2021) that is known to inhibit Myc mRNA translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 5J the bands look smaller after D-JNK1 treatment at 6 and 12h though in the text is says no change. Quantifying the bands here would be helpful to see if there really is no difference.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was repeated twice, and the average normalized densitometry values are presented in the updated Fig.5J. The main question addressed in this experiment was whether the hyperactivity of JNK in TNF-stimulated <italic>sst1</italic> mutant macrophages contributed to Myc upregulation, as was previously shown in cancer. Comparing effects of JNK inhibition on phospho-cJun and c-Myc protein levels in TNF stimulated B6.Sst1S macrophages (updated Fig.5J), we concluded that JNK did not have a major role in c-Myc upregulation in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Section 4, third paragraph, the conclusion that JNK activation in mutant macs drives pathways downstream of Myc are not supported here. Are there data or other literature from the lab that supports this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>This statement was based on evidence from available literature where JNK was shown to activate oncogens, including Myc. In addition, inhibition of Myc in our model upregulated ferritin (Fig.Fig.5C), reduced the labile iron pool, prevented the LPO accumulation (Fig.5D - G) and inhibited stress markers (Fig.5H). However, we do not have direct experimental evidence in our model that Myc inhibition reduces ASK1 and JNK activities. Hence, we removed this statement from the text and plan to investigate this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 6N Please provide further rationale for the BCG in vivo experiment. It is unclear what the hypothesis was for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current version BCG vaccination data is presented in Suppl.Fig.14B. We demonstrate that stressed BMDMs do not respond to activation by BCG-specific T cells (Fig.6J) and their unresponsiveness is mediated by type I interferon (Fig.6L and 6M). The observed accumulation of the stressed macrophages in pulmonary TB lesions of the <italic>sst1</italic>-susceptible mice (Fig.7E, Suppl.Fig.13 and 14A) and the upregulation of type I interferon pathway (Fig.1E,1G, 7C), (Suppl.Fig.1C and 11) suggested that the effect of further boosting T lymphocytes using BCG in Mtb-infected mice will be neutralized due to the macrophage unresponsiveness. This experiment provides a novel insight explaining why BCG vaccine may not be efficient against pulmonary TB in susceptible hosts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The in vitro work is all concerning treatment with TNFa and how this exposure modifies the responses in B6 vs sst1B6 macrophages; however, this is not explored in the in vivo studies. Are there differences in TNFa levels in the pauci- vs multi-bacillary lesions that lead to (or correlate with) the accumulation of peroxidation products in the intralesional macrophages. How to the experiments with TNFa in vitro relate back to how the macrophages are responding in vivo during infection?</p></disp-quote><p>Our investigation of mechanisms of necrosis of TB granulomas stems from and supported by in vivo studies as summarized below.</p><p>This work started with the characterization necrotic TB granulomas in C3HeB/FeJ mice in vivo followed by a classical forward genetic analysis of susceptibility to virulent Mtb in vivo.</p><p>That led to the discovery of the <italic>sst1</italic> locus and demonstration that it plays a dominant role in the formation of necrotic TB granulomas in mouse lungs in vivo. Using genetic and immunological approaches we demonstrated that the <italic>sst1</italic> susceptibility allele controls macrophage function in vivo (Yan, et al., J.Immunol. 2007) and an aberrant macrophage activation by TNF and increased production of Ifn-b in vitro (He et al. Plos Pathogens, 2013). In collaboration with the Vance lab we demonstrated that the type I IFN receptor inactivation reduced the susceptibility to intracellular bacteria of the <italic>sst1</italic>-susceptible mice in vivo (Ji et al., Nature Microbiology, 2019). Next, we demonstrated that the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> mRNA superinduction results from combined effects of TNF and JNK leading to integrated stress response in vitro (Bhattacharya, JCI, 2021). Thus, our previous work started with extensive characterization of the in vivo phenotype that led to the identification of the underlying macrophage deficiency that allowed for the detailed characterization of the macrophage phenotype in vitro presented in this manuscript. In a separate study, the Sher lab confirmed our conclusions and their in vivo relevance using <italic>Bach1</italic> knockout in the <italic>sst1</italic>-susceptible B6.Sst1S background, where boosting antioxidant defense by Bach1 inactivation resulted in decreased type I interferon pathway activity and reduced granuloma necrosis. We have chosen TNF stimulation for our in vitro studies because this cytokine is most relevant for the formation and maintenance of the integrity of TB granulomas in vivo as shown in mice, non-human primates and humans. Here we demonstrate that although TNF is necessary for host resistance to virulent Mtb, its activity is insufficient for full protection of the susceptible hosts, because of altered macrophages responsiveness to TNF. Thus, our exploration of the necrosis of TB granulomas encompass both in vitro and extensive in vivo studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>Introduction, while well written, is longer than necessary.

This work builds from previously published work (Bhattacharya 2021) in which the authors first identified the aberrant response induced by TNF in sst1 mutant macrophages. Better understanding how macrophages with the sst1 locus respond not only to bacterial infection but stimulation with relevant ligands such as TNF will aid the field in identifying biomarkers for TB, biomarkers that can suggest a poor outcome vs. &quot;cure&quot; in response to antibiotic treatment or design of host-directed therapies.</p><p>This work will be of interest to those who study macrophage biology and who study M.tb pathogenesis and tuberculosis in particular. This study expands the knowledge already gained on the sst1 locus to further determine how early macrophage responses are shaped that can ultimately determine disease progression.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the methodologies, employing both bulk and single cell-RNA seq to answer specific questions. Data are analyze using automated methods (such as HALO) to eliminated bias. The experiments are well planned and designed to determine the mechanisms behind the increased iron-related oxidative stress found in the mutant macrophages following TNF treatment. Also, in vivo studies were performed to validate some of the in vitro work. Examining pauci-bacillary lesions vs multi-bacillary lesions and spatial transcriptomics is a significant strength of this work. The inclusion of human data is another strength of the study, showing increased Myc in humans with poor response to antibiotics for TB.</p><p>Limitations include the fact that the work is all done with BMDMs. Use of alveolar macrophages from the mice would be a more relevant cell type for M.tb studies. AMs are less inflammatory, therefore treatment with TNF of AMs could result in different results compared to BMDMs. Reviewer's field of expertise: macrophage activation, M.tb pathogenesis in human and mouse models, cell signaling.</p><p>Limitations: not qualified to evaluate single cell or bulk RNA-seq technical analysis/methodology or spatial transcriptomics analysis.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
