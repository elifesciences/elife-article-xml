Prior studies, performed with single-plane imaging, suggest that subpopulations of electrically coupled β-cells have privileged roles in leading and coordinating the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) light-sheet imaging to analyze the location and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of single β-cells within the entire islet at &gt;2 Hz. In contrast with single-plane studies, 3D network analysis indicates that the most highly synchronized β-cells are located at the islet center, and remain regionally but not cellularly stable between oscillations. This subpopulation, which includes ‘hub cells’, is insensitive to changes in fuel metabolism induced by glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activation. β-Cells that initiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (leaders) are located at the islet periphery, and strikingly, change their identity over time via rotations in the wave axis. Glucokinase activation, which increased oscillation period, reinforced leader cells and stabilized the wave axis. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. These findings emphasize the stochastic nature of the β-cell subpopulations that control Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and identify a role for glucokinase in spatially patterning ‘leader’ β-cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>light-sheet microscope</kwd><kwd>pancreatic islets</kwd><kwd>β-cell</kwd><kwd>calcium oscillation</kwd><kwd>glucokinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK113103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merrins</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK127637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merrins</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK106412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benninger</surname><given-names>Richard KP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007496</institution-id><institution>Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development, VA Office of Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01BX005113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merrins</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1938058_Briggs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>Jennifer K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK102950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benninger</surname><given-names>Richard KP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK140904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benninger</surname><given-names>Richard KP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010174</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK116073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benninger</surname><given-names>Richard KP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>3D light-sheet imaging identifies the location and metabolic sensitivity of β-cell subpopulations that lead and coordinate islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pulsatile insulin secretion from pancreatic islet β-cells is key to maintaining glycemic control. Insulin secretory oscillations increase the efficiency of hepatic insulin signaling and are disrupted in individuals with obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Satin et al., 2015</xref>). The primary stimulus for insulin release is glucose, which is intracellularly metabolized to generate a rise in ATP/ADP ratio, which closes ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>ATP</sub> channels) to initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merrins et al., 2022</xref>). At elevated glucose, β-cells oscillate between electrically silent and electrically active phases with a period of minutes, both in vivo and in isolated islets. The depolarizing current can be transmitted between β-cells across the whole islet through gap junction channels. However, the activity of individual electrically coupled β-cells is functionally heterogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benninger and Kravets, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiriart and Ramirez-Medeles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiekens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pipeleers, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rutter et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wojtusciszyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Da Silva Xavier and Rutter, 2020</xref>). This heterogeneity results in the emergence of β-cell subpopulations that may be crucial for maintaining the coordination of the whole islet and regulating pulsatile insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kravets et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westacott et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding the underpinnings of β-cell functional heterogeneity and islet cell communication is important for understanding islet dysfunction and the pathogenesis of diabetes.</p><p>Similar to studies of neuronal networks, functional network analysis can be used to quantify interactions within the heterogenous β-cell system. Interactions (termed ‘edges’) are drawn between β-cell pairs with highly correlated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Studies suggest that the β-cell functional network exhibits high clustering or ‘small-world’ properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stožer et al., 2013b</xref>), with a subpopulation of β-cells that are highly synchronized to other cells (hub cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). Silencing the electrical activity of these hub cells with optogenetics was found to abolish the coordination within that plane of the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nasteska et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, time series-based lagged cross correlation analysis has identified subpopulations of cells at the wave origin, termed ‘early phase’ or ‘leader cells’, that lead the second-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave by depolarizing and repolarizing first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westacott et al., 2017</xref>). However, questions have been raised whether the highly networked or leader subpopulations have the power to control the entire islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peercy and Sherman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satin et al., 2020</xref>). Underlying this controversy lies several unanswered questions: what mechanisms drive the existence of these functional subpopulations? Do these subpopulations arise primarily from mechanisms intrinsic to β-cells, making the subpopulations consistent over time? Alternatively, do they arise from the combination of intrinsic mechanisms and emergence due to surrounding cells, allowing the subpopulations to fluidly change over time? To date, experiments have been restricted to imaging a single two-dimensional (2D) plane of the islet which contains only a small fraction of the β-cells present in the three-dimensional (3D) islet tissue, limiting the ability to address these questions.</p><p>With these caveats in mind, prior studies using a mixture of computational and molecular approaches suggested that β-cell subpopulations are patterned by glucokinase, which is often referred to as the ‘glucose sensor’ for the β-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westacott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dwulet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jetton and Magnuson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs et al., 2023</xref>). By phosphorylating glucose in the first step of glycolysis, glucokinase activation lengthens the active phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by committing more glucose carbons to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>). Until recently, it was believed that downstream glycolysis was irrelevant to pulsatile insulin secretion. However, in conflict with this model, allosteric activation of pyruvate kinase accelerates Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increases insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewandowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2022</xref>). As a potential mechanistic explanation for these observations, plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes, including glucokinase and pyruvate kinase, have been demonstrated to regulate K<sub>ATP</sub> channels via the ATP/ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho et al., 2023</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether these glycolytic enzymes influence β-cell heterogeneity and network activity.</p><p>To study single β-cell activity within intact islets, we engineered a 3D light-sheet microscope to simultaneously record the location and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of single β-cells over the entire islet during glucose-stimulated oscillations. In concert, we developed 3D analyses to investigate the spatial features of subpopulations that underlie the β-cell network and Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave, and the consistency of these features over time. We further examined the consequences of sampling islet heterogeneity in 2D compared to 3D. Finally, we investigated the role of the glycolytic enzymes glucokinase and pyruvate kinase in controlling β-cell subpopulations during glucose-stimulated oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Light-sheet microscopy enables high-speed 3D imaging of oscillations in single β-cells within intact islets</title><p>To acquire high-speed 3D time course imaging of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations within intact islets, we utilized a lateral-interference tilted excitation light-sheet system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fadero et al., 2018</xref>) mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <italic>Methods</italic>). To image Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and spatially resolve individual β-cells in intact islets, islets were isolated from <italic>Ins1-Cre:ROSA26<sup>GCaMP6s/H2B-mCherry</sup></italic> mice that express cytosolic GCaMP6s Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensors and nuclear H2B-mCherry reporters selectively within β-cells. We first compared the images collected by the light-sheet system with a commercial spinning disk confocal using the same ×40 water immersion objective. Similar to a widefield microscope, the axial resolution of the light-sheet microscope is dictated by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens (~1.1 μm for a 1.15 NA objective and GCaMP6s emission) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fadero et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the spinning disk uses a pinhole array to enhance axial resolution. At a shallow depth of 24 µm from the coverslip, H2B-mCherry-labeled nuclei and GCaMP6s-labeled β-cells were resolved both by the light-sheet and the spinning disk confocal. However, the nuclei were only resolved by the light-sheet system at depths ≥60 μm due to the reduced light scatter from side illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the main advantage of the light-sheet system is the ability to image the entire islet in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Engineering of a light-sheet microscope to image intact islets in 3D.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the light-sheet microscope showing the optical configuration.

To image the entire islet at similar acquisition speeds, the hardware was operated under triggering mode to minimize communication delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this mode, the lasers and the piezo z-stage were triggered directly by the camera, which received a single set of instructions from the computer via the NiDAQ card. To image 132 µm into the islet at 2 Hz, 15 ms was allowed for photon collection and stage movement for each of the 4 µm z-steps. Initially, an hour-long delay was required to save 120,000 imaging files after running a continuous 30-min experiment. Because this delay is only observed after the first 3 min of imaging, it was possible to eliminate the delay by separating the acquisition into a series of 3-min loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Individual β-cell nuclei were located using the Spots function of Bitplane Imaris software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The mean GCaMP6s intensity of each cell ROI for each time point was calculated and exported as single-cell traces. We did not observe any significant photobleaching using continuous GCaMP6s and H2B-mCherry excitation over the course of the experiment. The combination of this light-sheet system, islet cell labeling, and analysis pipeline allows for imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from nearly all β-cells in the islet at speeds fast enough for spatio-temporal analyses to identify functionally heterogenous β-cell subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>3D analyses of islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations reveal that the β-cell network is distributed in a radial pattern while Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves begin and end on the islet periphery</title><p>To investigate the synchronization between β-cells across the islet in 3D space, we imaged and extracted Ca<sup>2+</sup> time courses for <italic>Ins1-Cre:ROSA26<sup>GCaMP6s/H2B-mCherry</sup></italic> islets that exhibit slow oscillations.

If the ranking of high to low degree cell (e.g., A &gt; B &gt; C) for the first oscillation remains the same in the second oscillation, the KL divergence will be 0, indicating the cell ranking is completely predictable between oscillations. Alternatively, if the cell ranking changes between oscillations (A &gt; C &gt; B), the KL divergence will be 1, indicating the cell ranking is completely random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

While this ex vivo approach might not precisely mimic the in vivo situation, our analyses show that 3D imaging is a more robust approach than 2D imaging, which does not accurately reflect heterogeneity and subpopulation consistency over the entire islet. Reinforcing the concept of distinct β-cell subpopulations, the most highly synchronized cells are located at the center of the islet, while those β-cells that control the initiation and termination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (leaders) were located on the islet periphery. We further observed that different regions of the islet initiate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave over time, challenging the view that leader cells are a fixed pacemaker population of cells defined by their biochemistry. As discussed below, technical advances in image capture and analysis provide several new insights into the features of β-cell subpopulation in 3D and illustrate how glycolytic enzymes influence the system.</p><p>β-Cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is an indispensable approach for understanding pulsatility. When studied by light-sheet imaging, islets exhibited similar ~3- to 5-min oscillations as in vivo two-photon imaging of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in live mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2021</xref>), as well as the high-speed confocal imaging used in prior ex vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2024</xref>). Light-sheet imaging overcomes the speed and depth limitations, respectively, that prevent these approaches from single-cell analysis of the entire islet. Relative to spinning disk confocal, penetration depth increased &gt;twofold with the light-sheet microscope (from 50–60 to 130–150 μm), allowing small- and medium-sized islets to be imaged in toto. Abandoning confocal pinholes improved light collection, and therefore acquisition speed, ~threefold; this is an underestimate given the 0.4 e<sup>−</sup> read noise cameras on the spinning disk microscope versus 1.6 e<sup>−</sup> read noise cameras on the light-sheet microscope. The ~1.1-μm axial resolution of the light-sheet, while lower than spinning disk confocal, was easily sufficient for Nyquist sampling of 5–6 μm nuclei used to identify each β-cell in 3D space (β-cells themselves are 12–18 μm). Together these features allowed sampling the islet at &gt;2 Hz, although future studies could be improved by employing a higher NA objective and a camera with lower read noise and higher quantum efficiency.</p><p>Phase and functional network analyses were used to understand the behavior of β-cell subpopulations and how they communicate. Importantly, in past heterogeneity studies, phase and network calculations were assessed over the entire time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hraha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stožer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stožer et al., 2013b</xref>).

These have also been referred to as ‘leader cells’ or ‘pacemaker cells’ and regulate the oscillatory dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salem et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2024</xref>). To our surprise, the early phase cells (i.e., the leader cells) were not consistent over time. The late phase cells, located on the opposite end of the islet, showed a similar shift, with over half of the islets showing changes in the wave axis. Consequently, laser ablation of these early or late phase cells would be predicted to have little impact on islet function, as suggested previously by electrophysiological studies in which surface β-cells have been voltage-clamped with no impact on β-cell oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satin et al., 2020</xref>), or computational studies in which removal of simulated β-cells had little impact on resulting oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korošak et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Studies have sought to define whether β-cell intrinsic or extrinsic factors determine the oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Šterk et al., 2023</xref>). Because of the shift in Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave axis between consecutive oscillations, we conclude that β-cell depolarization is dominated by stochastic properties rather than a pre-determined genetic or metabolic profile. Previous experimental and modeling studies have suggested that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave origin corresponds to the glucokinase activity gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hraha et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, pharmacologic activation of glucokinase reinforced the islet region of early phase cells and reduced the wave axis change. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. Importantly, there is no evidence that the glucokinase gradient is the result of intentional spatial organization. Rather, in computational studies the glucokinase gradient emerges stochastically due to randomly placed high and low glucokinase-expressing cells, with multiple competing glucokinase gradients determining the degree of wave axis rotation. Our findings suggest that when glucokinase is activated, the strongest gradient is amplified, which is why the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave axis is reinforced. Another compelling hypothesis for stochastic behavior, which is not mutually exclusive, is the heterogenous nutrient response of neighboring α-cells influences the excitability of neighboring β-cells via GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capozzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). The preponderance of α-cells on the periphery of mouse islets, which influence β-cell oscillation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ren et al., 2022</xref>), would be expected to disrupt β-cell synchronization on the periphery and stabilize it in the islet center – which is precisely the pattern of network activity we observed. In addition to α-cells, vasculature may also impact islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jevon et al., 2022</xref>), and may induce additional heterogeneity in vivo.</p><p>Functional network studies of the islet revealed a heterogeneity in β-cell functional connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stožer et al., 2013b</xref>). A small subpopulation of β-cells, termed ‘hub’ cells, was found to have the highest synchronization to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). Optogenetic silencing of hub cells was found to disrupt network activity within that plane, however it should be noted that hub cells are defined as the most highly coordinated cells within a randomly selected plane of the islet. Debates exist over whether the hub cells can maintain electrical control over the whole islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Satin and Rorsman, 2020</xref>). Because our study investigated the 3D β-cell functional network over individual oscillations, our top 10% of highly coordinated cells are not the exact same population as hub cells defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>, however the subpopulations likely overlap. In contrast with leader cells, we found that the highly synchronized hub cells are both spatially and temporally stable. However, in conflict with the description of hub cells as intermingled with other cells throughout the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>), the location of such cells in 3D space is close to the center. This observation could be explained by the peripheral location of α-cells as discussed above for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave behavior.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that the intrinsic metabolic activity and thus oscillation profile may play a larger role in driving high synchronization than the strength of gap junction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Šterk et al., 2023</xref>). This included experimental 2D measurements but also computational 3D measurements. Nevertheless, we demonstrated here that perturbing glucokinase or pyruvate kinase had little effect on the consistency of the high or low degree cells within the 3D network. We further observed that the β-cell network was more regionally consistent than cellularly consistent, indicating a tendency for nearby cells within the islet center to ‘take over’ as high degree cells. The mechanisms underlying this are unclear. One explanation may be that paracrine communication within the islet determines which region of cells will show high or low degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). For example, more peripheral cells that are in contact with nearby δ-cells may show some suppression in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickerson et al., 2022</xref>), and thus reduced synchronization. Alternatively, more peripheral cells may show increased stochastic behavior that reduces their relative synchronization. Modulating α/δ-cell inputs to the β-cell in combination with 3D islet imaging will be important to test this in the future. Our study emphasizes that 3D studies are critical to fully assess the consistency and spatial organization of the β-cell network.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Ins1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thorens et al., 2015</xref>) (Jax 026801) were crossed with <italic>GCaMP6s</italic> mice (Jax 028866), a Cre-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator strain, and <italic>H2B-mCherry</italic> mice, a Cre-dependent nuclear indicator strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum et al., 2014</xref>).

The sample chamber consisted of an Ibidi 4-well No. 1.5 glass bottom chamber slide with optically clear sides. Excitation from a Vortran Stradus VeraLase 4-channel (445/488/561/637) single mode fiber-coupled laser and CDRH control box (AVR Optics) was passed through the TILT cylindrical lens to generate a light-sheet with a beam waist of 4.3 μm directly over the objective’s field of view. Similar to a widefield microscope, the axial (z) resolution of the light-sheet microscope is dictated by the NA of the objective (~1.1 μm for our Nikon CFI Apo LWD Lambda S 40XC water immersion objective with an NA of 1.15). Fluorescence emission was passed through an optical beamsplitter (OptoSplit III, 89 North) and collected by an ORCA-Flash4.0 v3 digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu C13440-20CU) equipped with a PoCL camera link cable. To achieve high-speed triggered acquisition, the laser and piezo z-stage were triggered directly by the camera, which received a single packet of instructions from the NIS-Elements JOBS module via a PCI express NiDAQ card (PCIe-6323, National Instruments).

Previous studies by the authors have shown that GK gradients likely dictate subpopulation behaviour, so the concern here is that GK activation across all cells might mask the influence of such gradients i.e. a U-shaped effect. Also, does the GK activator differentially penetrate the islet such that first responders/leaders are more vulnerable than hubs?</p></disp-quote><p>As we previously published, non-saturating concentrations of GK activator (as used here) have the same effect on calcium oscillations as raising glucose (PMID:33147484). In other words, the activator boosts the activity of the endogenous GK. To the second point, recent ex vivo islet studies (PMID: 28380380) document the islet penetration of a fluorescent glucose analogue within seconds even under static conditions, and in our study the islets calcium oscillations reached steady state, so we are not concerned about drug penetration. The real limitation with any drug study in the islet is that non-beta cells are also activated; this limitation is included in the discussion along with the recommendation that genetic tools are needed to assess the effect of GK activation in the various endocrine subpopulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional concern with the GK activation experiment is that GK activation might push beta cells into a more stressed state such that they are more susceptible to phototoxicity. Although the authors state that photobleaching is low, they provide no data to support such a statement. Given the long duration of imaging and acquisition rate, phototoxicity might be more of an issue, especially with GK activation. Some further analysis (e.g. apoptosis) would be useful here to exclude an effect of beta cell viability versus GK activation on the observed phenotype of the different subpopulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Acute GK activation (for 30min) does not stress the islet; the drug has the same effect as raising glucose (PMID: 33147484). To determine whether photobleaching was impacted by GK activation, we examined the peak of consecutive oscillations in response to vehicle and GK activator. The average photobleaching was less than 2% of the calcium fluorescence over 30min of continuous imaging. Furthermore, GKa activation did not significantly increase photobleaching (see Author response image 1).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103068-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To the reviewer’s second point, apoptosis cannot occur on the timescale of the drug treatment (30min), and raw calcium traces are included showing that all beta cells display oscillatory behavior throughout the course of the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors show that glucokinase activation increases the duration of islet calcium oscillations and in some islets (3 of 15 islets) causes &quot;a Ca2+ plateau.&quot; The authors indicate that &quot;Glucokinase, as the 'glucose sensor' for the β-cell, controls the input of glucose carbons into glycolysis, and opens KATP channels.&quot; It would be nice to have some experimental evidence that the change in oscillation rate caused by the glucokinase activator is due to KATP activation. This could be accomplished by treating islets with subthreshold KATP activators (e.g., diazoxide) or subthreshold KATP inhibitors (e.g., tolbutamide).</p></disp-quote><p>The statement that glucokinase activation opens KATP channels was a typo; glucose metabolism closes KATP channels by raising the ATP/ADP ratio. We now include additional citations that document the relationship between GK and KATP and the oscillatory behavior. See Ref 22 (PMID: 33147484) and Ref 34 (PMID: 33147484).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript finds that &quot;Early phase cells were maintained to a greater degree upon GKa application.&quot; Yet GKa is proposed to activate KATP. Some discussion about how the early phase is maintained in cell populations by GKa activation in the context of KATP activity would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we meant to say that GKa will close KATP and apologize for the confusion. As we mentioned in the discussion, early phase cells are most likely maintained to a great degree following GK activation as result of enhanced GK gradient and reduced effect of stochastic alpha cell input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Membrane potential depolarization precedes calcium channel activation and subsequent calcium entry. In many cases, electrical coupling across beta cells happens on millisecond timescale. It would be good to confirm that the calcium is showing the same time scale in terms of elevation following beta cell membrane potential depolarization. One concern is that the islet beta cells could be depolarizing at the same speed and lagging in terms of calcium channel activation and calcium entry.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this point, which is almost certainly true, particularly since plasma membrane calcium influx is not the sole source of intracellular calcium. Previously published “simultaneous” recordings of Vm and calcium show their same phase relationship but do not have sufficient time resolution to capture depolarization of each cell. A quantification of phase lag would require the field to generate mice with voltage sensors expressed in beta cells; these tools are not yet available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related issue: in the text, the authors discuss changes in membrane potential (not been measured in this study), while in the figures they exclusively describe Ca2+ oscillations (which were measured). Examples are on lines 149, 150, 153, 154, 263. It is recommended that the silent and active phases in the Results section describe processes actually measured in this study as shown in 6A.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we did not use the term ‘membrane potential’ anywhere in the manuscript. We do sometimes refer to calcium influx as a proxy for membrane depolarization; we think this is valid given the abundant evidence that these processes are interdependent in beta cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would be good to include the timing of the phases of calcium entry. When was the beta cell calcium entry monitored for the response time? Were the response times between the late and early phases consistent for each oscillation? It looks as if the start of the calcium upstroke was similar for many beta cells (such as for the Figure 2I traces). It would be nice to include a shorter time duration graph of calcium oscillation traces right when the upstroke starts. This would allow the community to observe the differences in the start time of calcium entry.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point. We now include an inset showing the expanded time scale of the calcium upstroke in Fig.2I. The response time spread between early and late phase cells is now shown in Fig.7F (and in Author response image 2). We also quantified the coefficient of variation in the response time spread (0 = no variation and 1 = maximal variation) and found no significant differences between metabolic activators (Author response image 2).</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103068-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, for most of the GCaMP6s traces shown, the authors indicate that they are plotted as F/F0. However, this normalization (F/F0) is not done for the actual traces shown. For example, Figure 2D shows the traces starting from what looks to be 0 to 0.3 F/F0, but the traces for an F/F0 group should all start at 1. Please change this for all representative oscillations so the start of calcium entry for example traces all line up.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in Fig. 2D, I and Fig. 3B. Also Fig.6 should be F not F/F0</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 53: &quot;Silencing the electrical activity of these hub cells with optogenetics was found to abolish the coordination within that plane of the islet&quot;. The authors should acknowledge that studies also showed that beta cell transcription factor (Pdx1/Mafa) dosage was important for hub cell phenotype and islet function.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this reference to Nasteska et al. (PMID: 33514698, Ref. 16) has been added to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Light sheet imaging is used to image the 3D islet volume. Whilst speed is undoubtedly an advantage of this technique, axial resolution is ~1.1 µm over 4 µm z-step size. How confident are the authors that single nuclei can be reliably identified given their ~6 µm size in a beta cell (e.g. do some elongated nuclear appear, which could be &quot;doublets&quot;)?</p></disp-quote><p>The axial resolution of 1.1 µm exceeds the resolution needed for the Nyquist criterion (i.e. sampling every 2-3 µm). As a practical matter, it is not possible to doublecount nuclei because the software will exclude nuclei that occupy the same volume. Only a very elongated nucleus (&gt;10 µm) would be double counted and this does not occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors discuss the advantages of the light sheet imaging approach used, including speed and phototoxicity. Some more balance is needed here since other approaches such as two-photon excitation achieve similar speeds with much better axial resolution (see dozens of neural circuit studies).</p></disp-quote><p>We are careful to point out that two-photon excitation has better axial resolution, better tissue penetration, and often higher speeds (kHz using linescans) – however these neuronal studies are limited to the cells in a few planes and the laser power is orders of magnitude higher than lightsheet. For this reason, two photon imaging has not been used to image islet calcium in three dimensions. The bottom line is lightsheet trades axial resolution for gentle volumetric imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 340: &quot;Laser ablation or optogenetic inactivation of these early phase cells would be predicted to have little impact on islet function, as suggested previously by electrophysiological studies in which surface β-cells have been voltage-clamped with no impact on β-cell oscillations&quot;. This statement is slightly ambiguous since the authors showed in their previous studies that laser ablation of first responder cells/leaders was able to influence the Ca2+ network. Do the authors mean that laser ablation would only temporarily influence islet function before another cell picked up the role of a first responder/leader? As written, the sentence seems to imply that first responders/leaders are unimportant for the islet function.</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to imply that the oscillatory system is sufficiently robust that a new cell take over when leader cells are ablated. We also cite Korosak et al. (PMID:34723613, Ref. 40) and Dwulet et al. (PMID: 33939712, Ref. 15) to make this point, although to clarify we are not examining first responders in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 369: &quot;In contrast with leader cells, we found that the highly synchronized cells are both spatially and temporally stable.&quot; The sentence needs qualifying- what would spatiotemporal stability be expected to confer on such a subpopulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the spatiotemporal stability of highly synchronized cells is a consequence of beta cells in the center of the islet lacking the stochastic input of nearby alpha cells; we raise this point in the discussion: “The preponderance of α-cells on the periphery of mouse islets, which influence β-cell oscillation frequency, would be expected to disrupt β-cell synchronization on the periphery and stabilize it in the islet center – which is precisely the pattern of network activity we observed.” (see line 372).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 370: &quot;However, in conflict with the description of hub cells as intermingled with other cells throughout the islet, the location of such cells in 3D space is close to the center.&quot; The study by Johnston et al did not have the axial resolution to exclude that some cells might have been grouped together.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have included the reviewer’s comment in the text (See line 384); that’s an important reason for conducting this 3D study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 380: &quot;One explanation may be that paracrine communication within the islet determines which region of cells will show high or low degree. For example, more peripheral cells that are in contact with nearby δ-cells may show some suppression in their Ca2+ dynamics, and thus reduced synchronization.&quot; A potentially exciting future study. Should however probably cite DOI s41467-022-31373-6 here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their input. This reference to Ren et al.

To address this comment, we conducted two normality tests: Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov on all statistical analyses in the manuscript. If the data were not normally distributed, we changed the analysis to Wilcoxon matchedpairs signed rank test (non-parametric version of t-tests) or the Friedman test (nonparametric version of ANOVA). Three results were changed based on this statistical correction: Figure 4D, also 5F 3D (from P=0.01 to P=0.0526), Figure 5F ¼ z-depth (P = 0.005 to P = 0.012). We have updated the manuscript methods, results, and figures accordingly. Importantly, these results did not change the main points of the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
