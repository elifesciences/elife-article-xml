Indeed, the eukaryotic replication fork plays host to the enzymes needed to replicate DNA as well as intricate machinery that reassembles chromatin in the wake of replication. However, during development, cell division is also coupled to the rewiring of gene expression patterns that lead to the generation of new cell types. An understanding of chromatin and epigenetics requires an understanding of the mechanisms by which cells can both faithfully transmit chromatin state through cell division, and subvert that inheritance to establish new cell types. The silent chromatin controlling mating-type identity in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> offers a tractable context for exploring how cell-cycle-regulated chromatin dynamics lead to the establishment of new expression states.</p><p>The maintenance of the correct mating type in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> relies on both the expression of the <bold>a</bold> or α mating-type genes at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus and the heterochromatin-mediated silencing of copies of those same genes at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herskowitz, 1989</xref>). Silencing is dependent on the <underline>S</underline>ilent <underline>I</underline>nformation <underline>R</underline>egulator genes, <italic>SIR1-4</italic>, whose study has led to an understanding of how silencing is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gartenberg and Smith, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>). <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> are flanked by DNA sequences termed silencers, which recruit the DNA-binding proteins Rap1, Abf1, and ORC. These in turn recruit the Sir proteins via protein-protein interactions. Sir protein recruitment to silencers is followed by the spread of Sir proteins across the multi-kilobase loci by iterative cycles of deacetylation of the tails of histones H3 and H4 by Sir2 and binding of Sir3 and Sir4 to those deacetylated histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hecht et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rusché et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Despite decades of work, a longstanding puzzle remains at the heart of the mechanism of silencing: cells must pass through S phase to establish silencing, but the identity of the elusive cell-cycle-dependent component is unknown (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Young and Kirchmaier, 2012</xref>). Cells with a temperature-sensitive <italic>sir3-8</italic> allele arrested in G1 cannot repress <italic>HMRa1</italic> when switched from the non-permissive temperature to the permissive temperature, but can when allowed to progress through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller and Nasmyth, 1984</xref>). DNA replication per se is not required for silencing establishment. Excised DNA circles bearing <italic>HMR</italic>, but no origin of replication, can be silenced if allowed to pass through S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirchmaier and Rine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, some feature of S-phase, but not DNA replication itself, is crucial for silencing establishment.</p><p>Interestingly, low-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies showed that Sir protein recruitment to <italic>HMR</italic> can occur with or without cell-cycle progression, suggesting that Sir protein binding and silencing are not inextricably linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirchmaier and Rine, 2006</xref>). If Sir proteins can bind to a locus but not silence it, then other molecular changes must be required to create silencing-competent chromatin. In cycling cells undergoing silencing establishment, removal of histone modifications associated with active transcription occurs over several cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of genes encoding enzymes that deposit euchromatic histone marks modulates the speed of silencing establishment in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that removal of these marks is a key step in building heterochromatin. It is unknown whether the removal of euchromatic marks is related to the S-phase requirement for silencing establishment.</p><p>To better understand how chromatin transitions from the active to repressed state are choreographed, we developed an estradiol-regulated Sir3 fusion protein, which, combined with high-resolution ChIP and RNA measurements, allowed precise experimental analysis of silencing establishment with single-cell resolution. We characterized the molecular changes that occur during silencing establishment and identified the genetic drivers of the S-phase requirement for silencing establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>S phase as a critical window for silencing establishment</title><p>Previous studies of silencing establishment have used a variety of strategies to controllably induce silencing establishment, each with its own strengths and weaknesses (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller and Nasmyth, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirchmaier and Rine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazarus and Holmes, 2011</xref>). We sought a new tool to induce silencing that would allow preservation of the structure of the silencers at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> and minimally perturb cell physiology upon induction. To do this, we fused the coding sequence of the estrogen binding domain (<italic>EBD</italic>) of the mammalian estrogen receptor α to <italic>SIR3</italic>, making <italic>SIR3</italic>’s function estradiol-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Picard, 1994</xref>). Estradiol addition frees the EBD from sequestration by Hsp90, and hence the induction is rapid because it does not require new transcription or translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McIsaac et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> strains grown without estradiol failed to repress <italic>HMR</italic>, mimicking the <italic>sir3∆</italic> phenotype, while those grown with estradiol repressed <italic>HMR</italic> to a similar degree as wild-type <italic>SIR3</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Silencing establishment using <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> required S-phase progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic for <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> activation.

In cycling cells, silencing establishment of <italic>HMR</italic> occurred gradually over several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, in cells arrested in G1, estradiol led to no measurable repression of <italic>HMR</italic>, even after many hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, silencing of <italic>HMR</italic> could not occur without progression through the cell cycle, in agreement with prior results using other conditional alleles.</p><p>Prior work indicated that S phase is a critical window during which cells may undergo partial silencing establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirchmaier and Rine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller and Nasmyth, 1984</xref>). Consistent with this, when we arrested cells in G1, then induced <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> and allowed them to proceed through S phase and re-arrested them at G2/M, <italic>HMR</italic> was repressed ~60% from its starting levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Crucially, the extent of this partial repression was stable over many hours in these G2/M-arrested cells. Thus, a repression-permissive window or event occurred between G1 and the beginning of mitosis that allowed partial silencing establishment, and further repression was not possible while arrested at G2/M. Indeed, after 3 hr in estradiol, cycling cells were repressed &gt;20 fold from their starting value, compared to only ~3 fold for cells arrested after a single S phase (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). This requirement for multiple cell cycles to occur before full gene repression was consistent with prior studies of silencing establishment both in cell populations and at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Having established the validity of the <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> fusion as a tool for studying silencing, we revisited two mutants that have been reported to bypass cell-cycle requirements for silencing establishment. In one study, depletion of the cohesin subunit Mcd1/Scc1 allowed for increased silencing in G2/M-stalled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau et al., 2002</xref>). In another study, deletion of a tRNA gene adjacent to <italic>HMR</italic>, termed <italic>tT(AGU)C</italic>, which is known to bind cohesin, was found to allow partial silencing establishment at <italic>HMR</italic> without S-phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazarus and Holmes, 2011</xref>). Using <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> in combination with an auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged Mcd1, we found no effect of depleting cohesin or deleting the tRNA gene in regulating silencing establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, at least for strains using <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic>, the genetic basis for the cell-cycle requirement for silencing establishment at <italic>HMR</italic> remained to be determined. Possible explanations for the discrepancies between our results and earlier reports are discussed below.</p><p>Our finding that <italic>tT(AGU)C</italic> did not regulate silencing establishment led us to reconsider the broader claim that <italic>HMR</italic> is distinct from <italic>HML</italic> in its requirement of S phase passage for silencing establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazarus and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2010</xref>). Earlier silencing establishment assays at <italic>HML</italic> were complicated by the strong silencing-independent repression of <italic>HMLα1</italic> and <italic>HMLα2</italic> by the <bold>a</bold>1/α2 repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herskowitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siliciano and Tatchell, 1986</xref>): when both <bold>a</bold> and α information are expressed in the same cell, the <bold>a</bold>1 and α2 proteins form a transcriptional repressor whose targets include the <italic>HMLα</italic> promoter. Unless strains are carefully designed, conventional measures of silencing will also inadvertently measure this silencing-independent repression. To circumvent this limitation, we constructed an allele of <italic>HML</italic> with nonsense mutations in both <italic>α1</italic> and <italic>α2</italic>, so that the α1 and α2 proteins were never made, even when <italic>HML</italic> was de-repressed. This modification also allowed us to use α factor to arrest cells while studying silencing establishment at <italic>HML</italic>, which was not possible before because expression of either the α1 or α2 protein renders cells insensitive to α factor. We also introduced additional single nucleotide polymorphisms into the regions of <italic>HML</italic> that are homologous to <italic>HMR</italic>, to allow unambiguous assignment of high-throughput sequencing reads to the two loci (see below). We refer to the mutant locus as <italic>HML*</italic> and the mutant alleles as <italic>hmlα1*</italic> and hml<italic>α2*</italic> hereafter.</p><p>When cells with <italic>HML*</italic> and <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic>, were arrested in G1 and then treated with estradiol, they were unable to silence <italic>hmlα1*</italic> or <italic>hmlα2*</italic> while kept in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, expression of <italic>hmlα1*</italic> and hml<italic>α2*</italic> increased markedly over the course of the α-factor arrest. This α-factor-dependent hyper-activation was observed even in <italic>sir3∆</italic> cells in which no silencing occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). We identified two previously-unreported binding sites for Ste12, the transcription factor activated by mating pheromone, in the bidirectional <italic>α1</italic>/<italic>α2</italic> promoter, which explains the increased expression when cells are exposed to α factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolan et al., 1989</xref>). Both <italic>hmlα1*</italic> and <italic>hmlα2*</italic> decreased in expression following release from G1 to G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>), suggesting that S phase was required for partial silencing establishment at <italic>HML</italic>. Notably, the fold change in expression that followed a single passage through S phase was not identical among <italic>HMRa1</italic>, <italic>hmlα1*</italic>, and <italic>hmlα2*</italic>. Thus, some S-phase-dependent process was important for silencing both <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, but the effects of that process varied in magnitude between these two loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Silencing establishment occurred through a partially repressive intermediate</title><p>We were interested in the partial silencing observed in cells that transited through a single S phase after <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> induction, in which transcription of <italic>HMRa1</italic> was down ~60% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This appearance of a stable intermediate level of silencing could reflect either of two distinct phenomena at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). One possibility was that cells have a ~60% chance of establishing stable heterochromatin during the first S phase after <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> induction and a ~40% chance of failing to do so. This possibility would resonate with the behavior of certain mutants, for example <italic>sir1∆</italic>, wherein silent loci can exist in one of two epigenetic states: stably repressed or stably de-repressed, with rare transitions between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pillus and Rine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2006</xref>).

Notably, even though G1-arrested <italic>H3K79R</italic> cells could strongly repress <italic>HMRa1</italic> (~15 fold), this was still incomplete relative to fully silenced cells, which repressed <italic>HMRa1</italic> &gt;1000 fold (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, either increased time or cell cycle progression promoted silencing establishment even in absence of H3K79 methylation.</p><p>In addition to promoting S-phase-independent silencing establishment, <italic>dot1∆</italic> and <italic>H3K79R</italic> cells that passed from G1 to G2/M also repressed <italic>HMRa1</italic> more robustly than did wild-type cells transiting the same cell-cycle window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). S-phase passage markedly increased the speed of silencing establishment in <italic>dot1∆</italic> cells, though the ultimate degree of repression was similar whether cells passed through S phase or stayed in G1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Thus, some feature of S phase still promoted silencing establishment in cells lacking H3K79 methylation.</p><p>To understand how H3K79 methylation prevented silencing establishment, we performed ChIP-seq for Sir4-myc in <italic>dot1∆</italic> cells undergoing silencing establishment in the absence of cell-cycle progression. G1-arrested <italic>dot1∆</italic> cells already displayed clear partial silencing establishment after 1.5 hr in estradiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, the level of Sir4-myc recruitment to <italic>HML*</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> at this early time point was similar to the recruitment observed in wild-type cells, in which no gene repression had occurred after 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, even though <italic>dot1∆</italic> and wild-type cells had indistinguishable levels of Sir binding, that binding gave rise to different transcriptional effects. Thus, removal of H3K79me did not regulate silencing establishment by controlling Sir protein binding.</p><p>We next tested explicitly whether H3K79 methylation depletion can occur during a G1 arrest and during passage through S phase. As noted previously, in wild-type cells, H3K79 trimethylation (H3K79me3) is almost completely absent from <italic>HML*</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, but in <italic>sir3∆</italic> mutants, H3K79me3 is present at both loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). When <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> was induced in cells arrested in G1, no change in H3K79me3 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), even though robust Sir protein recruitment could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Sas2, the catalytic component of the SAS-I complex, acetylates H4K16 during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meijsing and Ehrenhofer-Murray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reiter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suka et al., 2002</xref>).

The magnitude of this effect was weaker than in <italic>dot1∆</italic> cells but highly significant.

These results highlighted the value of studying the dynamics of silencing both in populations of cells and at the single cell level. By monitoring changes in chromatin and changes in expression simultaneously, we documented effects that were elusive at steady state, but critical for a mechanistic understanding of the process. We found that the cell-cycle-dependent removal of euchromatic marks was a major driver of a cell’s ability to establish stable heterochromatin. Interpretation of our results required critical reassessment of some earlier results.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Silencing establishment occurred by tuning down transcription in individual cells after Sir proteins were bound</title><p>The classic model for silencing establishment involves two steps: nucleation of Sir proteins at the silencers, followed by spreading of Sir proteins from silencers via the stepwise deacetylation of nucleosomes by Sir2 and subsequent binding of Sir3 and Sir4 to deacetylated positions of H3 and H4 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hecht et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rusche et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rusché et al., 2002</xref>). In the classic model, individual Sir proteins are recruited to the silencers, but the spread across the locus is dependent on all three proteins Sir2/3/4, with both continuous Sir protein binding and histone deacetylation being required for gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang and Kirchmaier, 2006</xref>). The binding of a Sir2/3/4 complex to internal nucleosomes at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> is thought to drive gene repression at least partly through sterically preventing other proteins from accessing the underlying DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loo and Rine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Steakley and Rine, 2015</xref>). Repression may also rely on inhibition of specific steps in transcription downstream of activator binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Widom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao and Gross, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>). A puzzling observation is that, qualitatively, the nucleation and spread of Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 to <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> appears to be cell-cycle-independent, even though the silencing activity of these proteins is clearly dependent on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirchmaier and Rine, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that silencing establishment led to increased Sir4 binding both at silencers and across the silent loci, beginning from a low-level distributed binding that was present even in the absence of Sir3. The weak Sir4 binding across <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in <italic>sir3∆</italic> cells suggested that the full Sir2/3/4 complex was not necessary for the distributed binding of Sir4. Rather, Sir3 appeared to stabilize or otherwise enhance Sir4-nucleosome interactions. Further high-resolution ChIP-seq studies will be needed to determine whether Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4, which localize indistinguishably in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thurtle and Rine, 2014</xref>), behave similarly in the absence of the full complex, and during silencing establishment.</p><p>Upon induction of <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic>, G1-arrested wild-type cells could robustly recruit Sir4 to <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> without causing any gene repression at these loci. Passage through S phase led to increased Sir binding and partial silencing establishment. However, in G1-arrested <italic>dot1∆</italic> cells, in which Sir4 binding patterns were indistinguishable from G1-arrested wild-type cells, induction of <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> caused partial silencing establishment. Together, these observations indicate that a key regulated step in building heterochromatin occurred after the major silencing factors were already present at the locus. Two interpretations were compatible with our data. First, the non-repressive Sir4 binding observed in G1 and the repressive Sir4 binding observed in G2/M could differ in some parameter that is not apparent in crosslinking ChIP experiments, such as differences in the on and off rates for Sir4 binding to nucleosomes. Second, Sir binding could be unable to drive transcriptional changes until competing euchromatic marks on chromatin are relieved. Consistent with the latter interpretation, we found that Sir protein binding could lead to changes in H3K79 trimethylation only after S phase. In addition, a prior study of telomeric silencing found that while Sir protein binding was detectable at both repressed and de-repressed telomeres, euchromatic marks, including H3K79me, were found only at de-repressed telomeres, and that, in vitro, H3K79me could disturb silencing without changing Sir protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitada et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our smRNA-FISH results showed that silencing establishment proceeds via the gradual tune-down of transcription in individual cells, and that this tune-down occurs over multiple cell cycles. Interestingly, the fraction of cells with zero transcripts after a single S phase (~30%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), is similar to the fraction of cells that established phenotypic silencing after a single division in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>). While these results are not directly comparable, as the previous study assayed silencing at <italic>HML</italic> and used a different induction strategy, one possibility is that phenotypic silencing only arises when transcript number falls to zero in a given cell. This result conflicts with a prior study of silencing establishment in single cells using a fluorescent reporter at <italic>HML</italic>. That study concluded that silencing establishment proceeded via discrete transitions from the ‘ON’ to the ‘OFF’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). However, because that study relied on qualitative assessment of fluorescence intensity in individual cells, it may not have been possible to ascertain intermediate states. Indeed, our data illustrate an inherent limitation of qualitative measurements of single-cell parameters: in the smRNA-FISH images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, a striking feature is the dichotomy between cells with no transcripts and those with some transcripts. That observation might lead to the conclusion that silencing establishment is caused by the complete shutdown of transcription stochastically in some cells. However, as illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, that dichotomy is expected from both an ‘all-or-nothing’ model and a ‘gradual transition’ model. It is only through the quantitative analysis that we could see the gradual decrease in transcription in individual cells.</p><p>Whether silencing acts through steric occlusion or through a more specific inhibition of some component necessary for transcription, it is difficult to explain how any intermediate in the assembly of a static heterochromatin structure could drive partial repression. The simplest explanation for how partially repressive chromatin could form would be that silencing machinery and transcriptional machinery both come on and off the chromatin, and the establishment of silencing involves a change in the relative rates of those two processes. In that case, histone modifications could be crucial in shifting the balance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Euchromatic histone mark removal was a key cell-cycle-regulated step in silencing establishment</title><p>Removal of Dot1-deposited methylation of H3K79 was a critical step in silencing establishment. This finding was consistent with earlier studies of cycling cells, which found that <italic>dot1∆</italic> cells established silencing more quickly than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl proposed a model for silencing establishment in which Sir protein binding and histone deacetylation occur rapidly, followed by slow removal of methylation over several cell cycles, which is consistent with our findings. Removal of H3K79 methylation appears to be the primary reason why cells need to progress through S phase to establish silencing. Dot1 is thought to reduce the Sir3 BAH domain’s affinity for the nucleosome core by methylating H3K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ng et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Onishi et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to Dot1 and Sir3 both binding the nucleosome core at H3K79, they also compete for binding to the H4 tail, and deacetylation of the tail by Sir2 is thought to favor Sir3 binding at the expense of Dot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altaf et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, through modifications at H4K16 and H3K79, transcription and silencing mutually antagonize each other. In a cell in G1, even if Sir2/3/4 are able to displace Dot1 by deacetylating H4K16, H3K79me will remain until histones are turned over, which seems to explain the S-phase requirement for silencing establishment.</p><p>Silencing establishment at <italic>HMR</italic> does not require replication of the locus, as shown by the ability of excised episomes bearing <italic>HMR</italic> but no replication origin to establish silencing in an S-phase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirchmaier and Rine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2001</xref>). This finding presented a major mystery: what S-phase-specific process other than replication fork passage drives silencing establishment? Our results suggest that an influx of H3 molecules lacking methylation at K79 could be the solution. Replication-independent histone exchange can occur throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dion et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rufiange et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schlissel and Rine, 2019</xref>), which means that a replicating or non-replicating copy of <italic>HMR</italic> can incorporate histone molecules from the nuclear pool. Outside of S phase, ~90% of all H3 in the nucleus is methylated at K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Leeuwen et al., 2002</xref>), so histone exchange would likely lead to incorporation of the silencing-refractory methylated form. However, during S phase, a large quantity of newly-synthesized non-methylated H3 is present. Therefore, histone incorporation during S phase through either replication-coupled chromatin assembly or replication-independent histone turnover would lead to incorporation of many H3 molecules that are not methylated at K79. This might explain why silencing establishment can occur at <italic>HMR</italic>, whether it is replicated or not, and why that establishment depends on S phase.</p><p>We found that <italic>H3K79R</italic> mutants, which mimicked the non-methylated state of H3K79, also established silencing in G1-arrested cells and did so even more strongly than <italic>dot1∆</italic> mutants. A simple explanation for this difference in impact of the two mutations could be that Sir3 binds more strongly to arginine than lysine at position 79. Alternatively, Dot1 has been shown to have several methyltransferase-independent functions, and it was possible that one of these functions acted to promote silencing. In particular, Dot1 has recently been shown to possess histone chaperone activity that is independent of its ability to methylate histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, Dot1 has the methyltransferase-independent ability to stimulate ubiquitination of histone H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Welsem et al., 2018</xref>). The latter result is particularly interesting, because H2B ubiquitination is itself required for both H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ng et al., 2002b</xref>) and H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dover et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sun and Allis, 2002</xref>). Conflicting reports have pointed to a role of H3K4 methylation in silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fingerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mueller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Santos-Rosa et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible that in a <italic>dot1∆</italic> mutant, the removal of H3K79me per se promotes silencing, but an indirect effect through H2Bub and/or H3K4me partially counteracts the H3K79me effect.</p><p>The histone acetyltransferases Sas2 and Rtt109 also had roles in limiting silencing establishment to S phase. Individually, <italic>sas2∆</italic> and <italic>rtt109∆</italic> mutations led to partial silencing establishment in G1-arrested cells, and each of these effects was additive with a <italic>dot1∆</italic> mutation. Acetylation of H4K16 by Sas2, like methylation of H3K79 by Dot1, is critical in distinguishing euchromatin and heterochromatin. Interestingly, in a previous study, while <italic>dot1∆</italic> sped silencing establishment at <italic>HML</italic>, <italic>sas2∆</italic> delayed silencing establishment by that assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>). The single-cell α-factor response assay used in that study required cells to fully repress <italic>HML</italic> to gain the <bold>a</bold> mating type identity, whereas our assay used more direct measures of changes in transcription at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>. Thus, one explanation consistent with both results is that <italic>sas2∆</italic> cells begin silencing more readily than wild-type cells, but take more cell cycles to reach full repression. This could be the result of the competing effects of the <italic>sas2∆</italic> mutation: hypoacetylation of histones at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> might increase Sir protein recruitment, while the global pool of hypoacetylated histones can also titrate Sir proteins away from <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>.</p><p>The ability of <italic>rtt109∆</italic> cells to drive partial silencing establishment in G1-arrested cells was surprising. Like Sas2, Rtt109 binds to Asf1 and acetylates newly-synthesized histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>), but H3K56 acetylation is removed after S phase by the sirtuins Hst3 and Hst4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Celic et al., 2006</xref>). The residual H3K56ac present outside of S phase is due to transcription-coupled histone turnover, which incorporates new histones marked with H3K56ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rufiange et al., 2007</xref>). A negative role for H3K56 acetylation in silencing has been observed, although this has not been well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodson and Rine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2008</xref>). One simple model is that H3K56ac favors transcription, and thus impedes silencing establishment. However, given genome-wide acetylation and deacetylation of H3K56, indirect effects cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Silencing establishment occurred via similar mechanisms at different loci</title><p>The mechanism of repression at the two silent mating type loci, <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>, is generally assumed to be quite similar, but there are mutations that cause effects only at one of the two loci, and others that cause divergent phenotypes between the two loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park and Szostak, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrenhofer-Murray et al., 1997</xref>; Yan and Rine, unpublished).

Given that H3K79 methylation is a major regulator of silencing establishment, this could explain the observation that <italic>hmlα2*</italic> was also the gene whose silencing was weakest after a single S phase of silencing establishment. The interrelation between promoter strength, transcription-coupled histone modification, and silencing remains a fascinating topic for future study.</p><p>This fundamental similarity between <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in silencing establishment was further evidenced by the lack of an effect of the tRNA gene adjacent to <italic>HMR,</italic> or the tRNA gene’s binding partner, cohesin, loss of either of which were reported to allow early silencing establishment in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazarus and Holmes, 2011</xref>). The reason behind the differences between our results and those of the previous studies was not clear. We did observe subtle silencing-independent fluctuations in <italic>HMRa1</italic> expression through the cell cycle, which may have confounded earlier results that relied on non-quantitative RT-PCR assays (data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that differences between <italic>SIR3-EBD</italic> and earlier inducible alleles contributed to the different results, as temperature, metabolism, and hormone addition could each affect silencing or the cell cycle in unappreciated ways. Lazarus and Holmes’s use of the galactose promoter to drive <italic>SIR3</italic> expression would alter Sir3 concentration and the stoichiometry of the SIR complex, both of which would be expected to be important parameters in regulating silencing establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Do the contributions of <italic>DOT1</italic>, <italic>SAS2</italic>, and <italic>RTT109</italic> completely resolve the cell-cycle requirement for silencing establishment?</title><p>In <italic>dot1∆</italic> mutants, S phase still dramatically accelerated silencing establishment, indicating that some feature of S phase beyond H3K79me removal was important in those cells. In addition, we found no case in which silencing establishment in G1-arrested cells matched the degree of silencing observed after overnight growth in estradiol. However, the ~90% repression observed in, for example G1-arrested <italic>H3K79R</italic> cells should be sufficient to completely turn off transcription at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> in the majority of cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The quantitative gap in the level of silencing seen at steady state and that which is achieved in the experiments reported here could reflect a requirement for further cell-cycle steps or more time to complete silencing establishment. Others have identified a cell-cycle window between G2/M and G1 that contributes to silencing establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau et al., 2002</xref>), and none of our data were inconsistent with that result. Identifying mutant conditions in which G1-arrested cells and cycling cells establish silencing at an equal rate will be required before the cell-cycle-regulated establishment of silencing is fully understood. In addition, future studies should address whether the antagonistic effects of euchromatic histone modifications on silencing establishment can be counteracted by increasing SIR complex concentration.</p><p>Together, our data suggest that silencing establishment cannot proceed without removal of histone modifications that favor transcription. In this view, at any stage of the cell cycle, Sir proteins can bind to <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>. Passage through S phase leads to incorporation of new histones, which, crucially, lack H3K79 methylation. This decrease of H3K79me by half leads to both further Sir binding and decreased transcription. However, one cell cycle is not sufficient to fully deplete activating marks, and successive passages through S phase complete the process of silencing establishment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>Various</td><td>This paper</td><td>NCBITaxon:4932</td><td>See<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-c-myc beads (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat #

Following a 5 min quench in 300 mM glycine, cells were washed twice in ice-cold TBS and twice in ice-cold FA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) + 0.1% SDS + protease inhibitors (cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Sigma-Aldrich 11873580001). Cell pellets were then either flash frozen or lysed. For lysis, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL FA lysis buffer without EDTA + 0.1% SDS and ~500 µL 0.5 mm zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec Products; Bartlesville, OK) were added. Cells were lysed using a FastPrep-24 5G (MP Biomedicals; Irvine, CA) with 6.0 m/s beating for 20 s followed by 2 min on ice, repeated four times total.

without the need for replication itself. The support provided for a model in which existing chromatin carrying histones with pro-transcription modifications must be turned over by passive mechanisms fed by the unmodified histones available only during S phase provides an elegant solution to this persistent question, and your use of orthogonal, robust methods provides high confidence in the conclusions. The results have high relevance to models for epigenetic switches outside the yeast system and will therefore have broad impact.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;S-phase-independent silencing establishment in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Tim Formosa as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rohinton T Kamakaka (Reviewer #2); Danesh Moazed (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Goodnight and Rine provide new insight into a longstanding puzzle regarding the establishment of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin in yeast. Using higher resolution ChIP and single-molecule RNA detection methods, they show that cells must pass through S phase multiple times to promote establishment of silenced heterochromatin, and suggest that it is the availability of a large pool of histones lacking modifications associated with transcriptional activation during S phase that is the key requirement met during this period but not during other parts of the cell cycle. These new insights have broad impact on understanding how epigenetic states are established and inherited.</p><p>The data are of high quality and are clearly presented. However, several issues were raised during review that should be considered by the authors prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should be more careful to present the contributions of other groups to the model they propose more accurately, especially concerning the use of mutations in <italic>HML</italic> here relative to work published by the Holmes and Sternglanz labs. Further, the distinction between Sir protein occupancy and timing of silencing and the requirement of multiple cell divisions for complete silencing that are key results here was also noted by the Struhl lab in their 2005 paper.</p><p>2) Reviewers felt that the manuscript would be strengthened by more discussion of their current in vivo findings in the context of what is known about the biochemical activities of Sir proteins in reconstitution experiments in vitro. The results in the following publications seem particularly relevant: Onishi et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2013; Kitada et al., 2012.</p><p>3) The Sir3-EBD strategy has certain advantages but may also be the source of some discrepancies with previous work. Ideally, the authors should consider some side-by-side comparisons of the new method with older approaches. However, it would be sufficient here to note the possible complications introduced by using a different approach and to use more restrained language in describing its superiority over past approaches to avoid implying that these results invalidate previous findings.</p><p>4) Several points of interest were raised that may be addressable by changes to the text, or the authors may consider them important enough to provide new experimental data; the latter is encouraged but not required.

We agree that the conclusions reached by our study agree with and build on the results of Katan-Khaykovich and Struhl and have introduced further context in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction and in the first paragraph of the subsection “Euchromatic histone mark removal was a key cell-cycle-regulated step in silencing establishment”, clarifying what is new in this study and what was identified by them in 2005.</p><p>With respect to the work of the Holmes and Sternglanz labs, we tried to take a nuanced approach as we believe that several key experiments from those labs were uninterpretable because of their lack of consideration of the issue of the a1/α2 repressor. In our effort to not offer offense to the authors of those studies, we erred on the side of understatement. Studying silencing establishment at <italic>HML</italic> inherently difficult due to the confounding effects from the a1/α2 repressor that we believe led the Sternglanz/Holmes experiments astray. In our revision we have been more explicit about their conclusions and have emphasized the limitations of ours caused by the Ste12-driven hyperactivation of <italic>HML.</italic> We have introduced a comment in the Discussion that emphasizes how our <italic>HML</italic> data have limitations (subsection “Silencing establishment occurred via similar mechanisms at different loci”, first paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers felt that the manuscript would be strengthened by more discussion of their current in vivo findings in the context of what is known about the biochemical activities of Sir proteins in reconstitution experiments in vitro. The results in the following publications seem particularly relevant: Onishi et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2013; Kitada et al., 2012.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this relevant literature. We agree that many of the results presented here are buttressed by in vitro data about silencing, particularly with respect to the impact of H3K79 methylation on Sir3 binding. We have increased our citations of the suggested studies (subsections “Silencing establishment occurred by tuning down transcription in individual cells after Sir proteins were bound” and “Euchromatic histone mark removal was a key cell-cycle-regulated step in silencing establishment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Sir3-EBD strategy has certain advantages but may also be the source of some discrepancies with previous work. Ideally, the authors should consider some side-by-side comparisons of the new method with older approaches. However, it would be sufficient here to note the possible complications introduced by using a different approach and to use more restrained language in describing its superiority over past approaches to avoid implying that these results invalidate previous findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers about the importance of offering some validation that use of Sir3-EBD given that we are making comparisons to earlier work of others with <italic>sir3-8</italic>. We have tested the comparability directly and have now have included a new experiment in Figure 4E demonstrating that <italic>dot1∆</italic> can lead to S-phase-independent silencing establishment using the classic <italic>sir3-8</italic> allele with data that are essentially indistinguishable with the data from Sir3-EBD. We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to address this as other readers would likely have had the same reservations. Although we have now removed this unknown, there may still be unknown unknowns, and in our Discussion, we emphasized the potential role that different alleles of Sir3 could play in different experiments (see subsection “Silencing establishment occurred via similar mechanisms at different loci”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Several points of interest were raised that may be addressable by changes to the text, or the authors may consider them important enough to provide new experimental data; the latter is encouraged but not required. These include the following questions: Is the 60% repression observed in one cell cycle enough to block mating in a phenotypic assay?</p></disp-quote><p>This specific experiment (assaying mating) is not possible in our strains, since we rely on α-factor responsiveness of cells with or without intact silencing to synchronize cells. However, a previous study by Osborne et al. speaks to the comparison between RNA measurements and mating ability. We have added a more explicit discussion of this study (subsection “Silencing establishment occurred by tuning down transcription in individual cells after Sir proteins were bound”, fourth paragraph), which we feel addresses the point: while direct comparisons between the two studies are difficult, we believe mating ability is probably restored only when ~0 transcripts per cell are present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can silencing be established in G1 by overexpression of Sir2/3/4?</p></disp-quote><p>We have long been interested in this question, but so far have not been able to achieve simultaneous overexpression of all three proteins in a balanced way. Moreover, work by others emphasize the potential importance of stoichiometry over overproduction. For example, while mild increases in Sir4 dosage can speed silencing establishment, strong overexpression leads to weakened silencing (Larin et al., PMID: 26587833). We are working to develop an overexpression strategy that we are confident maintains proper complex stoichiometry, but we have no idea when that will be successful. We have included a comment in the Discussion (subsection “Do the contributions of DOT1, SAS2, and RTT109 completely resolve the cell-cycle requirement for silencing establishment?”) that raises this as a topic for future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the proposal suggested here that differences between HML and HMR are due to promoter differences be tested by swapping the a/α information at these sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We made no claims about the source of differences seen at <italic>HML</italic> vs. <italic>HMR</italic>. We agree that strength of transcription is likely to be key, but our basic finding is that the differences in silencing establishment at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> are minor: <italic>HMRa1</italic> is repressed ~0.6x after a single S-phase, while <italic>hmlα2*</italic> is repressed ~0.4x. We do not view this difference as a fruitful avenue for future study. However, we added a new experiment in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, which aimed to answer a different question (namely, is H3K79 methylation depletion in fact limited only to S phase), but revealed a difference between <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic>: <italic>hmlα2*</italic> was far less able to deplete H3K79me after 1 S phase than was <italic>HMRa1</italic>. This could be due to a difference in strength of transcription (which drives H3K79 methylation). We have included this comment on possible contribution of promoter strength in our discussion of the new result (subsection “Silencing establishment occurred via similar mechanisms at different loci”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does Sir3 occupancy match the Sir4 occupancy reported here?</p></disp-quote><p>We have introduced Figure 3—figure supplement 3, which shows that Sir3-EBD binds indistinguishably from Sir4-13xMyc at steady state. In addition, we have resolved an issue that some find puzzling about the lack of a Sir protein signal at the silencers in the MNase seq data. We have added a new experiment showing the Sir4 occupancy determined by sonication ChIP-seq (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This experiment revealed that, as we suspected, our MNase ChIP-seq data severely under-report Sir4 binding to the silencers of <italic>HMR</italic> and <italic>HML</italic> due to their MNase sensitivity. We have adjusted our claims in the text to reflect this new information, but these data do not change any of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors might consider providing some additional context for the non-expert reader.
