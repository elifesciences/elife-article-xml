IL-1β+ macrophages express genes cooperatively induced by PGE2 and TNF signaling, but mechanisms that induce these cells are not known. We used an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis in primary human monocytes to study PGE2-TNF crosstalk, and how it is regulated by IFN-γ, as occurs in RA synovial macrophages. We identified a TNF + PGE2 (TP) induced gene expression signature that is enriched in IL1β+ RA and ICI-arthritis monocytic subsets, and includes genes in pathogenic IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine pathways. ICI-arthritis myeloid cells mapped primarily onto four previously defined RA synovial monocytic clusters, and TP genes were expressed in a manner suggestive of a new functional monocyte subset. TP signature genes are distinct from canonical inflammatory NF-κB target genes such as <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>IL12B</italic> and are activated by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP and NR4A family transcription factors with TNF-induced NF-κB activity. Unexpectedly, IFN-γ suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP and NR4A activity to ablate induction of IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine genes, while promoting expression of distinct inflammatory genes such as <italic>TNF</italic> and T cell chemokines like CXCL10. The opposing cross-regulation of PGE2 and IFN signaling in vitro was reflected in vivo in mutually exclusive expression of TP and IFN signatures in different cell clusters in RA and ICI-arthritis monocytes. These results reveal the basis for synergistic induction of inflammatory genes by PGE2 and TNF, and a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant for RA and ICI-arthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>tumor necrosis factor</kwd><kwd>interferon gamma</kwd><kwd>immune checkpoint inhibition</kwd><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR046713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivashkiv</surname><given-names>Lionel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR050401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivashkiv</surname><given-names>Lionel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI046712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivashkiv</surname><given-names>Lionel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interferon-γ and prostaglandin E2 signaling oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant for rheumatoid and immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced arthritis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a small lipid molecule with homeostatic functions in various tissues whose production is strongly upregulated after tissue injury or inflammatory signaling. PGE2 plays a key role in early acute inflammation by increasing vascular permeability and activating mast cells, with associated tissue edema and influx of immune cells such as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsuge et al., 2019</xref>). PGE2 is also a key mediator of acute pain, in part by acting directly on nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawabata, 2011</xref>). Inhibition of these PGE2-mediated functions explains the effectiveness of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that suppress PGE2 production in alleviating acute pain and tissue swelling. In contrast to activating mesenchymal cells, PGE2 has generally been considered to have primarily suppressive effects on both innate and adaptive immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacKenzie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perretti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sundberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 2013</xref>). This includes inhibition of Th1 cells and IFN-γ production, and inhibition of induction of inflammatory genes such as <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>IL12B,</italic> and <italic>IFNB</italic> in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Such inhibition raises the possibility that the expression of these genes increases after NSAID therapy, which would contribute to lesser effectiveness and lack of disease-modifying activity of NSAIDs in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smolen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In myeloid cells, PGE2 signals primarily via EP2 and EP4 receptors, which are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that elevate intracellular cAMP to directly activate protein kinase A (PKA) and signaling effector EPAC, which is coupled to small GTPases Rap1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 2013</xref>). The immune suppressive effects of PGE2 have been attributed to PKA-mediated activation of transcription factor (TF) CREB and histone deacetylases 4 and 5 (HDAC4/5). CREB induces expression of transcriptional repressors such as <italic>CREM</italic> and <italic>ATF3</italic>, and CREB can suppress NF-κB activity in a gene-specific manner by mechanisms that are not fully understood but include competition for transcription coactivator CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altarejos and Montminy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerlo et al., 2011</xref>). HDACs 4/5 bind to inflammatory gene loci such as <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> and suppress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luan et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, PGE2 suppresses TLR-induced autocrine IFN responses by suppressing TLR4 trafficking and signaling via TRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perkins et al., 2018</xref>), preventing induction of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> and de novo enhancers by suppressing activity of TF MEF2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cilenti et al., 2021</xref>), and attenuating induction of IRF8 target genes by suppressing IRF8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayerl et al., 2023</xref>). In accord with the suppression of immune cells, activation of cAMP signaling has shown therapeutic benefit in various inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsuge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4, which increase intracellular cAMP in immune cells, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2018</xref>). However, the efficacy of these therapies may be limited by concomitant pro-inflammatory effects of cAMP signaling, such as cell-, gene-, and context-specific augmentation of NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerlo et al., 2011</xref>). The importance of deciphering the mechanisms by which PGE2 activates inflammatory gene expression in macrophages is highlighted by a recent study showing that cooperation between PGE2 and TNF induces IL-1<italic>β</italic>+ tumor-associated macrophages that are associated with disease progression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caronni et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Activated monocytes and macrophages that infiltrate inflamed synovium (joint tissues) in RA and produce inflammatory mediators and cytokines have been strongly implicated in disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gravallese and Firestein, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalliolias and Ivashkiv, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McInnes and Schett, 2011</xref>). High-level expression of inflammatory genes in RA synovitis has long been appreciated, and recent studies using high-dimensional single-cell profiling technologies have identified subsets of synovial monocytes/macrophages (hereafter termed MonoMacs) and highlighted a pervasive IFN signature and likely pathogenic myeloid subsets that coordinately express NF-κB target genes and interferon-stimulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alivernini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mandelin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orange et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). One RA synovial macrophage subset, termed cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>, was increased in RA relative to osteoarthritis samples, was proposed to be pathogenic based on elevated expression of inflammatory genes, and was notable for high <italic>IL1B</italic> expression. IL-1<italic>β</italic>+ monocytes and macrophages have also been observed in inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis (ICI-arthritis) that occurred after anti-PD-1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2024</xref>). In RA, the macrophage cluster 1 gene expression signature could be modeled by coculture of monocytes with synovial fibroblasts in the presence of TNF, and a substantial fraction of the fibroblast+TNF effect was dependent upon fibroblast-produced PGE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donlin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, TNF-induced and PGE2-mediated fibroblast–monocyte crosstalk cooperatively induced expression of potentially pathogenic cluster 1 genes such as <italic>HBEGF</italic>, <italic>EREG</italic>, <italic>IL1B,</italic> and transcription factor (TF) <italic>STAT4</italic>. Other studies also found that early RA synovial biopsy tissues showed enrichment of ‘eicosanoid’ and ‘cAMP-mediated signaling’ pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>), and RNAseq of purified macrophages from synovial biopsies identified six gene modules, one of which showed enrichment for ‘G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mandelin et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these studies establish activation of the PGE2-cAMP pathway in a likely pathogenic subset of RA synovial macrophages and suggest that crosstalk of PGE2-cAMP with TNF and possibly IFN signaling is important for the pathogenic phenotype.</p><p>Therapeutic targeting of immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1 and CTLA4 has been highly effective in cancer therapy, but is also associated with autoimmune responses, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs), in greater than 80% of treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Bass, 2022</xref>). Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy induces inflammatory arthritis in approximately 4% of patients. ICI-arthritis begins shortly after treatment and can develop into a severe and persistent polyarthritis that requires anti-inflammatory therapy and even joint replacement. Although ICI-arthritis patients are typically negative for autoantibodies diagnostic for RA, such as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) or rheumatoid factor, joint pathology and synovitis can be similar to RA, with infiltration by lymphocytes and myeloid cells, pannus formation, and joint tissue destruction. Recent work has highlighted synovial and blood expansion of oligoclonal IFN-γ-expressing CD8+T cells that show evidence of activation by type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Patients treated with combined inhibition of PD-1 and CTLA4 show elevated levels of CD4+T cells expressing IL-17 or IL-17 together with IFN-γ (also known as transient Th17 cells). The myeloid compartment includes IL-1ß-hi monocyte and macrophage subsets, and ICI-arthritis synovial fluid contains elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-17A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2024</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that crosstalk among these infiltrating immune cells and their secreted products could generate myeloid cell subsets similar to those in RA.</p><p>We wished to understand the full spectrum of pathogenic inflammatory genes induced by cooperation between PGE2 and TNF signaling to gain insight into mechanisms underlying signaling crosstalk and address the important question of how PGE2-TNF crosstalk is modulated by IFN-γ, as occurs in RA synovial macrophages. We performed an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility using primary human monocytes, which correspond directly to cells that migrate into inflamed synovium and provide an opportunity to model in vivo activation. We identified a ‘TNF+PGE2’ (TP) gene expression signature that is enriched in RA synovial monocytic subsets and includes genes in pathogenic IL-1, Notch, and neutrophil chemokine pathways. A similar gene expression signature was also apparent in ICI-arthritis myeloid subsets that showed similarity to pathogenic RA monocytic subtypes. Expression of the TP signature was driven by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A family TFs with TNF-induced NF-κB activity. IFN-γ suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A activity and suppressed IL-1, Notch, and neutrophil chemokine genes, while promoting expression of distinct inflammatory genes and T cell chemokines. Mutually exclusive expression of TP and IFN signatures in distinct RA and ICI-arthritis myeloid cell subsets supported similar opposing cross-regulation amongst these pathways in vivo. These results reveal a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant for the pathogenesis of RA and ICI-arthritis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PGE2 augments expression of a large subset of TNF-inducible genes</title><p>We used RNAseq to perform a transcriptomic analysis of the effects of PGE2 on the TNF response in monocytes. Primary human monocytes were stimulated with PGE2 (280 nM) and/or TNF (20 ng/ml) and harvested 3 or 24 hr after stimulation for RNAseq analysis; the experimental design is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. As expected, co-stimulation of monocytes with PGE2+TNF induced expression of genes enriched in inflammatory and NF-κB pathways, largely reflecting a TNF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Clustering of genes upregulated after 3 hr of stimulation (n=747; fold change &gt;2, false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05) based upon pattern of expression confirmed that PGE2 suppresses expression of a subset of TNF-inducible genes including <italic>TNF</italic> itself and interferon-stimulated genes <italic>CXCL9</italic>, <italic>CXCL10,</italic> and <italic>CXCL11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, group III, n=86 suppressed genes). Surprisingly, PGE2 augmented TNF-mediated induction of a substantially larger number of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, groups I and V, 395 co-stimulated genes). Pathway analysis revealed that genes costimulated by PGE2+TNF were similarly enriched in inflammatory pathways (e.g., response to lipopolysaccharide, neutrophil migration), although the enriched pathways were partially distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

While immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment of malignancies, ICI can lead to autoimmune side effects including inflammatory arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougan et al., 2021</xref>). Approximately 4% of ICI-treated patients can develop autoimmune inflammatory arthritis that persists despite cessation of ICI therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braaten et al., 2020</xref>), and understanding mechanisms and pathways that activate immune cells in ICI-arthritis may yield insights into the pathogenesis of spontaneous autoimmune arthritides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cappelli et al., 2020</xref>). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of mononuclear cells FACS-sorted from synovial fluids of five ICI-arthritis patients and from two synovial tissues from one ICI-arthritis patient who underwent bilateral knee replacements. These patients had received anti-PD1 antibodies as monotherapy or in combination with anti-CTLA4 therapy (clinical characteristics of patients are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Following subclustering of monocytes and macrophages, we defined eight clusters from 14,110 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To this end, we retrieved the RA myeloid cell scRNAseq dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>. We utilized the same 15 myeloid cell clusters defined in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and generated an essentially similar uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot that displayed the myeloid clusters including proposed pathogenic IL1B+ FCN1+ HBEGF+ (termed ‘inflammatory’), STAT1+ CXCL10 + (express high IFN signature), and SPP1+ (express ‘wound healing’ phenotype) monocytic subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Reference mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lotfollahi et al., 2024</xref>) showed that the majority of ICI-arthritis myeloid cells mapped onto four RA myeloid clusters: IL1B + FCN1 + HBEGF+, STAT1+ CXCL10+, SPP1+, and MERTK+ HBEGF+ clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The correspondence of ICI-arthritis cells to these specific RA clusters was corroborated by an independent computational approach involving integration, reclustering, and within-cluster dataset overlap analysis of the two datasets (not shown). These results support the similarity of certain ICI-arthritis and RA myeloid cell types, but this interpretation is subject to several caveats (see ‘Discussion’). We then investigated the expression of TP gene sets in RA and ICI-arthritis myeloid clusters by calculating gene set activity scores in each cell using the AUCell package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) as described in ‘Materials and methods’, and visualizing gene expression on UMAP plots.

Notably, the TP signature was absent from the IFN signature-expressing STAT1+ CXCL10+ cells. We then analyzed the expression of TP genes in ICI-arthritis myeloid cells (projected onto RA cell clusters as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). TP gene expression in ICI-arthritis cells was apparent in the same general and contiguous area of the projected UMAP and spanned the same clusters as expression in RA cells, except TP genes were expressed in a smaller fraction of cells in some of the RA-defined cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The size of a node reflects the number of unique functional connections between a node and other nodes in the network and edges connect associated nodes. Notably, TFs were grouped together with their targets in several ICs, for example, IC2 contains IRF2 and IRF8 and their targets; IC4 contains NF-κB1,2 and RELB and their targets; IC6 contains Myc and its targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Although RNA levels of Jun are regulated only weakly, its ultimate activity and binding site repertoire are affected by relative levels of dimerization partners and interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). For example, BATF2 (IC2) and BATF (IC6) were up- and down-regulated by the combination of IFN-γ and (T+P) relative to (T+P), which potentially affects relative abundance of JUN/BATF/IRF ternary complexes. Similarly, CEBPA, CEBPE (IC3), and MYC (IC6) are regulated in a reciprocal fashion: IFN-γ relieves a (T+P) inhibition of CEBPA and CEBPE yet also concomitantly decreases MYC mRNA levels. A recent report describing negative regulation of Myc by CEBPA/E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Theilgaard-Mönch et al., 2022</xref>) suggests that a similar mechanism is involved in IFN-γ-dependent inhibition of Myc and its targets. Overall, the interaction analysis indicates that IFN-γ does not alter the core NF-κB response (which is activated primarily by TNF) and suggests that instead IFN-γ regulates the PGE2 response, at least in part by modulating PGE2-induced AP-1 and CEBP factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>IFN-γ inhibits PGE2-induced gene expression and chromatin accessibility</title><p>We tested this notion that IFN-γ regulates the PGE2 response using combined transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analysis.

We investigated mechanisms of crosstalk between PGE2 and TNF that costimulated expression of inflammatory and pathogenic genes. Epigenomic analysis revealed the cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A family TFs with TNF-induced NF-κB activity to drive expression of pathogenic gene modules including IL-1, Notch, and neutrophil chemokine pathways. The genes in these pathways are distinct from canonical inflammatory genes such as <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>IL6,</italic> and <italic>IL12B</italic> that are driven by core NF-κB and IRF signaling.

IFN-γ and PGE2 signaling also appeared to oppose each other in vivo in inflammatory arthritis, based upon mutually exclusive expression of IFN and TP signatures in different cell clusters. These results reveal the basis for synergistic induction of inflammatory genes by PGE2 and TNF, and a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Crosstalk between PGE2 and TNF signaling and its regulation by IFN-γ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PGE2 costimulates TNF-induced expression of select inflammatory genes such as IL-1 and Notch pathway genes and neutrophil chemokines by inducing transcription factors including CEBP, AP-1, and NR4A1/2 that cooperate with TNF-activated NF-κB (left).

In contrast to IFNs that are generally thought to be ‘pro-inflammatory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivashkiv, 2018</xref>), PGE2-cAMP signaling in innate immune cells is considered anti-inflammatory based upon inhibition of <italic>TNF</italic> and ISGs such as <italic>CXCL10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsuge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Recent reports by our and other laboratories showed that PGE2+TNF drive expression of EGFR ligands such as <italic>HBEGF</italic> in myeloid cells, thereby promoting proliferation and invasive behavior of synovial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>), expansion of pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caronni et al., 2023</xref>), and survival and reparative capacities of intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, TP costimulation can have pathogenic or protective roles, depending on context. The current study further extends this paradigm by showing that TP costimulation promotes expression of additional pathogenic modules in RA including IL-1-related genes that promote tissue degradation, Notch ligands that can activate synovial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zack et al., 2024</xref>), and neutrophil chemokines that can contribute to initiation or flares of inflammatory arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gravallese and Firestein, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zec et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Although our study focuses on monocytes/macrophages, TNF and PGE2 also cooperate to promote maturation and antigen-presenting capacity of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rieser et al., 1997</xref>).

Additionally, in vitro-matured human DCs, including those stimulated with TNF+PGE2, have been developed for DC-mediated therapy such as vaccination against tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steinman and Pope, 2002</xref>). In previous work, we had found that in human in vitro generated DCs, TNF and PGE2 costimulation induced expression of DC maturation markers such as CD25, CD40, and CD86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2008</xref>). It will be interesting in future work to determine whether some of the crosstalk mechanisms described in the current study also play a role in driving gene expression during DC maturation.</p><p>In contrast to the cooperation of IRFs with NF-κB that drives signature inflammatory genes, our results suggest that the distinct TP gene expression program is promoted by cooperation of NF-κB with CEBP, AP-1, and NR4A1/2 TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, left). CEBP is a pioneer TF that can open chromatin, and its induction helps explain the formation of de novo enhancers under costimulation conditions. The above-mentioned PGE2-induced TFs are well-established target genes for canonical cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altarejos and Montminy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerlo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), which is in accord with our results implicating this pathway downstream of PGE2 and EP2 and EP4 receptors. A role for CREB was not identified by our experimental approaches, possibly because the number of direct CREB target genes was too small to pass statistical significance thresholds or because CREB binds to its target genes under basal conditions and is activated by phosphorylation rather than changes in DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altarejos and Montminy, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, IFN-γ suppressed the PGE2-induced transcriptional program by inhibiting the activity of AP-1 and NR4A1/2 and altering the expression profile of CEBP, which was associated with abrogation of expression of IL-1, Notch, and neutrophil chemokine gene modules. These results identify an unexpected dual role for IFN-γ and suggest that the inflammatory profile of TNF signaling is regulated by the local balance between PGE2 and IFN-γ activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>Previous work characterizing RA synovial cells using scRNAseq identified various inflammatory monocyte and macrophage subsets, and reparative MERTK+ macrophages that are associated with remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alivernini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). MERTK+ cells appear to have a tissue-resident macrophage phenotype, produce inflammation-resolving mediators, and promote a repair response in synovial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alivernini et al., 2020</xref>). Early studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) with limited cell numbers resolved RA synovial myeloid cells into four subtypes, which included inflammatory IL1<italic>β</italic>+ monocytes that express NF-κB target genes and a distinct monocyte cluster that expresses high levels of ISGs and thus an IFN signature. The inflammatory IL1<italic>β</italic>+ monocytes also expressed TNF-inducible genes whose expression is augmented by PGE2-producing fibroblasts. In the current study, we have defined TP genes whose expression is co-stimulated by adding PGE2 to TNF and showed that they are expressed in IL1<italic>β</italic>+ cluster 1 as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, and in a subset of ICI-arthritis myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We have also found that the TP signature is expressed in an IL1<italic>β</italic>+ FCN1+ HBEGF+ subset of RA monocytes defined in a more recent study with larger cell numbers that subclustered RA myeloid cells at a higher resolution of 15 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, the TP signature was not limited to IL1<italic>β</italic>+ FCN1+ HBEGF+ cells, but instead partially extended into adjacent SPP1+, MERTK+ LIVE1-, and DC2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); DC2s have recently been shown to have distinct homeostatic and pathogenic functions in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacDonald et al., 2024</xref>). One possibility is that the proximity of cells to PGE2-producing fibroblasts modulates subsets of functionally distinct SPP1+ and MERTK+ LIVE1- cells to exhibit a superimposed TP phenotype. Alternatively, the TP signature may identify one functional phenotype of synovial monocyte that was not well captured by the clustering as performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>. The latter possibility is suggested by the clean separation of a TP-expressing cluster in ICI-arthritis myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and the localization of TP-expressing ICI-arthritis cells in one UMAP region that spans several RA clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, the pattern of TP gene expression on these UMAPs very closely resembles the pattern of myeloid cell neighborhoods associated with the myeloid subtype of RA, as shown in Figure 4B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>. The function of TP signature-expressing cells will be investigated in future work using functional analysis of cell subtypes isolated from inflamed joints.</p><p>Our in vitro studies showing opposition between IFN-γ and PGE2 in regulation of specific TNF-inducible gene sets, suppression of ISGs by PGE2, and suppression of PGE2 responses by IFN-γ predicts that IFN-γ and PGE2 may cross-inhibit each other in vivo, resulting in cell clusters that are ISG+ TP- (strongly activated by IFNs) or ISG- TP+ (strongly activated by PGE2). This prediction was indeed borne out, as the IL1<italic>β</italic>+ FCN1+ HBEGF+ cells are essentially devoid of ISG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://immunogenomics.io">https://immunogenomics.io</ext-link>), and STAT1+ CXCL10+ ISG-hi cells did not express TP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As synovial IFN-γ is made predominantly by T cells and PGE2 by fibroblasts, this suggests that colocalization of monocytes with either T cells (e.g., in lymphoid aggregates) or with fibroblasts (e.g., in synovial lining) can determine IFN versus TP phenotype. Cells that simultaneously receive both IFN and PGE2 inputs may exhibit mixed expression of both signatures, for example the TP+ subset of SPP1+ or MERTK+ LYVE1- cells. The relative strength of IFN-γ versus PGE2 signaling would determine functional outcomes. This idea can be tested in future work using spatial transcriptomics to colocalize various myeloid subsets with IFN-γ-expressing T cells or PGE2-producing fibroblasts.</p><p>Our results indicate a level of similarity between ICI-arthritis and RA synovial myeloid subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; similar results were obtained using an independent computational approach to integrate the RA and ICI-arthritis datasets). The striking segregation of monocytic clusters expressing TP signature genes and ISGs in our ICI-arthritis dataset represents another similarity to RA. These results are subject to several caveats. RA myeloid cells were derived from synovial tissue, whereas the majority of ICI-arthritis cells were from synovial fluids. This may explain the lack of more mature tissue macrophage-like cells (clusters M0-M3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) in the ICI-arthritis dataset. Additionally, the smaller number of ICI-arthritis cells analyzed limited the ability to capture more rare subsets, such as some of the DC populations that were detected in RA. Lastly, reference mapping, while computationally rigorous, is a constrained approach because it will only assign cells to clusters in the reference set (i.e., will not generate de novo clusters), creating the possibility of false-positive assignment. We decreased this possibility by using only myeloid cells from each dataset and corroborated the results using a complementary dataset integration approach. In future work, it will be important to perform a more thorough analysis of more extensive RA and ICI-arthritis datasets. It will be informative to perform this analysis in responders and nonresponders to TNF blockade and NSAID therapy, which would causally link these pathways with myeloid subsets and help in utilizing myeloid pathogenic cell clusters in patient stratification.</p><p>Major sources of PGE2 in inflammatory arthritis and tumors are stromal cells such as fibroblasts and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayerl et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsuge et al., 2019</xref>). This argues that macrophages in tissue niches characterized by interaction with fibroblasts will strongly express the PGE2-driven gene expression program including expression of EGFR and Notch ligands that activate fibroblasts, suggestive of a positive feedback loop. Associated high expression of TP-induced neutrophil chemokines would promote neutrophil-mediated inflammation. IL-1 action on myeloid cells strongly induces COX2 and thus PG production, and an autocrine IL-1-PGE2 loop can further amplify the TP response, as shown in pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caronni et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, the major sources of IFN-γ in RA are T cells, which are localized either to ectopic germinal center-like structures or are dispersed throughout inflamed synovium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gravallese and Firestein, 2023</xref>). IFN-γ is also highly expressed by CD8+T cells in ICI-arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). IFN-γ-exposed macrophages express T cell chemokines such as CXCL10 instead of neutrophil chemokines, thereby promoting T cell-mediated pathogenesis instead of stromal-neutrophil mediated pathogenic responses. Based upon our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishra and Ivashkiv, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiao et al., 2013</xref>) and the current study, these macrophages would be predicted to express signature NF-κB target genes such as <italic>TNF</italic>, which was indeed the case with the STAT1+ CXCL10+ RA cluster. Distinct subsets of RA patients may exhibit fibroblast/PGE2 versus T cell/IFN-γ-dominant phenotypes and thus be differentially responsive to therapeutics.</p><p>In RA, macrophages are major producers of TNF, which is a well-established therapeutic target. However, only a subset of RA patients show &gt;50% improvement after TNF blockade therapy, and even these patients can become resistant to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perera et al., 2024</xref>). One current explanation for resistance to TNF blockade therapy is that in subsets of RA patients synovitis is driven by distinct pathogenic mechanisms; additionally, these different mechanisms can emerge when TNF activity is blocked, which can explain acquired resistance to TNF blockade. Such distinct mechanisms of RA pathogenesis include those driven by IL-6 and IL-1 instead of TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gravallese and Firestein, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McInnes and Schett, 2011</xref>). While IL-6 blockade therapy is highly effective in a subset of RA patients, IL-1 blockade with anakinra, although an FDA-approved therapy for RA that is effective at suppressing tissue degradation, appears to have limited efficacy in suppressing inflammatory symptoms. One explanation for potential low efficacy in suppressing symptoms of inflammation such as joint swelling is that IL-1 pathways are not primarily coupled with symptoms of inflammation, but instead with tissue degradation via their effects on synovial fibroblasts. Alternatively, our work raises the intriguing possibility that interrupting the IL-1-PGE2 axis using IL-1 blockade will release genes such as <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> from suppression and result in the emergence of stronger TNF- and lymphocyte-driven pathogenic pathways that maintain synovitis. If substantiated, this notion would promote the idea of combination therapy of using anakinra with either TNF blockade or T cell-targeted therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary human monocyte isolation and culture</title><p>Deidentified buffy coats were purchased from the New York Blood Center following a protocol (# 2016-958) approved by the Hospital for Special Surgery Institutional Review Board.

The authors studied this combined state using an in vitro model with macrophages derived from monocytes of healthy donors. They complemented this with single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic data from patients with ICI-RA, specifically, macrophages sorted out of synovial fluid and tissue samples. The study addressed critical questions regarding the regulation of PGE2 and TNF: Are their actions co-regulated or antagonistic? How do they interact with IFN-γ in shaping macrophage responses?</p><p>This study is the first to specifically investigate a macrophage subset responsive to the PGE2 and TNF combination in the context of ICI-RA, describes a new and easily reproducible in vitro model, and studies the role of IFNgamma regulation of this particular Mф subset.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Methodological quality: The authors employed a robust combination of approaches, including validation of bulk RNA-seq findings through complementary methods. The methods description is excellent and allows for reproducible research. Importantly, the authors compared their in vitro model with ex vivo single-cell data, demonstrating that their model accurately reflects the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenicity of this macrophage subset.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The revisions made to this manuscript followed the suggestions and improved the manuscript. The authors have thoroughly addressed my previous concerns, making several key improvements:</p><p>The expanded comparison between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced RA (ICI-RA) in both cellular and molecular pathology is excellent. These additions to the literature review and discussion sections significantly strengthen the manuscript and provide valuable context.</p><p>I particularly appreciate the added effort in mapping a particular cell subset onto previously published single-cell RNA-Seq embeddings. The enhanced UMAPs with cell subset projection analyses are methodologically compelling, informative and visually are easy to understand for any reader. The new Figure 3 represents a substantial improvement.</p><p>More detailed comparisons with previously published single-cell datasets from 2019, 2020, and 2023 effectively contextualize this research within the broader field of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. This enhances the manuscript's value for specialists in autoimmunity and myeloid immunology.</p><p>I find the authors' suggestion to use the defined myeloid pathogenic phenotypes as biomarkers for therapy response prediction or dose optimization particularly insightful and clinically relevant.</p><p>Overall, the authors have significantly improved both the analysis and presentation of results. The manuscript has been substantially enhanced.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104367.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary/Significance of the findings:</p><p>The authors have done a great job by extensively carrying out transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses in the primary human/mouse monocytes/macrophages to investigate TNF-PGE2 (TP) crosstalk and their regulation by IFN-γ in the Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial macrophages. They proposed that TP induces inflammatory genes via a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant to RA and ICI-arthritis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have done a great job on RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in primary human monocytes stimulated with TNF and showing the selective agonists of PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 22 that signal predominantly via cAMP. They have beautifully shown IFN-γ opposes the effects of PGE2 on TNF-induced gene expression. They found that TP signature genes are activated by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A with TNF-induced NF-κB activity. On the other hand, they found that IFN-γ suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A activity to ablate induction of IL-1, Notch, and neutrophil chemokine genes but promoted expression of distinct inflammatory genes such as TNF and T cell chemokines like CXCL10 indicating that TP induces inflammatory genes via IFN-γ in the RA and ICI-arthritis.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have answered my questions and i recommend this manuscript for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104367.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sokhi</surname><given-names>Upneet K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Ruoxi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Bikash</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chinenov</surname><given-names>Yurii</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Singaraju</surname><given-names>Anvita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Karmela K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bass</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Donlin</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ivashkiv</surname><given-names>Lionel B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital for Special Surgery</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article investigates the phenotype of macrophages with a pathogenic role in arthritis, particularly focusing on arthritis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.</p><p>Building on prior data from monocyte-macrophage coculture with fibroblasts, the authors hypothesized a unique role for the combined actions of prostaglandin PGE2 and TNF. The authors studied this combined state using an in vitro model with macrophages derived from monocytes of healthy donors. They complemented this with single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic data from patients with ICI-RA, specifically, macrophages sorted out of synovial fluid and tissue samples. The study addressed critical questions regarding the regulation of PGE2 and TNF: Are their actions co-regulated or antagonistic? How do they interact with IFN-γ in shaping macrophage responses?</p><p>This study is the first to specifically investigate a macrophage subset responsive to the PGE2 and TNF combination in the context of ICI-RA, describes a new and easily reproducible in vitro model, and studies the role of IFNgamma regulation of this particular Mф subset.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Methodological quality: The authors employed a robust combination of approaches, including validation of bulk RNA-seq findings through complementary methods. The methods description is excellent and allows for reproducible research. Importantly, the authors compared their in vitro model with ex vivo single-cell data, demonstrating that their model accurately reflects the molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenicity of this macrophage subset.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Introduction: The introduction lacks a paragraph providing an overview of ICI-induced arthritis pathogenesis and a comparison with other types of arthritis. Including this would help contextualize the study for a broader audience.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have added a paragraph on ICI-arthritis to intro (pg. 4, middle paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results Section: At the beginning of the results section, the experimental setup should be described in greater detail to make an easier transition into the results for the reader, rather than relying just on references to Figure 1 captions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the experimental setup (pg. 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is insufficient comparison between single-cell RNA-seq data from ICI-induced arthritis and previously published single-cell RA datasets. Such a comparison may include DEGs and GSEA, pathway analysis comparison for similar subsets of cells. Ideally, an integration with previous datasets with RA-tissue-derived primary monocytes would allow for a direct comparison of subsets and their transcriptomic features.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion, which has increased the impact of our data and analysis. A computationally rigorous representation mapping approach showed that ICI-arthritis myeloid subsets predominantly mapped onto 4 previously defined RA subsets including IL-1β+ cells. This result was corroborated using a complementary data integration approach. Analysis of (TNF + PGE)-induced gene sets (TP signatures) in ICI-arthritis myeloid cells projected onto the RA subsets using the AUCell package showed elevated TP gene expression in similar ICI-arthritis and RA monocytic cell subsets. We also found mutually exclusive expression of TP and IFN signatures in distinct RA and ICI-arthritis myeloid cell subsets, which supports that the opposing cross-regulation between IFN-γ and PGE2 pathways that we identified in vitro also functions similarly in vivo. This analysis is shown in the new Fig. 3, described on pg. 7, and discussed on pp. 13-14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While it's understandable that arthritis samples are limited in numbers and myeloid cell numbers, it would still be interesting to see the results of PGE2+TNF in vitro stimulation on the primary RA or ICI-RA macrophages. It would be valuable to see RNA-Seq signatures of patient cell reactivation in comparison to primary stimulation of healthy donor-derived monocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be interesting but given limited samples and distribution of samples amongst many studies and investigators this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: Prior single-cell studies of RA and RA macrophage subpopulations from 2019, 2020, 2023 publications deserve more discussion. A thorough comparison with these datasets would place the study in a broader scientific context.</p><p>Creating an integrated RA myeloid cell atlas that combines ICI-RA data into the RA landscape would be ideal to add value to the field.</p><p>As one of the next research goals, TNF blockade data in RA and ICI-RA patients would be interesting to add to such an integrated atlas. Combining responders and non-responders to TNF blockade would help to understand patient stratification with the myeloid pathogenic phenotypes. It would be great to read the authors' opinion on this in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 3 above. This point is addressed in Fig. 3, pg. 7, and pp. 13-14, which includes a discussion of responders and nonresponders and patient stratification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusion: The authors demonstrated that while PGE2 maintains the inflammatory profile of macrophages, it also induces a distinct phenotype in simultaneous PGE2 and TNF treatment. The study of this specific subset in single-cell data from ICI-RA patients sheds light on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this condition, however, how it compares with conventional RA is not clear from the manuscript.</p><p>Given the substantial incidence of ICI-induced autoimmune arthritis, understanding the unique macrophage subsets involved for future targeting them therapeutically is an important challenge. The findings are significant for immunologists, cancer researchers, and specialists in autoimmune diseases, making the study relevant to a broad scientific audience.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary/Significance of the findings:</p><p>The authors have done a great job by extensively carrying out transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses in the primary human/mouse monocytes/macrophages to investigate TNF-PGE2 (TP) crosstalk and their regulation by IFN-γ in the Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial macrophages. They proposed that TP induces inflammatory genes via a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant to RA and ICI-arthritis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have done a great job on RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in primary human monocytes stimulated with TNF and showing the selective agonists of PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 22 that signal predominantly via cAMP. They have beautifully shown IFN-γ opposes the effects of PGE2 on TNF-induced gene expression. They found that TP signature genes are activated by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A with TNF-induced NF-κB activity. On the other hand, they found that IFN-γ suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP, and NR4A activity to ablate induction of IL-1, Notch, and neutrophil chemokine genes but promoted expression of distinct inflammatory genes such as TNF and T cell chemokines like CXCL10 indicating that TP induces inflammatory genes via IFN-γ in the RA and ICI-arthritis.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors carried out most of the assays in the monocytes/macrophages. How do APCcells like Dendritic cells behave with respect to this TP treatment similar dosing?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting topic especially as TNF + PGE2 is one of the standard methods of maturing in vitro generated human DCs and promoting antigen-presenting function. As DC maturation is quite different from monocyte activation this would represent a new study and is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have instead added a paragraph to the discussion (pg. 12) and cited the literature on DC maturation by TNF + PGE2 including one of our older papers (PMID: 18678606; 2008)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors studied 3h and 24h post-treatment transcriptomic and epigenomic. What happens to TP induce inflammatory genes post-treatment 12h, 36h, 48h, 72h. It is critical to see the upregulated/downregulated genes get normalised or stay the same throughout the innate immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify that subsets of inducible genes showed distinct kinetics of induction with transient expression at 3 hr versus sustained expression over the 24 hr stimulation period as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 (pg. 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors showed IL1-axis in response to the TP-treatment. Do other cytokine axes get modulated? If yes, then how do they cooperate to reduce/induce inflammatory responses along this proposed axis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, which we approached using a combination of pathway analysis and targeted inspection of pathways important pathogenesis of RA, which is the inflammatory condition most relevant for this study. In addition to genes in the IL-1-NF-κB core inflammatory pathway, pathway analysis of genes induced by TP co-stimulation showed enrichment of genes related to leukocyte chemotaxis, in particular neutrophil migration. Accordingly, TP costimulation increased expression of CSF3, which plays a key role in mobilizing neutrophils from the bone marrow, and major neutrophil chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5 that recruit neutrophils to sites of inflammation including in inflammatory arthritis. Analysis of the late response to TNF similarly showed enrichment of genes important in chemotaxis, and suppression of genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, which we and others have previously linked to IFN responses. Targeted inspection of genes in additional pathways implicated in RA pathogenesis showed increased expression of genes in the Notch pathway. We believe that these pathways work together with the IL-1 pathway to increase immune cell recruitment and activation in inflammatory responses; these results are described on pp. 5-6 and are incorporated into Figures 1, 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2.</p><p>Overall, the data looks good and acceptable but I need to confirm the above-mentioned criticisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The discussion section of the manuscript claims: &quot;In this study, we utilized transcriptomics to demonstrate a 'TNF + PGE2' (TP) signature in RA and ICI-arthritis IL-1β+ synovial macrophages.&quot; This statement is misleading, as no new transcriptomic data from RA synovial samples were generated in this study. To support such a claim, the authors would need to compare primary monocytes or macrophages from RA patients using bulk RNA-seq or singlecell RNA-seq. Based on the current data, the comparison is limited to bulk RNA-seq findings from the authors' in vitro model and prior monocyte-fibroblast coculture studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the abstract and discussion (pg. 10) to reflect that we have compared an in vitro generated TP signature with gene expression in previously identified RA macrophage subsets.</p></body></sub-article></article>
