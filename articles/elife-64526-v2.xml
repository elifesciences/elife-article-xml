To investigate this question, we established an in vivo imaging model that also allows chronic and acute neuromodulation with genetic and optogenetic tools. Using the GCaMP6s biosensor together with endocrine cell fluorescent reporters, we imaged calcium dynamics simultaneously in multiple pancreatic islet cell types in live animals in control states and upon changes in innervation. We find that by 4 days post fertilization in zebrafish, a stage when islet architecture is reminiscent of that in adult rodents, prominent activity coupling between beta cells is present in basal glucose conditions. Furthermore, we show that both chronic and acute loss of nerve activity result in diminished beta–beta and alpha–beta activity coupling. Pancreatic nerves are in contact with all islet cell types, but predominantly with beta and delta cells. Surprisingly, a subset of delta cells with detectable peri-islet neural activity coupling had significantly higher homotypic coupling with other delta cells suggesting that some delta cells receive innervation that coordinates their output. Overall, these data show that innervation plays a vital role in the maintenance of homotypic and heterotypic cellular connectivity in pancreatic islets, a process critical for islet function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic islet</kwd><kwd>innervation</kwd><kwd>homotypic coupling</kwd><kwd>heterotypic coupling</kwd><kwd>in vivo calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yu Hsuan Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000159/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yu Hsuan Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 773-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yu Hsuan Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIG-JOINT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yu Hsuan Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AMED</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawakami</surname><given-names>Koichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briant</surname><given-names>Linford JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UKRI Expanding Excellence in England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yu Hsuan Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intercellular communication is critical for organ function, and the role of innervation in mediating this communication is of relevance to many fields, including developmental biology, neuroendocrinology, and disease pathophysiology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tight regulation of hormone release from pancreatic islets is critical for glucose homeostasis and its disruption can lead to diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Noguchi and Huising, 2019</xref>). Pancreatic islets are composed of different cell types, including the hormone producing alpha, beta, and delta cells, peripheral nerves, and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Studies have implicated signaling from the vascular scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almaça et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mullapudi et al., 2019</xref>) and nerve networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taborsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makhmutova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tarussio et al., 2014</xref>) during the development and function of pancreatic islet cells. However, it remains difficult to investigate the immediate effects of acute nerve modulation on islet cell function. Given the alterations in islet innervation architecture in some models of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mundinger and Taborsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mundinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tang et al., 2018</xref>), it is imperative to understand whether disruption of nervous control can contribute to diabetes etiology.</p><p>Different methods of assessing islet cell function have provided important clues into the role of autocrine and paracrine signaling in this process. Electrophysiological recordings have provided fundamental insights into isolated islet cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vergari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camunas-Soler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hastoy et al., 2018</xref>), including functional connectivity studies that identified homotypic as well as heterotypic coupling between endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moreno et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briant et al., 2018</xref>). However, assessing islet function in live animals with undisrupted vascular and nerve networks remains challenging. Calcium dynamics is a good readout of the function of all islet cell types because its influx is critical for hormone release. However, no studies to date have been able to record simultaneously the activity of all islet endocrine cell types in the intact organ of a living animal, which is required to understand how the different endocrine cell types respond to physiological perturbations individually and interdependently. To this end, we established an in vivo imaging platform to visualize the activity of all the islet cell types by combining calcium imaging with cell type reporters. We investigated the functional connectivity between homotypic and heterotypic cell pairs by analyzing the correlation patterns in their intracellular calcium changes. Chronic and acute inhibition of nerve activity captured its dynamic control of the functional connectivity between islet endocrine cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The activity of all pancreatic endocrine cell types can be studied simultaneously in vivo</title><p>The zebrafish primary islet becomes highly innervated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) and vascularized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mullapudi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Toselli et al., 2019</xref>) early in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Significant changes in the intercepts suggest impairments in delta–beta and alpha–beta heterotypic coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Nearest neighbors have a greater likelihood of displaying coupling, as seen in our <italic>R</italic><sub>avg</sub> over increasing distance analysis. We analyzed single-cell calcium traces and determined the fraction of time a given nearest cell pair resides in a state when (1) both cells are active, (2) both cells are silent, and (3) one cell is silent, the other active. This analysis of activity patterns between nearest heterotypic cell pairs further supported the observed heterotypic coupling defects upon chronic neural inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). Aside from the quiet phase, when both cell types are silent, we found changes in activity patterns between alpha–beta, delta–beta, and alpha–delta cell pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>): upon chronic neural inhibition, the delta-silent/beta-active state was decreased while the delta-active/beta-silent state and the delta-active/alpha-silent state were both increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).

We also found a significant decrease in the alpha-active/beta-active state upon chronic neural inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting that neural signaling is an important regulator of alpha–beta connectivity.</p><p>Given the potential role of pancreatic innervation on islet cell maturation, we next investigated the effects of acutely blocking neural activity using two different approaches. By lineage tracing, we found that the neural crest-derived peri-islet neurons were also labeled by the <italic>Et(1121A:GAL4FF)</italic> enhancer trap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), thereby allowing us to investigate the effects of photo-ablating a subset of peri-islet neurons on islet cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The photo-ablation of peri-islet neurons reduced islet nerve density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). While the oscillatory pattern of calcium dynamics was maintained in beta cells upon this ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the coupling between beta cells was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Notably, we did not observe further impairment in beta cell coupling over increasing distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that upon ablation of peri-islet neurons, the signal that initiates beta cell coupling was blunted while beta cells maintained their propensity for coupling across the islet. Whether this beta cell coupling is due to gap junctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>) and/or soluble factors warrants further studies. Delta–beta coupling was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Unlike in the chronic neural inhibition scenario, in the fraction time analysis, delta–beta and alpha–delta coupling was not affected upon ablating peri-islet neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>). However, we observed a decrease in alpha–beta coupling and in the alpha-active/beta-active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). The observed coupling defects are unlikely due to changes in individual calcium spike characteristics, as no significant differences were observed in calcium oscillation frequency, peak height, or peak duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, the ablation of peri-islet neurons significantly disrupted beta–beta and alpha–beta connectivity, while conclusions regarding other heterotypic interactions will require further investigation into the various neural subsets that were targeted.

We report a noninvasive in vivo imaging strategy to study all the different pancreatic endocrine cell types within the same animal. Our three approaches to inhibit neural control, ranging in temporal and spatial specificity, provided useful insights into the role of neurons in regulating pancreatic islet function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Whether activity coupling between beta cells is in part mediated by gap junctions warrants further studies, but our data suggest that neural regulation is critical for the establishment and maintenance of beta cell connectivity as we consistently found decreased beta cell coupling upon chronic and acute neural inhibition. Given that our targeted neural ablation approach also led to this decline in beta cell coupling, it is likely that autonomic neural control is required for beta cell connectivity independently of possible indirect effects resulting from neural regulation of other organs. Whether this neural regulation is directly on beta cells or a bystander effect resulting from the regulation of other cell types, including delta and endothelial cells, requires further studies. It has been proposed that glucose sensing neurons regulate early postnatal beta cell proliferation and maintenance of beta cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tarussio et al., 2014</xref>), and our data support the peri-islet localization of such neurons.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract summarizing the research findings.</title><p>Neuromodulation, with varying temporal and spatial specificity, provides useful insights into the role of neurons in regulating homotypic and heterotypic activity coupling between pancreatic islet cells.

Correlation analysis allowed us to study heterotypic coupling and fraction time analysis further allowed us to study activity patterns of heterotypic cell pairs that are near each other, upon loss of neural signaling. We found changes in delta–beta activity coupling, supporting a role for gap junctions in mediating electrical coupling between delta and beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briant et al., 2018</xref>). Both chronic and acute neural inhibition also blunted the functional connectivity between alpha and beta cells suggesting that neurons may have an important role in the paracrine potentiation of beta cell activity by glucagon released from alpha cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Svendsen et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that alpha–beta interactions are specifically regulated by pancreatic innervation since peri-islet neural ablation led to a similar decrease in alpha–beta coupling and the alpha-active/beta-active state. However, given that pan-neural inhibition is required to induce changes in nearest delta–beta interactions, it is possible that central nervous control of other organs could in part be driving these changes. Importantly, our data further support a role for neurons in modulating delta cell activity, since delta cells that display neural activity connection exhibit a significant increase in their coupling to other delta cells. Future studies will determine whether the observed changes in delta cell activity directly reflect alterations in somatostatin release.</p><p>Selective targeting of subsets of neurons will advance our understanding of the pancreatic islet-neural interplay in health and disease, including diabetes pathophysiology. Through our in vivo studies of homotypic and heterotypic activity coupling, we have illustrated how studying functional connectivity can be achieved for the endocrine pancreas and discovered a critical role for neurons in mediating these connections. Given the cellular heterogeneity of organ composition, simultaneously evaluating the function of the different cell types that make up an organ provides insights that can be missed by simply investigating one cell type at a time. Interrogating the neural regulation of other organs, such as the liver, intestine, and kidney, can be achieved through the extended application of these tools. In combination with the ability to monitor organ development, function, and regeneration in vivo, this approach will allow one to address complex questions pertaining to the autonomic nervous system and its role in organ maintenance and dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Zebrafish transgenic lines and husbandry</title><p>All zebrafish husbandry was performed under standard conditions in accordance with institutional (MPG) and national ethical and animal welfare guidelines (Proposal numbers: B2/1041, B2/Anz. 1007, B2/1218).

Only larvae that displayed complete endoderm transplant, without obvious defects, and carried the relevant transgenes were used for downstream imaging experiments. Control chimeras were negative for BoTxBLC-GFP expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>In vivo confocal microscopy</title><p>Live zebrafish between 100 and 110 hpf were anesthetized with 0.015% Tricaine and mounted in 0.8% low melting agarose in egg water containing 0.005% Tricaine for confocal imaging. A Zeiss LSM880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×20/NA1.0 dipping lens was used for imaging. Time-lapse calcium imaging was conducted in 25°C conditions and z-stacks were taken at 5-s intervals for 1–2 hr. Larvae were exposed to 75 mM glucose containing egg water at the indicated time points during the time-lapse imaging to increase whole larvae glucose levels within a physiological range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the photo-inhibition experiments, the GCaMP6s signal was visualized with a Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire Laser (Coherent) laser at 920 nm. For all other experiments, the GCaMP6s signal was visualized with an Argon laser at 488 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Two-photon laser ablation</title><p>A Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire Laser (Coherent) mounted on a Zeiss LSM880 microscope was used for two-photon single-cell laser ablation of peri-islet neurons labeled by the <italic>Et(1121A:GAL4FF)</italic> enhancer trap. The tunable laser was set at 800 nm to scan an ablation area of 4 µm<sup>2</sup> at a scan speed of 1 with 10 iterations. Following ablation, embryos were rested for 5 min before continuation of calcium imaging. Controls were mock ablation of cells within 20 µm from the peri-islet neurons. Animals from the same clutch were randomly assigned to ablation and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Photo-inhibition of nerve activity</title><p>All experiments with <italic>Tg(elavl3:sypb-miniSOG2-P2A-mScarlet)</italic> animals were done on F1 to F3 larvae displaying strong and uniform mScarlet signal. Controls were transgene-negative siblings. To assess swimming behavior, 110 hpf larvae were individually isolated in 9-mm diameter circular wells filled with 200 µl egg water. A Nikon SMZ25 stereomicroscope with a P2-SHR PlanApo ×1/NA0.15 objective was used for time-lapse imaging of larvae at 1-s intervals; the same animals were imaged prelight and postexposure to a 5-min pulse of blue light (3.8 mW LED, 466/40 filter, Lumencor Sola Light Engine). To assess changes in glucose levels, pools of 40 larvae swimming in 9 cm diameter Petri dishes filled with 35 ml egg water were exposed to 0.3 mW blue LED light for 30 min prior to sample collection; control animals were not exposed to blue light and were randomly selected siblings from the same clutch. Notably, acute blue light exposure alone mildly reduced swimming behavior and increased glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Induction of a stress response likely led to this increase in glucose levels in wild-type larvae, as chronic 14 hr exposure to blue LED light for 3 consecutive days kills zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ustundag et al., 2019</xref>). To assess calcium changes, larvae were exposed to a 3-min pulse of blue light (2.1 mW 470 nm LED, Colibri) and the GCaMP6s signal was measured pre- and post-blue light exposure. While blinding was not possible, we randomized the order in which animals on a given day were imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Wholemount immunostaining</title><p>Zebrafish were euthanized with Tricaine overdose prior to overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 120 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4% sucrose, pH 7.4. The skin was manually removed with forceps, without disturbing the internal organs and the zebrafish were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) containing PBS for 3 hr at room temperature. Following blocking with 5% donkey serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) in blocking buffer (Dako), samples were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed 4× with 0.025% Triton X-100 containing PBS, incubated in secondary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed 4×, incubated in an increasing glycerol gradient of 25%, 50%, and 75%, and mounted in VectorShield mounting medium. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: mouse anti-glucagon (1:200, Sigma G2654), chicken anti-GFP (1:200, Aves GFP-1020), mouse anti-acetylated Tubulin (1:200, Sigma T7451), and guinea pig anti-insulin (1:300, DAKO A0564). Secondary antibodies used in this study include donkey anti-guinea pig AlexaFluor647 (1:200, Jackson 706-605-148), donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor488 (1:300, Jackson 715-545-150) and AlexaFluor647 (1:200, Jackson 715-605-150), and donkey anti-chicken AlexaFluor488 (1:300, Jackson 703-545-155).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sarah M Knox (Reviewer #3); Dirk Meyer (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The role of islet innervation on endocrine cell activity is currently not well defined. Previously, Yang et al. provided a detailed description of embryonic islet innervation dynamics in zebrafish and they established that innervation and/or neural activity is required for proper glucose homeostasis and δ-cell formation. In their new manuscript, they introduced a novel transgenic model for whole islet in vivo calcium imaging. By applying this tool in a series of innovative and technically challenging approaches, the authors employ 3 distinct methods to modulate neuronal activity using a range of reporter lines, mutant lines and intravital imaging to examine these islet cell interactions. In addition they demonstrate that larval β-cells express the gap-junction protein Cx43 and that β-cell coupling is disturbed in cx43 mutants. On the whole these methods are robustly applied, in addition to the analytical methods used to interpret 'connectivity' from the ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Overall, this is an important study that adds to our currently weak understanding for the role of neuronal interactions with the islet.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are supportive of publication and study provides important novel insights into our understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating coordinated pancreatic endocrine cell responses. However, they indicate the need for a number of important clarifications (particularly related to interpreting the connectivity analysis) and places where data presentation is not always clear. In addition, all 3 reviewers indicated that throughout the manuscript the authors' made overly speculative statements and there is some concern that the study does not provide evidence of direct influence of neuronal activity. Finally, some of the experiments require additional and/or alternative statistical analyses. While most of these revisions will not require additional experimentation, a small number of experiments are suggested that would help support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. An important caveat in this study is that connectivity is used to refer to cells showing similar ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, whether calculated via correlation coefficients or fraction of time two neighboring cells are 'active'/'inactive'. This does not per se indicate if the two cells truly are directly interacting, or whether they are instead each interacting with some other factor. For instance, an increased correlation coefficient between β cells upon innervation could be due to enhanced gap junction coupling or paracrine communication between β cells or it could be due to neuronal activity driving the activity of the β cells. Some literature (e.g. Zhang et al., Biophys.J. 2008) would suggest the latter, not the former, and thus conflicts with the authors conclusions.</p><p>2. Related to this above point, in figures 2-4 the authors use one type of analysis for assessing homotypic interactions between β cells, but a separate analysis for assessing heterotypic interactions. Why do the authors not use a correlation based analysis between cell neighbors for heterotypic interactions? Would they observe changes if such correlation analysis is employed? (I see why they cannot use it across all cells).</p><p>Also, if the 'connectivity' between two cell types changes (e.g. β-δ), then the apparent connectivity with the other cell type (α) would very likely change irrespective of whether any actual connection is present. For instance, it seems to me that changes in β cell correlation would change the apparent β-δ and β-α connectivity, irrespective of the actual link between these cell types. Δ-α 'connectivity' doesn't change under any of the experimental conditions which would support this alternative conclusion. How do the authors exclude this alternative conclusion?</p><p>Finally, are α, β and δ cell activity patterns themselves altered under each neuronal modulation and Cx43 deletion? E.g. the duration and amplitude of ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. If so could these explain differences in apparent 'connectivity'?</p><p>3. There are many overly speculative statements that need either toning down or including data that better supports the conclusion: e.g.</p><p>– Abstract: &quot;δ cells receive innervation which coordinates its (the islet) output.&quot; Such an interpretation would rely on modulating neuronal-δ cell interactions specifically.</p><p>– Lines 123-124: hyper-activation of δ cells is a strong statement. Instead, it seems that δ cells are activated more than their neighboring β and α cells. But the change in δ cell activity is not especially strong. Is δ cell activity itself (% time elevated or spike height) different?</p><p>– Line 124: similarly, the authors did not measure somatostatin release so cannot say this is directly the result of δ cell activity.</p><p>– Line 192-194: the authors should combine their Cx43 with neural modulation to test if pancreatic innervation is indeed mediating the remaining intra-islet coordination.</p><p>4. In performing neuronal modulation, pan-neural chronic botox treatment (Figure 2) significantly disrupted both homotypic and heterotypic interactions; acute photo-ablation of peri-islet neurons (Figure 3) only disrupted homotypic interactions (although note my comment 1); and pan-neural acute inhibition of neurotransmitter release (Figure 4) significantly disrupted both homotypic and heterotypic interactions. How can the authors exclude the pan-neural disruptions affecting islet function independent of pancreas innervation, e.g. innervation affecting another organ and changing some circulating factor? Especially given both pan neural methods generate different findings than the peri-islet disruption.</p><p>5. Line 140-141: you cannot say there is a trend towards a decrease in α-active β active state based on a p of 0.06 within a set of data that contains 12 related comparisons. This leads me to ask if the authors have corrected for multiple comparisons in their statistical analysis? (for 2J-L, for 3I-K, for4G-I). Throughout, the authors should state in the figure captions what statistical analysis was performed for which comparison indicated.</p><p>6. Figure 2 G: the change in Ravg (correlation) is marginally significant. The results refer to these changes as 'significantly disrupted', 'severe disruption', drastically altered' which needs toning down, with 'marginal' being a more apt term. Furthermore, in F the 'representative' correlation matrices are not congruent with the data in G. At the very least in G the data points corresponding to the example in F should be indicated, and better would be to include more representative matrices.</p><p>7. In figures 2-4 I do not follow the Ravg vs distance measurement. This is interpreted to be indicating β cell wave propagation. I do not see how the decline in relative correlation with distance would refer to wave propagation? This is really a decorrelation which is entirely expected for a system that is not perfectly coupled. Other phenomena than wave propagation could explain such decorrelation. I suggest the authors either analyze the time-index of Ca across the islet to specifically show wave propagation, or refer to this data appropriately.</p><p>8. While the islet cell type specific reporters coupled with calcium imaging represents a novel and exciting new technology for understanding zebrafish endocrine functionality, the authors utilize it along with three methods to address the same question; namely, do nerves regulate islet cell functional connectivity. Of the three, one method (photo-ablation; Figure 3), shows contradictory/weak results when compared to the other two and is thus not warranted as a main figure and could be moved to supplement.</p><p>9. In figure 3 (photo ablation of peri-islet nerves) the authors show no evidence that photo ablation does indeed lead to non-functional/disrupted nerve architecture. To address this, the authors could fix and stain for nerves directly after photo ablation to see if neuronal axons are still present.</p><p>10. While the findings of cx43 KO leading to impaired β cell functionality are novel, they have no direct tie to the previous 4 figures of the paper. The relationship to the nerves is supported by solid data, indeed, there is very, very little data to indicate nerve input plays a role here.</p><p>11. The authors state that δ cell activity is increased in the chronic and acute models of neuronal inhibition (BoTx and optogenetics), suggestion that nerves play an inhibitory role in δ cell function. This, however, cannot be proven directly by the current experiments performed by the authors. Furthermore, the current experiments cannot definitively say that the nerves play a direct role in regulating neuronal activity vs. bystander effect of modulating other surrounding cell types (i.e. vasoconstriction of vascularization within the islet).</p><p>12. The authors cannot attribute which branch of the peripheral nervous system (parasympathetic vs. sympathetic) are leading to functional disruptions upon inhibition. While botox is predominantly thought of as an inhibitor of cholinergic neurons, there is evidence that administration affects pre-ganglionic ganglia that activate sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition of pancreatic nerves will potentially inhibit both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Thus, determining which peripheral nerve subtype is important for functional signaling in pancreatic islet cell would be novel and beneficial to the field.</p><p>13. Does the BoTx affect the health of the zebrafish, which might affect the function of the pancreatic islet cells? This needs to be addressed.</p><p>14. While the authors also shed new light on the previously unclear role of gap-junctions in the zebrafish islet and β-cell coupling, it remains unclear how these results connect to the innervation phenotypes. Rather, it might have been more interesting to use Et(1121A:LAL4FF) driven GCaMP expression in peri-islet neurons to directly correlate neuronal with endocrine activity – in particular with respect to the suggested role of neural input in modulating δ cell function.</p><p>15. 109, Figure 2G: The data show no significant difference between LG – HG, suggesting that there is no glucose-induced response, same for Figure 3F and 4D (such a difference is only seen for the control in 5E ?). In addition: paired sample t-test rather than student's t-test should be used for comparing LG and HG (3F: repeated measures ANOVA?)</p><p>16. 109-111 &quot;[…] indicating drastically altered synchronicity and wave propagation (Figure 2H-I).&quot; – data in H show no difference in slopes between both groups, purpose/meaning of AOC is not explained and relevance appears unclear as there is no significant change.</p><p>17. 123-125: &quot;[…] resulted in the hyperactivation of δ cells, […]&quot; – Figure 2J-L: These conclusions need more detailed statistics, in particular as it is not clear which statistical tests were used – information about sample size, standard deviation and or confidence intervals, degrees of freedom, t-value are missing. (same for corresponding data in Figure 3-5).</p><p>18. 183-184: &quot;From normalized single cell calcium traces, we observed blunted</p><p>glucose-induced coupling of β cell activity glucose-induced coupling&quot; – see above: it seems this is the only data set supporting a glucose response in control animals?</p><p>19. 520: &quot;[…]; p-values from ANOVA.&quot; P-values are from post-hoc test? Holm Sidak's multiple comparisons should be applied instead.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64526.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are supportive of publication and study provides important novel insights into our understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating coordinated pancreatic endocrine cell responses.

How do the authors exclude this alternative conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>While we cannot exclude the alternative conclusion completely, we think that the differential effects observed across the different conditions that all display β cell correlation changes support the presence of connectivity between heterotypic cell pairs. For instance, there is some evidence of δ-α connectivity changes in both chronic and acute pan-neural inhibition condition, but not in the acute, peri-islet ablation setting. In these ablation experiments, only α-β changes were concurrently observed for both the correlation and fraction time analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, are α, β and δ cell activity patterns themselves altered under each neuronal modulation and Cx43 deletion? E.g. the duration and amplitude of ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.

There doesn’t appear to be any significant differences in frequency, duration, or amplitude of calcium transients for β, δ, or α cells across the different conditions and upon ablation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are many overly speculative statements that need either toning down or including data that better supports the conclusion: e.g.</p><p>– Abstract: &quot;δ cells receive innervation which coordinates its (the islet) output.&quot; Such an interpretation would rely on modulating neuronal-δ cell interactions specifically.</p><p>– Lines 123-124: hyper-activation of δ cells is a strong statement. Instead, it seems that δ cells are activated more than their neighboring β and α cells. But the change in δ cell activity is not especially strong. Is δ cell activity itself (% time elevated or spike height) different?</p><p>– Line 124: similarly, the authors did not measure somatostatin release so cannot say this is directly the result of δ cell activity.</p><p>– Line 192-194: the authors should combine their Cx43 with neural modulation to test if pancreatic innervation is indeed mediating the remaining intra-islet coordination.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the language.</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, further analysis of δ cell activity did not show any significant difference in calcium peak frequency, height, or duration (Figure 3 – Figure Suppl. 3).

In performing neuronal modulation, pan-neural chronic botox treatment (Figure 2) significantly disrupted both homotypic and heterotypic interactions; acute photo-ablation of peri-islet neurons (Figure 3) only disrupted homotypic interactions (although note my comment 1); and pan-neural acute inhibition of neurotransmitter release (Figure 4) significantly disrupted both homotypic and heterotypic interactions. How can the authors exclude the pan-neural disruptions affecting islet function independent of pancreas innervation, e.g. innervation affecting another organ and changing some circulating factor? Especially given both pan neural methods generate different findings than the peri-islet disruption.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that the pan-neural disruption affects the pancreas indirectly, and have now added a sentence on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 140-141: you cannot say there is a trend towards a decrease in α-active β active state based on a p of 0.06 within a set of data that contains 12 related comparisons. This leads me to ask if the authors have corrected for multiple comparisons in their statistical analysis? (for 2J-L, for 3I-K, for4G-I). Throughout, the authors should state in the figure captions what statistical analysis was performed for which comparison indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study with the pan-neural ablation was under powered, and we have now increased the number of biological replicates. The change in α-β heterotypic interaction is statistically significant, both with the correlation analysis and fraction time analysis, suggesting that innervation does play a role in α-β interactions.</p><p>Information about the statistical analysis performed is now included in all the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2 G: the change in Ravg (correlation) is marginally significant. The results refer to these changes as 'significantly disrupted', 'severe disruption', drastically altered' which needs toning down, with 'marginal' being a more apt term. Furthermore, in F the 'representative' correlation matrices are not congruent with the data in G. At the very least in G the data points corresponding to the example in F should be indicated, and better would be to include more representative matrices.</p></disp-quote><p>The language has been toned down.</p><p>The correlation matrices in panel F match the calcium traces in panel E. For panel G, we have now indicated the data points corresponding to the examples in panels E &amp; F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In figures 2-4 I do not follow the Ravg vs distance measurement. This is interpreted to be indicating β cell wave propagation. I do not see how the decline in relative correlation with distance would refer to wave propagation? This is really a decorrelation which is entirely expected for a system that is not perfectly coupled. Other phenomena than wave propagation could explain such decorrelation. I suggest the authors either analyze the time-index of Ca across the islet to specifically show wave propagation, or refer to this data appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased our interpretation as recommended and removed all reference to wave propagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. While the islet cell type specific reporters coupled with calcium imaging represents a novel and exciting new technology for understanding zebrafish endocrine functionality, the authors utilize it along with three methods to address the same question; namely, do nerves regulate islet cell functional connectivity. Of the three, one method (photo-ablation; Figure 3), shows contradictory/weak results when compared to the other two and is thus not warranted as a main figure and could be moved to supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>The photo-ablation experiments add a level of specificity to targeting pancreatic innervation. Although, we don’t yet know the exact identity of these neurons, more animals have since been analyzed to increase the power of our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In figure 3 (photo ablation of peri-islet nerves) the authors show no evidence that photo ablation does indeed lead to non-functional/disrupted nerve architecture. To address this, the authors could fix and stain for nerves directly after photo ablation to see if neuronal axons are still present.</p></disp-quote><p>To support the claim of disrupted islet nerve architecture upon photo-ablation of peri-islet neurons (now Figure 4), we have included quantification of islet nerve density following peri-islet neuron ablation in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. While the findings of cx43 KO leading to impaired β cell functionality are novel, they have no direct tie to the previous 4 figures of the paper. The relationship to the nerves is supported by solid data, indeed, there is very, very little data to indicate nerve input plays a role here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have decided to remove the <italic>cx43</italic> data from this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors state that δ cell activity is increased in the chronic and acute models of neuronal inhibition (BoTx and optogenetics), suggestion that nerves play an inhibitory role in δ cell function. This, however, cannot be proven directly by the current experiments performed by the authors. Furthermore, the current experiments cannot definitively say that the nerves play a direct role in regulating neuronal activity vs. bystander effect of modulating other surrounding cell types (i.e. vasoconstriction of vascularization within the islet).</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the language. Additionally, and as suggested by the reviewers, we have now analyzed the activity of peri-islet neurons in parallel with islet cells (new Figure 2) and the data do suggest that a subset of δ cells may be directly modulated by nerve activity. We cannot exclude bystander effects and have included a statement to that effect in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors cannot attribute which branch of the peripheral nervous system (parasympathetic vs. sympathetic) are leading to functional disruptions upon inhibition. While botox is predominantly thought of as an inhibitor of cholinergic neurons, there is evidence that administration affects pre-ganglionic ganglia that activate sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition of pancreatic nerves will potentially inhibit both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Thus, determining which peripheral nerve subtype is important for functional signaling in pancreatic islet cell would be novel and beneficial to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously demonstrated that at the stages when these experiments were carried out, innervation is only from the vagus nerve and have since found that sympathetic innervation does not enter the islet until after 120 hpf. We have now included this point in the results and plan to analyze effects of sympathetic nerves with appropriate transgenic lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Does the BoTx affect the health of the zebrafish, which might affect the function of the pancreatic islet cells? This needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Pan-neural expression of BoTx does have other effects that may influence pancreatic islet function. As we have previously described (PMID: 29916364), these fish may also have defects in the development of δ cells. This point has now been mentioned in the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. While the authors also shed new light on the previously unclear role of gap-junctions in the zebrafish islet and β-cell coupling, it remains unclear how these results connect to the innervation phenotypes. Rather, it might have been more interesting to use Et(1121A:LAL4FF) driven GCaMP expression in peri-islet neurons to directly correlate neuronal with endocrine activity – in particular with respect to the suggested role of neural input in modulating δ cell function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have removed the <italic>cx43</italic> data and added examples of correlation of neural activity with endocrine activity (new Figure 2). Notably, we found that δ cells displaying significant activity coupling to a peri-islet neuron had significantly higher activity coupling to other δ cells within the same islet in comparison to those that were not coupled to the neuron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. 109, Figure 2G: The data show no significant difference between LG – HG, suggesting that there is no glucose-induced response, same for Figure 3F and 4D (such a difference is only seen for the control in 5E ?).

There is a significant difference between LG – HG in the control of the BoTx experiment (Figure 3G). However as noted by the reviewers, this glucose induced response is not observed in Figure 4F and 5D. The photo-inhibition/photo-ablation experiments had to be carried out 5 hours later than the BoTx experiment, due to the inability to photo-ablate the neurons at earlier stages. The ~20% rise in glucose level in the earlier stages (Figure 3- Figure Suppl. 1) had a significant effect on β cell correlation. The increased basal glucose level in the later stages (PMID: 23201900) likely led to less prominent induction of glucose, and thus a lesser effect on β cell correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. 109-111 &quot;[…] indicating drastically altered synchronicity and wave propagation (Figure 2H-I).&quot; – data in H show no difference in slopes between both groups, purpose/meaning of AOC is not explained and relevance appears unclear as there is no significant change.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement has now been removed since, as the reviewers pointed out, our analyses do not allow one to infer any changes in wave propagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. 123-125: &quot;[…] resulted in the hyperactivation of δ cells, […]&quot; – Figure 2J-L: These conclusions need more detailed statistics, in particular as it is not clear which statistical tests were used – information about sample size, standard deviation and or confidence intervals, degrees of freedom, t-value are missing.
