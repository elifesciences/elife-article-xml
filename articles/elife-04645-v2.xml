but mechanisms are poorly understood. It has been proposed that endothelial cells have a preferred level of fluid shear stress, or ‘set point’, that determines remodeling. We show that human umbilical vein endothelial cells respond optimally within a range of fluid shear stress that approximate physiological shear. Lymphatic endothelial cells, which experience much lower flow in vivo, show similar effects but at lower value of shear stress. VEGFR3 levels, a component of a junctional mechanosensory complex, mediate these differences. Experiments in mice and zebrafish demonstrate that changing levels of VEGFR3/Flt4 modulates aortic lumen diameter consistent with flow-dependent remodeling. These data provide direct evidence for a fluid shear stress set point, identify a mechanism for varying the set point, and demonstrate its relevance to vessel remodeling in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04645.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04645.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04645.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood and lymphatic vessels remodel their shape, diameter and connections during development, and throughout life in response to growth, exercise and disease. This process is called vascular remodeling.</p><p>The endothelial cells that line the inside of blood and lymphatic vessels are constantly exposed to the frictional force from flowing blood, termed fluid shear stress. Changes in shear stress are sensed by the endothelial cells, which trigger vascular remodeling to return the stress to the original level. It has been proposed that remodeling is governed by a preferred level of fluid shear stress, or set point, against which deviations in the shear stress are compared. Thus, changing the fluid flow through a blood vessel increases or decreases shear stress, which results in the vessel remodeling to restore the original level of shear stress. Like all remodeling, this process involves inflammation to recruit white blood cells, which assist with the process.</p><p>Baeyens et al. investigated whether such a shear stress set point exists and what its biological basis might be using cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins. These cells remained stable and in a resting state when a particular level of shear stress was applied to them; above or below this shear stress level, the cells produced an inflammatory response like that seen during vascular remodeling. This suggests that these cells do indeed have a set point for shear stress. The same response occurred in human lymphatic endothelial cells, although in these cells the shear stress set point was much lower, correlating with the low flow in lymphatic vessels.</p><p>Baeyens et al. then discovered that the shear stress set point is related to the level of a protein called VEGFR3 in the cells, which was recently found to participate in shear stress sensing. Endothelial cells from lymphatic vessels normally produce much greater quantities of VEGFR3 than those from blood vessels. Reducing the amount of VEGFR3 in lymphatic endothelial cells increased the set point shear stress, while increasing the levels in blood vessel cells decreased the set point. This suggests that the levels of this protein account for the difference in the response of these two cell types. Baeyens et al. then tested this pathway by reducing the levels of VEGFR3 in zebrafish embryos and in adult mice. In both animals, this caused arteries to narrow, showing that VEGFR3 levels also control sensitivity to shear stress—and hence vascular remodeling—inside living creatures.</p><p>Understanding in detail how vascular remodeling is regulated could help improve treatments for a wide range of cardiovascular conditions. To do so, further work will be needed to develop methods to control the sensitivity of endothelial cells to shear stress and to identify other proteins that might specifically control the narrowing or the expansion of vessels in human patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04645.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04645.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>shear stress</kwd><kwd>vascular remodeling</kwd><kwd>arteriogenesis</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007197</institution-id><institution>U.S. Public Health Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HL107205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Martin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14POST19020010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baeyens</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Flow-dependent remodeling of blood vessels is critical for normal physiology and for recovery from arterial blockage in disease; understanding its cellular mechanisms may lead to the development of treatments for patients that are deficient in this process following myocardial infarction or other vascular diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homeostasis, one of the central concepts in physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannon, 1929</xref>), posits that physiological variables have an optimum value or set point such that deviations from that set point activate responses that return those variables toward their original value. For example, changes in central body temperature trigger sweating, altered blood flow to the skin or shivering to restore normal temperature. In the vasculature, arteries remodel under sustained changes in blood flow, with increased or decreased flow triggering outward or inward remodeling, respectively, to adjust lumen diameters accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thoma, 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamiya and Togawa, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamiya et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langille and O'Donnell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langille et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langille, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tronc et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tuttle et al., 2001</xref>).

Outward remodeling of atherosclerotic vessels helps to maintain lumen diameter and blood flow, whereas inward remodeling leads to ischemia associated with angina and peripheral vascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ward et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, flow-dependent remodeling of small blood vessels near sites of myocardial infarction provides collateral circulation that plays a major role in restoring cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heil and Schaper, 2004</xref>), whereas failure to remodel is a major factor in progression to heart failure.</p><p>Flow-dependent remodeling is initiated by inflammatory activation of the endothelium, leading to recruitment of leukocytes that assist with remodeling in several ways including secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silvestre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schaper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silvestre et al., 2013</xref>). Once the remodeling phase is completed, inflammation is resolved and the vascular wall stabilized. NF-κB plays a major role in the initial inflammatory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sweet et al., 2013</xref>), whereas signaling through TGF-β is critical in the anti-inflammatory, stabilization phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walshe et al., 2009</xref>) .</p><p>These considerations led us to investigate the existence of a fluid shear stress set point and its relevance to vascular remodeling. Our results provide strong evidence for a fluid shear stress set point in vascular endothelium. They also show that vascular and lymphatic endothelium have different set points, that this difference is mediated by differences in expression of VEGFR3, and provide evidence that this pathway controls artery remodeling in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Is there a set point for fluid shear stress?</title><p>To test the existence of a shear stress set point, we built a flow chamber that creates a gradient of shear stress along a single culture slide. Following a previous design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Usami et al., 1993</xref>), the width of the chamber progressively decreases to yield a linear gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then measured several biological responses associated with fluid shear stress and vascular remodeling. To assay responses as a function of shear stress, we took successive microscopic images along the chamber. Depending on localization, these responses correlated with calculated values of shear stress. Changing the gasket thickness and flow rate allowed us to control the range of shear stress for each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We first measured endothelial cell alignment in flow, which is a well-studied response associated with vessel stabilization and suppression of inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levesque and Nerem, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baeyens et al., 2014</xref>). Alignment was quantified by measuring the angle between the major axis of the nucleus and the flow direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baeyens et al., 2014</xref>). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to 16 hr of laminar shear stress ranging from 2 to 60 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup>. HUVECs aligned in the direction of the flow, between approximately 10 and 20 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup>, but were misaligned or oriented perpendicularly, against the flow direction, outside this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

NF-κB showed baseline activation in cells without flow, which decreased between approximately 10 and 25 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup>, and dramatically increased at very high shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The suppression of NF-κB translocation in this range is consistent with previous observations that sustained laminar flow is anti-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berk, 2008</xref>). Lastly, we measured the activation of TGFβ/SMAD signaling by assaying nuclear translocation of Smad1. Strikingly, flow induced Smad translocation with a sharp maximum between 10 and 20 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> and repressed translocation at higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results obtained with the gradient chamber were validated by examining 2, 12 and 50 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> using normal parallel flow chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that HUVECs have a biphasic response to shear stress such that anti-inflammatory, stabilization pathways are activated between approximately 10 and 20 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup>, while lower or higher shear stress is pro-inflammatory. This behavior is consistent with a shear stress set point within the range of 10 and 20 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> for these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis of lymphatic endothelial cells</title><p>An essential aspect of the set point hypothesis is that it must differ between different types of vessels. In vivo, average shear stress in lymphatic vessels is much lower than in arteries or veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipowsky et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suo et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore examined the behavior of human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLEC), using modified chamber parameters to obtain values of shear stress from 0.5 to 20 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In these experiments, HUVECs aligned between 8 and 20 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) whereas HDLEC aligned maximally between 4 and 6 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The notion that levels of VEGFR3 (Flt4 in zebrafish) determine the shear stress set point predicts that reducing VEGFR3 expression will induce inward remodeling of the vessels in order to increase shear stress and restore normal signaling. We used a strain in which blood vessels are labeled by expression of <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic> (VEGFR2) and <italic>flt4:Citrine</italic> (VEGFR3) reporters. <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic> was highly visible in the dorsal aorta and the posterior cardinal vein, whereas <italic>flt4:Citrine</italic> was low (though detectable) in the dorsal aorta and higher in the cardinal posterior vein and the developing thoracic duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To assay the effect of FLT4 and VEGFC dosage on vessels diameter, we injected zebrafish embryos at the one cell stage with previously validated VEGFC and FLT4 morpholinos at two different concentrations. These antisense oligos target the respective mRNAs and induce a dose dependent loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villefranc et al., 2013</xref>). At 72 hr post fertilization (hpf), the progressive inhibition of VEGFC did not perturb the remodeling of blood vessel or vessel diameter but as expected inhibited the development of the thoracic duct, the first zebrafish lymphatic vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yaniv et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, white stars). By contrast, progressive inhibition of FLT4 reduced the diameter of the dorsal aorta with loss of thoracic duct evident at a higher dose of FLT4 morpholino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggested that VEGF-C-independent Flt4 activation is required for artery diameter and exclude an indirect effect of lymphatic development on the artery development.

Strikingly, in the absence of flow, neither Flt4 nor VEGF-C morpholinos caused further changes in vessel size.

For more than a century, investigators have observed effects suggesting that the blood flow controls vascular diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thoma, 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langille and O'Donnell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langille et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langille, 1996</xref>), a mechanism that would optimize perfusion by adjusting vascular morphology in response to tissue demand. It has been hypothesized that, as for thermoregulation, there is an optimal value of flow which is maintained through feedback mechanisms to prevent deviation from this value. This is what we term the ‘shear stress set point’ theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodbard, 1975</xref>). The current data show that HUVECs align in the direction of flow, inhibit NF-κB and activate Smads within a narrow range of fluid shear stress magnitudes. This range corresponds to the physiological flow within the umbilical vein estimated at around 8.4 to 12.5 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiserud and Rasmussen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boito et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>); shear stress = 8 × viscosity (velocity/diameter), with viscosity = 0.06–0.09 poisse, velocity = 7.1 cm.s<sup>−1</sup> and diameter = 4.1 mm). These results imply that physiological flow inhibits inflammatory pathways and activates anti-inflammatory/stabilization pathways. By contrast, cells in low or high flow fail to align, activate NF-κB and suppress Smads. We propose that these responses are involved in the vessel remodeling that reestablishes optimal blood flow.</p><p>It is known that inflammation is a critical component of flow-dependent as well as other forms of vessel remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silvestre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schaper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silvestre et al., 2013</xref>). It has been recently demonstrated that inhibiting NF-κB impairs outward remodeling associated with increased shear stress as well as aneurysm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, defective Smad1 signaling in the endothelium is associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telengiectasia (HHT), which is characterized by the development of unstable, arteriovenous malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dupuis-Girod et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, these malformations are preceded by increased vascular lumen diameter, which occurs in a flow dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corti et al., 2011</xref>). These observations, combined with ours, suggest that these two signaling pathways contribute to balanced control of the vessel caliber.</p><p>Fluid shear stress varies among different types of vessels, and to some extent even within the same vessel, suggesting that different cells must have different set points for shear stress, depending on their location. Relevant to our experiments, the shear stress in the human umbilical vein is estimated at around 8.4–12.5 dynes/cm<sup>−2</sup> whereas lymphatic vessels have highly pulsatile flow with peaks values at around 4–8 dynes.cm<sup>−2</sup> and averages that are much lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon et al., 2006</xref>). The shear stress set point model therefore predicts that these cell types will have different set points, which was borne out in our studies. Furthermore, we found that this difference can be largely accounted for by differences in VEGFR3 expression. This receptor, a close homolog of VEGFR2, is also activated in response to flow. Both expression levels in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Witmer et al., 2002</xref>) and our functional experiments in vitro lead to the conclusion that high expression of VEGFR3 increases sensitivity to shear to give a low shear stress set point, while low expression of VEGFR3 is associated with higher set points. However, it is highly likely that other mechanotransducers or mediators influence set point values. While we did not observe any major difference in PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin expression between HDLEC and HUVEC, these two proteins can vary between different vascular beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pusztaszeri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herwig et al., 2008</xref>), which might also affect the set point. We used HUVECs as a model for blood endothelial cells because they are readily available and their response to shear stress is well characterized. However, it has been recently showed that arterial and venous markers greatly diminish in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranguren et al., 2013</xref>), thus, whether they fully represent typical venous cells in vivo should be treated with caution. Comparing fresh primary cells from veins and arteries will be an interesting direction for future work. Mechanotransducers apart from the junctional complex are also likely to be important. There must also be pathways that distinguish high and low shear to initiate outward vs inward remodeling. Future work will be required to explore these pathways in more detail and their relevance to vascular remodeling.</p><p>The notion that vascular remodeling is governed by a shear stress set point, which is itself set by activation of various receptors and signaling pathways, may be relevant to a number of applications. Recovery from atherosclerotic luminal narrowing or myocardial infarction is thought to proceed in part via flow-dependent vessel remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heil and Schaper, 2004</xref>). Vascular graft adaptation also requires activation of signaling pathways activated by high shear stress to promote healing of the graft by preventing intimal proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohler et al., 1991</xref>). Arteriovenous malformations are also thought to have a flow-dependent component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corti et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, further understanding of the molecular sensors and downstream signaling pathways that control flow-dependent remodeling is relevant to a broad range of vascular dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) pooled from three different donors were obtained from the Yale Vascular Biology and Therapeutics program and cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum, 50 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup> of Endothelial Cell growth Supplement (ECGS) prepared from bovine hypothalamus, 100 μg.ml<sup>−1</sup> heparin, 100 U.ml<sup>−1</sup> penicillin and 100 μg.ml<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin.

Masks of the images were made using a combination of an adaptive histogram equalization algorithm with intensity and size thresholding. Cell orientation was calculated by taking the masks of the cell nuclei, fitting to an ellipse, and finding the angle between the flow direction and the major-axis of the ellipse. Nuclear translocation was computed by taking the mask of the nucleus and determining the integrated intensity of the transcription factor stain (Smad1 or p65) in the nucleus and in the whole cell. The ‘translocation factor’ (TF) was calculated by dividing the integrated intensity in the nucleus by the value for the whole cell. If the entire signal is localized to the nucleus, TF = 1, while if the entire signal is cytoplasmic, TF = 0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>siRNA transfection and adenoviral expression</title><p>Depletion of VEGFR3 was achieved by transfecting 10 nM siRNA (L-003138-00 OnTarget Smartpool Human FLT4, ThermoScientific) with Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions.

The ear skin was removed, cleaned of connective tissue and cartilage, and permeabilized for 4 hr in permeabilization buffer (1% BSA, 1% NGS, 0.5% Tween in PBS). The skin was then incubated with antibody against LYVE-1 or VEGFR3, in 50% permeabilization buffer/50% PBS for 2 days at 4°C. After washing, the skin was incubated with secondary antibodies overnight 4°C in the same buffer. The skin was then flat mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and imaged with a Perkin Elmer spinning disk confocal microscope with a 20× objective. The aorta was removed, cleaned of all connective tissue, fixed overnight in 3.7% formaldehyde at 4°C and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin embedding and sectioning were performed by the Yale Pathology department, in the Tissue Microarray facility. Aortas were cut longitudinally, paraffin was removed in xylene baths and sections progressively rehydrated before antigen retrieval for 30 min at 95°C in citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween, pH = 6).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. All the reviewers considered your work to be interesting and important. Although there is a long list of comments for you to address, many can be dealt with in the text and by strengthening the Discussion.</p><p>However, two critical issues are as follows:</p><p>First, the cited unpublished results (Coon et al.) that VEGFR3 is a part of the mechanosensory complex consisting of PECAM–1, VEC and VEGFR2 should be presented in this manuscript. It is impossible to accept the authors' statements without reviewing this evidence.</p><p>Second, there does not seem to be any detectable Flt4 signal in the zebrafish aorta. Previously published results indicate that Flt4 is expressed in the PCV, not aorta, and in segmental arteries, and Vegfc is expressed in the zebrafish aorta (Covassin et al., PNAS, 2006; Siekman and Lawson, Nature, 2007). How could Flt4 MO have any effect on aorta width in this case? High MO concentrations could have off-target effects in aorta development, or on blood flow. In fact, recent results have indicated that few phenotypes based on morpholinos are similar to those based on corresponding gene-edited deletions, casting doubt on experiments that employ morpholinos (see Schulte-Merker and Stainier, 2014, Development, 3103-3104).</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Flow chamber:</p><p>a Please explain what is the actual flow profile. It is unclear if the linear dependence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was obtained experimentally or calculated using laminar flow models.</p><p>b. Are there any downstream effects of the cells exposed to low shear to those exposed to higher shear?</p><p>c. Please clarify how reproducible are data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (all three panels). Could statistical differences be shown?</p><p>2) It is stated that HUVECs aligned between 8 and 20 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A and 3A</xref>), lymphatic endothelial cells aligned between 4 and 6 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and the minimum NF-kB translocation shifted to 4 and 10 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is not obvious from the data shown. It would be helpful to clarify how these ranges were determined, and if they correspond to statistically significant differences relatively to the other regions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> representative pictures of cell alignment (junctional staining or bright field images or at least the one in supplemental figure) should be included for 3 values of flow (under 10, between 10 and 20, above 20 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Again, it would be instructive to know what is the reproducibility of these data (which look like single data sets), and important to determine which differences are significant.</p><p>4) The zebrafish loss-of-function experiments are not temporally controlled and flt4 will have additional roles that are difficult to separate from the alleged mechanosensory role. Therefore the authors should avoid overstating these results in saying that they show that ligand independent activation of flt4 is involved in this process. The authors do not provide any data on flt4 activation at all. So it remains unclear how, mechanistically, VEGFR3 is involved.</p><p>5) The authors should include representative images of cell alignment, p65 and Smad1 under different shear stress conditions. It should be noted in the text that the quantification shown in the figure uses nuclear anisotropy as a proxy for cell alignment. This may well be justifiable but needs to be made clear. The authors assess alignment and NFκB–SMAD translocation at 16 hr for both HUVECs and HDLEC. Could these cells have also a different time-response to shear stress to alignment and NFκB–SMAD activation?</p><p>6) Is MMP9 part of the set-point by affecting “stiffness”, or just a downstream effector involved in remodelling? If not possible to tie down experimentally, this should at least be discussed. Are p65 and Smad1 affected in vivo? This should be tested to better link the parts of the manuscript.</p><p>7) Regarding the quantification program for the translocation factor, how do the authors differentiate between cells with very low level of NFkB everywhere (cytoplasm and nucleus with the same staining intensity) and cells with very high level of NFkB everywhere? Biologically these two situations are different because NFκB increases in the nucleus but the ratio would give the same value. In other words, are total levels affected by shear levels and is this relevant? Can it be excluded? Same comment for Smad1.</p><p>8) The authors mention in the text that more than 90% of cells expressed VEGFR3-GFP. Based on the images provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, we can see approximately half of the cell GFP+ (or it is not a confluent monolayer). The authors should assess the transduction efficiency with a more accurate method.</p><p>9) Please comment on what happens to the thoracic duct in nifedipine treated fish.</p><p>10) The authors nicely show that VEGFR3 is expressed in EC of thoracic Aorta. As the inner part of the curvature of the aorta is exposed to lower shear stress, do the authors see any differential expression of VEGFR3 in this area? Is there any regulation of VEGFR3 expression or phosphorylation by the shear stress level in the in vitro chamber?</p><p>11) The authors observe a strange effect on aorta curvature in EC iDR3 mice. Could it be linked with the increased production of MMPs potentially softening the surrounding matrix. Could the authors comment on this?</p><p>12) How is MMP9 expression modulated in the flow chamber model?</p><p>13) Do the authors have any explanation on how VEGFR3 expression regulates MMP9 expression?</p><p>14) How are p65 and SMAD modified in the aorta of EC iDR3 mice or in the different morpholino fish? Is the alignment of EC modified?</p><p>15) Could it be that VEGFR3 deletion has a short time effect on vessel diameter by modulating the vasomotor tone in addition to the remodelling effect of MMPs production?</p><p>16) The YFP fluorescent reporter seems to be based on a large recombinant genomic clone in an unknown chromosomal location, where it can be influenced by the chromosomal context. Does the YFP expression reflect reliably the expression of VEGFR3 in the adult aorta? What is the half-life of the YFP used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>? The YFP expression appears “patchy” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; does this mean that ECs in the aorta expresses variable amounts of VEGFR3? The authors should obtain convincing data showing that the VEGFR3 protein is indeed expressed at a significant level in the aortic endothelial cells in vivo.</p><p>17) The authors use HUVECs in their in vitro studies. These cells do not correspond to the endothelial cells in the mouse or zebrafish aorta. Although the flow conditions in umbilical vein may be similar to those in an artery, venous endothelial cells express higher levels of VEGFR3 than arterial endothelial cells (for example, see Hogan et al., Development, 2009). Somehow, based on in vitro analysis, the shear stress “setpoints” are handled rather indiscriminately, considering that arteries and veins as well as primary lymph vessels and collecting vessels also have obvious differences in shear stress in vivo. It would be useful and relevant to perform the gradient flow chamber experiments using freshly isolated arterial endothelial cells, or even better, aortic endothelial cells. If the authors are not willing to do this, then at least the limitation of using the cell lines should be discussed.</p><p>18) The completeness of recombination achieved in the mouse aorta using the <italic>Cdh5-Cre</italic> line produced by Wang et al. is not reported. How does the dermal lymphatic data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> connect with the rest of the manuscript? It certainly does not provide surrogate evidence for VEGFR3 deletion, and should be replaced by the assessment of VEGFR3 expression levels in mouse aortas before and after <italic>Cre</italic>-mediated deletion by IHC, WB and qPCR.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Vascular remodeling is governed by a VEGFR3-dependent fluid shear stress set point” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is impossible to accept the authors' statements without reviewing this evidence</italic>.</p><p>The main point that is relevant to the current study is that VEGFR3 contributes to flow signaling similarly to VEGFR2. The mechanism by which it is activated by flow is a separate issue that is better left for the other paper where it is studied in detail. We have therefore added new data demonstrating activation of VEGFR3 by flow in both HUVECs and lymphatic ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and provide the unpublished manuscript for the reviewers’ inspection.</p><p><italic>Second, there does not seem to be any detectable Flt4 signal in the zebrafish aorta. Previously published results indicate that Flt4 is expressed in the PCV, not aorta, and in segmental arteries, and VEGFC is expressed in the zebrafish aorta (Covassin et al., PNAS, 2006; Siekman and Lawson, Nature, 2007). How could Flt4 MO have any effect on aorta width in this case? High MO concentrations could have off-target effects in aorta development, or on blood flow. In fact, recent results have indicated that few phenotypes based on morpholinos are similar to those based on corresponding gene-edited deletions, casting doubt on experiments that employ morpholinos (see Schulte-Merker and Stainier, 2014, Development, 3103-3104)</italic>.</p><p>We have now included a full-size, detailed picture of the Flt4 reporter embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), where we observe a gradient of Flt4 transcription: high expression in the developing thoracic duct, lower in the posterior cardinal vein and lower but still readily detectable in the dorsal aorta. This observation is very much in accordance with our paradigm that expression of VEGFR3 inversely correlates with shear stress magnitude in vasculature. We also would like to stress that these former studies by Nathan Lawson’s laboratory were performed at 24 hpf, during the initial phases of vasculature development, while our observation is done at 72 hpf, when the vasculature is more mature.</p><p>Concerning the potential off-target effect of the morpholinos, the concentration dependent effect on dorsal aorta diameter without affecting the whole vasculature of the embryo or its viability, supports the specificity of the effect. More critically, the kinase dead <italic>expando</italic> mutant for Flt4 (Hogan, Herpers et al., 2009) yielded similar effects on the diameter of the dorsal aorta, though these were not noted by the authors (Kwon, Fukuhara et al., 2013). This effect is not observable with a VEGFC morpholino, in accordance with our own observations. These results, plus the similar observation in mice, strongly support the conclusion that the decrease of the dorsal aorta diameter is related to the decreased levels of Flt4 rather than an off-target effect. All of these issues are now discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Specific points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Flow chamber</italic>:</p><p><italic>a.

Could statistical differences be shown?</italic></p><p>The linear dependence of the flow profile was calculated using flow models from the original manuscript describing this chamber (Usami, Chen et al., 1993). To confirm the results obtained with the gradient chamber, we performed additional experiments with a conventional parallel plate chamber under uniform shear stress of 2, 12 or 50 dynes.cm<sup>-2</sup>. The results of these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) support the results obtained with the gradient chamber, ruling out downstream effect from cells exposed to low shear on the responses measured at higher shear stress. Lastly, the statistical significance of the results obtained with the gradient chamber has been tested with an ANOVA test and the result of the test for each variable is now included in the legends of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) It is stated that HUVECs aligned between 8 and 20 dynes/cm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> <italic>(</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2A and 3A</italic></xref><italic>), lymphatic endothelial cells aligned between 4 and 6 dynes/cm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>, (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref><italic>), and the minimum NF-κB translocation shifted to 4 and 10 dynes/cm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> <italic>(</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>).

Therefore the authors should avoid overstating these results in saying that they show that ligand independent activation of flt4 is involved in this process. The authors do not provide any data on flt4 activation at all. So it remains unclear how, mechanistically, VEGFR3 is involved</italic>.</p><p>We performed an ANOVA test to compare the different situations and the results are now included in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We also included the raw data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should include representative images of cell alignment, p65 and Smad1 under different shear stress conditions. It should be noted in the text that the quantification shown in the figure uses nuclear anisotropy as a proxy for cell alignment. This may well be justifiable but needs to be made clear. The authors assess alignment and NFkB–SMAD translocation at 16h for both HUVECs and HDLEC. Could these cells have also a different time-response to shear stress to alignment and NFkB–SMAD activation?</italic></p><p>We have added representative pictures and have highlighted that cell alignment was quantified by measuring nuclei orientation. We previously validated that nuclear alignment is a suitable metric that is highly correlated with cell alignment and that reference is now cited (Baeyens, Mulligan-Kehoe et al., 2014). Regarding the time dependence of the responses, our opinion is that this may not be relevant to the set point theory: lymphatic cells can align at a magnitude where HUVEC cannot, after 16 hours of flow, indicating clearly that the shear sensing mechanisms are optimized for lower values of shear stress in lymphatic cells.</p><p><italic>6) Is MMP9 part of the set-point by affecting “stiffness”, or just a downstream effector involved in remodelling? If not possible to tie down experimentally, this should at least be discussed. Are p65 and Smad1 affected in vivo? This should be tested to better link the parts of the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We examined MMP9 as a well-known downstream effector in arterial remodeling primarily to assess the time course of remodeling. The key point from the results is that following MMP9 expression after VEGFR3 deletion, it then resolves, indicating that vessels have reached a new steady state, thus, are not undergoing regression or some other continuing process. Its expression is thought to be controlled in part by NFkB but also by other factors whose identification is not important here. We have been unable to reliably quantify p65 and SMAD nuclear translocation in longitudinal sections of the thoracic aorta.</p><p><italic>7) Regarding the quantification program for the translocation factor, how do the authors differentiate between cells with very low level of NFkB everywhere (cytoplasm and nucleus with the same staining intensity) and cells with very high level of NFkB everywhere? Biologically these two situations are different because NFkB increases in the nucleus but the ratio would give the same value. In other words, are total levels affected by shear levels and is this relevant? Can it be excluded? Same comment for Smad1</italic>.</p><p>While this is in principle a valid point, there are in fact no discernable changes in staining intensity but rather in staining localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blotting also shows little change in total p65 expression under flow (Orr, Sanders et al., 2005). This is why we developed the high-throughput quantification method, allowing us to assess this very specific feature of nuclear translocation, which is a well-established feature of NFκB and Smad1 activation.</p><p><italic>8) The authors mention in the text that more than 90% of cells expressed VEGFR3-GFP. Based on the images provided in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, we can see approximately half of the cell GFP+ (or it is not a confluent monolayer).

As the inner part of the curvature of the aorta is exposed to lower shear stress, do the authors see any differential expression of VEGFR3 in this area? Is there any regulation of VEGFR3 expression or phosphorylation by the shear stress level in the in vitro chamber?</italic></p><p>We do observe higher VEGFR3 expression in the inner curvature and some portions of the carotids, and lower expression on the outer curvature of the aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that VEGFR3 expression is higher in areas of low shear stress. However, within each vessel, expression appears nonuniform, suggesting local regulation. We also have in vitro data suggesting that VEGFR3 is slightly reduced under flow mainly due to internalization and degradation. The factors that govern VEGFR3 expression in arterial endothelial cells therefore appear to be complex and represent a distinct question separate from the one we address in this manuscript. We feel this issue is best left for further work.</p><p><italic>11) The authors observe a strange effect on aorta curvature in EC iDR3 mice</italic>. <italic>Could it be linked with the increased production of MMPs potentially softening the surrounding matrix. Could the authors comment on this?</italic></p><p>Yes, it is plausible that asymmetric remodeling of the aorta involving MMP9 resulted in the change in aorta curvature. Such asymmetric remodeling may be the consequence of a non-uniform VEGFR3 expression along the aorta. Or it could be a feature of the complex mechanics of the ascending aorta, which moves axially during each cardiac cycle and would be predicted to differentially load the inner and outer curvature (Kassab, 2006). We thought it appropriate to make a note of the observation but feel that anything we could say would be largely speculative as well as being unrelated to the main point of the paper and to any known remodeling process in vivo.</p><p><italic>12) How is MMP9 expression modulated in the flow chamber model?</italic></p><p>We stained for MMP9 in HUVECs in the gradient chamber but failed to observe any consistent change in intensity. However, MMP9 is a determinant of 3-dimensional tissue remodeling in vivo; ECs on a flat coverslip without a smooth muscle layer cannot undergo any sort of comparable process and may not express or capture secreted MMP9 in the same way. MMP9 analysis in vitro does not appear to be a fruitful line of investigation.</p><p><italic>13) Do the authors have any explanation on how VEGFR3 expression regulates MMP9 expression?</italic></p><p>Our current explanation is that reduction of VEGFR3 expression induces a change in the set point of the endothelial cells, which results in altered flow signaling, which induces remodeling. In essence, VEGFR3 deletion results in ECs sensing that shear levels are too low, which induces inward remodeling to increase shear. MMP9 may be a fairly indirect downstream consequence of these events.</p><p><italic>14) How are p65 and SMAD modified in the aorta of EC iDR3 mice or in the different morpholino fish? Is the alignment of EC modified?</italic></p><p>We tried to measure nuclear translocation in longitudinal sections of the aorta but have been unable to reliably quantify the effects in these sections. Expression levels of Smad1 and p65 seemed unaffected. Also, it is impossible, to our knowledge, to assess properly endothelial cell alignment in zebrafish embryos or in longitudinal sections of the aorta.</p><p><italic>15) Could it be that VEGFR3 deletion has a short time effect on vessel diameter by modulating the vasomotor tone in addition to the remodelling effect of MMPs production?</italic></p><p>Vasomotor tone is currently thought to be a critical component of vascular remodeling. The idea is that high or low shear induce, respectively, vasorelaxation or constriction, which over long times is entrained by tissue remodeling (Humphrey, Dufresne et al., 2014). It is also well established that production of nitric oxide in response to flow is mediated in part by the PECAM/VE-cadherin-VEGFR2 pathway (Jin, Ueba et al., 2003; Fleming, Fisslthaler et al., 2005). Thus, a similar role for VEGFR3, which leads to vessel remodeling, is quite reasonable.</p><p><italic>16) The YFP fluorescent reporter seems to be based on a large recombinant genomic clone in an unknown chromosomal location, where it can be influenced by the chromosomal context. Does the YFP expression reflect reliably the expression of VEGFR3 in the adult aorta? What is the half-life of the YFP used in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref><italic>? The YFP expression appears “patchy”in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref><italic>; does this mean that ECs in the aorta expresses variable amounts of VEGFR3? The authors should obtain convincing data showing that the VEGFR3 protein is indeed expressed at a significant level in the aortic endothelial cells in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To address this problem, we performed an immunohistological staining for VEGFR3 in the thoracic aorta and the ear skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This staining matches our observation with the YFP fluorescent reporter.</p><p><italic>17) The authors use HUVECs in their in vitro studies. These cells do not correspond to the endothelial cells in the mouse or zebrafish aorta. Although the flow conditions in umbilical vein may be similar to those in an artery, venous endothelial cells express higher levels of VEGFR3 than arterial endothelial cells (for example, see Hogan et al., Development, 2009). Somehow, based on in vitro analysis, the shear stress “setpoints” are handled rather indiscriminately, considering that arteries and veins as well as primary lymph vessels and collecting vessels also have obvious differences in shear stress in vivo. It would be useful and relevant to perform the gradient flow chamber experiments using freshly isolated arterial endothelial cells, or even better, aortic endothelial cells. If the authors are not willing to do this, then at least the limitation of using the cell lines should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>Our fundamental reason for using HUVECs is that since most of the venous vs arterial gene expression signature is lost when ECs are cultured (Aranguren, Agirre et al., 2013), we felt it was better to use cells that are easy to obtain and use, and that respond well to flow. The feature we are studying appears to be conserved among different types of ECs, thus, HUVECs provide a suitable in vitro model. We tried freshly isolated mouse arterial ECs but they failed to show any alignment in response to flow. This is very likely a protocol problem but in practical terms is a significant issue. We now include a statement about the limitation of using these two cells lines and invite the reader to consider that different cells lines may have different set points.</p><p><italic>18) The completeness of recombination achieved in the mouse aorta using the</italic> Cdh5-Cre <italic>line produced by Wang et al. is not reported. How does the dermal lymphatic data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref> <italic>connect with the rest of the manuscript?
