While an indispensible tool for elucidating the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases including CVD, the interactome is limited in its utility as it is not specific to any cell type, experimental condition or disease state. We introduced context-specificity to the interactome by combining it with co-abundance networks derived from unbiased proteomics measurements from activated macrophage-like cells. Each macrophage phenotype contributed to certain regions of the interactome. Using a network proximity-based prioritization method on the combined network, we predicted potential regulators of macrophage activation. Prediction performance significantly increased with the addition of co-abundance edges, and the prioritized candidates captured inflammation, immunity and CVD signatures. Integrating the novel network topology with transcriptomics and proteomics revealed top candidate drivers of inflammation. In vitro loss-of-function experiments demonstrated the regulatory role of these proteins in pro-inflammatory signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When human cells or tissues are injured, the body triggers a response known as inflammation to repair the damage and protect itself from further harm. However, if the same issue keeps recurring, the tissues become inflamed for longer periods of time, which may ultimately lead to health problems. This is what could be happening in cardiovascular diseases, where long-term inflammation could damage the heart and blood vessels.</p><p>Many different proteins interact with each other to control inflammation; gaining an insight into the nature of these interactions could help to pinpoint the role of each molecular actor. Researchers have used a combination of unbiased, large-scale experimental and computational approaches to develop the interactome, a map of the known interactions between all proteins in humans. However, interactions between proteins can change between cell types, or during disease. Here, Halu et al. aimed to refine the human interactome and identify new proteins involved in inflammation, especially in the context of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Cells called macrophages produce signals that trigger inflammation whey they detect damage in other cells or tissues. The experiments used a technique called proteomics to measure the amounts of all the proteins in human macrophages. Combining these data with the human interactome made it possible to predict new links between proteins known to have a role in inflammation and other proteins in the interactome. Further analysis using other sets of data from macrophages helped identify two new candidate proteins – GBP1 and WARS – that may promote inflammation. Halu et al. then used a genetic approach to deactivate the genes and decrease the levels of these two proteins in macrophages, which caused the signals that encourage inflammation to drop.</p><p>These findings suggest that GBP1 and WARS regulate the activity of macrophages to promote inflammation. The two proteins could therefore be used as drug targets to treat cardiovascular diseases and other disorders linked to inflammation, but further studies will be needed to precisely dissect how GBP1 and WARS work in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>networks</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Amitabh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kowa Company Ltd, Nagoya, Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aikawa</surname><given-names>Masanori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enriching the interactome with context-specific information from proteomics helps the identification of novel regulators of macrophage activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pro-inflammatory macrophage activation plays a prominent role in a large number of disorders including cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aikawa and Libby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glass and Olefsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glass and Witztum, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gregor and Hotamisligil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Randolph, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ridker and Lüscher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tabas, 2010</xref>). Established treatments for CVD such as those dependent on the cholesterol lowering effect of statins do not completely eliminate cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aikawa and Libby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aikawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Libby, 2005</xref>), therefore alternative novel solutions are needed to tackle such residual risk by targeting pro-inflammatory activation in CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ridker et al., 2017</xref>). Characterizing the mechanisms underlying macrophage activation itself proves to be a challenging task, given the functional heterogeneity of macrophages and the complex interplay between the pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biswas and Mantovani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gordon and Mantovani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koltsova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lawrence and Natoli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Swirski and Nahrendorf, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that macrophage activation has many distinct types and follows a spectrum model defined by specific stimuli rather than the bipolar model of pro- and anti-inflammatory polarization that once prevailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nahrendorf and Swirski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, using experimental models, where cause-effect relations are well defined, within a systems-based approach might help to facilitate the discovery of specific mechanisms that can contribute to the overall balance of macrophage phenotype or new therapeutic targets. As it stands, the hunt for hitherto undiscovered mechanistic connections in macrophage activation, and therapeutic targets aimed at resultant CVD, has much to benefit from complex systems approaches emerging in medicine.</p><p>Complex human diseases such as CVD are seldom the result of a perturbation of a single gene but rather arise from the concerted effects of multiple genes and their products forming complex networks of interactions in cells, collectively embodied in the ‘interactome’ concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vidal et al., 2011</xref>). Network medicine has emerged as an effective quantitative framework to address the complexity of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barabási et al., 2011</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that disease determinants tend to be localized in the same region in the interactome and interact closely with each other, leading to their organization into ‘disease modules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barabási et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Menche et al., 2015</xref>). The same principle is valid for functionally similar genes, which form ‘functional modules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shih and Parthasarathy, 2012</xref>). Based on this understanding of biological function and disease pathogenesis, network-based methods have successfully identified candidates for therapeutic targets: Early studies that constructed the network of approved drug targets and disease genes shed light on the current trends in drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yildirim et al., 2007</xref>). Other network-based pharmacological studies have focused on drug target prediction and proposed drug repurposing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger and Iyengar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Methods using shortest paths between drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gottlieb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhao and Li, 2012</xref>) and drug-disease proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guney et al., 2016</xref>) in the interactome were proposed.</p><p>Despite these advances, one important factor hampering the effective molecular characterization of diseases is that interactomes, which are collections of multiple types of literature-curated physical protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with experimental evidence from high-throughput experiments and small-scale studies, are incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Menche et al., 2015</xref>) and biased toward highly studied proteins such as disease-related proteins or targets of pre-existing drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rolland et al., 2014</xref>). Most importantly, interactomes are context-independent, that is do not carry information specific to the cell type, experimental condition or pathological state but rather represent the sum of all observed interactions, which makes them inherently generic and limits their utility in diverse biological and experimental settings.</p><p>Owing to its unbiased nature and high information content, high-resolution/accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) offers an opportunity to characterize the proteome of a specific cell state in a comprehensive way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mann et al., 2013</xref>). The rapid progress in proteomics technologies has instigated a growing body of works that combine large amounts of MS data with network biology methods. For instance, a recent study has used the proteomics of breast cancer cells in conjunction with literature-derived signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sacco et al., 2016</xref>). Protein abundance profiles from global proteomics measurements have been used to cluster co-regulated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singh et al., 2014</xref>), as well as build ‘co-abundance’ networks to identify key driver proteins for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McDermott et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, cell- and tissue-specific proteomic profiling could complement the incomplete and generic yet system-wide cellular picture provided by the interactome, especially in specific disease contexts.</p><p>Here, we used unbiased macrophage-derived proteomics measurements to enhance the literature-curated human interactome by adding cell type- and condition-specific information to it, thereby helping address its context-independence as well as its incompleteness. While we now realize that macrophage heterogeneity is more multidimensional rather than M1/M2 dichotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murray et al., 2014</xref>), assessing molecular mechanisms still requires a model in which cause-effect relationships are well defined, as we recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwata et al., 2016</xref>). We thus used interferon-γ (IFNγ) as an example of major instigators of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. We utilized a network proximity-based prediction method to identify key drivers of macrophage activation as it pertains to CVD. Our results revealed that edges derived from macrophage-specific proteomics contributed to the less characterized parts of the interactome, reflected the respective macrophage stimulation condition in terms of pathways and biological processes, and increased the prediction performance of CVD therapeutic targets. The top-ranked candidates for regulators of macrophage activation, and hence potential CVD drug targets, also showed significant enrichment with immune system as well as cardiovascular disease related signatures. Our multi-step and multi-omics analytical pipeline resulted in the identification of Guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS) as top candidates, based on evidence from network topology, gene expression and protein expression. To validate our network-based prediction, we performed loss-of-function experiments and demonstrated that GBP1 and WARS indeed regulate the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, CCL2, and phosphorylation of STAT1, two classical pro-inflammatory readouts. Overall, our findings suggest the utility of adding context-specific information to the generic interactome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-abundance networks from a cell culture model of macrophage activation add specificity to the interactome while recapitulating known interactions</title><p>The literature-curated human interactome, or PPI network (see Materials and methods), hosts invaluable information about potential protein subnetworks related to diseases. However, it is non-specific as it describes interactions that can occur between proteins within any cell or tissue under any condition, as well as currently incomplete. We hypothesized that the introduction of phenotype-specific interactions to the PPI network would address its incompleteness and fill in the biologically less characterized portions of it. We used time-course proteomics data collected from baseline control, IFNγ stimulated/pro-inflammatory, and IL-4 stimulated anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving phenotypes of the macrophage-like cell line THP-1, denoted by M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4), respectively, as the phenotypic information.</p><p>For each condition, we built co-abundance networks to represent the relationships between proteins that show similar abundance patterns over time by constructing the correlation matrix, setting a correlation threshold and building the network based on the edges above this threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a summary of topological properties). While the co-abundance networks have several-fold higher edge densities than the PPI network as a whole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), their edge densities are comparable to the region of the PPI that hosts the proteins in the co-abundance networks (0.96%). Mirroring well-known properties of PPI networks, the co-abundance networks display broad degree distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and high average clustering coefficients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Despite these similar characteristics, in comparison with the PPI network, the co-abundance networks have higher diameters and higher average shortest path lengths, as well as higher average clustering coefficients, possibly due to similar protein expression patterns connecting local groups of proteins all at once (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, co-abundance networks are more locally clustered and not as compact, compared to the PPI network, overall suggesting a complementary topology to the PPI network.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Co-abundance networks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top row: Sample from the Pearson correlation matrix showing the top 40 proteins in alphabetical order.

Thus, co-abundance networks may be instrumental in helping address the lack of biological investigation of certain parts, that is the incompleteness, of the PPI network while enhancing it with experiment- and context-specific information.</p><p>To ensure that the co-abundance edges correspond to biologically meaningful interactions, we validated these edges by measuring their overlap with known physical interactions and shared functional annotations. Co-abundance edges showed significant enrichment for (i) shared Gene Ontology (GO) terms, (ii) the literature curated PPI network used throughout this study, and (iii) interactions between pairs of proteins belonging to a common protein complex, based on high-quality protein complex databases and curated co-complex association maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Thus, the co-abundance networks independently generated from MS data in an experiment-specific context still capture GO-term-based functional associations and high-confidence interactions documented in context-independent interactomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Addition of macrophage derived co-abundance edges shortens the paths to CVD drug targets</title><p>We next inquired about how the macrophage-specific topology provided by co-abundance edges could facilitate the extraction of CVD and inflammation related drug target information from the combined network. To test this, we evaluated the effect of the addition of co-abundance edges on the shortest paths between proteins and drug targets related to the biology of the co-abundance network, and hence the combined network’s overall ‘drug target navigability.’ We found that, for both M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4), the average shortest distances between the co-abundance network’s nodes and known CVD drug targets from the integrated Complex Traits Network (iCTNet) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) are shorter for the combined network than the PPI network only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Proving that this effect cannot be attributed to the mere addition of edges, the addition of co-abundance edges resulted in an average shortest distance distribution that is shifted significantly towards lower values compared to the addition of the same number of randomly chosen edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that the co-abundance links used in conjunction with the PPI network result in a more compact network structure that makes the known drug targets more reachable by other proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Addition of macrophage derived co-abundance edges increases CVD drug target prediction performance</title><p>We hypothesized that, since the macrophage-derived co-abundance network renders the PPI network more compact and navigable to drug targets, network proximity-based drug target prediction methods should fare better on this combined network than the PPI network alone, enabling us to more efficiently identify novel targets. The co-abundance networks spanned a certain portion of the entire PPI network with their edges concentrated on certain regions, while the CVD drug targets were dispersed around the combined PPI network, forming a disconnected subnetwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting the fragmented nature of the CVD drug target information in the interactome. The proportions of CVD drug targets to non-drug targets in the PPI and co-abundance network were very similar to each other (0.0018 versus 0.0017, respectively), suggesting that there is no preferential presence of drug targets in either network over the other one. In terms of connectivity, the degrees of drug targets were significantly higher than the degrees of other proteins in the PPI network, while there was no significant degree difference between drug targets and other proteins in the co-abundance networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, measuring the tendency of co-abundance edges to connect to hubs in the PPI network, we found that proteins connected by CoA edges (i.e. CoA network nodes) have significantly higher degrees in the PPI network than the other nodes in the PPI network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these results point at a degree bias in the way drug targets and co-abundance edges are connected in the PPI network. To give equal opportunity to proteins not necessarily captured by proteomics measurements but contained in the PPI network, we chose to leverage the biology-specific information provided by the co-abundance network for a global prioritization of all proteins in the combined PPI network.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Target candidate prioritization and its performance assessment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The entire literature curated PPI network with co-abundance edges from all three stimulation conditions, providing a global view of the distribution and connectivity of co-abundance edges and drug targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for a quantification of related degree distributions and largest connected component (LCC) sizes).

As a proxy of prediction performance, we measured the rate of detecting known CVD drug targets by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Compared to the PPI network only, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was significantly increased with the addition of co-abundance links (p=0.018, p=0.003 and p=0.015 for M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4), respectively, paired t-test following k-fold cross-validation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

Furthermore, we found that the prediction performance can be further improved by (a) the systematic ‘de-noising’ of the PPI network by removing edges based on low-throughput experiments and co-complex interactions (see Materials and methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>) and (b) modulating the ratio of weights of the PPI links and co-abundance links, specifically by giving more ‘importance’ to the co-abundance links (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>), hence increasing the specificity of the network to the biological question.</p><p>Finally, to ensure that the increase in the prediction performance is not simply the result of the bulk addition of edges, we compared the AUROCs of co-abundance enriched PPI networks to those enriched with the equivalent number of random edges. To control for the degree bias in the connectivity between co-abundance and PPI networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), we implemented degree-preserving randomization, which ensures the addition of randomly selected edges that connect proteins with similar degrees to the proteins in the co-abundance networks (see Materials and methods). We found that co-abundance networks contribute to the increase in prediction performance significantly more (empirical p-value&lt;0.05) than the random case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To establish the relevance of our network-based prioritization to the therapeutic targets it is aimed at finding, we sought the enrichment of the top-ranked proteins in external datasets. As iCTNet-based CVD targets were used as seeds in the prioritization scheme, we used external datasets containing clinically approved CVD targets and chemically suitable CVD targets satisfying given small molecule activity thresholds for validation (see Materials and methods). These datasets were fairly orthogonal, showing insignificant overlap (except for one case, where the overlapping genes were removed from both datasets, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>) between their CVD drug target sets, thereby providing three independent sources for validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). We once again observed the increase in the target prediction performance with the addition of co-abundance edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). These findings applied to all drug targets derived from the same databases as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>), reflecting the broad impact of inflammation in human disease and suggesting the potential of macrophage-specific co-abundance edges in capturing additional inflammatory disease drug targets.</p><p>We also tested how robust the prediction performance is against changes in several points in the workflow. First, to investigate whether the improvement in the prediction performance is influenced by potential shared dependencies on a third confounding factor, we implemented two correlation measures that are robust against outliers and control for confounding factors, biweight midcorrelation and partial correlation, to build the co-abundance networks (see Materials and methods). The improvement in the AUROCs with the addition of co-abundance networks over PPI only was similar to the Pearson coefficient case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). These results indicate that the outlier abundance values and the indirect effect of baseline abundances do not influence the downstream analysis substantially.</p><p>Second, to explore how sensitive prediction performance is to untraversed longer-range paths between candidates and drug targets, we have considered global association measures and other types of network-based distance measures. In particular, we used dynamical prioritization methods such as random walk with restarts (RWR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Köhler et al., 2008</xref>) and its degree-aware version (DADA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erten et al., 2011</xref>), as well as other distance-based measures such as the kernel distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guney et al., 2016</xref>). Relying on a random walker, RWR/DADA takes into account all possible paths, including many longer-range paths between a candidate and a target (seed), whereas Kernel distance penalizes paths based on their length using an exponential function (see Matetrials and methods). Both types of measures yielded similar results to average shortest path in terms of the AUROC, and the improvement with the addition of CoA edges persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Top prioritized candidates capture immunity and CVD signatures and reflect the respective macrophage phenotype</title><p>To ensure that the prioritization method above reflects the macrophage biology and cardiovascular disease relation of the co-abundance networks, we measured their rate of capturing genes related to inflammation, innate immune response, and coronary artery disease signatures (see Materials and methods). The performance of the co-abundance enriched PPI networks in capturing these signatures surpassed that of the PPI network alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). The top prioritized (empirical p-value&lt;0.01, see Materials and methods) were significantly enriched in all three datasets for both stimulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the enriched pathways of the top prioritized proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>) were common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is mainly due to the fact that the despite the different stimulation conditions, the biological processes and pathways of top-prioritized candidates are mainly dominated by the cell type, resulting in a large number of commonalities, and reflecting the predominant effect of the common macrophage biology on the resulting target prioritization. Focusing on the condition-specific pathways, we found that M(IFNγ) is enriched in pro-inflammatory pathways such as p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation related pathways, as well as pathways related to PI3K-Akt activation, NFAT and hypertrophy of the heart, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and interleukin signaling, whereas M(IL-4) is enriched in Rho GTPase activation, SUMOylation, β-catenin, scavenger receptor and Fas (CD95) signaling related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for full list). Mapping these pathways in a pathway network (see Materials and methods) enabled us to summarize all biological processes related to each condition whereby pathways sharing molecular elements were clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that our global ranking of the entire PPI network, including proteins not in macrophage proteomics, captures the inflammatory and immune-response-related component of CVD mediated by macrophage activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pathways of top prioritized proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Venn diagram showing the shared pathways between the significantly enriched (q-value &lt;0.05) pathways of the top candidates (empirical p-value&lt;0.01) prioritized by the addition of the M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4) co-abundance networks to the PPI network.

In a similar vein, we sought to integrate our protein abundance data with previously published gene expression data from human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xue et al., 2014</xref>) to refine our list of prioritized proteins and focus on a much smaller subspace of highly expressed candidates for further in vitro validation. Particularly, since the network-based prioritization ranks all the proteins in the interactome indiscriminately and the prediction ROC curves show the greatest improvement at moderate ranks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we devised a combined filtering/ranking scheme to obtain a smaller set of final drug target candidates while maximizing the advantage offered by the performance of our prioritization method. The filtering step was used to intersect the network-based prioritization ranking with the highly expressed molecules from -omics data to detect the strongest signals that were also close to drug targets. The ranking scheme considered (a) the network closeness to drug targets, (b) the relative protein abundance difference with respect to baseline M(-) over all time points, and (c) the gene expression fold change with respect to baseline M(-) from human macrophage transcriptome data, and calculated a combined score based on these three criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Selection of top target candidates by incorporating expression and abundance data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the filtering/combined ranking scheme.

Moreover, each separate ranking was orthogonal to each other with insignificant correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that network-based prioritization ranking contributes in a non-trivial way to the combined ranking, and that each ranking carries its own information, contributing uniquely to the combined ranking.</p><p>The final list of candidates ranked according to the combined score was significantly close in the interactome to CVD drug targets for both M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4) in terms of the average shortest distance than what would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, see Materials and methods), confirming that the filtering of candidates aligns with the original premise of network proximity to CVD drug targets. This finding was further supported in the discretized distribution of shortest path lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, see Materials and methods), where shorter path lengths were significantly over-represented compared to random expectation. The top five final candidates for the M(IFNγ) ranking were GBP1, WARS, TGM2, NAMPT and STAT1, excluding PARP14, which was among the iCTNet drug targets. STAT1 belongs to a family of molecules known to be expressed in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xuan et al., 2001</xref>), and to play a role in the link between coronary artery disease and inflammatory responses in vascular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O'Donnell and Nabel, 2011</xref>). Of these candidates, GBP1 and WARS showed the most dramatic changes with IFNγ stimulation in protein abundance and gene expression alike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, the top five final candidates for M(IL-4) were LIPA, TGM2, EVL, PFKP and LRRFIP1, which showed a broad range of expression kinetics with their highest induction at different time points, implying that the related in vitro validation should be planned accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, the top prioritized and the top combined-ranked proteins showed good agreement with the rankings found through the alternative correlation measures and prioritization methods discussed above, showing significant overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplements 8C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">9B–C and E–F</xref>).</p><p>To inspect more closely the molecular paths between our top candidates and drug targets, we created subnetworks connecting the top five candidates to all CVD drug targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). STAT1 and TGM2 tended to connect to CVD drug targets through more established links in the literature-curated PPI network, whereas GBP1, WARS and NAMPT were mostly connected to drug targets by co-abundance edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly for M(IL-4), we noted that TGM2, PFKP and LRRFIP1 mostly utilize PPI network edges to link to drug targets while EVL and LIPA exploit the information provided by the co-abundance links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Mapping the shortest paths between the known CVD drug targets and top-ranked candidates thus presents us with an unbiased network-based means to select putative targets that preferentially leverage the novel information provided by the context-specific co-abundance links.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Validation experiments identify GBP1 and WARS as potential regulators of pro-inflammatory signaling</title><p>Although a systems approach facilitates target discovery, increased or decreased genes or proteins identified by unbiased omics screening may not necessarily play causal roles. While the expression levels of certain proteins increase during the activation of human macrophages, as gauged by induction of pro-inflammatory molecules, these molecules may not contribute to this phenotypic switch. Thus, to provide mechanistic insights about these induced molecules, as well as to validate our systems approach, we performed in vitro loss-of-function experiments. Based on the shortest path mapping between top candidates and CVD targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>), we chose GBP1 Guanylate Binding Protein (1) and WARS (Tryptophanyl-tRNA Synthetase) as candidates for novel regulators of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation and proceeded to in vitro validation experiments. Evidence had linked WARS with vascular angiogenesis and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ewalt and Schimmel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wakasugi et al., 2002</xref>). Further, genome-wide linkage studies have previously implicated this molecule in myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Broeckel et al., 2002</xref>), although subsequent genetic-epidemiological studies did not find significant associations between WARS and the risk of myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zee et al., 2005</xref>). A more recent study that used human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) demonstrated that secretion of the full-length form of WARS is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli, including bacterial-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS), suggesting a role for WARS in the defense system against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we investigated the potential for WARS to regulate prototypical pro-inflammatory signaling proteins and cytokines in response to IFNγ. We performed small interfering RNA(si-RNA)-mediated WARS loss-of-function studies on THP-1-differentiated macrophage-like cells and human primary macrophages derived from PBMC. In THP-1 cells stimulated by IFNγ, silencing of WARS enhanced the mRNA expression of the chemokine CCL2, and the secretion of its protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), however no such effects were observed for the cytokine TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The enhanced secretion of CCL2 in response to WARS silencing was confirmed in three different PBMC donors, where the increase in CCL2 secretion was significant at 12 hr of IFNγ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Investigating the effect of WARS on the JAK-STAT pathway, the transcriptional levels of STAT1 and JAK2 did not change with WARS silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Silencing of WARS, however, increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser701 in both THP-1-differentiated macrophage-like cells and human primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>In vitro loss-of-function experiments for GBP1 and WARS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative mRNA and protein expression levels for CCL2, TNFα, JAK2 and STAT1 and with WARS silencing under control and IFNγ stimulation conditions, performed on THP-1-differentiated macrophage-like cells.(n = 8–12 samples from three to four experiments) (<bold>B</bold>) Western blot showing protein expression levels of pSTAT1 with WARS silencing under control and IFNγ stimulation conditions, performed on THP-1-differentiated macrophage-like cells.

Network medicine approaches utilizing large-scale interactomes hold the key to the efficient identification of novel therapeutic solutions targeting pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in CVD. Currently available interactomes, however, are hindered in their usefulness since they are by design the aggregation of all possible interactions from diverse cell states, which obscures any tissue, cell type, experiment or disease-specific information. One approach to address this lack of specificity and incompleteness is to enhance the interactome with context-specific information from proteomics measurements. To capitalize on the potential for interactome networks to expedite CVD drug target discovery research, we combined our protein co-abundance networks derived from a cell-specific, macrophage activation in vitro model with the ‘all-purpose’, generic PPI network. We interrogated the resulting combined interactome to predict and highlight new regulators of macrophage activation and potential targets of CVD as well as studied the potential the mechanisms by which they might regulate pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and experimentally validated some of these mechanisms.</p><p>When proposing new sources for protein interactions, two questions must be asked: (i) Does the new network add novel information to the existing one?; and (ii) Is this novel information biologically relevant? The first question is addressed by the ‘fill-in-the-blanks’ effect of the co-abundance edges, where the sparse portions of the PPI network were filled in by co-abundance networks, potentially addressing the incompleteness and investigation bias of the PPI network. Previously, co-expression networks were suggested to represent a complementary tool to the PPI network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vella et al., 2017</xref>), and protein abundances obtained through mass spectrometry and direct protein contacts detected by crosslinking and mass-spectrometry were found to be complementary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Solis-Mezarino and Herzog, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, each stimulation condition was distinct in regards to which part of the PPI network they filled in. We also noted that the M(IL-4) co-abundance network had more overlap with M(-). Addressing the second question, our assumption is that proteins that are co-regulated are more likely to be involved in similar pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kustatscher et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the co-abundance edges were significantly enriched in interactions based on binary interactomes, co-complex associations and shared functional annotations. While direct binary interactions were less strongly represented among co-abundance edges, the indirect co-associations evidenced by the enrichment of multiple co-complex resources suggests that the real value of co-abundance edges might lie in their use as co-complex resources and not necessarily direct physical interactions.</p><p>It has been proposed that network proximity is a good proxy of therapeutic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guney et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we found that network distance-based measures fared better with the addition of context-specific co-abundance edges, and that co-abundance edges rendered the PPI network more navigable for the drug targets. The prediction performance of novel drug targets based on network proximity measures showed a significant improvement with the addition of co-abundance edges. The prediction performance further increased when co-abundance edges were given more prominence, which suggests that the information provided by the co-abundance network is beneficial and adds positive value to the PPI network when predicting drug targets. Remarkably, the prioritized candidates also captured disease biology, especially inflammation, innate immune response and CAD signatures. This suggests that the drug target candidates themselves may play a direct role in CVD or be involved in the inflammatory mechanisms leading to it. We note that, while co-abundance edges were built systematically, filtered with statistical rigor, and as a whole contributed to the increase in drug target prediction accuracy, they were not experimentally validated in this study and therefore are not deemed high-confidence edges individually.</p><p>Aside from hallmark pro-inflammatory pathways such as MAPK and NF-κB, the top ranked candidates for M(IFNγ) were enriched in various pathways associated with atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders, including Wnt, FGF, adrenergic, IGF, Akt, and ras. IFNγ was suggested to have direct effects on cardiomyocytes through β-adrenergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levick and Goldspink, 2014</xref>), PI3K-Akt pathway has been posed as a key regulator in macrophage metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brenner et al., 2016</xref>). The enriched pathways of the top ranked candidates for M(IL-4) showed a breadth of evidence for the alternatively activated, pro-resolving macrophage polarization. Among these, Rho GTPase activation has been associated with M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aflaki et al., 2011</xref>). SUMOylation was linked to anti-inflammatory signals and suggested as a potential target pathway for the modulation of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leitinger and Schulman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tugal et al., 2013</xref>). Elevated levels of Fas (CD95) expression in anti-inflammatory macrophages was associated with proangiogenesis in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively activated macrophages were shown to activate Wnt signaling pathway and increase β-catenin expression in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cosín-Roger et al., 2013</xref>). The expression of several scavenger receptors was increased in alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canton et al., 2013</xref>). This pathway-based evidence suggests that co-abundance networks indeed influence the PPI network and the resulting drug target prioritization reflects the biology of the respective macrophage activation.</p><p>The correlation between gene and protein expression may be low in multi-cellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kustatscher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Sousa Abreu et al., 2009</xref>), which we also observed in our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To ameliorate this issue, we used a combined ranking of rankings to effectively normalize the ranking distributions and address the possible delay between gene expression and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The resulting filtered list of candidates indeed showed the desired closeness to known CVD drug targets. When measuring the network distance between the final list of candidates and CVD targets, we used two measures that offer a complementary view of network proximity: Average shortest distance is a useful summary metric that quantifies the distance between candidates and targets while shortest distance distributions provide a more detailed view enabling us to see which number of links between candidates and targets tend to be over-represented compared to random. While minimum (or closest) shortest distance has been found to outperform other proximity measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guney et al., 2016</xref>), we chose to use average shortest distance as the metric of choice in our drug target prioritization method since minimum shortest distances are confined to integer numbers resulting in redundancy of ranks, which convolutes the overall rankings for prioritization. Considering potential limitations of shortest path based prioritization methods such as ignoring biologically meaningful alternative longer-range paths between candidates and drug targets, we also ran our workflow on global dynamical prioritization measures, which displayed similar results, suggesting that the improvement of target prediction with context-specific information from co-abundance networks is independent of the prioritization metric used.</p><p>To validate our systems approach to the discovery of new regulators of macrophage activation, we chose GBP1 and WARS from the subnetworks of top five candidates and CVD drug targets. In particular, GBP1 and WARS stood out as the candidates that were linked to the majority of drug targets by novel co-abundance links, hence potentially having many undiscovered downstream mechanisms related to CVD and inflammation. It is important to note the opposite influences of GBP1 and WARS on JAK-STAT signaling, particularly on the pro-inflammatory cytokine CCL2 and pSTAT1. Our siRNA silencing and inhibitor treatment experiments suggest that WARS has a protective effect, suppressing these downstream pro-inflammatory markers, whereas GBP1 has an exacerbating effect on inflammation, enhancing their expression, along with another pro-inflammatory molecule, JAK2. Overall, the downstream effect of GBP1 points at a possible feedback regulation on JAK2-STAT1-CCL2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Other GBP family members, GBP2, GBP3, GBP4 and GBP6, were also found in our proteomics measurements, showing higher induction after 24 hr, with GBP2 displaying similar expression patterns to GBP1, while GBP3 and GBP6, the two family members found to be induced in macrophage foam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goo et al., 2016</xref>), have a distinct pattern characterized by a sharp drop in protein expression at 12 hr and then a sharp increase at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Coupled with evidence from our network-based prioritization, this suggests that other members of the GBP family with similar expression patterns to GBP3 and GBP6, including the top-prioritized GBP1, might also play a role in atherosclerosis mediated by hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>The present work can be improved in multiple directions. While we adopted a simple weighted integration method of the PPI network and co-abundance networks to take into account the predictive potential of each network, similar to the weighted network integration method demonstrated in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Valentini et al., 2014</xref>, many alternative filtering strategies remain. As an alternative to combining the PPI network and co-abundance networks, we explored a filtering strategy where we removed the negative correlation edges in addition to adding the positive correlation ones. However, the number of edges that were already present in the PPI was limited to a few hundreds 114, 271 and 105 edges for M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4), respectively), therefore the removal of these did not result in a substantial increase in the ROCs, with limited improvement for M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4) in terms of AUROCs (86.77% to 86.78% for M(IFNγ) and 85.18% to 85.20% for M(IL-4). In other words, the improvement caused by the removal of a few hundred edges was mostly overshadowed by the addition of many more positive correlation edges. This suggests that the main shortcoming of the PPI is incompleteness, which is thought to be a large percentage of all possible edges, rather than noise and false positives, which make up a much smaller portion. Another constraint regarding the building of co-abundance networks is that we used only the common proteome between M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4) and applied a PSM cutoff of &gt;10, which reduces the size of the co-abundance networks. While this ensures that we work with the strongest signals, relaxing these criteria might result in the discovery of additional key targets.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that proteomics-derived co-abundance edges introduce context specificity to the PPI network and significantly improve the prediction of drug targets related to the biology in question. Indeed, co-abundance networks derived from IFNγ- and IL-4-stimulated macrophage-like cells resulted in the network proximity-based prediction of GBP1 and WARS as potential regulators of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Our in vitro loss-of-function studies involving human primary macrophages verified the role of these targets in pro-inflammatory signaling as regulators of CCL2 and JAK2 as well as STAT1 phosphorylation. Overall, our workflow has general applicability and can serve as the blueprint for subsequent studies to combine proteomics data with context-independent interactomes to extract cell type- and experimental condition-specific information for the purpose of identifying targetable pathways and molecules in the context of complex pathobiologies such as CVD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of the literature-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network</title><p>To represent the current knowledge on human protein-protein interactions as a literature-based PPI network, we compiled a comprehensive list of PPIs with experimental evidence from various databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Menche et al., 2015</xref>) including the following types of interactions: (i) regulatory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matys et al., 2006</xref>), (ii) high-quality binary PPIs tested via high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, obtained from multiple publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rolland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rual et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stelzl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Venkatesan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) and public databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aranda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceol et al., 2010</xref>), (iii) literature-curated PPIs identified by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS), Y2H, low-throughput experiments, and protein three-dimensional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aranda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keshava Prasad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), (iv) metabolic enzyme-coupled interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), (v) protein complexes derived from a variety of experimental tools, from co-immunoprecipitation to co-sedimentation and ion exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruepp et al., 2010</xref>), (vi) kinase-substrate interactions derived from high-throughput and literature-curated low-throughput experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hornbeck et al., 2012</xref>), and (vii) signaling interactions from both high-throughput and literature curation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vinayagam et al., 2011</xref>). After the removal of duplicated edges, the resulting PPI network contained 170,303 interactions between 14,213 proteins. For our analyses, we discarded the isolated nodes that only self-interact and used the largest connected component (LCC) of this network, which has 170,253 interactions and 14,115 proteins. The resulting network has an average degree &lt;k &gt; of 24.12, an average clustering coefficient &lt;C&gt; of 0.210, a diameter of 12 and an average shortest path length of 3.54 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To address the investigation bias and eliminate noise due to indirect associations from protein complexes wherever possible within the PPI network, we systematically removed the edges from individual, low-throughput experiments from literature and co-complex interactions. The removal of low-throughput edges resulted in 13,604 proteins and 147,295 interactions and the subsequent removal of co-complex edges resulted in 13,568 proteins and 125,495 interactions. As it yields the best performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), this ‘de-noised’ PPI with the low-throughput and co-complex interactions removed was used throughout the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>TMT sample preparation and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>We have detailed the IFNγ and IL-4 stimulation conditions, cell culture experiments and six-plex tandem mass tagging (TMT) sample preparation methods previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwata et al., 2016</xref>.

Then, for every pair of proteins, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) between their abundance profiles. This resulted in a weighted, complete graph where the edge weights were given by Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> values. As a robust way of comparing these correlation values against a null model representing the expectation by chance, we created randomized datasets whereby the abundance profile vectors were shuffled for a large number of realizations, and calculated permutation-based empirical p-values. In this case, the empirical p-value (P*) was calculated as P* = r<sub>&gt;</sub>/N where N = 300 is the total number of permutations performed and r<sub>&gt;</sub> is the number of permutations where the permuted <italic>r</italic> was higher than the real <italic>r</italic>. In other words, P* is the probability of encountering a higher value of r in the permuted data than the observed <italic>r</italic>. We then adjusted the empirical p-values for multiple-testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control for the false discovery rate (FDR). This resulted in a Pearson correlation and adjusted empirical p-value pair (r, Q*) for all possible edges. Finally, to filter the network to preserve only the most high-confidence co-abundance edges, we set an edge weight threshold. For the selection of this threshold, we performed a sensitivity analysis where we plotted the density of the resulting co-abundance network as a function of the adjusted empirical p-value. At an FDR of 1%, we selected the highest Pearson correlation that maintained the network density, that is 0.90, as the edge weight cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As additional correlation measures, we calculated biweight midcorrelation and partial correlation using the WGCNA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Langfelder and Horvath, 2012</xref>) and ppcor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim, 2015</xref>), respectively, in R.

Lastly, we used hu.Map, a recent large-scale protein complex map resulting from the integration of over 9000 MS experiments, which contained 35,375 interactions after setting an interaction probability threshold of 0.265, which is deemed high-confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drew et al., 2017</xref>).

We excluded the inference-based evidence types IPI (inferred from physical interaction) and IEA (inferred from electronic analysis), and ND (not described). To ensure that the GO networks adhere to relatively specific GO terms, we considered terms with less than 100 associated genes. This resulted in 11,361 nodes and 631,799 edges for GO:BP, 7586 nodes and 162,154 edges for GO:MF, and 6044 nodes and 196,936 edges for GO:CC, after mapping Entrez IDs to gene symbols.

To cover a broad range of cardiovascular diseases, we selected the ‘cardiovascular system disease’ phenotype (ID: 1287) and all its subcategories and included the results from both the GWAS catalog and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. For the drug associations, we queried iCTNet2 for disease-drug and gene-drug interactions from DrugBank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wishart et al., 2006</xref>) and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mattingly et al., 2003</xref>).

As the drug target data lacks information about their relative importance, we weighted the seed genes equally, assigning them the relative weight <italic>I(s)</italic> value of 1.0. Using the proximity score, we ranked all the proteins in the PPI network. As a measure of the prediction performance, that is the rate of capturing true positives, of our prioritization method, we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the area under the ROCs (AUROC). We implemented k-fold (k = 7 was chosen for a reasonable test set size, unless otherwise noted) cross-validation to determine the statistical significance of the difference between AUROC values, and as the datasets were partitioned into folds consistently across PPI and PPI + CoA, a paired t-test was used to compare the two cases and two-tailed p-values were reported. For the addition of random edges used as negative control in the prediction performance assessment, we adopted a degree-preserving randomization strategy. As there is typically a small number of very highly connected proteins in the PPI network, to avoid repeatedly selecting the same proteins in lieu of these highly connected nodes, all proteins were logarithmically binned according to their degree. Edges were then established between pairs of proteins uniformly randomly picked from their respective degree bin representing a pool of similar degree proteins. In addition to ROC curves, we additionally plotted precision-recall curves as they can provide additional information for imbalanced datasets where positives are rare.

The combined ranking was achieved as the result of (i) the rank according to the network prioritization, (ii) the rank according to the relative protein abundance difference with respect to baseline M(-) over all time points, and (iii) the gene expression fold change with respect to baseline M(-) from human macrophage transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). We first determined the optimal threshold on the network-based prioritization ranking that would maximize the sum of the sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (1 – false positive rate). Based on the ROC curves obtained after optimization of weight ratios, we found these optimal threshold values to be the top 2971 candidates for M(IFNγ) and the top 3496 candidates for M(IL-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Second, we filtered these top-N candidates with the top 500 candidates with the highest relative abundance in the proteomics data for each time point, with respect to the baseline M(-).

macrophage activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper proposes a combination of -OMICS data using a molecular network framework. The goal is to identify new regulators of macrophage activation related with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The assessment of the results is carried out by an enrichment analysis strategy, i.e. quantifying the position in the ranking of known cardio disease related drugs (from iCTNet) and pathways. A small scale loss of function experiment is performed for two newly proposed targets.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The critical questions that have to be clarified are the following:</p><p>1) Possible biases in the network construction and associated calculations.</p><p>(1a) The inclusion of small scale experiments in the network might end up biasing the results, since these experiments target well known proteins. Similarly, the network might contain other biases, e.g. smaller distances between druggable proteins.</p><p>(1b) Other related question would be if the definition of druggable proteins, obtained from a network based method, will influence their distribution in the network?</p><p>(1c) Use of the Pearson correlation instead of the partial correlation coefficient, and the possible bias towards indirect associations.</p><p>(2) Insufficient information and doubts on the procedures.</p><p>(2a) The comparison of the combined network with its two components, i.e.</p><p>PPI and co-abundance, seems to be incomplete and the specific methodological details not sufficiently clear. What is the prediction performance of the co-abundance network alone?</p><p>(2b) It is reasonable to question if the direct union of both types of networks is the best strategy. This issue should be discussed.</p><p>(2c) The reasons of additional filtering of the results obtained with the network based approach by requesting an additional level of expression – fold changes – is unclear. How and why the resulting candidates were selected requires additional clarification.</p><p>(3) The use of shortest path distances seems too simple as a measure of associations, while other alternatives, including network kernel distances,connectivity-based association measures, assortativity, and others, are commonly used in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors use an integrative analysis of proteomics, transcriptomics and molecular network data in order to identify new regulators of macrophage activation, which may be of interest as candidate therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The proposed methodology, which combines omics-derived co-abundance networks with literature-derived molecular interaction networks, is evaluated by assessing the enrichment of the resulting top-ranked proteins in known CVD drugs as compared to a prioritization that uses only literature-derived network information, as well as by the enrichment of the top-ranked proteins in inflammation-related pathways and signatures. Moreover, for two new top-ranked proteins, in-vitro loss-of-function experiments are used to show that these proteins have a regulatory role in pro-inflammatory signaling.</p><p>Overall, the authors' approach is logical, and although the method is very similar to previous contextualized network distance based target prioritization approaches, the obtained results in the context of macrophage activation and CVD are new and interesting. However, major comments have to be addressed regarding potential biases in the network construction resulting from the inclusion of data from targeted low-throughput experiments, the comparative evaluation of network prioritization approaches (no cross-validation is performed), and the discussion of limitations regarding false positives and negatives in the combined networks and in the experimental evaluation of candidate drug targets.</p><p>(1) In the subsection “Construction of the literature-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network”, the authors mention that the literature-based PPI network they constructed does not only include high-quality binary interactions from high-throughput Y2H screens, but also interactions from low-throughput experiments, protein 3D structures, as well as protein complexes derived from experiments that cannot confirm direct physical interactions (e.g. Co-IP). As the authors correctly mention in the third paragraph of the Introduction, such networks are often biased towards highly studied proteins. The addition of context-specific co-abundance edges may to a certain extent address limitations of the PPI network with regard to cell-type specificity, but since the authors combine the PPI network with the co-abundance network, rather than using the co-abundance information to filter the PPI network, biases and false-positives in the original PPI network will not be removed and still influence the final analyses. Moreover, as opposed to the partial correlation coefficient, the Pearson correlation used to construct the co-abundance network will identify many indirect associations and spurious associations between two variables resulting from shared dependencies on a third confounding factor variable. For these reasons, the authors should check how the results of their approach change if low-throughput experiments and sources of evidence limited to indirect associations (rather than physical interactions) are filtered out from the PPI construction. Similarly, the influence of the correlation measure used for the construction of the co-abundance network on the final results should be investigated, e.g. by testing alternative measures like the partial correlation coefficient or the biweight midcorrelation, which is more robust against outliers, and discussing limitations arising from potential confounding variables. Finally, the authors should consider and discuss whether using the co-abundance information to filter the PPI network, rather than combining the two networks (and their erroneous edges), would provide a more reliable final network.</p><p>(2) In their comparison of network prioritization methods based on known CVD drugs from iCTNet the authors relate the predictive performance for the combined networks (PPI + co-abundance networks) to the performance for using only the PPI network via ROC curve analyses. However, they do not compare the combined networks to using the co-abundance networks only, i.e. it is not clear whether the co-abundance networks alone as data source would already outperform the purely PPI-based analysis for drug prioritization, or whether only the combination of PPI + co-abundance networks provides a superior performance. Thus, ROC curves and statistical tests for evaluating the co-abundance networks only as compared to the combined networks should be added. The statistical test used for performance comparison should also be explained in more detail: The authors mention that they use a Mann-Whitney U-Test to compare the AUROC values; however, given that only one AUROC is available for each network (the PPI and the combined network), it is not clear how the Mann-Whitney U-Test is applied in this context, since this test requires more than one value per group: Do the authors use a cross-validated AUROC computation? This would be an appropriate and more robust approach than computing a single AUROC, and would enable a statistical performance comparison, but also needs to be explained in detail in the manuscript.</p><p>Especially if the authors optimize their model (e.g. by modulating the ratio of weights, as described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Addition of macrophage derived co-abundance edges increases CVD drug target prediction performance”), a cross-validation is needed in order to prevent that the same outcome data used to optimize the prediction approach is also used to evaluate it (i.e. preventing a circular analysis with misleading performance estimates).</p><p>(3) In the Abstract, the authors write that their approach revealed &quot;top candidates for CVD therapeutic targets&quot;; however, in the manuscript, the authors do not investigate the druggability of these candidate proteins (GBP1 and WARS), neither experimentally nor in-silico, but only experimentally asses their regulatory role using pro-inflammatory readouts. Thus, the authors should either limit the claimed discovery to have identified/confirmed the regulatory role of the candidate proteins, or alternatively, add analyses that confirm the druggability and/or show preliminary evidence confirming that CVD-specific disease phenotypes (rather than generic inflammation readouts) in a model system can be modulated specifically via GBP1 and WARS. The authors should also mention whether existing disease gene prioritization approaches would predict the same or different candidate proteins (currently no comparison is shown).</p><p>(4) The authors should explain why they use shortest path distances for quantifying network associations rather than network kernel distances or connectivity-based association measures. The multiplicity and density of interactions that interconnect proteins may provide more evidence for a functional association than the shortest path distances alone, and it is unclear whether considering longer-range shortest path distances in the analysis still provides a significant added informative value or rather spurious associations as compared to an association measure purely based on direct connectivity. These points and potential limitations of the used association measure should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have demonstrated an interesting approach that starts with large scale data mining and end up with validation of potential target of CVD and in particular the macrophage activities in CVD.</p><p>The experimental design and workflow of the publication is clearly laid out, and it is didactic enough to walk through the manuscript without too many hurdles.</p><p>I see no major issue with the manuscript as is and found it actually quite good examplar of systems oriented study and target prioritization excercise.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The article is well written but the Introduction and Discussion are too lengthy. My general concerns relate to:</p><p>(1) The authors have not carefully tested for confounding factors that might underlie some if not most of the observed correlations and prediction performances. Do the drug targets show some preferential presence in the co-abundance network versus PPI network and are there any degree differences between drug targets and other proteins in the co-abundance network and/or PPI network? Do co-abundance edges preferentially connect to hubs in the PPI network? If there are biases of these kinds then a random addition of edges to the network as empirical control might not capture this and modifications like adding random edges involving proteins in the co-abundance network would represent a more relevant negative control? To which extent is the definition of your drug targets influenced by network information because a network tool, iCTNet was used? Can this lead to circularity when using these drug targets as seeds in the network proximity approach?</p><p>(2) The authors state that the drug targets are not significantly close to each other in the network, yet, when used in the benchmark of the network proximity algorithm, the performance is good. Don't they have to be close in the network for the algorithm to work? Why use the LCC sometimes and the average shortest path at other times to determine closeness? What is the negative dataset used in the benchmark and can authors plot precision-recall curves as well to provide a better overview on the precision of the predictions? What is the prediction performance of the co-abundance network alone?</p><p>(3) The reasoning for why the candidate lists need to be further improved by using expression fold change data are not clear. Is the candidate list based on the network prediction not good enough? Then this can be clearly stated. Why were the candidates GBP1 and WARS picked? Because they show the highest expression fold change among the candidates? How many other proteins show as high or higher fold change justifying that the network prediction &quot;helped&quot; selecting among the differentially expressed genes those that are more close to known drug targets? To my non-expert understanding of the immune system, the experiments validate the function of the candidate genes in inflammation/immune response but that was an obvious hypothesis given their up-regulation in expression? How do these experiments validate the concept of using network proximity to drug targets to find new candidates? It remains unclear how the modulation of inflammation biomarkers by the candidates relates to CVD. Contrary to statements in the discussion, I cannot find experimental validation of mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37059.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall, the authors' approach is logical, and although the method is very similar to previous contextualized network distance based target prioritization approaches, the obtained results in the context of macrophage activation and CVD are new and interesting.

The removal of edges from low-throughput experiments indeed resulted in an increase in the AUROC for PPI only (0.831 to 0.848). Moreover, the improvement with the addition of co-abundance edges remained the same, where AUROCs were increased proportionally (M(-): 0.862 to 0.881, M(IFNγ): 0.868 to 0.878 and M(IL-4): 0.852 to 0.870) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). The improvement of PPI+CoA was statistically significant under k-fold cross-validation (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C), with p = 0.0236 for M(-), p=0.0042 for M(INFγ) and p=0.0431 for M(IL-4) by paired t-test (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D). To further eliminate possible noise from the PPI network, we next removed the co-complex edges. As expected, for PPI only, the AUROC improved even further with the additional removal of protein complex edges (from 0.831 to 0.855). Moreover, the improvement with the addition of co-abundance links persisted, where AUROCs were increased proportionally (M(-): 0.862 to 0.887, M(IFNγ): 0.868 to 0.886 and M(IL-4): 0.852 to 0.879) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). The improvement of PPI+CoA was again statistically significant under 7-fold cross-validation (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C) with improved p-values: p = 0.0180 for M(-), p=0.0029 for M(IFNγ) and p=0.0154 for M(IL-4) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D). Collectively, these results suggest that the systematic elimination of potentially biased edges results in an improvement in target prediction performance. In light of these results, we have now opted to run the workflow with the de-noised version of the PPI and present these results in the main figures. We have added these results in the text as shown below, and the comparison in the supplementary figures.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Furthermore, we found that the prediction performance can be further improved by (a) the systematic “de-noising” of the PPI network by removing edges based on low-throughput experiments and co-complex interactions (see Materials and methods, and Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-D)”.</p><p>To address the second issue, we have implemented two correlation measures that are robust against outliers and control for confounding factors, i.e. biweight midcorrelation and partial correlation, respectively, to build the co-abundance networks. For the biweight midcorrelation, the M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4) networks consisted of 13,118,31,193, and 14,831 edges, respectively. When added to the PPI network, the improvement with the addition of co-abundance networks over PPI only was similar to the Pearson coefficient case (Figure 2—figure supplement 8A). The final combined rankings were also similar to those of the Pearson coefficient case, with a high level of overlap (p=9.34e-99 and p=9.00e-73 for M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4), respectively) (Figure 2—figure supplement 8C). Similarly, using partial correlation, controlling for baseline M(-) abundances, the resulting co-abundance networks had 14,307, 141,768 and 85,752 edges, respectively, for M(-), M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4). The improvement with the addition of co-abundance networks over PPI only was again similar to the Pearson coefficient case (Figure 2—figure supplement 8B). The final combined rankings were also similar to those of the Pearson coefficient case, with a high level of overlaps (p=3.64e-101 and p=1.70e-94 for M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4), respectively) (Figure 2—figure supplement 8D). These results indicate that the outlier abundance values and the indirect effect of baseline abundances do not influence the downstream analysis substantially. Despite the relatively large number of added edges, especially for partial correlation, the ROC curves and resulting combined rankings are similar to Pearson correlation coefficient. We have now included a discussion of these results in the main text as shown below, and the related figures in the supplementary figures.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“We also tested how robust the prediction performance is against changes in several points in the workflow. […] These results indicate that the outlier abundance values and the indirect effect of baseline abundances do not influence the downstream analysis substantially.”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“As additional correlation measures, we calculated biweight midcorrelation and partial correlation using the WGCNA package (1) and ppcor package (2), respectively, in R. Baseline (M(-)) abundances were controlled for in the partial correlation calculation. Resulting two-sided p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the BH procedure, and a correlation threshold of 0.90 (p&lt;0.01) was chosen for consistency.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors should consider and discuss whether using the co-abundance information to filter the PPI network, rather than combining the two networks (and their erroneous edges), would provide a more reliable final network.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we combined the PPI network with positive correlation co-abundance edges by assuming that co-expressed proteins are likely to be functionally related (3), and that protein co-expression networks represent a complementary tool to the PPI, as suggested recently by Vella et al. (4). Furthermore, protein abundances obtained through mass spectrometry and direct protein contacts detected by crosslinking and mass-spectrometry were found to be complementary by Solis-Mezarino et al. (5). We have now added these references to the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Previously, co-expression networks were suggested to represent a complementary tool to the PPI network (Vella et al., 2017), and protein abundances obtained through mass spectrometry and direct protein contacts detected by crosslinking and mass-spectrometry were found to be complementary (Solis-Mezarino and Herzog, 2017).”</p><p>Nevertheless, the filtering approach raised by the reviewer is valid and important. While we adopt a simple weighted integration method of two networks to take into account the predictive potential of each network, similar to the weighted network integration method demonstrated in the study by Valentini et al. (6), undoubtedly many alternative filtering strategies remain. Here we explored the strategy of also removing existing edges from PPI in a further attempt to de-noise the PPI, using co-abundance networks this time. As removing the noisy edges clearly showed that adding does not necessarily improve prediction performance, and conversely, removing does not necessarily decrease prediction performance, we hypothesized that removing edges could be a good strategy. Specifically, we removed the negative correlation edges in addition to adding the positive correlation ones. However, the number of edges that were already present in the PPI was limited to a few hundred. Thus, the removal of these did not result in a substantial increase in the ROCs, although there was minimal (0.01%-0.02%) improvement for M(IFNγ) and M(IL-4) in the AUROCs. In other words, the improvement caused by the removal of a few hundred edges was mostly overshadowed by the addition of many more positive correlation edges. This also goes to suggest that the main shortcoming of the PPI is incompleteness (which is thought to be a large percentage of all possible edges), rather than noise and false positives, which make up a much smaller portion. Hence we adopted our initial strategy of “adding” rather than “filtering” for this study. We have discussed this additional filtering strategy and other similar strategies that could be implemented in future studies, as shown below.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“While we adopted a simple weighted integration method of the PPI network and co-abundance networks to take into account the predictive potential of each network, similar to the weighted network integration method demonstrated in the study by Valentini et al.

However, they do not compare the combined networks to using the co-abundance networks only, i.e. it is not clear whether the co-abundance networks alone as data source would already outperform the purely PPI-based analysis for drug prioritization, or whether only the combination of PPI + co-abundance networks provides a superior performance. […] Especially if the authors optimize their model (e.g. by modulating the ratio of weights, as described in the second paragraph of the subsection “Addition of macrophage derived co-abundance edges increases CVD drug target prediction performance”), a cross-validation is needed in order to prevent that the same outcome data used to optimize the prediction approach is also used to evaluate it (i.e. preventing a circular analysis with misleading performance estimates).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points regarding the prediction assessment. We agree that the ROC curves corresponding to the co-abundance networks by themselves are essential for a complete comparison. We have now performed target prioritization on these networks alone and plotted the ROC curves along with the combined networks (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). In line with our expectation that, since co-abundance networks span a certain, biology-specific part of the entire interactome, the co-abundance networks by themselves would not yield a good performance regarding the global prioritization of proteins, the prediction performance of the co-abundance networks was lower than the combined network. This result was also confirmed in the validation datasets (Figure 2—figure supplement 5 and 7). We have added these results in the main text.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“The prediction performance of the combined networks also surpassed those of co-abundance networks alone (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).”</p><p>The reviewer is correct that Mann-Whitney U test for the comparison of ROC curves is not the most suitable tool. We had previously used this test to compare the TPR distributions of ROC curves. We agree that cross-validation is a much better and robust approach that allows for a more intuitive statistical comparison between the curves. We have now implemented k-fold cross validation (k=7 was chosen for a reasonable test set size unless otherwise noted) for the results presented in the study, and compared the results with a paired t-test (Figure 2—figure supplements 2, 3, 5 and 7). We describe this procedure in detail in the Materials and methods section. Under cross-validation, the difference between PPI and PPI+CoA ROC curves still remain significant for the original PPI including low-throughput and co-complex interactions, as well as the “de-noised” PPI (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C-D). We have also implemented k-fold cross-validation in the optimization procedure, and selected the weight ratio that yields the highest mean AUROC across all folds for each condition (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A), and re-ran the entire workflow with the updated optimized parameters.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“We implemented k-fold (k=7 was chosen for a reasonable test set size, unless otherwise noted) cross-validation to determine the statistical significance of the difference between AUROC values, and as the datasets were partitioned into folds consistently across PPI and PPI+CoA, a paired t-test was used to compare the two cases and two-tailed p-values were reported.”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“We also implemented k-fold (k=7 was chosen for a reasonable test set size, unless otherwise noted) cross-validation in the optimization procedure, and selected the weight ratio that yields the highest mean AUROC across all folds for each condition, to be used for subsequent analyses throughout the manuscript.

Thus, the authors should either limit the claimed discovery to have identified/confirmed the regulatory role of the candidate proteins, or alternatively, add analyses that confirm the druggability and/or show preliminary evidence confirming that CVD-specific disease phenotypes (rather than generic inflammation readouts) in a model system can be modulated specifically via GBP1 and WARS. The authors should also mention whether existing disease gene prioritization approaches would predict the same or different candidate proteins (currently no comparison is shown).</p></disp-quote><p>We use the expression “therapeutic target candidate for CVD” with the assumption that molecules that arise from in silico predictions seeded with known CVD targets and found to play specific regulatory roles in pro-inflammatory macrophage activation are likely to be CVD therapeutic targets.

The multiplicity and density of interactions that interconnect proteins may provide more evidence for a functional association than the shortest path distances alone, and it is unclear whether considering longer-range shortest path distances in the analysis still provides a significant added informative value or rather spurious associations as compared to an association measure purely based on direct connectivity. These points and potential limitations of the used association measure should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>For our study, we chose shortest path related measures as a proxy of association with drug targets, as they are well studied and widely used within the field for disease gene and drug target candidate prioritization. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that they should be compared to global dynamical association measures, as well as other types of network-based distance measures. To explore how sensitive prediction performance and the resulting candidates are to untraversed longer paths, we have considered dynamical prioritization methods such as random walk with restarts (RWR) and its degree-aware version (DADA), as well as other distance-based measures such as the kernel distance. Relying on a random walker, RWR/DADA takes into account all possible paths, including many longer-range paths between a candidate and a target (seed), whereas Kernel distance penalizes paths based on their length using an exponential function. Both of these measures yielded similar results to average shortest path in terms of the AUC, and the improvement with the addition of CoA edges persisted (Figure 2—figure supplement 9A and 9D). Moreover, both the top prioritization and the top combined-ranked proteins significantly overlapped between our method and these additional measures (Figure 2—figure supplement 9B, 9C, 9E and 9F). These results indicate that the improvement of target prediction with context-specific information from co-abundance networks is independent of the prioritization metric used. We have included the related results in the Results section, and in the Materials and methods, as shown below. While the results are similar, we also describe some limitations of the shortest path based approaches in the Discussion section.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Second, to explore how sensitive prediction performance is to untraversed longer-range paths between candidates and drug targets, we have considered global association measures and other types of network-based distance measures.

We have therefore not included these in the list of measures to be compared against.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The article is well written but the Introduction and Discussion are too lengthy. My general concerns relate to:</p><p>1) The authors have not carefully tested for confounding factors that might underlie some if not most of the observed correlations and prediction performances. Do the drug targets show some preferential presence in the co-abundance network versus PPI network and are there any degree differences between drug targets and other proteins in the co-abundance network and/or PPI network? Do co-abundance edges preferentially connect to hubs in the PPI network? If there are biases of these kinds then a random addition of edges to the network as empirical control might not capture this and modifications like adding random edges involving proteins in the co-abundance network would represent a more relevant negative control? To which extent is the definition of your drug targets influenced by network information because a network tool, iCTNet was used? Can this lead to circularity when using these drug targets as seeds in the network proximity approach?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points about possible confounding factors. It is indeed crucial to determine these potential relationships. We have addressed these concerns one by one:</p><p>The proportions of CVD drug targets to non-drug targets in the PPI and co-abundance network were very similar to each other (0.0018 versus 0.0017, respectively), suggesting that there is no preferential presence of drug targets in these networks. We have now added this result in the text.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“The proportions of CVD drug targets to non-drug targets in the PPI and co-abundance network were very similar to each other (0.0018 versus 0.0017, respectively), suggesting that there is no preferential presence of drug targets in either network over the other one.”</p><p>Regarding biases related to degrees: While the degrees of drug targets in the co-abundance networks are not significantly different from the degrees of other proteins in the co-abundance networks, the degrees of drug targets in the PPI network are significantly higher than the degrees of other proteins in the PPI network (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, measuring the tendency of co-abundance edges to connect to hubs in the PPI network, we found that proteins connected by CoA edges (i.e. CoA network nodes) have significantly higher degrees in the PPI network than the other nodes in the PPI network (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Collectively, these results point at a degree bias in the way drug targets and co-abundance edges are connected in the PPI network. We have summarized these results, as shown below.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“In terms of connectivity, the degrees of drug targets were significantly higher than the degrees of other proteins in the PPI network, while there was no significant degree difference between drug targets and other proteins in the co-abundance networks (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). […] Taken together, these results point at a degree bias in the way drug targets and co-abundance edges are connected in the PPI network.”</p><p>To take into account the bias in the connectivity between the co-abundance and PPI networks while prioritizing the entire interactome, we changed the randomization procedure to incorporate degree-preserving randomization. This approach effectively permits us to add randomly selected edges that connected proteins with similar degrees to the proteins in the co-abundance networks. We re-ran the entire workflow with this updated procedure. The degree-preserving random edge addition procedure is now described in the Results and Materials and methods sections, and we have updated Figures 1D and 2D to reflect this change, as well as revised the legend for Figure 2A to refer the reader to the above results.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To control for the degree bias in the connectivity between co-abundance and PPI networks (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-C), we implemented degree-preserving randomization, which ensures the addition of randomly selected edges that connect proteins with similar degrees to the proteins in the co-abundance networks (see Materials and methods).”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“For the addition of random edges used as negative control in the prediction performance assessment, we adopted a degree-preserving randomization strategy. […] Edges were then established between pairs of proteins uniformly randomly picked from their respective degree bin representing a pool of similar degree proteins.”</p><p>Regarding the circularity concern: iCTNet itself is not a network-based method to identify disease genes or drug targets, but rather a heterogeneous network representation of the publicly available information regarding various independent types of interactions such as gene-tissue, drug-disease, miRNA-gene interactions, etc. (9). The drug target information used in our manuscript employs the set of drug-gene and drug-disease interactions in the iCTNet database, which are obtained from the Comparative Toxigenomics Database (CTD) and the DrugBank database. While iCTNet also has protein-protein interactions, they are not used in our study, and in any case they are independent from the drug-gene and drug-disease interactions. Due to this independence between sources and the lack of involvement of protein interactions in the drug-gene and drug-disease, there is no prospect of circularity. We have now clarified this point in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“While the iCTNet database also has protein-protein interactions, they were not used in our study to avoid circularity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that the drug targets are not significantly close to each other in the network, yet, when used in the benchmark of the network proximity algorithm, the performance is good. Don't they have to be close in the network for the algorithm to work? Why use the LCC sometimes and the average shortest path at other times to determine closeness? What is the negative dataset used in the benchmark and can authors plot precision-recall curves as well to provide a better overview on the precision of the predictions? What is the prediction performance of the co-abundance network alone?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to distinguish between the closeness of drug targets to each other and the closeness of target candidates to drug targets. The exploration of the former is related to the question of how clustered together versus dispersed they are around the interactome – or how complete or fragmented the CVD drug target information is in the interactome. The LCC analysis is related to this aspect. As such, the closeness of drug targets to each other does not play a role in the comparison of prediction performance. The latter case, i.e. the closeness of targets candidates to drug targets, is what determines the candidate’s ranking and the resulting ROC curves and prediction performance comparisons. When determining the closeness, always the shortest paths are used. The negative control used to determine the statistical significance of the improvement is the degree-preserved randomly added edges to enable a fair comparison with the co-abundance nodes. We have now expanded upon the above where applicable in the text as well as the sections related to Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“The co-abundance networks spanned a certain portion of the entire PPI network with their edges concentrated on certain regions, while the CVD drug targets were dispersed around the combined PPI, forming a disconnected subnetwork (Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), suggesting the fragmented nature of the CVD drug target information in the interactome.”</p><p>Figure 2A legend:</p><p>“The entire literature curated PPI network with co-abundance edges from all three stimulation conditions, providing a global view of the distribution and connectivity of co-abundance edges and drug targets (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for a quantification of related degree distributions and largest connected component (LCC) sizes). A force-directed layout algorithm was used to visualize the networks.”</p><p>While we recognize that precision-recall curves can be more useful in imbalanced datasets where positives are rare, we chose to present ROC curves to allow for a consistent comparison across different validation datasets, regardless of the ratio of positives (known drug targets) to negatives (non-drug targets, i.e., drug target candidates) in each dataset. This enabled, for instance, the comparison between PPI+CoA and CoA only networks within a dataset, as well as comparisons across different datasets. Nevertheless, for interested readers, we have followed the reviewer’s suggestion and plotted additional precision-recall curves. These are now made available as the right-hand side plots of Figure 2—figure supplements 2, 5 and 7, and the bottom row in Figure 2—figure supplement 6.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>“In addition to ROC curves, we additionally plotted precision-recall curves as they can provide additional information for imbalanced datasets where positives are rare.”</p><p>Finally, we agree that the ROC curves corresponding to the co-abundance networks by themselves are essential for a complete comparison. We have now performed target prioritization on these networks alone and plotted the ROC curves along with the combined networks (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). In line with our expectation that, since co-abundance networks span a certain, biology-specific part of the entire interactome, the co-abundance networks by themselves would not yield a good performance regarding the global prioritization of proteins, the prediction performance of the co-abundance networks was lower than the combined network. This result was also confirmed in the validation datasets (Figure 2—figure supplements 5 and 7). We have added these results in the main text.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“The prediction performance of the combined networks also surpassed those of co-abundance networks alone (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reasoning for why the candidate lists need to be further improved by using expression fold change data are not clear. Is the candidate list based on the network prediction not good enough? Then this can be clearly stated. Why were the candidates GBP1 and WARS picked? Because they show the highest expression fold change among the candidates? How many other proteins show as high or higher fold change justifying that the network prediction &quot;helped&quot; selecting among the differentially expressed genes those that are more close to known drug targets?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the rationale behind the combined ranking should be further clarified and the contributions of each type of ranking should be detailed. We appreciate this important advice.</p><p>After showing that the global ranking of all proteins in the interactome is improved with the addition of co-abundance links, we sought to focus on a much smaller subspace of highly expressed candidates for further validation. This is not to say that proteins highly ranked by prioritization ranking only do not have the potential to be viable drug targets/regulators of macrophage activation. Rather, we chose to add the omics to detect the strongest signals that are also close to drug targets. GBP1 and WARS are indeed strongly induced in terms of fold change. Our final ranking does not, however, reflect the expression ranking directly. To address these questions more concretely, we have therefore conducted analyses to present a “micro” and “macro” view of the ranking process.</p><p>As for the “micro” view, GBP5 and CXCL10 were both higher than GBP1 in terms of expression fold change, but their closeness to drug targets were both lower than GBP1 due to their very low ranking (12978 and 10804, respectively) in the prioritization, therefore they were deprioritized relative to GBP1. Similarly, GBP4, CXCL9, CCL8, TNFAIP6, IFIT2, EDN1, IFIT3, IRF1 all had higher expression than WARS, but their closeness to drug targets were lower than WARS, pushing them lower in the ranks due to their low rankings (12981, 11039, 10649, 10542, 12495, 3853, 5518 and 4007, respectively) in the prioritization. Therefore, these also were deprioritized relative to WARS.</p><p>For the “macro” view, we focused on the three rankings and their relationship, as well as their relative contribution to the combined ranking. To quantify each omics source’s relative contribution to the final ranking, we plotted the ranks of each protein in the final list, according to their combined rank and the three constituent rankings. The combined ranking was positively correlated (as expected) with all separate rankings. While the combined ranking was slightly more driven by the gene expression and protein abundance (Spearman’s Rho=0.64 (p=3.10e-06) for expression FC and Spearman’s Rho=0.67 (p=1.02e-06) for abundance, respectively) the network prioritization ranking was close to them for M(IFNγ) (Spearman’s Rho=0.31 (p=0.041)) (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A) and on par with them for M(IL-4) (Spearman’s Rho=0.60 (p=1.34e-03)) (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). Moreover, each separate ranking was orthogonal to each other, showing no correlation among themselves (Spearman’s Rho ranging between -0.074 and 0.097 (p&gt;0.05)) (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). Taken together, these results suggested that network-based prioritization ranking contributes in a non-trivial way to the combined ranking, and that each ranking carries its own information, contributing uniquely to the combined ranking. We have now added these results and incorporated the related discussion in the main text. We have also expanded the description of and the rationale behind the combined filtering/ranking approach.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“In a similar vein, we sought to integrate our protein abundance data with previously published gene expression data from human macrophages (10) to refine our list of prioritized proteins and focus on a much smaller subspace of highly expressed candidates for further in vitro validation.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“The filtering step was used to intersect the network-based prioritization ranking with the highly expressed molecules from -omics data to detect the strongest signals that were also close to drug targets. The ranking scheme considered (a) the network closeness to drug targets, (b) the relative protein abundance difference with respect to baseline M(-) over all time points, and (c) the gene expression fold change with respect to baseline M(-) from human macrophage transcriptome data, and calculated a combined score based on these three criteria (Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1, see Materials and methods)”.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To quantify each constituent ranking’s relative contribution to the final ranking, we investigated the correlations between them. […] Together, these results suggest that network-based prioritization ranking contributes in a non-trivial way to the combined ranking, and that each ranking carries its own information, contributing uniquely to the combined ranking.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To my non-expert understanding of the immune system, the experiments validate the function of the candidate genes in inflammation/immune response but that was an obvious hypothesis given their up-regulation in expression? How do these experiments validate the concept of using network proximity to drug targets to find new candidates? It remains unclear how the modulation of inflammation biomarkers by the candidates relates to CVD. Contrary to statements in the discussion, I cannot find experimental validation of mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the in vitro experiments were aimed at establishing the regulatory role of GBP1 and WARS in pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Although systems approaches facilitate target discovery, we are aware that increased or decreased genes or proteins identified by unbiased screening may not necessarily play causal roles. The expression levels of certain proteins, including GBP1 and WARS, increase during activation of human macrophages, as gauged by induction of pro-inflammatory molecules, but these molecules may not contribute to this phenotypic switch. We thus performed loss-of-function experiments using siRNA silencing for GBP1 and WARS. In addition, such validation experiments are also critical to examine whether our systems approach can provide biologically meaningful results. To do this, we chose GBP1 and WARS as examples.</p><p>Inflammation plays important roles in the development and complications of atherosclerotic diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction). Despite extensive studies on vascular diseases and the development of various potent drugs, particularly lipid lowering statins, many patients still suffer with complications of inflammatory vascular diseases. Such residual risk is a global health burden. This clinical unmet need has driven active target discovery efforts to explore new mechanisms for inflammation beyond modifiable risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia) and translate new findings into the clinic. The present study thus aimed to explore molecules that promote pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages using unbiased proteomics. To select promising targets, we used computational prediction that linked GBP1 and WARS with cardiovascular diseases. in vitro validation experiments, using the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1 and human primary macrophages, demonstrated that GBP1 and WARS indeed regulate macrophage activation.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer, however, that these points should be made clear in the text, and the discussion regarding potential therapeutic targets should be broadened to include other possible inflammatory diseases.
