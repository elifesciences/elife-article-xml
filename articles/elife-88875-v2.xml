biomolecules leading to genetic aberration and protein misfolding. Hence, RCS levels are crucial indicators in the progression of various pathological diseases. Besides the glyoxalase system, emerging studies report highly conserved DJ-1 superfamily proteins as critical regulators of RCS. DJ-1 superfamily proteins, including the human DJ-1, a genetic determinant of Parkinson’s disease, possess diverse physiological functions paramount for combating multiple stressors. Although <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> retains four DJ-1 orthologs (Hsp31, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34), their physiological relevance and collective requirement remain obscure. Here, we report for the first time that the yeast DJ-1 orthologs function as novel enzymes involved in the preferential scavenge of glyoxal and methylglyoxal, toxic metabolites, and genotoxic agents. Their collective loss stimulates chronic glycation of the proteome, and nucleic acids, inducing spectrum of genetic mutations and reduced mRNA translational efficiency. Furthermore, the Hsp31 paralogs efficiently repair severely glycated macromolecules derived from carbonyl modifications. Also, their absence elevates DNA damage response, making cells vulnerable to various genotoxins. Interestingly, yeast DJ-1 orthologs preserve functional mitochondrial content, maintain ATP levels, and redistribute into mitochondria to alleviate the glycation damage of macromolecules. Together, our study uncovers a novel glycation repair pathway in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and a possible neuroprotective mechanism of how hDJ-1 confers mitochondrial health during glycation toxicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast Hsp31</kwd><kwd>DJ-1 family proteins</kwd><kwd>DNA glycation</kwd><kwd>deglycation repair</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial glycation</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial dysfunction</kwd><kwd>Dicarbonyl stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2018/001988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Silva</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SR/FST/LSII045/2016-G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Silva</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR27952/IN/22/212/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Silva</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yeast DJ-1 homologs are molecular erasers of glycation adducts on cellular macromolecules and preserve mitochondrial health through redistributing into mitochondria under elevated carbonyl stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The structural and functional integrity of nucleic acids and proteins is critical for establishing a physiological balance to maintain normal cellular health. Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) are highly toxic compounds that covalently bind and damage vital cellular components such as protein, DNA, and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semchyshyn, 2014</xref>). RCS primarily constitutes methylglyoxal (MG), glyoxal (GO), and 3-deoxyglucosone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semchyshyn, 2014</xref>). The MG and GO are metabolic by-products of reactive aldehyde and ketones, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allaman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 2012</xref>). At the basal physiological level, these dicarbonyls participate in numerous signaling processes essential for cellular development and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodrigues et al., 2020</xref>). On the contrary, MG and GO modifies the thiol and amine groups at elevated levels through the Maillard reaction, forming a myriad of irreversible intermediates followed by stable Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semchyshyn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thornalley, 2008</xref>). They preferentially form adducts with side chains of arginine, lysine, and cysteine and indiscriminately impair the structure and function of proteins. Moreover, the glycation of essential proteins, including antioxidant machinery, can alter reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, mitochondrial performance, and proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goudarzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seo et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, chronic exposure of nucleic acids to RCS culminates into nucleotide AGEs that promote genetic aberrations and translational defects and induce a spectrum of mutations, including transition and G: C to T: A transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murata-Kamiya et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murata-Kamiya et al., 2000</xref>). Elevated glycation of protein and DNA has implications for several pathologies like diabetes, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fournet et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, regulating endogenous RCS and minimizing its detrimental effects on biomolecules is critically important. The glyoxalase system that constitutes glyoxalase I and II efficiently detoxifies MG and GO to D-lactate and glycolate by utilizing glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inoue et al., 2011</xref>). Since excess levels of carbonyls concomitantly induce ROS, the GSH pool is rapidly depleted during the anti-oxidation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bari et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, cells have evolved GSH independent pathway (glyoxalase III system) to maintain a healthy redox balance, primarily comprising DJ-1/ThiJ/Pfp1 superfamily proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bankapalli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melvin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>DJ-1 superfamily members are highly conserved, multi-stress responding, and ubiquitously present in most organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandyopadhyay and Cookson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). The superfamily includes human DJ-1(hDJ-1/<italic>PARK7</italic>), a well-explored protein that induces a familial form of Parkinson’s disease (PD) through its genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifati et al., 2003</xref>). Besides having various neuroprotective functions, hDJ-1 possesses methylglyoxalase and glyoxalase activity that substantially modulates endogenous carbonyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the deletion of <italic>E. coli</italic> DJ-1 members exhibited alterations in the glycation of DNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richarme et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has four homologs of DJ-1, namely Hsp31, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34, representing Hsp31 mini-family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 share ~99.5% sequence identity within them and ~70% sequence identity with Hsp31. All the paralogs possess a common catalytic triad constituting Cys138, His139, and Glu170. A characteristic hallmark of DJ-1 superfamily members is the redox-sensing catalytic cysteine, whose oxidation state determines the physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson, 2011</xref>). The emerging evidence on bacteria, humans, and plant DJ-1 members reveals a unique deglycase machinery that relieves the MG and GO glycation adducts on DNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prasad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richarme et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). This repair mechanism is further appreciated in preventing protein aggregation and altering the epigenetic landscape of the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Some <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hsp31 members are reported to possess crucial functions in regulating ROS, mitochondrial dynamics, and chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aslam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bankapalli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller-Fleming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>). However, the biological relevance of having multiple DJ-1 orthologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is poorly understood due to the lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence and difficulties in targeting specific paralog as they are genetically almost identical.</p><p>In the current report, we have uncovered a primary role of the Hsp31 paralogs as glyoxalases and protectants of the genome and mitochondria against RCS. By, governing endogenous dicarbonyl levels, they prevent macromolecular glycation and abrogate genetic mutations. In response to glycation stress, mRNA translation activity was significantly reduced in the absence of yeast DJ-1 members. Furthermore, the novel deglycase machinery efficiently repairs glycated DNA and proteins, substantially reverting deleterious alterations on biomolecules. We also show that Hsp31 paralogs impart enhanced mitochondrial integrity by maintaining functional mitochondria content, sustained ATP levels, and attenuating glycation stress on mitochondria through redistribution. Together, the dual role is critical in providing multifaceted protection to cellular and organellar macromolecules during persistent carbonyl stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of Hsp31 paralogs aggravates carbonyl toxicity and induces proteome glycation</title><p>The DJ-1 superfamily members strongly relate to regulating dicarbonyl stress primarily through scavenging excess intracellular MG and GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subedi et al., 2011</xref>). However, despite being conserved, the biological significance of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hsp31 paralogs is uncharacterized in the presence of carbonyl toxicity. Although the paralogs have very similar amino acid sequences, we utilized the ease of genetic manipulation in yeast to unravel their association with the homeostasis of RCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hsp31 paralogs were sequentially deleted in the WT background in multiple combinations such as Δ<italic>hsp31</italic> (Δ<italic>31</italic>) to Δ<italic>hsp34</italic> (Δ<italic>34</italic>), Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>32</italic> to Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>34</italic>, Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>32</italic>Δ<italic>33</italic> (Δ<italic>T),</italic> and Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>32</italic>Δ<italic>33</italic>Δ<italic>34</italic> (Δ<italic>Q</italic>) which simplifies the comprehensive understanding of the individual genes. As glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) extensively modulates endogenous RCS levels, Δ<italic>glo1</italic> strain was used for comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>). Phenotypic analyses under GO stress revealed a mild growth sensitivity in single deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref><italic>, compare panels glyoxal (GO) with control</italic>), and the viability was further affected in Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>32,</italic> Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>33,</italic> and Δ<italic>31</italic>Δ<italic>34</italic>. Interestingly, Δ<italic>T and</italic> Δ<italic>Q</italic> displayed synergistic worsening of growth compared to other strains, inferring their additive overlapping functions during GO toxicity. Subsequently, the effect of MG stress was tested in the deletion background of Hsp31 members.

To determine the GO and MG-induced alterations<italic>,</italic> anti-CML (carboxymethyl-lysine) and anti-MAGE (methylglyoxal AGE) antibodies were utilized to determine the intermediates of AGEs, respectively. The basal physiological glycation levels (absence of glycation stress) in Δ<italic>Q</italic> strain displayed an increment in GO-modified proteins compared to Δ<italic>glo1</italic> strain suggesting Hsp31 paralogs are essential for the RCS detoxification <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). However, such basal glycation levels are tolerable to the cells without exhibiting growth sensitivity. Intriguingly, upon subjecting to additional external glycation stress, a significant elevation of CML levels was observed in the single mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At the same time, the deletion of additional members substantially further exacerbated the modifications. It cumulatively enhanced the protein glycation levels to a greater extent in Δ<italic>T and ΔQ</italic> than Δ<italic>glo1,</italic> consistent with growth sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast<italic>,</italic> the effect of MG-induced glycation was restricted to Δ<italic>31</italic> with a subtle increment of MAGE levels compared to WT, consistent with growth sensitivity in the presence of MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> <italic>and compare growth in the last panels,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This preliminary data demonstrate that yeast DJ-1 members act on specific RCS and collectively provide superior tolerance towards GO toxicity than the GLO1.

Therefore, it is critical to study whether Hsp31 paralogs confer the glycation repair of proteins. To determine the deglycase property, human Sod1, and Lysozyme were pre-treated without or with GO separately for 2 hr to form glycation adducts. The reaction mixture was diluted 6-fold and incubated for 3 hr with purified Hsp31 members or BSA (negative control) (<italic>Experimental scheme;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunodetection by anti-CML antibody to confirm the degree of glycation. All the Hsp31 members exhibited robust deglycase activity, as the paralogs extensively reverted the glycation damage of proteins, unlike GO and BSA controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). On the other hand, the active site mutation (C138A) in paralogs was tested to verify deglycase enzyme activity further. The active site mutants failed to relieve the glycation adducts on DNA and proteins, thus establishing the specificity of the deglycase action of Hsp31 paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><p>As GO is known to induce random mutations that severely impair genome integrity, we scored the glycation-induced conversions at the DNA level to investigate the impact of glyoxalase and deglycase activity of Hsp31 paralogs on genome protection. Strains lacking Hsp31 paralogs were subjected to GO treatment, and mutation frequency was determined by amplifying specific genes such as mitochondrial-encoded (<italic>cox2</italic>) and nuclear-encoded (<italic>sod1</italic> and <italic>rad14</italic>), which have vital <italic>in vivo</italic> functions. Due to the loss of Hsp31 paralogs, the Δ<italic>Q</italic> strain exhibited enhanced mutation frequency as determined by cox2, sod1, and rad14 gene sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, due to robust intrinsic glyoxalase and deglycase activity associated with the paralogs, the overexpression of Hsp31, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 significantly attenuated the mutation frequency of all the genes tested, further highlighting their physiological role in the maintenance of genome integrity under the GO toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>To further establish their role in offering genome integrity, WT and Δ<italic>Q</italic> strains were exposed to well-known genotoxic agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydroxyurea (HU). The Δ<italic>Q</italic> strain showed severe growth sensitivity towards MMS and HU treatment compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with GO and genotoxins combined showed a synergistic increment in the growth sensitivity of Δ<italic>Q</italic> compared to their individual treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These genotoxins induce DNA lesions and strand breaks, which could be monitored by the expression of DNA damage response genes such as RNR3 (subunit of RiboNucleotide Reductase) that specifically upregulates during genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, Δ<italic>Q</italic> exhibited a notable increase in the expression of RNR3 compared to WT cells treated with MMS and GO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Besides RNR3, multiple DNA repair proteins, including RAD52, assemble at the strand break regions. Hence, the formation of RAD52-GFP foci indicates the extent of DNA damage in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conde and San-Segundo, 2008</xref>).

The immunoblots indicate a 2-3 fold enrichment of Hsp31 in mitochondria upon exposure to MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 do not display mitochondrial redistribution under MG toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), further emphasizing that Hsp31 and not its paralogs respond and mitigate broader stress conditions. Tim23 and Ydj-1 were probed for mitochondrial and cytosol control proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>To understand the relevance of GO-dependent mitochondrial translocation of Hsp31 paralogs, mitochondria were isolated from cells supplemented with GO to analyze the altered glycation of mitochondrial macromolecules.

Since the Hsp31 paralogs govern the glycation of mitochondrial macromolecules, we studied mitochondrial health by determining the viability of deletion strains of yeast DJ-1 members on a non-fermentable carbon source (glycerol).

As the glycation affected the mitochondrial morphology, we examined the impact on total and functional mitochondrial content through flow cytometric analysis using NAO and TMRE dyes, respectively. In the absence of GO stress, Δ<italic>Q</italic> showed an increase in overall mitochondrial content than WT, possibly due to hyperfusion of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Although the mass of mitochondria remained almost similar in WT, an increase in total mitochondrial content was found in Δ<italic>Q</italic> upon GO stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Next, functional mitochondrial mass was determined through TMRE dye, we observed comparable functional mitochondria in WT treated and untreated, while a significant loss of functional mitochondria was noted in Δ<italic>Q</italic> under glycation toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments firmly establish the specificity of Hsp31 paralogs towards GO substrates, while Hsp31 alone detoxifies both MG and GO. Since Hsp32 and Hsp34 are structurally uncharacterized, we considered overlapping structural features with Hsp33 for comparative analysis due to its solved crystal structure and close sequence similarity. Strikingly, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 possess a similar active site offering different substrate specificity than Hsp31. Such preferential scavenging of carbonyls is also observed in bacteria and plant DJ-1 members where YajL, ElbB, <italic>At</italic>DJ-1A, and <italic>At</italic>DJ-1B are GO specific, and some orthologs detoxify both substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Although MG and GO are detoxified through distinct pathways, certain NADPH-dependent enzymes like aldehyde dehydrogenase and aldose reductase scavenge both the carbonyls, with their activities stringently governed by cellular redox status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vander Jagt and Hunsaker, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to MG catabolism, the primary antioxidant GSH inefficiently reacts with GO making it a poor substrate for the GLO1 glyoxalase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has bonafide multiple DJ-1 orthologs, and their steady-state levels are rapidly upregulated in response to GO allowing efficient carbonyl homeostasis. Our results highlight that the deletion of individual paralogs shows moderate sensitivity for GO. However, the collective loss of yeast DJ-1 orthologs (Δ<italic>Q</italic>) renders severe growth deficiency more than Δ<italic>glo1</italic>. At the same time, their absence promotes severe accumulation of toxic carbonyls leading to a higher fold macromolecular glycation than Δ<italic>glo1</italic>. Besides scavenging RCS, Hsp31 is also reported to provide partial tolerance toward acetic acid stress, also a deleterious glycolytic intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Natkańska et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that Hsp31 members are paramount in regulating a broad group of toxic metabolites compared to the GLO system (1 and 2), which is restricted to specific carbonyls. Moreover, under oxidative damage, the activity of the GLO system (1 and 2) is impaired due to extensive utilization of the limiting pool of GSH. In contrast, the GSH-independent Hsp31 paralogs aid in restoring redox balance and simultaneously provide robust RCS homeostasis, hence, indispensable for cellular viability under carbonyl stress.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Global surveillance of nucleic acid glycation by yeast DJ-1 orthologs regulates the genome integrity</title><p>Despite several harmful effects, the physiological amounts of glycation are critical for post-translation modification, required for signaling in numerous pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodrigues et al., 2020</xref>).

Such non-enzymatic covalent epigenetic modifications regulate stress adaptations by altering chromatin architecture and gene expression. We highlight that Hsp31 paralogs are essential repair enzymes that regulate the degree of nucleic acid glycation by indirectly detoxifying the carbonyls or directly removing adducts by deglycation. This corroborates well with the idea that Hsp31 paralogs preserve genome integrity by lowering deleterious mutations as a counter-response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Also, the absence of paralogs elicits enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage stress when exposed to multiple genotoxins, as indicated by enriched expression of RNR3 and RAD52 foci formation, suggesting their strong association with genome maintenance. At the molecular level, the antiglycation property of the paralogs could also prevent the replication stress by replenishing repaired dNTP pool. Hsp31 members are widely recognized for metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming during the diauxic shift as they extensively tune the expression of necessary proteins for rapid acclimatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller-Fleming et al., 2014</xref>).

Under physiological conditions, glycation on arginine, lysine, and cysteine modulates the functional diversity of various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). We show that the absence of Hsp31 paralogs triggers severe glycation of the proteome, which may contribute to protein aggregation, misfolding, and cross-linking. Furthermore, under these circumstances, the conventional proteasomal degradation pathway fails to provide quality turnover resulting in AGE accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raupbach et al., 2020</xref>). As a compensatory response mechanism, amino acid biosynthesis and protein translation were upregulated in the single deletions of Hsp31 mini-family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller-Fleming et al., 2014</xref>). This primarily indicates the biogenesis of functional proteins to promote cell survival during glycation stress. Therefore, scavenging excess endogenous RCS by the Hsp31 paralogs is imperative to evade persistent glycation and maintain balanced proteostasis. Besides, their robust deglycase activity repairs severely glycated proteins from different cellular compartments, including mitochondria. This enables cells to efficiently reutilize the cellular proteome pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

In a previous report, we showed the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology by regulating the fusion-fission network by Hsp31 and Hsp34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bankapalli et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we provide evidence of mitochondrial maintenance by yeast DJ-1 orthologs, effectively through global regulation of glycation stress and attenuation of glycation damage on mitochondrial macromolecules. Interestingly, Hsp31 members redistribute into mitochondria in response to carbonyl toxicity that may substantially lower the glycation of mitochondrial proteome and DNA, contributing to enhanced mitochondrial survival. Moreover, the mitochondrial translocation of the paralogs could elevate the glycolate synthesis from glyoxal, a critical antioxidant that maintains mitochondrial membrane potential during stress conditions and re-establishes redox balance by producing GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toyoda et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, under carbonyl stress, their absence leads to the accumulation of fragmented and dysfunctional mitochondria, significantly attenuating the availability of the ATP pool and contributing to detrimental mitochondrial health. The dysfunctional mitochondria are accompanied by poor maintenance of mitochondrial DNA quality, which may further suppress the activity of mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory complexes leading to compromised ATP generation. These pathogenic alterations of mitochondria are central to neurodegeneration and the rapid progression of PD.</p><p>Besides impaired carbonyl homeostasis, a major contributor to PD progression is α-synuclein toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>). Its physiological role involves interaction with mitochondrial complex I and ATP synthase. However, MG glycated α-synuclein forms cytotoxic oligomers, which may induce mitophagy and mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faustini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vicente Miranda et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, cells rely on DJ-1 member proteins that possess glyoxalase and deglycases to abrogate the toxic accumulation of glycated products. Our findings highlight a possible neuroprotective function of PD-associated hDJ-1 involving the repair of damaged macromolecules and mitochondrial quanlity control, promoting healthy maintenance of neuronal cells with intrinsically higher levels of RCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angeloni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings significantly contribute to understanding the diversified response by Hsp31 paralogs in the field of carbonyl biology.

Although Hsp31 paralogs display stress-induced mitochondrial redistribution, their translocation pathway is poorly studied.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> DJ-1 paralogs maintain genome integrity through glycation repair of nucleic acids and proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carlo Vascotto (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agree that in its current form the manuscript requires major revisions to strengthen the aspects that are new in this work, which will likely take considerably longer than a few months. The list of critical comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript is appended below. Given the high interest in the topic and the potential of the findings, we encourage you to consider <italic>eLife</italic> for the submission of a more mature version of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Susarala and colleagues attempted to uncover the functional importance of 4 human DJ-1 paralogs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. By utilizing yeast strains lacking different combinations of these paralogs and by re-introducing them individually via overexpression, they unequivocally answer the role of these DJ-1 homologs in protecting against different forms of glycation damage. Furthermore, their study offers mechanistic insight into how these paralogs both neutralize reactive carbonyl species and reverse glycation damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins. Finally, they show that these paralogs translocate to mitochondria during glycation stress, illustrating the important role of these homologs in protecting mitochondria from reactive carbonyl species.</p><p>Thus, this study firmly establishes the physiological role of the 4 yeast DJ-1 homologs Hsp31, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34. While these results have implications for how proteostatic stress is mitigated and proteostasis is maintained in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, they lack direct translatability to various disease models in which DJ-1 is suspected to play a physiological role. Moreover, the translocation of the paralogs to mitochondria during reactive carbonyl species stress is an interesting observation, but further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic importance of this process in different disease models.</p><p>1. For Figure 1A, given the translocation of the paralogs to mitochondria during glycation stress, it would be interesting to observe the growth of these strains on a non-fermentable carbon source.</p><p>2. For Figure 2J, why are the RNA glycation damage values for the various Hsp knockout strains significantly lower than Δ31 in Figure 2I? Given that these figures concern methylglyoxal-induced damage, shouldn't we expect the values to be more similar?</p><p>3. The in vitro activity assays are very well done, but it is the opinion of this reviewer that the results of the C138A mutants do not add significantly to the overall story. Perhaps these data are better suited for the supplement?</p><p>4. The confocal images in Figures 5I, 7, and 7-supplement 1 would benefit from the inclusion of rigorous quantification to show RAD52 foci formation and percent co-localization of the paralogs to mitochondria.</p><p>5. It is the opinion of the reviewer that the manuscript would benefit if Figure 7 —figure supplement 1 was somehow included in the main figure. Furthermore, it would be helpful if in the supplement it was shown that Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 do not translocate to mitochondria during methylglyoxal stress.</p><p>6. In the first paragraph of the discussion, you mention that Hsp33 has a different active site than Hsp31. Do you instead mean that Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 all have the same active site and that only Hsp31 has a different active site?</p><p>7. Lines 497-498 would benefit from the addition of citations.</p><p>8. On line 509, what do you mean by &quot;stabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential&quot;? Additional clarification and/or rephrasing would be helpful.</p><p>9. On lines 513-516, you highlight that the potential translocation of DJ-1 to mitochondria may help delay the progression of Parkinson's disease by attenuating glycation damage. However, this point warrants additional discussion and citations concerning how this may impact interactions of α-synuclein with mitochondria, and further how this may be important for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>10. On line 519, I would argue that the claim of conferring cytoprotection by preserving organellar integrity is unsubstantiated by the current study.</p><p>11. Lines 520-522 require citations.</p><p>12. It is the opinion of this reviewer that the Discussion section of this manuscript would benefit from the inclusion of a paragraph discussing both the limitations of the current study and potential avenues for follow-up studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>With this study, Susarla et al. investigate a previously neglected family of yeast enzymes belonging to the DJ -1 superfamily of proteins. In particular, the authors focus on Hsp31 paralogs, which play a leading role in controlling the glycation of proteins and nucleic acids. The manuscript is logically organized and easy to read. The methodological approaches chosen are appropriate, and the data are presented logically and coherently, largely supporting the hypothesis.</p><p>The weaknesses that I noticed relate to:</p><p>1. The mitochondrial function of these proteins is not fully and adequately supported by the data presented.</p><p>2. Some controls necessary to support the experimental approach are missing.</p><p>3. The discrepancy between some images and the relative densitometric analysis.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript has a high degree of novelty, and the new findings greatly expand the current knowledge in the field.</p><p>Although the reported data are convincing, I think the authors should consider the following points to improve the quality of their work:</p><p>1. The impact of the results on mitochondrial maintenance is limited and not properly supported.</p><p>2. In Figure 7E, there are no markers showing that the analysis was performed on isolated mitochondria. The author should include at least one mitochondrial marker protein.</p><p>3. The sentence on page 21, line 505 &quot;Interestingly, translocation of Hsp31 members into mitochondria substantially lowers the glycation of mitochondrial proteome and DNA,…&quot; I cannot find any data showing a decrease in mtDNA glycation levels. The authors should measure the glycation level of isolated mtDNA under ΔQ and Hsp31 overexpression conditions.</p><p>4. Figure 2 G, H: I found no agreement between the image and relative densitometric analysis. e.g.: in panel G, the glycation level of DNA is reported to be 40-fold higher in Dglo1 than in WT. In panel I, an 8-fold increase is reported, but looking at the picture, it looks much more. The same is true for the other two panels (H and J). I also notice a discrepancy between the image and the bar graph in Figure 4C. The signal in samples 32 and 33 seems to me to be stronger than that in ΔQ. Since this is a representative image of biological replicates, it should also be representative of the data reported in the densitometric analysis. The authors should revise these data.</p><p>5. In Figure 3A-B, the authors use recombinant proteins to measure the enzymatic activities and kinetic parameters of Hsp31 paralogs. I suggest including a picture of an SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant proteins used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors were trying to explore the mechanism of action of the DJ-1 paralogs Hsp31, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 and whether there may be differences between these highly similar orthologs. They did a good job of showing that while for reactive carbonyl species, glyoxal, they behave similarly, but, for methylglyoxal, only Hsp31 was able to revert this damage.</p><p>My main criticism of the work is that for many of the other conclusions it is unclear how much this advances the field over previous work already published by this group and others. They have already previously published that Hsp31 has robust glyoxalase activity (Bankapalli et al. 2015). While others have shown that DJ-1 and its bacterial homologs can repair glycated nucleic acids and proteins (Richarme et al. 2017, Richarme et al. 2018). While an argument could be made that it is unclear if human DJ-1 and Hsp31 would have the same activity, they also previously showed that human DJ-1 can complement hsp31∆ (Bankapalli et al. 2015). They also mention how distribution to the mitochondria can alleviate glycation damage, but they already showed that DJ-1 orthologs redistribute to the mitochondria during stress (Bankapalli et al. 2015).</p><p>Another criticism is that some of their findings are overstated relative to the data they show here.</p><p>&quot;…the glycation of RNA significantly reduced mRNA translation activity in the absence of yeast DJ-1 members&quot;. This is not directly shown. While they do see reduced mRNA translation activity while they see increased glycation of RNA, they have also shown that there are many levels of stress response induced by this treatment (DNA damage, mitochondrial stress). As a reduction of translation initiation is a common occurrence from a variety of stresses, it is unclear that it can be concluded that the reduced translational activity is due directly to the glycation of RNA and not a general stress response of the cell.</p><p>&quot;DJ-1 orthologs provide robust organellar protection by redistributing into mitochondria to alleviate the glycation damage of mitochondrial DNA and proteins.&quot; &quot;Here, we provide direct evidence of mitochondrial maintenance by yeast DJ-1 orthologs, effectively through robust redistribution under glycation stress.&quot; I would disagree that they show direct evidence that redistribution is necessary for the protective effects they see. While it is shown that these proteins relocalize to the mitochondria, it isn't shown that relocalization is required to protect the mitochondrial proteins. It could be that the glyoxalase-driven reduction of these reactive carbonyl species is sufficient to protect the mitochondria without translocation to the mitochondria.</p><p>To directly show that mitochondrial localization of Hsp31 is necessary to protect the mitochondria, the authors should repress relocalization to the mitochondria and test the effects on mitochondrial proteins. Do these proteins have a mitochondrial targeting sequence? What is known about how these proteins are targeted to the mitochondria?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> DJ-1 paralogs maintain genome integrity through glycation repair of nucleic acids and proteins&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Specifically, reviewer 1 requests further improvements as outlined below, which may be addressed by text changes or experimentally, upon the authors' decision, and described in the point-by-point response.</p><p>However, it is critical that the authors thoroughly address points no 4 and 5.</p><p>Altogether, as you will see from the appended comments, the reviewers are impressed by the largely improved version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. First, I thank the authors for their thorough and thoughtful replies to our original critiques. I feel they have done an excellent job fully addressing our concerns, and I believe the manuscript is greatly strengthened as a result.</p><p>2. In Figure 8B, NAO is used to stain the total mitochondrial mass +/- GO treatment. Is it known whether or not the loss of Hsp31-34 paralogs has any effect on cardiolipin levels, which may affect the measurement of mitochondrial mass? Did you try using MitoTracker, or another membrane potential-independent dye?</p><p>3. In Figure 8D, you measure mitochondrial ATP levels after GO treatment. Of course, AAC would be exporting ATP during the isolation procedure. Have you attempted to instead measure cellular ATP levels after GO treatment, perhaps in a media with a non-fermentable carbon source?</p><p>4. In some of the figures, the number of independent biological replicates is listed (i.e., n = 3). However, other figures, such as Figure 5 and Figure 5-supplement 1, it is missing. Furthermore, for Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, it is unclear if the quantification from multiple images (&gt; 3) is from one or more independent biological replicates. The review would find it helpful if all figures list the number of independent biological replicates performed.</p><p>5. Lastly, for Figure 8—figure supplement 1, in the text you mention that mitochondrial health is compromised in δ Q, but δ T also shows impaired growth on a non-fermentable carbon source.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>They have improved the manuscript by including data that loss of the Hsp31 paralogs induced reduced growth in respiratory conditions as well as that loss of the paralogs leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation. The authors have also improved their manuscript by reducing some of the claims they were making.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately addressed all the issues/concerns raised by the three reviewers and have implemented the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>In my opinion, the topic is relevant and the data presented are of high quality, compelling, and overall add to the current knowledge of DJ-1 orthologs as detoxifying enzymes against lesions caused by reactive carbonyl species on nucleic acids and proteins. As is often the case, new information on molecular mechanisms raises further questions, such as the molecular mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial transport or the relevance to human studies, but these could be addressed in future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88875.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We agree that the emerging functions of Hsp31 paralogs are fascinating and need further examination in human DJ-1 with desired model organisms to reveal its physiological significance. However, our study provides a possible mechanism of how human DJ-1 contributes to cellular protection during carbonyl toxicity. Indeed, the translocation of Hsp31 paralogs into mitochondria is interesting. Further experiments need to be performed to better understand the diverse response of DJ-1 and its mechanism to support mitochondrial health.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For Figure 1A, given the translocation of the paralogs to mitochondria during glycation stress, it would be interesting to observe the growth of these strains on a non-fermentable carbon source.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

We have now included the western analysis of mitochondria used in Figure 7E to show its purity and quality.

The sentence on page 21, line 505 &quot;Interestingly, translocation of Hsp31 members into mitochondria substantially lowers the glycation of mitochondrial proteome and DNA,…&quot; I cannot find any data showing a decrease in mtDNA glycation levels. The authors should measure the glycation level of isolated mtDNA under ΔQ and Hsp31 overexpression conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions. The glycation levels of mtDNA under ΔQ and Hsp31 overexpression conditions were measured from purified mitochondria, and the data (refer to Figure 7G) has been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2 G, H: I found no agreement between the image and relative densitometric analysis. e.g.: in panel G, the glycation level of DNA is reported to be 40-fold higher in Dglo1 than in WT. In panel I, an 8-fold increase is reported, but looking at the picture, it looks much more. The same is true for the other two panels (H and J). I also notice a discrepancy between the image and the bar graph in Figure 4C. The signal in samples 32 and 33 seems to me to be stronger than that in ΔQ. Since this is a representative image of biological replicates, it should also be representative of the data reported in the densitometric analysis. The authors should revise these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inconvenience due to densitometric discrepancies. In the current manuscript, we have re-quantitated the western blots and revised all the densitometric graphs, whose values are now comparable to representative images.

In Figure 3A-B, the authors use recombinant proteins to measure the enzymatic activities and kinetic parameters of Hsp31 paralogs.

They did a good job of showing that while for reactive carbonyl species, glyoxal, they behave similarly, but, for methylglyoxal, only Hsp31 was able to revert this damage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the work and describing the key highlights of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My main criticism of the work is that for many of the other conclusions it is unclear how much this advances the field over previous work already published by this group and others. They have already previously published that Hsp31 has robust glyoxalase activity (Bankapalli et al. 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical analysis. The key highlights of the present study show are listed below for the first time.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We examined the enzymatic properties of the unexplored members of Hsp31 minifamily proteins, where Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 possess glyoxalase activity. At the same time, Hsp31 has glyoxalase and methylglyoxalase activity, suggesting that multiple paralogs of DJ-1 could aid enhanced protection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We show that the absence of yeast DJ-1 members induces severe glycation of DNA, RNA, and protein, along with reduced mRNA translation activity under carbonyl stress.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our studies indicate that DJ-1 members are involved in genome maintenance as their disruption upregulates DNA damage response and enhances mutation frequency.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our report provides evidence of glycation repair pathways in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Furthermore, the paralogs have substrate preference enabling Hsp31 to deglycate methylglyoxal and glyoxal glycated macromolecules, while Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34 are specific to glyoxal glycated substrates.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For the first time, we show that yeast DJ-1 members translocate into mitochondria during carbonyl stress. They also influence global mitochondrial content and ATP levels during glycation toxicity.</p></list-item></list><p>The reviewer refers to (Bankapalli et al.) where authors discovered methylglyoxalase activity of Hsp31 alone and its role in oxidative stress. In the current report, we have investigated more comprehensively the physiological relevance of the unexplored members (Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34) of Hsp31 paralogs in protection against glycation stress essentially through enzymatic functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While others have shown that DJ-1 and its bacterial homologs can repair glycated nucleic acids and proteins (Richarme et al. 2017, Richarme et al. 2018). While an argument could be made that it is unclear if human DJ-1 and Hsp31 would have the same activity, they also previously showed that human DJ-1 can complement hsp31∆ (Bankapalli et al. 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable response. Although human DJ-1 and Hsp31 share partial functional conservation under oxidative stress, as reported by Bankapalli et al. 2015, very few studies were performed to understand the role of human DJ-1 under carbonyl stress and its implications in mitochondrial functioning. The absence of Hsp31 paralogs collectively induces glycation damage of macromolecules and promotes mitochondrial impairments through altered mitochondrial morphology, loss of functional mitochondria, and depleted ATP levels. Refer to Figure 8.</p><p>In summary, our report gives insights into how hDJ-1 could govern cellular and organellar health during carbonyl toxicity, a leading factor for the progression of Parkinson’s disease. Human DJ-1 possibly contributes through reverting glycation damage of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Further, it might translocate into mitochondria under carbonyl stress to abrogate glyoxal toxicity and maintain functional mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also mention how distribution to the mitochondria can alleviate glycation damage, but they already showed that DJ-1 orthologs redistribute to the mitochondria during stress (Bankapalli et al. 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the response. The authors from Bankapalli et al. 2015 investigated the redistribution of Hsp31 alone into mitochondria during oxidative stress. On the other hand, our report highlights the mitochondrial translocation of all the Hsp31 members in response to glycation toxicity, together alleviating the glycation damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another criticism is that some of their findings are overstated relative to the data they show here.</p><p>&quot;the glycation of RNA significantly reduced mRNA translation activity in the absence of yeast DJ-1 members&quot;. This is not directly shown. While they do see reduced mRNA translation activity while they see increased glycation of RNA, they have also shown that there are many levels of stress response induced by this treatment (DNA damage, mitochondrial stress). As a reduction of translation initiation is a common occurrence from a variety of stresses, it is unclear that it can be concluded that the reduced translational activity is due directly to the glycation of RNA and not a general stress response of the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake. Since there was enhanced RNA glycation, we investigated its effects on mRNA translation efficiency and observed a reduction. However, as the reviewer suggested, the attenuation in translation could be a general stress response. Therefore, we have rephrased the statement to the following “Moreover, in response to glycation stress, mRNA translation activity was significantly reduced in the absence of yeast DJ-1 members”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;DJ-1 orthologs provide robust organellar protection by redistributing into mitochondria to alleviate the glycation damage of mitochondrial DNA and proteins.&quot; &quot;Here, we provide direct evidence of mitochondrial maintenance by yeast DJ-1 orthologs, effectively through robust redistribution under glycation stress.&quot; I would disagree that they show direct evidence that redistribution is necessary for the protective effects they see. While it is shown that these proteins relocalize to the mitochondria, it isn't shown that relocalization is required to protect the mitochondrial proteins. It could be that the glyoxalase-driven reduction of these reactive carbonyl species is sufficient to protect the mitochondria without translocation to the mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical analysis of our work. We observed a 2-3-fold increase in mitochondrial translocation of Hsp31 paralogs during carbonyl stress, which may abrogate macromolecular glycation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, E). However, as the reviewer pointed out, we need to perform extensive studies in the future to understand the localization mechanism of Hsp31 paralogs and their relevance in providing mitochondrial protection. Moreover, we have rephrased the sentence in the revised manuscript. Refer to lines 551-553.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To directly show that mitochondrial localization of Hsp31 is necessary to protect the mitochondria, the authors should repress relocalization to the mitochondria and test the effects on mitochondrial proteins. Do these proteins have a mitochondrial targeting sequence? What is known about how these proteins are targeted to the mitochondria?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your critical question and suggestion. This has been a debate over the past 2 decades on how DJ-1 translocates into the mitochondrial compartment without having a welldefined N-terminal targeting sequence (Kojima et al.; Maita et al.). However, it is not surprising that many proteins show a dual localization under specific circumstances (such as oxidative stress, glyoxal stress), presumably by forming a complex with the resident mitochondrial proteins or due to posttranslational modifications. We believe that Hsp31 paralogs from yeast exhibit a similar phenotype (Elliott and Volkert; Heo et al.).</p><p>By considering reviewer suggestions constructively, we made several attempts to address this question past 6 months. The following are salient features of our findings:</p><p>Considering the existing literature and information available in online databases, strikingly, there is no evidence of MTS in yeast Hsp31 paralogs, and their translocation mechanism needs to be better studied. On the other hand, mutations in the N-terminal region of hDJ-1 affect mitochondrial translocation (Maita et al.).</p><p>Based on sequence alignment, we attempted to make several mutants (in combination) on the N-terminal region of Hsp31 and truncated N-terminal 12 residues. Subsequently, they were tested for phenotype and mitochondrial redistribution by probing isolated mitochondria from cells treated with methylglyoxal. Upon Western analysis, we observed an altered localization pattern in the Hsp31 mutants, comparable to WT Hsp31, but no repression was observed.</p><p>Moreover, the mutants showed enhanced localization of the protein in the absence of MG stress which is intriguing See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right K4A and K5A (lane 2 and 3) mutants compared to WT (lane 1). This suggests that the N-terminal residues play a role in redistributing the Hsp31 into the mitochondria. Moreover, we attempted to delete the protein's N terminal portion (truncated) to test the hypothesis. However, we could not detect the N-terminal truncated Hsp31 through the Western analysis.</p><p>However, elucidating the exact mechanism of how the N-terminal sequence regulates mitochondrial entry will be a larger question that requires a large time frame in the future.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88875-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>ReferencesBankapalli, K. et al. &quot;Robust Glyoxalase Activity of Hsp31, a Thij/Dj-1/Pfpi Family Member Protein, Is Critical for Oxidative Stress Resistance in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.&quot; <italic>J</italic></p><p><italic>Biol Chem</italic>, vol. 290, no. 44, 2015, pp. 26491-26507, doi:10.1074/jbc.M115.673624.</p><p>Elliott, N.

In Figure 8B, NAO is used to stain the total mitochondrial mass +/- GO treatment. Is it known whether or not the loss of Hsp31-34 paralogs has any effect on cardiolipin levels, which may affect the measurement of mitochondrial mass? Did you try using MitoTracker, or another membrane potential-independent dye?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. NAO dye was used to determine the total mitochondrial mass in Figure 8B, which stains the cardiolipin of mitochondria. However, there are no studies performed to estimate the cardiolipin levels in the absence of Hsp31 paralogs and hDJ-1. Besides, our microscopic data from Figure 8A, where cells are episomally expressing mCherry in a plasmid, also indicates that loss of Hsp31 paralogs alters mitochondrial content.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have utilized MitoTracker deep red, a potential dependent stain that is independent of cardiolipin levels, to measure mitochondrial mass (Xiao et al.).

We did not measure the cellular ATP levels since the global ATP pool is contributed through multiple biochemical pathways besides mitochondrial respiration (Dunn and Grider). Moreover, it is difficult to conclude glycation-induced mitochondrial damage from an altered total cellular ATP pool. Therefore, we isolated mitochondria devoid of cytosolic fraction and estimated ATP levels which directly correlate to mitochondrial respiration and health.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
