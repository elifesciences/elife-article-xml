There is a wide range of opioid analgesics, differing in their chemical structure and their properties of receptor activation and subsequent effects. A better understanding of ligand-receptor interactions and the resulting effects is important. Here, we calculated the respective binding poses for several opioids and analyzed interaction fingerprints between ligand and receptor. We further corroborated the interactions experimentally by cellular assays. As MOR was observed to display ligand-induced modulation of activity due to changes in membrane potential, we further analyzed the effects of voltage sensitivity on this receptor.

However, their pain killing effects are accompanied by severe side effects, like respiratory depression and addiction. Their high risk for abuse and overdose led to the opioid crisis in the USA with more than 80,000 deaths caused by opioid overdose in 2021 alone, on a rising trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">CDC, 2022</xref>). Especially synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl, are responsible for the majority of the observed deaths. The currently used opioid analgesics differ not only in their chemical structure, but also with respect to their potency, efficacy, and kinetics to activate Gi/o proteins via MOR. Furthermore, they may exhibit differences in their efficacy to induce arrestin recruitment to MOR. There have already been attempts to develop more effective and safer opioids through a structure-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manglik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>). In any case, because of the observable differences between the different opioids, it is important to understand details of ligand-receptor interactions. We recently showed that ligand-induced MOR activity is modulated by the membrane potential, and that the effect and extent of this voltage sensitivity is ligand-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>). As the MOR is mainly expressed in highly excitable tissue and the effect of voltage modulation of MOR is present in native tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>), the voltage sensitivity of this receptor might have a strong, still unexplored, physiological relevance, which is still neglected in the majority of studies on the MOR and GPCRs in general. As a matter of fact, since the first report of voltage sensitivity of the muscarinic M<sub>2</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Chaim et al., 2003</xref>), several other GPCRs have been observed to be modulated in their activity depending on the membrane potential. Moreover, these effects were found to be ligand-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">López-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moreno-Galindo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navarro‐Polanco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rinne et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the voltage effect on GPCRs is a function of the receptor-ligand interactions. However, a general mechanism of voltage sensitivity is still elusive.</p><p>The expression of the MOR in neurons and the strongly pronounced and ligand-specific voltage effect makes this receptor an interesting candidate for further analysis of voltage sensitivity. Moreover, due to the clinical relevance of opioids, a wide range of ligands of the MOR has been described. Analysis of the interactions of these ligands with the receptor in general would give new information on molecular determinants of ligand-specific voltage sensitivity, which could then be used in the fine-tuning of safer and more effective opioids. Therefore, we analyzed the predicted binding poses of several opioids, detected key interactions and interaction groups, and correlated these with the effects voltage has on the MOR. To do so, we performed molecular docking calculations for 10 opioid ligands, including the clinically most relevant ones, and calculated interaction patterns for these ligands. Subsequently, we experimentally corroborated the predicted interactions by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assays and by fluorescent ligand-binding competition assays in HEK293T cells. The analysis of the ligand-specific voltage sensitivity of the MOR was further performed with FRET-based functional assays under direct control of the membrane potential, revealing a correlation of the particular interaction pattern of a ligand and the specific voltage sensitivity of the MOR. Based on these observations, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, we identified receptor regions determining the effect voltage has at the MOR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Voltage sensitivity of the MOR is ligand-specific</title><p>Voltage sensitivity of the MOR was investigated by utilizing single-cell FRET-based assays to study G protein activity as well as recruitment of arrestin3 to the MOR under conditions of whole-cell voltage clamp. To detect the effect of voltage on G protein activity, HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) MOR and Gα<sub>i</sub>-mTurquoise, cpVenus-Gγ<sub>2</sub>, and Gβ<sub>1</sub> in order to monitor G<sub>i</sub> protein activity through a decrease in the FRET emission ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Unen et al., 2016</xref>). Agonists were applied at concentrations close to the EC<sub>50</sub>-value to avoid signal saturation. The level of maximal stimulation was determined by the application of a saturating concentration of DAMGO in all FRET recordings. Application of morphine at –90 mV induced a robust Gα<sub>i</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), depolarization to +30 mV enhanced Gα<sub>i</sub> activation strongly, and the effect was reversible after repolarization. A similar protocol was applied to cells stimulated with methadone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Here, however, the depolarization induced a decrease in Gα<sub>i</sub> activation. Voltage affected the FRET signal only when a ligand was present and MOR was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ligand dependence of the voltage sensitivity, mainly based on a change of efficacy in receptor activation, was previously additionally reported for morphine, Met-enkephalin, DAMGO, and fentanyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the MOR shows a strong ligand-specific voltage sensitivity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Voltage sensitivity of the µ opioid receptor (MOR) is ligand-specific.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Averaged Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based single-cell recordings of MOR-induced Gα<sub>i</sub> activation under voltage clamp conditions with wild-type (WT) receptor, Gα<sub>i</sub>-mTurquoise, cpVenus-Gγ<sub>2</sub>, and Gβ in HEK293T cells are plotted for the indicated agonists (mean ± SEM; A: n=8, B: n=13, C: n=12).

Our docking calculations were performed based on the crystal structure of the active-state MOR (PDB: 5C1M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). We decided not to use the cryo-EM structures of the MOR bound to the G protein (PDB: 6DDE and 6DDF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koehl et al., 2018</xref>), as they have been solved with a peptide instead of a small molecule ligand, thus resulting in a different conformation of the orthosteric pocket. The docking calculations revealed different binding poses for the different opioids. The binding pose for morphine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) suggested D147<sup>3.32</sup>, Y148<sup>3.33</sup>, Y326<sup>7.43</sup> and the water molecules between helices 5 and 6 as important interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and M151<sup>3.36</sup>, V236<sup>5.42</sup>, H297<sup>6.52</sup>, and W293<sup>6.48</sup> as possible interactions, as well (numbers in superscript are according to the Ballesteros-Weinstein enumeration scheme for GPCRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995</xref>). In contrast, the binding pose for methadone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) indicated only a salt bridge with D147<sup>3.32</sup> and hydrophobic interactions and/or possible aromatic-aromatic stacking interactions with V236<sup>5.42</sup>, H297<sup>6.52</sup>, W293<sup>6.48</sup>, and Y326<sup>7.43</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was predicted to form an H-bond with Y326<sup>7.43</sup> via its amide carbonyl and a salt bridge with D147<sup>3.32</sup> via its amide carbonyl. In addition, Q124<sup>2.60</sup>, C217<sup>45.50</sup>, W293<sup>6.48</sup>, and H297<sup>6.52</sup> were possible interactions for fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further compared our fentanyl docking poses with a recently published complex structure of the MOR (PDB: 8EF5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhuang et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we found that our calculated binding pose of fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) was flipped upside down in comparison to the experimental structure, but that the overall interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) were comparable. This can be explained by the symmetry inherent in fentanyl, also one of the reasons why binding mode prediction for this molecule has in general been difficult. In the further analysis, we used the binding pose of fentanyl observed in the experimental structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhuang et al., 2022</xref>). All binding poses were further investigated with a fingerprint analysis, a computational evaluation converting the interactions between a ligand and the receptor into a string of numbers, i.e., a vector. In order to reduce dimensionality, a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the set of fingerprints. The interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) that contributed strongest to the first two principal components emerged from this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). On one side, interactions defining the first principal component (PC1, describing 27% of the variance observed in the interactions) were found within helices 2, 5, and 6 and extracellular loop 2 (N127<sup>2.50</sup>, C217<sup>45.50</sup>, L232<sup>5.38</sup>, and W293<sup>6.48</sup>). On the other side, key interactions defining the second principal component (PC2, describing 15% of the variance observed in the interactions) were mostly found in helices 2 and 3 (Q124<sup>2.60</sup>, I144<sup>3.29</sup>, Y148<sup>3.33</sup>, and M151<sup>3.36</sup>). The PCA revealed diverse interaction patterns of the different opioid ligands with MOR. As a side note, the PCA plot did not change substantially when we used the fingerprint for the experimentally determined binding mode of fentanyl instead of the computational one (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, we excluded our reference agonist DAMGO from this analysis, as it is generally unfeasible to calculate a reliable binding pose of such highly flexible peptidergic ligands. Moreover, analysis of the fingerprint of the crystallographically resolved binding mode of DAMGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koehl et al., 2018</xref>) revealed a completely different interaction pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) in comparison to the other opioids, putting it outside of a possible applicability domain of our analysis. This is likely due to the larger size of the peptide DAMGO in comparison to the non-peptidic opioid agonists. Further, transformation of DAMGO into the already described space led to no reasonable clustering of DAMGO in comparison to the other ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Along these lines, we suggest that the use of our findings in a predictive manner should only be attempted for ligands with similar physicochemical characteristics (including the size; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and binding locations. As the MOR-binding pocket is known to be highly flexible and pose prediction via docking could possibly be unreliable, we repeated our fingerprint analysis for all tested ligands with not only the highest ranked poses but also with the top three poses according to energy score, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The resulting fingerprints did not vary to a large extent between the top three poses, suggesting our computational pose prediction is suitable for further evaluation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Predicted binding poses of different opioids at the µ opioid receptor (MOR) reveal differential interaction patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Binding poses of morphine (<bold>A</bold>) and methadone (<bold>B</bold>) docked to the MOR are illustrated as a view from the extracellular side, H-bonds are indicated as dotted lines.

The decision of which residue was mutated and to which amino acid was taken based on a visual investigation of the calculated binding poses. Next, we determined concentration-response curves for G protein activation in single-cell FRET measurements for the different modified receptors. To that end, we measured Gα<sub>i</sub> activation induced by MOR-WT or the mutated version of MOR at increasing concentrations of morphine, methadone, or fentanyl and compared it to the maximal activation obtained when using DAMGO. We plotted these as concentration-response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and calculated pEC<sub>50</sub>-values for each receptor variant and ligand. To further evaluate the mutants, we additionally performed fluorescent ligand competition-binding assays as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schembri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Therefore, we measured the displacement of the sulfo-Cy5-bearing fluorescent buprenorphine-based ligand by morphine, methadone, and fentanyl at the MOR-WT and the mutated versions of MOR and calculated pIC<sub>50</sub>-values, where applicable. To give an overview of all mutations and their influence on Gα<sub>i</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and competition binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>) of the different ligands, we plotted all calculated pEC<sub>50</sub>-values and pIC<sub>50</sub>-values in bar graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The mutation of Y148<sup>3.33</sup>F, V236<sup>5.42</sup>, and H297<sup>6.52</sup>, respectively, led to a strong loss of pEC<sub>50</sub>-value for morphine-induced Gα<sub>i</sub> activation and pIC<sub>50</sub>-value for competition binding, indicating the importance of these residues for proper morphine binding, consistent with the docking prediction. For methadone, we identified H297<sup>6.52</sup> as important interaction. Furthermore, the identification of Y326<sup>7.43</sup> as important interaction for methadone and fentanyl was verified by Gα<sub>i</sub> activation and competition binding. Residue W293<sup>6.48</sup>, part of the CWxP motif, which is known to be important in the activation of class A GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2002</xref>), was identified as important interaction for both methadone and fentanyl as well. Replacement by the smaller F resulted in nearly completely abolished Gα<sub>i</sub> activation by fentanyl. In contrast, for methadone we observed an increase in Gα<sub>i</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>, left shift by 2 orders of magnitude). However, this mutant was not able to bind the fluorescent ligand anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J</xref>), making it impossible to evaluate the effect of this mutant in competition-binding assays. The same is true for the mutations of M151<sup>3.35</sup>, H297<sup>6.52</sup>, and V300<sup>6.55</sup> to F and L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F, J, K, L, O, P</xref>). Interestingly, both mutants of K233<sup>5.39</sup> clearly bound the fluorescent ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>), yet we were not able to observe displacement of the fluorescent ligand upon ligand application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G–H</xref>). Overall, we see a high similarity in effects on function (shown by Gα<sub>i</sub> activation) and ligand binding (shown by competition of fluorescent ligand) induced by the point mutations. Just some mutations showed differing effects between binding and activation (Y148<sup>3.33</sup>A for morphine, Y148<sup>3.33</sup>F, V236<sup>5.42</sup>N, and V300<sup>6.55</sup>N for fentanyl). For these mutants, the binding was increased or not effected, but there was a stronger loss in activation of the G proteins. Overall, these experimental results are therefore congruent with the assumption that these residues are involved in ligand binding and/or elicitation of receptor response. We did not explicitly evaluate the influence on efficacy of receptor activation of the receptor mutants, as the normalization for such experiments was unfeasible for some of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2S–V</xref>). However, we analyzed the maximum Cy5 intensity per cell for each mutant and compared it to WT and non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2T</xref>). Here, only the mutants M151A, W293F, H297F, and V300F and -L resulted in a significant loss of Cy5 intensity in comparison to the WT receptor. However, we can’t conclude from these results whether these mutants (M151A, W293F, H297F, and V300F and -L) have or do not have a significant impact on receptor function or expression levels, as we could not detect any fluorescent ligand binding. Indeed, the remaining mutants appear to have comparable ligand-binding levels to WT, as the Cy5 intensity was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2T</xref>). Further, by testing for expression levels of every mutant by performing western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), we obtained similar expression levels as the WT receptor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects on function.</title><p>and ligand binding of point mutations corroborate binding poses of different opioids at the µ opioid receptor (MOR).</p><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Concentration-response curve for Gα<sub>i</sub> activation induced by the depicted agonist were fitted for MOR wild-type (WT) and the pEC<sub>50</sub>-values (morphine = 9.35, methadone = 6.62, fentanyl = 9.51) were calculated.

The ligands that showed enhanced activity upon depolarization mainly interacted with helix 3 (M151<sup>3.36</sup>) and helix 5 (K233<sup>5.39</sup>) and the water network between helices 5 and 6, while the ligands exhibiting a decrease in activation upon depolarization mainly interacted with ECL1 and -2 (W133<sup>23.50</sup> and C217<sup>45.50</sup>), helix 2 (Q124<sup>2.60</sup> and N127<sup>2.63</sup>), helix 6 (W293<sup>6,48</sup> and V300<sup>6.55</sup>), and helix 7 (W318<sup>7,35</sup> and Y326<sup>7.43</sup>). Overlaying this information on the binding pocket, two separate main interaction regions or motifs can be discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), one important for depolarization-induced activation (marked in blue) and one important for depolarization-induced deactivation (marked in pink), which correlate with the voltage-sensitive behavior of the ligand. We excluded DAMGO from this analysis as its binding pose – mainly because of its different size compared to the other ligands – resulted in a completely different fingerprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We further performed an association analysis by fitting a linear model of the interaction fingerprint entries of all agonists to the activation ratio upon depolarization for each interacting residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1M</xref>). There it became obvious that in particular weak H-bonds with Y326<sup>7.43</sup> only appeared for ligands exhibiting a decrease in activation upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1M</xref>). In contrast, interactions with M151<sup>3.36</sup> and K233<sup>5.39</sup> only appeared for agonists exhibiting an enhanced activity upon depolarization. The only exception here seems to be meptazinol. The fingerprint of meptazinol was comparable to compounds displaying a decrease in activation upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, for meptazinol the association analysis revealed a weak H-bond with Y326<sup>7.43</sup> and an interaction with K233<sup>5.39</sup>, both interactions defining the opposite direction of voltage effect. This could possibly explain the relatively small voltage effect when applying meptazinol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). In addition, SR17018 was the only ligand in this study which displayed no detectable voltage effect and did further not cluster with the other ligands. This could be explainable by the recent hypothesis stating this compound binds non-competitively to the MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stahl et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Altered ligand-receptor interactions influence agonist-specific voltage sensitivity of the MOR</title><p>As we already showed that site-directed mutagenesis alters ligand-induced G protein activation and binding of the ligand, we evaluated the influence of mutations of these potential ligand-receptor interactions on the agonist-specific voltage sensitivity of the MOR. Hereby we gained more information on potential molecular determinants for voltage sensitivity. Therefore, we measured mutated MOR-induced Gα<sub>i</sub> activation under voltage clamp conditions and compared this to the WT behavior. Agonists were applied in a concentration inducing comparable Gα<sub>i</sub> activation levels, which were determined respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–R</xref>). The mutation of Y148<sup>3.33</sup> to F resulted in a reduced voltage effect of morphine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, green), leading to just a slight increase of Gα<sub>i</sub> activation upon depolarization. The insertion of an A at this position instead led to a strongly increased Gα<sub>i</sub> activation, even stronger than the one for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, magenta). The mutation of the positively charged K233<sup>5.39</sup> to the neutral A reduced the voltage effect for morphine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as well. The exchange of H297<sup>6.52</sup> to an A changed the direction of voltage effect for methadone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, magenta), now showing an increased Gα<sub>i</sub> activation upon depolarization. However, exchange of H297<sup>6.52</sup> to an F led to a voltage effect of methadone comparable to WT behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, green). The insertion of an F instead of Y326<sup>7.43</sup> changed the direction of the voltage effect for methadone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A change of direction of voltage effect was also induced for fentanyl by the change of Q124<sup>2.60</sup> to an E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), now increasing Gα<sub>i</sub> activation upon depolarization. However, the mutation H297<sup>6.52</sup>A, which inverted the voltage effect for methadone, had a divergent effect on fentanyl: here the effect of depolarization on Gα<sub>i</sub> activation led to an even stronger decrease in Gα<sub>i</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). All effects on voltage-sensitive behavior induced by point mutations of residues involved in potential ligand-receptor interactions were plotted in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, based on data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), where the agonist-induced response at +30 mV was normalized to the response at –90 mV. We did not analyze the effect of double mutants, as these displayed only weak and not evaluable Gα<sub>i</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Overall, although the suggested receptor interactions of morphine changed or are abolished by the mutations, depolarization increased Gα<sub>i</sub> activation in each case, albeit to a different extent. For methadone and fentanyl, the altered ligand-receptor interactions were consistent with the change in direction of the voltage effect of methadone- or fentanyl-induced Gα<sub>i</sub> activation, which was now increasing upon depolarization in nine cases. Overall, the strongest effects were induced by mutation of Y148<sup>3.33</sup>, M151<sup>3.36</sup>, H297<sup>6.52</sup>, and Y326<sup>7.43</sup>. As already shown by the fingerprint and association analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M</xref>), whether there’s an interaction with M151<sup>3.36</sup> or Y326<sup>7.43</sup> seemed to have an influence on the direction of voltage sensitivity.

We analyzed the binding mode of naloxone by molecular docking, and, as the chemical structure of naloxone contains the morphinan scaffold and is highly related to morphine overall, we compared the predicted binding modes of these two ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The two binding modes were highly comparable, as expected. Only the direct interaction with Y326<sup>7.43</sup> seems to be missing in the case of naloxone. According to the fingerprint analysis, naloxone belongs to the group of ligands that would show increased activation upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As it was reported before that depolarization can convert GPCR antagonists to agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurung et al., 2008</xref>), we also evaluated naloxone with respect to voltage sensitivity. For this, we measured MOR-induced Gα<sub>i</sub> activation under voltage clamp conditions. Application of naloxone at –90 mV induced no Gα<sub>i</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), depolarization to +30 mV led to Gα<sub>i</sub> activation up to a level of approx. 30% of the Gα<sub>i</sub> activation induced by a saturating concentration of DAMGO. This effect was reversible after repolarization. We further analyzed this voltage effect through the application of different membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and fitted these to a Boltzmann function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A comparison with the effects evoked by morphine in the same setting revealed that the net charge movements upon change in membrane potential, represented as z-values, were comparable, with 1.17 for naloxone and 0.8 for morphine. Both values are also in the same range of z-values previously published for other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Chaim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navarro‐Polanco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinne et al., 2013</xref>). The half-maximal effective membrane potential for naloxone (V<sub>50</sub>: +31 mV) was shifted to a more positive V<sub>M</sub> in comparison to morphine (V<sub>50</sub>: –29 mV), indicating that the conversion of naloxone from an antagonist to an agonist requires a more positive membrane potential. We performed the identical analysis also for Gα<sub>o</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), resulting in nearly identical V<sub>50</sub> and z-values for data fitted to a Boltzmann function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we checked if this effect is also visible in assays that show no amplification. For this, we measured the direct interaction of MOR-sYFP and arrestin3-mTur2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>) under voltage clamp conditions.

In order to further verify the observed voltage-induced conversion from antagonist to agonist for naloxone, we measured MOR-evoked inward GIRK currents at different holding potentials, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>). We applied naloxone and compared the evoked K<sup>+</sup> current to a saturating concentration of DAMGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) at –90 mV and –20 mV.

These differential interaction patterns were connected to ligand-specific voltage sensitivity of the MOR. Furthermore, we were able to identify important regions in the receptor which we correlated with the voltage effect on the MOR.</p><p>Specifically, our molecular docking studies and subsequent fingerprint analysis, which described the interactions between a ligand and a receptor as a vector of numbers, revealed that morphine (or agonists with the morphinan scaffold) interacted with D147<sup>3.32</sup>, Y148<sup>3.33</sup>, Y326<sup>7.43</sup> and the water networks between helices 5 and 6 as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kapoor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lipiński et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vo et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, morphine displayed several interactions with helix 6, which were mostly missing for methadone and fentanyl, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kapoor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lipiński et al., 2019</xref>). The observed binding pose for methadone indicated a salt bridge with D147<sup>3.32</sup> as the only direct interaction, comparable to the findings of Kapoor et al. For fentanyl, we identified a salt bridge with D147<sup>3.32</sup> and an H-bond with Y326<sup>7.43</sup> as critically important interactions. Indeed, we observed a strong right shift of 4 orders of magnitude in the concentration-response curve for G<sub>i</sub> protein activation, indicating a severe loss in potency, at the tested WT-like expressing Y326<sup>7.43</sup> mutant, perfectly in line with our docking calculations. The same interactions could be seen in a recently published complex structure of the MOR (PDB: 8EF5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhuang et al., 2022</xref>). Although our calculated binding pose of fentanyl was flipped upside down in comparison to this experimental structure, the interactions were comparable. This can be explained by the inherent symmetry in fentanyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lipiński et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vo et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, other studies showed that there are different possible binding poses for fentanyl which can convert to each other at low energy barriers, also in line with our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2023</xref>). In summary, with our approach we were able to corroborate the interaction patterns calculated from the binding poses experimentally through mutagenesis.</p><p>We further evaluated several opioids regarding their voltage sensitivity by means of FRET under conditions of whole-cell voltage clamp. We identified ligands showing a strong increase in receptor activation upon depolarization of the membrane potential in a physiological range (morphine, buprenorphine, pethidine, etorphine, DAMGO, tramadol, PZM21, and naloxone). In contrast, other ligands displayed a decrease in activation (methadone, fentanyl, TRV130, loperamide, and meptazinol). Met-enkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>) and SR17018 displayed no apparent voltage sensitivity. This opposite direction of the voltage effect can neither be explained by the difference between partial and full agonists nor by the intrinsic ligand properties (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Both partial and full agonists were included in each of the tested groups. Moreover, agonists that are hypothesized to display a bias between G<sub>i</sub> activation and arrestin recruitment compared to DAMGO (PZM21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manglik et al., 2016</xref>], TRV130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWire et al., 2013</xref>], and SR17018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>]) were present in all groups. In conclusion, this indicated that the increased or decreased activation due to depolarization is not dependent on the degree of receptor activation. Additionally, the voltage effect was able to turn the antagonist naloxone into an agonist, comparable to the effects investigated for the P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurung et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we detected that the grouping of the opioids according to the direction of their voltage effect matched to a very high degree with the grouping based on the analysis of the fingerprints describing the docking-derived and experimental binding modes. These results revealed a strong ligand-specific voltage sensitivity, which seemed to be determined by the specific binding mode, and thus interaction pattern, of the ligands. Further analysis of the distinct interaction motifs of the ligand groups indicated two main interaction motifs determining the voltage effect. Helices 3 and 5 (M151<sup>3.36</sup> and K233<sup>5.39</sup>) and the water network were indicated as important interaction sites for the ligands which had an activating effect upon depolarization. In contrast, a motif located mainly on helices 2, 6, and 7 (Q124<sup>2.60</sup>, N127<sup>2.63</sup>, W293<sup>6,48</sup>, V300<sup>6.55</sup>, W318<sup>7,35</sup>, and Y326<sup>7.43</sup>) and ECL1 and -2 (W133<sup>23.50</sup> and C217<sup>45.50</sup>) appears to be important for the ligands displaying a decrease in activation. A strong influence on ligand-specific voltage sensitivity defined by differential interactions with different helices was also reported for the muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rinne et al., 2015</xref>). In general, there is still a lot of speculation about a possible general voltage sensing mechanism for GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barchad-Avitzur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">López-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vickery et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, the involvement of a sodium ion bound to a conserved D was discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vickery et al., 2016</xref>). This sodium ion seems to be important for the activation of the MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Selley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sutcliffe et al., 2017</xref>). However, it has been shown that this sodium ion or sodium in general is not involved in the voltage sensing mechanism of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ågren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tauber and Ben Chaim, 2022</xref>). Our approach of combining in silico and in vitro methods enabled us to identify and select important ligand-receptor interactions for each of the opioids, alter them by site-directed mutagenesis, and test the influence of these changes on voltage sensitivity. Overall, we were not able to change the directionality of the voltage effect on MOR activation for morphinan compounds. In contrast, for methadone and fentanyl we were able to change the direction of the voltage effect following the introduction of receptor mutations. Exchange of amino acids located in helices 3 and 6 displayed the largest effects on voltage sensitivity. Especially mutation of Y148<sup>3.33</sup> resulted in an increased receptor activation upon depolarization for all tested ligands. A similar effect was induced by the H297<sup>6.52</sup>A mutation. It can be speculated that if the ligands are located closer to helix 3, the movement of helix 6, which is known to move outward upon receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), could be increased upon depolarization. On the one hand, there could simply be more space for this movement if the ligands strongly interact with helix 3, further increasing the activation of the receptor. Supporting this hypothesis, we previously showed that the voltage effect induced by activation with morphine is primarily due to an increase of efficacy in receptor activation and not in affinity for the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, ligands not showing this strong interaction with helix 3, such as fentanyl, could lose affinity for the receptor due to this movement or they might impede this movement, stabilizing the receptor in a more inactive state. Another potential base for the ligand-specific voltage effect of the MOR was presented in a recent study, where MD simulations revealed different active conformation states of the MOR depending on the bound ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2023</xref>). Qu et al. found that the MOR bound to lofentanil, a derivative of fentanyl, resulted in a different conformational state than induced by the binding of another, structurally different opioid (MP). Further, DAMGO was in an equilibrium between these two possible active states, also showing the difficulty of finding a correct docking pose for this peptide. They hypothesized here that TM7 rotates in the different activation states, and especially the interaction of the residues Y326<sup>7.43</sup> and Q124<sup>2.60</sup> are crucial for these conformational changes. Interestingly, these residues displayed a strong impact on voltage sensitivity of methadone and fentanyl in our studies. One could hypothesize that these different conformational states induced by different ligands are differentially affected by voltage, resulting in an increased activity (like for morphine) or a decreased activity of the receptor (like for fentanyl).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that ligand-specific voltage sensitivity of MOR activation is mechanistically based on the interaction patterns between ligands and the receptor. With this study we cannot determine an accurate mechanism for the impact of voltage on the overall structure of the MOR, as the identified residues important for MOR are not known to be part of GPCR activation pathways, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hauser et al., 2021</xref>). However, some identified residues are to some extent part of ligand-specific conformational states of the MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, we propose that depolarization influences the conformation (or probability to reach certain conformations) of MOR in a way that increases the probability to activate receptors for ligands primarily interacting with helices 3 and 5, and the water network. Conversely, voltage decreases this probability for those ligands interacting with a motif on helices 2, 6, and 7 and the extracellular loops. These observations seem to hold true for morphinan-based ligands, but might represent a more general pattern, particularly if the influence of the ligands is considered at a helix (rather than residue) level. Indicative of the limitations of our postulates, ligands with substantially different interaction patterns, such as DAMGO, cannot be explained with our findings. As has been stated earlier in this manuscript, we suggest to limit the use of our proposed model as a predictor to ligands that have similar biophysical characteristics and binding modes as the molecules investigated here. Considering the observed ligand-specific voltage sensitivity is also seen with other receptors, it will be interesting to see if the hypothesis developed in this work also applies to those receptors as well, and maybe even to those for which voltage sensitivity has not been described yet. Our approach, strongly involving the opportunities enabled by in silico methods, allows the screening of a large number of predicted interactions and helps to choose the most information-rich receptor mutants and ligands for the subsequent in vitro analysis in a systematic and rational way. The MOR, with its diverse voltage pharmacology, was a good model system to illustrate the potential of this approach.</p><p>As MOR is expressed in neuronal tissue, which is highly excitable, a pharmacological relevance of voltage sensitivity of the MOR is very likely, albeit difficult to prove. We have already shown that the voltage sensitivity of the MOR is also reflected in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>). In this recent study we have demonstrated that the voltage modulation of MOR also affects the downstream signaling, even in a small, physiological voltage range and without overexpression of the receptor in native tissue. As it has been observed that morphine-mediated signaling is tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haberstock-Debic et al., 2005</xref>), the membrane potential should be considered for the explanation of these observed effects. Further, it is known that different cell types, excitable or non-excitable, have different resting membrane potentials in a large range from –100 mV (like skeletal muscle cells) to nearly 0 mV (fertilized eggs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang and Brackenbury, 2013</xref>). Based on this, it is intriguing that the membrane potential of these different cell types has an impact on a wide range of physiological aspects. These effects were shown among others for circadian rhythm, hearing, secretion, proliferation, cell cycle, cancer progression, and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Kadir et al., 2018</xref>). It seems obvious that GPCRs, known as the largest group of membrane receptors, are also highly influenced by the membrane potential and that this aspect should be considered when analyzing their signaling. So far only for muscarinic receptors, voltage insensitive mutants with otherwise WT-like agonist-binding properties have been generated and expressed in vivo. These studies revealed even a behavioral phenotype in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rozenfeld et al., 2021</xref>), indicating the importance of voltage sensitivity of GPCR for physiology. For the MOR, the voltage effect is only pronounced for non-endogenous opioid ligands, as the endogenous opioid met-enkephalin displayed no detectable voltage effect, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>, indicating a role for pharmacology rather than physiology. We suggest that the differential effect of voltage on the activity of the different opioid ligands needs to be taken into account as one possible determinant of the clinical profile of opioid drugs. A better understanding of the voltage dependence of the MOR, as achieved in our study, can potentially help with the development of safer and more effective opioids. It is, for instance, known that neurons sensing pain depolarize more often. Development of opioid ligands with a voltage dependence stronger than morphine could therefore potentially act predominantly in these depolarized cells. This would be a novel way of precise drug targeting, possibly reducing side effects, which are still the main problems of opioid therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular docking and fingerprint analysis</title><p>The crystal structure of the active-state MOR (PDB code 5C1M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) was prepared for docking by deletion of the N-terminus up to residue 63 and the inclusion of two water molecules (HOH 525 and HOH 546). The two water molecules were selected as they were present in both existing small-molecule-bound crystal structures (PDB codes 4DKL and 5C1M) and are involved in water bridges and hydrogen bonds with the ligand. Recent cryo-EM structures (PDB codes 6DDF and 6DDE) were not selected, as they have been solved with a peptide instead of a small molecule ligand. Using MakeReceptor (OpenEye Scientific Software, Santa Fe, NM, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eyesopen.com">http://www.eyesopen.com</ext-link>), the water molecules were defined as part of the receptor and D147<sup>3.32</sup> (numbers in superscript are according to the Ballesteros-Weinstein enumeration scheme for GPCRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995</xref>) as main interaction partner, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Surratt et al., 1994</xref>. Ligand preparation was performed with OMEGA (OpenEye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hawkins et al., 2010</xref>), using isomeric SMILES from PubChem. After docking of ligands using FRED (OpenEye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGann, 2011</xref>), the best scored poses were minimized in the pocket with SZYBKI (OpenEye). Pethidine was docked a second time without the water molecules, as the pose from the initial docking was close to the side of the receptor instead of the bottom of the pocket. This is likely due to the water molecules hindering pethidine from binding at the bottom, and indeed removal of the two water molecules allowed it to reach a pose that interacted with the bottom of the pocket. The 2D ligand-protein interactions maps were generated with Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, Molecular Operating Environment, 2022.02 Chemical Computing Group ULC, Montreal, Canada) program from the binding pose. Interaction fingerprints were calculated using the program Arpeggio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jubb et al., 2017</xref>), results were analyzed with PCA using scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>) and the first two principal components were plotted. Values on the x- and y-axis, respectively, originate from the linear combination of fingerprint features and do not carry an additional meaning, e.g., likelihood. The 10 most important interactions were determined for each component. Association analysis was performed by fitting a linear regression model of the interactions of all compounds to the activation ratio upon depolarization for each interacting residue using R programming. The F-test p-values for each interaction were computed and ranked in order to identify interactions that correlate with the activation ratio. Based on a visual investigation of the calculated binding poses we decided to perform site-directed mutagenesis of several residues that were predicted to be important or not in the binding pocket of the MOR. Also based on this visual investigation, we decided which residue was mutated and to which amino acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>cDNAs for rat MOR-WT, MOR-sYFP2, Gα<sub>i</sub>-YFP, Gα<sub>o</sub>-YFP, Gβ<sub>1</sub>-mTur2, Gγ<sub>2</sub>-WT, arrestin3-mTur2, GRK2-WT, GRK2-mTur2, Gα<sub>i</sub>-WT, Gβ<sub>1</sub>-WT, Gγ<sub>2</sub>-WT, bicistronic plasmid expressing GIRK3.1 and GIRK3.4 subunits and pcDNA3-eCFP have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ruland et al., 2020</xref>).

The intensity of the signals was quantified with ImageJ and analyzed using GraphPad prism 8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>FRET measurements were corrected for photobleaching (using OriginPro 2016) and were normalized to maximum responses within the same cell and recording. Further data analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). Data is always shown (if not indicated otherwise) as mean ± SEM and group size defined as n. Statistical analyses were performed with a paired Student’s t-test or a two-tailed unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction (as normality of data distribution wasn’t given for every group) or, for more than two groups, by an ordinary one-way ANOVA (as SDs were significantly different, a Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA test were performed) with Dunnet’s T3 multiple comparisons test, as indicated. Differences were considered as statistically significant if p≤0.05.

While there may be some paths toward addressing this in principle (see comments below), the reviewers felt that the scope of needed work is beyond what would be reasonable for revision timeline. As a result, we cannot proceed with the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Over the past decade or so, a number of studies have demonstrated that multiple GPCRs are sensitive to voltage – i.e. their signaling properties change as a function of membrane voltage. The physiological consequence and relevance of this voltage sensitivity remains poorly understood. The authors recently reported that voltage can influence activation of the mu-opioid receptor, and that this effect is different between opioid receptor agonists (Ruland, BJP 2020), with some agonists causing increased activation of the receptor with depolarization, while other agonists (fentanyl) cause decreased activation with depolarization. In the present study, the authors aim to connect this observation to specific interactions made by different opioid receptor ligands to try to map specific contacts between ligands and the receptor that are responsible for this voltage sensitivity. Here, the authors first establish that different ligands acting at the opioid receptor are differentially sensitive to membrane voltage, e.g. the effect of morphine is increased while that of methadone and fentanyl is decreased. Based on these findings, the authors then dock various opioid ligands into the active conformation of MOR to identify differences in contacts between the ligands. A fingerprint analysis of contacts is used to cluster ligands with similar/different contacts; some of these differential interactions are probed/validated by dose response assays. The authors then suggest that grouping ligands with the fingerprint analysis approach seemed to correlate with voltage sensitivity, and that this correlation came with sufficient power to predict how meptazinol binds and the effect of voltage on etorphine. Specific mutations in the MOR binding pocket were then assessed for their effect on MOR voltage sensitivity to three prototypical opioids (morphien, methadone, and fentanyl) – here, the authors found that some mutations could reverse the directionality of voltage sensitivity for fentanyl and methadone. Finally, membrane depolarization could convert the antagonist naloxone into a weak partial agonist.</p><p>These studies convincingly show that voltage does not simply change the conformation of the MOR, leading to more or less G protein signaling activity. Instead, it is the specific interactions of a ligand with the MOR binding pocket that lead to a specific outcome – these are clearly influenced by specific ligands, and the specific contacts that a given ligand makes with the MOR binding pocket. The most exciting data to the latter point is the remarkable effect that specific mutations can have in converting the effect of voltage on methadone in Figure 6C or in the effect on naloxone.</p><p>Less clear is how well the authors can define these specific interactions. It is not clear whether the docking studies are truly informative in this regard. First, but it is not completely clear whether binding poses for various ligands are truly accurate – the authors efforts to dock fentanyl suggest that there are many potential challenges in obtaining accurate poses. Even with accurate poses, it is unclear whether the fingerprint analysis is robust. For example, it is likely the case that D147(3.32) is a critically important residue for basically all opioids (the authors cite one of the seminal studies demonstrating this). This residue, however, is part of the set used to distinguish ligands (e.g. part of PC2 in Figure 2F). This is reflected in the conclusions – the authors state that ligands with enhanced activity with depolarization interact with ECL2/TM6 while ligands with decreased activation with depolarization interact with TM3. However, this doesn't appear to be concordant with the docking poses presented in Figure 2 as morphine (enhanced activity) is shown to interact with Y148 in TM3.</p><p>Overall this study therefore provides interesting evidence that interactions between the MOR and the ligand in the binding pocket are important for MOR voltage sensitivity. But the specific interactions made and how they drive this behavior remains hard to rationalize based on the docking/fingerprint analysis</p><p>It is unclear why the authors initially present their fentanyl docking results as not being dependent on D147. This suggests that the docking needs further work and doesn't recapitulate key aspects of the binding site.</p><p>In Figure 1 – it is very hard to understand how/why morphine gives a negative response in the presence of a depolarizing current. This almost suggests there is a reserve of G protein that cannot interact with the receptor in the absence of depolarization. Some comment on this would be important.</p><p>In Figure 2 – it is unclear what the axes for PC1 and PC2 mean. Is a more positive value associated with increased reliance on this component?</p><p>In pg 7, the authors suggest that in silico modeling of mutations suggests that ligands bind to the mutated receptors with distinct poses, and this is responsible for the decreased EC50's observed in Figure 3. I think the authors need to be careful here – in general, it is far more likely that the binding pose of various ligands remains similar to the wild-type receptor. For example, it seems quite unlikely that the Y326F mutation would completely flip the pose for fentanyl in the binding site as it is known that D147 is important for fentanyl binding. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that methadone loses an ionic interaction in the H297A mutant.</p><p>Figure 4B is very challenging to interpret – it is unclear how the reader is able to figure out what is happening in the voltage dimension.</p><p>Figure 5E – it is unclear whether etorphine has any voltage dependent effect. It appears from this plot that it doesn't.</p><p>For the predictive experiments showing in Figure 5 – was etorphine blinded in the original analysis? It is unclear how this was a predictive result instead of another example of concordance between the fingerprint analysis and voltage sensitivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors combined electrophysiology with FRET assays to monitor how membrane potential modulates the ligand-dependent MOR signaling. The approach was described in their previous work [Ruland et al. Br J Pharmacol 2020, 177(15):3489-3504]. The current study focuses on how different receptor-ligand interactions are associated with differential voltage sensitivities of MOR signaling induced by various opioids. To determine the ligand binding modes, molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis were performed. The authors proposed common receptor-ligand interaction patterns that may mechanically modulate MOR activation upon depolarization and alter Gαi signaling.</p><p>Voltage dependence may indeed be a non-negligible factor in the therapeutic outcome of opioids. Given the clinical importance of opioid analgesics, the large amount of data reported here are an asset in this largely untapped domain of opioid function. Structural insights into the ligand-specific voltage dependence of MOR would be valuable. However, the following aspects of the current manuscript raise concerns.</p><p>1. Accurate ligand binding mode prediction is critical for the conclusion drawn in this work. This can be challenging for ligands that are dissimilar to those in the crystal/cryo-EM structures (i.e. morphinan compounds, DAMGO, JDTic for opioid receptors). In addition, GPCR activation is a complex and dynamic allosteric process. A ligand may have multiple binding poses, and the active pose may not be the most energetically favorable. Even high-resolution experimental structures or elaborated molecular simulations can only partially describe the dynamic ligand-receptor interactions. Docking to a single crystal structure often results in irrelevant binding poses, such as the difficulties encountered with fentanyl in this work. While site-directed mutagenesis is commonly employed to verify ligand binding modes, often times it is not straightforward to interpret the data, due to the allosteric nature of GPCR activation dynamics. The approach in this study appears to perform well on morphinan ligands, for which the binding mode is known. The ability of the model to extrapolate to other scaffolds is questionable. For instance, the current study excluded DAMGO and SR17018 from the applicability domain. How to determine the applicability domain, if one were to use this approach for prospective predictions?</p><p>2. The fingerprint and principal component analyses further simplified the description of ligand-receptor interactions. It appears that the two categories of ligands (increasing or decreasing Gαi signaling upon depolarization) were better separated by the second principal component, which accounted for 14% of the variance in the interactions. To assess the model predictivity, the authors chose two morphinan ligands (etorphine and naloxone) as test cases. However, this does not reflect the model applicability to other ligand scaffolds, since the binding mode of morphinan ligands is known and the morphinan structure can be discriminated from other opioids. How predictive really is this seemingly over simplified model? Other type of ligands should be tested to provide better assessments.</p><p>3. Alternative test cases could be the large number of mutants reported here (Figure S6). Is the docking-fingerprint analysis able to predict the voltage sensitivity of the mutant receptors with the three ligands?</p><p>4. One major challenge here is to predict and verify ligand binding modes. The authors' choice of the PDB 5C1M (e.g. over 6DDE) was, understandably, to be more suitable for docking small molecular agonists. This made it difficult &quot;to calculate a reliable binding mode for DAMGO due to the high flexibility of this peptidergic ligand&quot;. Even small molecules like fentanyl were difficult to predict. There is currently no easy solution. Molecular simulations have been reported to predict the binding mode of fentanyl, PZM21, TRV130, etc., which gave rather inconsistent results. Another possibility is ensemble docking which, however, is also non-trivial.</p><p>I think the key question is: how predictive is the final model, despite the simplifications of docking and principal component analysis? The manuscript as it currently stands, does not allow sufficient evaluation of this point. The authors may either challenge the model with non-morphinan ligands and the mutants, or provide a clearer distinction of the model's applicability domain.</p><p>5. How does the predicted fentanyl binding mode compare with lofentanyl in the recent cryo-EM structure (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.07.471645)?</p><p>6. How does the apo receptor react to depolarization, if the signal is measurable?</p><p>7. Have about the other signaling pathways such as arrestins and GRK? Only some data are present for few ligands. Since the authors mentioned biased signaling in the introduction, one would expect the same analysis on these pathways. I am not suggesting to perform the additional experiments. However, the challenges should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here, the authors build on their prior work to investigate how the efficacy of various opioid agonists at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) depends upon voltage (i.e. upon differences in voltage across the cell membrane). The authors employ a FRET-based screening assay that depends on proximity of the G-α and G-β subunits and monitor whole cell FRET under voltage clamping. First, the authors demonstrate that morphine, but not methadone or fentanyl, exhibits an increased ability to stimulate G-protein activation upon cell depolarization. Previously, the authors examined the voltage dependence of MOR activation by morphine, DAMGO, met-enkephalin and fentanyl (Ruland et al., 2020). Next, the authors used computational docking methods to predict the poses of various opioid ligands in the MOR binding pocket. The authors describe each pose in terms of an interaction 'fingerprint'--i.e. a list of all the residues in the binding pocket that interact with a chemical moiety on the ligand--and then selected residues to mutate to disrupt those interactions to test their binding predictions. Finally, the authors sought to link differences in interaction fingerprints for a given ligand with its voltage dependence, allowing for the identification of distinct sets of residues that engage ligands whose efficacy increases upon depolarization vs. those whose efficacy decreases upon depolarization. Overall, the work presented here could aid in the identification of candidate opioid compounds with certain physiological properties.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Pinpointing the atomic-level mechanisms underlying voltage sensitivity in a membrane protein receptor can be incredibly difficult. Thus, the authors take a chemo-informatics approach to try to correlate ligand-protein interactions with voltage dependence instead. A key strength of this paper is that this general approach could be used to derive predictions about other key properties that may be difficult to investigate using traditional mechanistic/biochemical approaches. Additionally, this same approach affords some predictive power, because one could imagine using the rules developed here to guide design of new ligands with certain voltage-dependent properties.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the manuscript presents, in principle, a sound strategy for examining a hard-to-study property of GPCRs, certain aspects of the experimental design require further support and validation to match the strength of the conclusions drawn.</p><p>First, a major component of the paper relies on the results of chemical docking predictions, which come with several caveats. Recent reports suggest that while docking software can generate numerous reasonable poses, often including the 'correct' pose, correctly ranking poses among a set of top poses remains challenging and may require manual selection of the pose based on chemical intuition. Although the authors do explain how they selected the 'final' pose for each of the predicted poses, it is not clear which other candidate poses might have been considered viable. While the authors use mutagenesis (see more below) to ablate key interactions between chemical groups on the ligand and receptor residues, they do not demonstrate the ability to rule out substantially different and incorrect poses using a similar mutagenesis strategy. On a similar note, although very few structures of MOR bound to different ligands have been experimentally determined, the authors should demonstrate the extent to which their docking approach is able to recover known ligand poses for those few experimentally determined structures. Additionally, they should map the interaction fingerprints resulting from the crystallographic poses into the principal components space shown in e.g. Figure 2F to reveal the similarity of known poses to docked poses for the same and different ligands.</p><p>A second concern stems from the authors' use of mutagenesis, coupled with a measure of receptor activation, as a primary way to validate binding pose predictions. In addition to the concern mentioned in the above paragraph, the authors use a FRET signal that reports on G-protein activation to assess ligand binding. Strictly speaking, one cannot uncouple determinants for binding from determinants for efficacy using this approach. Ideally, the authors would use radioligand binding/competition experiments to demonstrate the impact of mutating a residue on ligand binding, without the confounding variable of ligand efficacy.</p><p>Third, it is exciting to see that ligands that demonstrate either positive or negative activation due to depolarization can be differentiated by their interaction fingerprints with the receptor binding pocket. However, the various models described in the paper's conclusions do not afford an explanation for how voltage could differentially affect ligand binding (and/or activation) via these different surfaces. GPCRs are well known to be modulated by sodium and other ions, as well as by changes in receptor protonation. Without some clear mechanistic explanation of how voltage can impact the structure of the MOR in a ligand-dependent manner, the conclusions of this paper may have limited utility for understanding why GPCRs in general may be voltage sensitive, and how ligand activity may depend on this property.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Differential recognition of opioid analgesics by µ opioid receptors: Predicted interaction patterns correlate with ligand-specific voltage sensitivity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>The editor and reviewers agree that your findings of ligand-dependent voltage sensitivity are intriguing, as is the observation about naloxone acting as a weak agonist under depolarizing conditions (although this also raises questions about physiological implications). However, the fundamental problem with the manuscript as written is the uncertainty about the accuracy of the docking poses. The mutant receptors really would need to be evaluated in a binding assay to look at this, not just a signaling assay. We think a substantially rewritten manuscript could make a more compelling story if it were to focus first and foremost on the experimental data and not emphasize the docking so much, given the impossibility of determining with certainty if the poses are accurate. In addition, now that additional structures of mu-OR bound to various ligands exist, we wonder whether the authors could take advantage of those structures (and MD simulation results described in Qu et al. Nat Chem Biol 2022) to guide mechanistic exploration of ligand-dependent voltage dependence, which would likely lead to a more compelling contribution to the field. If you decide to try and address these concerns with an extensively revised manuscript, we would be willing to consider it as a new submission. You would need to fully address the above concerns and all those detailed in the reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>In general, I am not certain that the authors have sufficiently addressed the concerns I raised previously:</p><p>1) Pose prediction is inherently incredibly difficult, particularly for the mu-opioid receptor, where the ligand binding pocket is flexible, and the chemical structure of ligands vary significantly. Consequently, while docking software can often generate several candidate poses that often include the 'true' pose, pose ranks may not be incredibly reliable. I would recommend that the authors, at a minimum, show for a subset of ligands what the alternative poses look like, and whether they all consistently make the same, or different contacts, within the binding pocket. (i.e. how much does the interaction fingerprint vary with pose?)</p><p>2) An additional, remaining concern is that EC50 measurements of G-protein activation carried out on different mutant receptors, which may have drastically different efficacies, do not directly validate binding pose. I am aware of only two primary ways to evaluate ligand binding directly: (a) radioligand binding/competition experiments or (b) determining the ligand-bound receptor structure, through X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM. I agree that performing either set of these experiments might be prohibitive for the lab and should not necessarily prevent publication certain results within this manuscript, which may be of broad interest to the GPCR community.</p><p>3) Related to the above point, even if we accept that G-protein activation is an acceptable, indirect measure of binding, the authors would still need to demonstrate that mutagenesis experiments enable them to discriminate between correct and incorrect poses. For example, they need to explicitly state the hypothesized effect of a given mutation based on the docked pose, and then demonstrate whether or not the interaction had the 'expected' effect. Otherwise, readers cannot assess whether validation via signaling is working. Although this information is present to some degree in the manuscript, it is incredibly difficult to know exactly what is going on because in Figure 2, not all binding pocket residues are shown within the binding pocket, even if they do not interact; and in Figure 3, the effects of some mutations are shown for some ligands, but not for others.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could carefully go through their manuscript to determine which conclusions are strongly supported by their data, and could re-organize their narrative to emphasize those findings. From my understanding, three key findings of significance that are well supported by the data are that:</p><p>1) The MOR displays different degrees of ligand-dependent voltage sensitivity across a wide array of agonists (Figure 4)</p><p>2) Certain residues in the binding pocket impact G-protein activation in a ligand-dependent manner in the absence of depolarization (Figure 3) and also in the presence of depolarization (Figure 5)--although as noted elsewhere, I do have concerns about how these data are currently presented &amp; interpreted.</p><p>3) Naloxone, a known antagonist, (surprisingly) acts as a weak agonist under depolarizing conditions</p><p>The docking results are certainly interesting, and may be of use to the community, but need to be presented with the appropriate caveats and perhaps should not be the basis for all subsequent investigation in the manuscript.</p><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1. In Figure 3D, I now think that the representation of change in EC50 through a simple ratio (and subsequent color coding) is quite difficult to interpret: e.g. a ratio of 500 indicates that the EC50 has shifted ~2 orders of magnitude to the right for mutant vs. WT. A ratio of 642 corresponds to a highly similar shift-yet this difference is represented as significant in the table, due to the color scheme. Would it be helpful to instead change this to a log (ratio) ?</p><p>2. It does not seem entirely correct to state that there is 'no correlation' between chemical structure and voltage sensitivity: indeed, buprenorphine, etorphine and morphine are all incredibly similar (share a morphinan scaffold), and they cluster together interns of their effects. (Figure S4K-L). Also, in Figure S4M, why do the interaction fingerprints (vertical columns) show all 0s for fentanyl and other similarly-behaved ligands?</p><p>3. In Figure 5, I do not understand why mutations to interacting residues e.g. Y148A and Y148F led to voltage-sensitive responses for morphine-this is just incredibly difficult to understand.</p><p>4. In Figure S2, I had intended for the DAMGO interaction fingerprint to be transformed into the space already described by the principal components analysis performed (i.e. no new PCA needs to be performed-one simply needs to figure out where DAMGO's fingerprint falls in the existing PC space, in order to figure out which DAMGO-MOR interactions are also common to interactions formed by the other ligands with MOR)</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript addresses many of the points raised in the initial round of review, however there are some substantial issues remaining that should, in my view, preclude publication of the manuscript in its current form. Most central is that the docking poses, which are critical to the entirety of the manuscript, remain incompletely evaluated. As noted in the first round of review, using G protein signaling assays with mutant receptors is an inherently confounded approach because G protein activation reflects both binding and signaling. Radioligand binding assays or another direct binding assay would be a more appropriate approach here, but the authors have chosen not to conduct these recommended experiments. A related concern is that expression levels of the mutants are not presented. If mutations affect expression levels, the EC50 value of the ligands may shift for this reason even without any direct change in binding affinity (radioligand assays would not be confounded in this way). Taken together, these shortcomings reduce confidence in the assigned binding poses which underpin the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Differential recognition of opioid analgesics by µ opioid receptors: Predicted interaction patterns correlate with ligand-specific voltage sensitivity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

A surface staining experiment or similar would be required to ensure that expression levels of mutants are not radically altered compared to WT.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by eLife.</p><p>Specifically, all three reviewers raised major concerns about the inherent uncertainty of the docking poses and the fingerprint analysis, which are central to the manuscript and its conclusions. While there may be some paths toward addressing this in principle (see comments below), the reviewers felt that the scope of needed work is beyond what would be reasonable for revision timeline. As a result, we cannot proceed with the current manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Over the past decade or so, a number of studies have demonstrated that multiple GPCRs are sensitive to voltage – i.e. their signaling properties change as a function of membrane voltage. The physiological consequence and relevance of this voltage sensitivity remains poorly understood. The authors recently reported that voltage can influence activation of the mu-opioid receptor, and that this effect is different between opioid receptor agonists (Ruland, BJP 2020), with some agonists causing increased activation of the receptor with depolarization, while other agonists (fentanyl) cause decreased activation with depolarization. In the present study, the authors aim to connect this observation to specific interactions made by different opioid receptor ligands to try to map specific contacts between ligands and the receptor that are responsible for this voltage sensitivity. Here, the authors first establish that different ligands acting at the opioid receptor are differentially sensitive to membrane voltage, e.g. the effect of morphine is increased while that of methadone and fentanyl is decreased. Based on these findings, the authors then dock various opioid ligands into the active conformation of MOR to identify differences in contacts between the ligands. A fingerprint analysis of contacts is used to cluster ligands with similar/different contacts; some of these differential interactions are probed/validated by dose response assays. The authors then suggest that grouping ligands with the fingerprint analysis approach seemed to correlate with voltage sensitivity, and that this correlation came with sufficient power to predict how meptazinol binds and the effect of voltage on etorphine. Specific mutations in the MOR binding pocket were then assessed for their effect on MOR voltage sensitivity to three prototypical opioids (morphien, methadone, and fentanyl) – here, the authors found that some mutations could reverse the directionality of voltage sensitivity for fentanyl and methadone. Finally, membrane depolarization could convert the antagonist naloxone into a weak partial agonist.</p><p>These studies convincingly show that voltage does not simply change the conformation of the MOR, leading to more or less G protein signaling activity. Instead, it is the specific interactions of a ligand with the MOR binding pocket that lead to a specific outcome – these are clearly influenced by specific ligands, and the specific contacts that a given ligand makes with the MOR binding pocket. The most exciting data to the latter point is the remarkable effect that specific mutations can have in converting the effect of voltage on methadone in Figure 6C or in the effect on naloxone.</p><p>Less clear is how well the authors can define these specific interactions. It is not clear whether the docking studies are truly informative in this regard. First, but it is not completely clear whether binding poses for various ligands are truly accurate – the authors efforts to dock fentanyl suggest that there are many potential challenges in obtaining accurate poses. Even with accurate poses, it is unclear whether the fingerprint analysis is robust. For example, it is likely the case that D147(3.32) is a critically important residue for basically all opioids (the authors cite one of the seminal studies demonstrating this). This residue, however, is part of the set used to distinguish ligands (e.g. part of PC2 in Figure 2F). This is reflected in the conclusions – the authors state that ligands with enhanced activity with depolarization interact with ECL2/TM6 while ligands with decreased activation with depolarization interact with TM3. However, this doesn't appear to be concordant with the docking poses presented in Figure 2 as morphine (enhanced activity) is shown to interact with Y148 in TM3.</p><p>Overall this study therefore provides interesting evidence that interactions between the MOR and the ligand in the binding pocket are important for MOR voltage sensitivity. But the specific interactions made and how they drive this behavior remains hard to rationalize based on the docking/fingerprint analysis</p><p>It is unclear why the authors initially present their fentanyl docking results as not being dependent on D147. This suggests that the docking needs further work and doesn't recapitulate key aspects of the binding site.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. We have re-performed the docking and all following analysis. For the docking, we set D147 as mandatory interaction. Further, for fentanyl we used for our analysis the recently published structure of the MOR-fentanyl complex (PDB: 8EFS, Zhuang et al., 2022), as our binding pose was flipped upside down in comparison to this structure. This had no influence on the overall interactions which we calculated. This could be due to the inherent symmetry in fentanyl, making the prediction of a general binding mode for fentanyl in general difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1 – it is very hard to understand how/why morphine gives a negative response in the presence of a depolarizing current. This almost suggests there is a reserve of G protein that cannot interact with the receptor in the absence of depolarization. Some comment on this would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1 we used a FRET-based G-protein activation sensor published by van Unen et al. 2016. This sensor has a fluorescence labeled Gai and Gγ. Upon activation of the receptor, the G-proteins are activated and dissociate or reorient, resulting in a decrease in the FRET emission ratio. With this, a decrease, like seen for morphine, indicates an activation. Further, we used non-saturating concentrations of the respective agonists, resulting in a reserve of G-proteins which are not activated through the application of agonist, but are indeed activated the increased activity of the receptor bound to morphine under depolarized conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 – it is unclear what the axes for PC1 and PC2 mean. Is a more positive value associated with increased reliance on this component?</p></disp-quote><p>Principal Components 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2) represent linear combinations of interaction fingerprints that explain the largest variance in the interaction fingerprints. PC1 and PC2 themselves do not carry any meaning except to represent distances between docking poses based on their interaction fingerprints. We added the following line in the material and methods to make it clearer: “Values on the x- and y-axis, respectively, originate from the linear combination of fingerprint features and do not carry an additional meaning, e.g. likelihood”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In pg 7, the authors suggest that in silico modeling of mutations suggests that ligands bind to the mutated receptors with distinct poses, and this is responsible for the decreased EC50's observed in Figure 3. I think the authors need to be careful here – in general, it is far more likely that the binding pose of various ligands remains similar to the wild-type receptor. For example, it seems quite unlikely that the Y326F mutation would completely flip the pose for fentanyl in the binding site as it is known that D147 is important for fentanyl binding. Similarly, it is highly unlikely that methadone loses an ionic interaction in the H297A mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments and agree with the reviewer to be more cautious here. For this reason, we excluded the docking to the mutated receptor from the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B is very challenging to interpret – it is unclear how the reader is able to figure out what is happening in the voltage dimension.</p></disp-quote><p>We have redone Figure 4B in order to hopefully make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5E – it is unclear whether etorphine has any voltage dependent effect.

It is unclear how this was a predictive result instead of another example of concordance between the fingerprint analysis and voltage sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>As we reperformed the docking calculations, we do not present any predictive results in the manuscript anymore and we excluded Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors combined electrophysiology with FRET assays to monitor how membrane potential modulates the ligand-dependent MOR signaling. The approach was described in their previous work [Ruland et al. Br J Pharmacol 2020, 177(15):3489-3504]. The current study focuses on how different receptor-ligand interactions are associated with differential voltage sensitivities of MOR signaling induced by various opioids. To determine the ligand binding modes, molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis were performed. The authors proposed common receptor-ligand interaction patterns that may mechanically modulate MOR activation upon depolarization and alter Gαi signaling.</p><p>Voltage dependence may indeed be a non-negligible factor in the therapeutic outcome of opioids. Given the clinical importance of opioid analgesics, the large amount of data reported here are an asset in this largely untapped domain of opioid function. Structural insights into the ligand-specific voltage dependence of MOR would be valuable. However, the following aspects of the current manuscript raise major concerns.</p><p>1. Accurate ligand binding mode prediction is critical for the conclusion drawn in this work. This can be challenging for ligands that are dissimilar to those in the crystal/cryo-EM structures (i.e. morphinan compounds, DAMGO, JDTic for opioid receptors). In addition, GPCR activation is a complex and dynamic allosteric process. A ligand may have multiple binding poses, and the active pose may not be the most energetically favorable. Even high-resolution experimental structures or elaborated molecular simulations can only partially describe the dynamic ligand-receptor interactions. Docking to a single crystal structure often results in irrelevant binding poses, such as the difficulties encountered with fentanyl in this work. While site-directed mutagenesis is commonly employed to verify ligand binding modes, often times it is not straightforward to interpret the data, due to the allosteric nature of GPCR activation dynamics. The approach in this study appears to perform well on morphinan ligands, for which the binding mode is known. The ability of the model to extrapolate to other scaffolds is questionable. For instance, the current study excluded DAMGO and SR17018 from the applicability domain. How to determine the applicability domain, if one were to use this approach for prospective predictions?</p></disp-quote><p>We like to thank the review for bringing up this point, we now included SR17018 in the analysis. The reviewer is right that our findings may not extend to predictions of arbitrary ligands, and as we are not performing systematic predictions in this manuscript, this is difficult to quantitatively assess. Still, based on our observations during the revisions to this manuscript, we feel confident that we are able to give the reader cautionary advice, and therefore added the following line in page 5 under Results: “Along these lines, we suggest that the use of our findings in a predictive manner should only be attempted for ligands with similar physicochemical characteristics (including the size; Table S1) and binding locations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The fingerprint and principal component analyses further simplified the description of ligand-receptor interactions. It appears that the two categories of ligands (increasing or decreasing Gαi signaling upon depolarization) were better separated by the second principal component, which accounted for 14% of the variance in the interactions. To assess the model predictivity, the authors chose two morphinan ligands (etorphine and naloxone) as test cases. However, this does not reflect the model applicability to other ligand scaffolds, since the binding mode of morphinan ligands is known and the morphinan structure can be discriminated from other opioids. How predictive really is this seemingly over simplified model? Other type of ligands should be tested to provide better assessments.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our reply to the previous point 1, we think that a systematic analysis of this question is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Moreover, we did not really intend to suggest to use our findings in a predictive manner. Of course, if our hypotheses are correct, this should be possible, but we tried to carefully rephrase the text so that we do not make this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Alternative test cases could be the large number of mutants reported here (Figure S6). Is the docking-fingerprint analysis able to predict the voltage sensitivity of the mutant receptors with the three ligands?</p></disp-quote><p>The docking calculations to the mutant receptors are complicated due to the sensitivity of docking towards slight changes in the binding pocket. Therefore, we decided to exclude the docking to mutant receptors, especially since we do not have the crystallographic structure of the mutants available and can therefore not assess the validity of our computational predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. One major challenge here is to predict and verify ligand binding modes. The authors' choice of the PDB 5C1M (e.g. over 6DDE) was, understandably, to be more suitable for docking small molecular agonists. This made it difficult &quot;to calculate a reliable binding mode for DAMGO due to the high flexibility of this peptidergic ligand&quot;. Even small molecules like fentanyl were difficult to predict. There is currently no easy solution. Molecular simulations have been reported to predict the binding mode of fentanyl, PZM21, TRV130, etc., which gave rather inconsistent results.

The manuscript as it currently stands, does not allow sufficient evaluation of this point. The authors may either challenge the model with non-morphinan ligands and the mutants, or provide a clearer distinction of the model's applicability domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern with regards to the applicability and have added the following line in page 5 under Results: “Along these lines, we suggest that the use of our findings in a predictive manner should only be attempted for ligands with similar physicochemical characteristics (including the size; Table S1) and binding locations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

However, the challenges should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the biased signaling in the introduction. As we worked with several partial agonists, the measurement in GRK or Arrestin assays is not simple. We tried to perform the assays, but they did not really work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here, the authors build on their prior work to investigate how the efficacy of various opioid agonists at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) depends upon voltage (i.e. upon differences in voltage across the cell membrane). The authors employ a FRET-based screening assay that depends on proximity of the G-α and G-β subunits and monitor whole cell FRET under voltage clamping. First, the authors demonstrate that morphine, but not methadone or fentanyl, exhibits an increased ability to stimulate G-protein activation upon cell depolarization. Previously, the authors examined the voltage dependence of MOR activation by morphine, DAMGO, met-enkephalin and fentanyl (Ruland et al., 2020). Next, the authors used computational docking methods to predict the poses of various opioid ligands in the MOR binding pocket. The authors describe each pose in terms of an interaction 'fingerprint'--i.e. a list of all the residues in the binding pocket that interact with a chemical moiety on the ligand--and then selected residues to mutate to disrupt those interactions to test their binding predictions. Finally, the authors sought to link differences in interaction fingerprints for a given ligand with its voltage dependence, allowing for the identification of distinct sets of residues that engage ligands whose efficacy increases upon depolarization vs. those whose efficacy decreases upon depolarization. Overall, the work presented here could aid in the identification of candidate opioid compounds with certain physiological properties.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Pinpointing the atomic-level mechanisms underlying voltage sensitivity in a membrane protein receptor can be incredibly difficult. Thus, the authors take a chemo-informatics approach to try to correlate ligand-protein interactions with voltage dependence instead. A key strength of this paper is that this general approach could be used to derive predictions about other key properties that may be difficult to investigate using traditional mechanistic/biochemical approaches. Additionally, this same approach affords some predictive power, because one could imagine using the rules developed here to guide design of new ligands with certain voltage-dependent properties.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the manuscript presents, in principle, a sound strategy for examining a hard-to-study property of GPCRs, certain aspects of the experimental design require further support and validation to match the strength of the conclusions drawn.</p><p>First, a major component of the paper relies on the results of chemical docking predictions, which come with several caveats. Recent reports suggest that while docking software can generate numerous reasonable poses, often including the 'correct' pose, correctly ranking poses among a set of top poses remains challenging and may require manual selection of the pose based on chemical intuition. Although the authors do explain how they selected the 'final' pose for each of the predicted poses, it is not clear which other candidate poses might have been considered viable. While the authors use mutagenesis (see more below) to ablate key interactions between chemical groups on the ligand and receptor residues, they do not demonstrate the ability to rule out substantially different and incorrect poses using a similar mutagenesis strategy. On a similar note, although very few structures of MOR bound to different ligands have been experimentally determined, the authors should demonstrate the extent to which their docking approach is able to recover known ligand poses for those few experimentally determined structures. Additionally, they should map the interaction fingerprints resulting from the crystallographic poses into the principal components space shown in e.g. Figure 2F to reveal the similarity of known poses to docked poses for the same and different ligands.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their concern. We re-did the docking and only selected the best scored pose for each ligand with the exception of Pethidine. We also compared the docking pose of fentanyl to the one in the recently published structure of MOR (PDB 8EF5) and found that despite the binding pose being flipped, the overall interactions were comparable. This is due to the high inherent symmetry of fentanyl. We added the analysis of the previously calculated docking pose in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second concern stems from the authors' use of mutagenesis, coupled with a measure of receptor activation, as a primary way to validate binding pose predictions. In addition to the concern mentioned in the above paragraph, the authors use a FRET signal that reports on G-protein activation to assess ligand binding. Strictly speaking, one cannot uncouple determinants for binding from determinants for efficacy using this approach. Ideally, the authors would use radioligand binding/competition experiments to demonstrate the impact of mutating a residue on ligand binding, without the confounding variable of ligand efficacy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. However, the main conclusions of this work deal with the voltage sensitivity. Radioligand binding or competition experiments are not practicable in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, it is exciting to see that ligands that demonstrate either positive or negative activation due to depolarization can be differentiated by their interaction fingerprints with the receptor binding pocket. However, the various models described in the paper's conclusions do not afford an explanation for how voltage could differentially affect ligand binding (and/or activation) via these different surfaces. GPCRs are well known to be modulated by sodium and other ions, as well as by changes in receptor protonation. Without some clear mechanistic explanation of how voltage can impact the structure of the MOR in a ligand-dependent manner, the conclusions of this paper may have limited utility for understanding why GPCRs in general may be voltage sensitive, and how ligand activity may depend on this property.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot give an accurate mechanism for the impact of voltage on the overall structure of the MOR with these results. Our identified residues important for voltage sensitivity of the MOR are for example not known to be part of the GPCR activation pathways which where described elsewhere (see Hauser et al. 2021). It was also shown before that for example the sodium ion is not part of the voltage sensing mechanisms of GPCRs (see Ågren et al., 2018 and Tauber &amp; Chaim, 2022).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>In general, I am not certain that the authors have sufficiently addressed the concerns I raised previously:</p><p>1) Pose prediction is inherently incredibly difficult, particularly for the mu-opioid receptor, where the ligand binding pocket is flexible, and the chemical structure of ligands vary significantly. Consequently, while docking software can often generate several candidate poses that often include the 'true' pose, pose ranks may not be incredibly reliable. I would recommend that the authors, at a minimum, show for a subset of ligands what the alternative poses look like, and whether they all consistently make the same, or different contacts, within the binding pocket. (i.e. how much does the interaction fingerprint vary with pose?)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this point. We repeated our fingerprint analysis for all tested ligands with not only the highest ranked poses but also with the top three poses according to energy score (Supplemental Figure 3B). The resulting fingerprints did not vary to a large extent between the top three poses, suggesting our computational pose prediction is suitable for further evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An additional, remaining concern is that EC50 measurements of G-protein activation carried out on different mutant receptors, which may have drastically different efficacies, do not directly validate binding pose. I am aware of only two primary ways to evaluate ligand binding directly: (a) radioligand binding/competition experiments or (b) determining the ligand-bound receptor structure, through X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM. I agree that performing either set of these experiments might be prohibitive for the lab and should not necessarily prevent publication certain results within this manuscript, which may be of broad interest to the GPCR community.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point again. We have now performed fluorescent ligand competition experiments for all of our mutants with the agonists morphine, methadone and fentanyl and calculated IC50 values for the respective agonists (figure 3B-D, supplemental figure 5-6). The results are in line with our previous evaluation of the mutant receptors, supporting our calculated interactions between ligand and receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above point, even if we accept that G-protein activation is an acceptable, indirect measure of binding, the authors would still need to demonstrate that mutagenesis experiments enable them to discriminate between correct and incorrect poses. For example, they need to explicitly state the hypothesized effect of a given mutation based on the docked pose, and then demonstrate whether or not the interaction had the 'expected' effect. Otherwise, readers cannot assess whether validation via signaling is working. Although this information is present to some degree in the manuscript, it is incredibly difficult to know exactly what is going on because in Figure 2, not all binding pocket residues are shown within the binding pocket, even if they do not interact; and in Figure 3, the effects of some mutations are shown for some ligands, but not for others.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have now measured the binding directly via fluorescent ligand competition experiments. Further, we have reduced our statements to the point that we calculated interactions which we have confirmed via binding and signaling experiments. In addition, we have added 2D interaction maps displaying the calculated interactions (Figure 2D-G), which should simplify the understanding of our statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps the authors could carefully go through their manuscript to determine which conclusions are strongly supported by their data, and could re-organize their narrative to emphasize those findings. From my understanding, three key findings of significance that are well supported by the data are that:</p><p>1) The MOR displays different degrees of ligand-dependent voltage sensitivity across a wide array of agonists (Figure 4)</p><p>2) Certain residues in the binding pocket impact G-protein activation in a ligand-dependent manner in the absence of depolarization (Figure 3) and also in the presence of depolarization (Figure 5)--although as noted elsewhere, I do have concerns about how these data are currently presented &amp; interpreted.</p><p>3) Naloxone, a known antagonist, (surprisingly) acts as a weak agonist under depolarizing conditions</p><p>The docking results are certainly interesting, and may be of use to the community, but need to be presented with the appropriate caveats and perhaps should not be the basis for all subsequent investigation in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, but as we present the data in this study is how we were performing all analysis: we observed the ligand specific voltage sensitivity of the MOR (as published before, Ruland et al. 2020). We next performed docking calculations and out of these calculations we searched for possible important interactions and decided to mutate these different residues in the ligand binding pocket.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1. In Figure 3D, I now think that the representation of change in EC50 through a simple ratio (and subsequent color coding) is quite difficult to interpret: e.g. a ratio of 500 indicates that the EC50 has shifted ~2 orders of magnitude to the right for mutant vs. WT. A ratio of 642 corresponds to a highly similar shift-yet this difference is represented as significant in the table, due to the color scheme. Would it be helpful to instead change this to a log (ratio) ?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point, we have changed the EC50 to pEC50, and pIC50 respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It does not seem entirely correct to state that there is 'no correlation' between chemical structure and voltage sensitivity: indeed, buprenorphine, etorphine and morphine are all incredibly similar (share a morphinan scaffold), and they cluster together interns of their effects. (Figure S4K-L). Also, in Figure S4M, why do the interaction fingerprints (vertical columns) show all 0s for fentanyl and other similarly-behaved ligands?</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis in supplemental Figure 7 K-L revealed no correlation between the ligands. But indeed, it is correct that al morphinan ligands behave the same way, but also ligands with a completely different scaffold show the same effect (like pethidine and PZM21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 5, I do not understand why mutations to interacting residues e.g. Y148A and Y148F led to voltage-sensitive responses for morphine-this is just incredibly difficult to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We showed that these to mutants still enable binding of morphine and induce Gprotein activation (Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 4-6), but the EC50 is shifted. For this, we increased the dose of morphine for the measurements shown in Figure 5A. Here we can still detect a morphine induced G-protein activation which is also sensitive for voltage changes. Comparable to WT, the G-protein activation is increased upon depolarization, but the voltage induced increase in activation is smaller than for WT (Y148F, Figure 5A green trace) or increased in comparison to WT (Y148A, pink trace). Overall, all mutants still led to a voltage-sensitive response for morphine, as for all mutants the morphine induced G-protein activation was increased upon depolarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure S2, I had intended for the DAMGO interaction fingerprint to be transformed into the space already described by the principal components analysis performed (i.e. no new PCA needs to be performed-one simply needs to figure out where DAMGO's fingerprint falls in the existing PC space, in order to figure out which DAMGO-MOR interactions are also common to interactions formed by the other ligands with MOR)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed this analysis as shown in Supplemental Figure 3D. DAMGO does in this analysis still nut cluster with any of the other ligands, confirming the substantially different behavior of DAMGO in the docking and fingerprint analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>The revised manuscript addresses many of the points raised in the initial round of review, however there are some substantial issues remaining that should, in my view, preclude publication of the manuscript in its current form. Most central is that the docking poses, which are critical to the entirety of the manuscript, remain incompletely evaluated. As noted in the first round of review, using G protein signaling assays with mutant receptors is an inherently confounded approach because G protein activation reflects both binding and signaling. Radioligand binding assays or another direct binding assay would be a more appropriate approach here, but the authors have chosen not to conduct these recommended experiments. A related concern is that expression levels of the mutants are not presented. If mutations affect expression levels, the EC50 value of the ligands may shift for this reason even without any direct change in binding affinity (radioligand assays would not be confounded in this way). Taken together, these shortcomings reduce confidence in the assigned binding poses which underpin the rest of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point, we have, as mentioned above, now performed direct binding assays using fluorescent ligand competition experiments, which are in line with our previous results. Using the fluorescent ligand, we also could show that the mutant receptors are expressed in comparable levels as the WT (Supplemental Figure 5 T). All mutants which were able to bind the fluorescent ligand showed no significant different maximum intensities in comparison to WT, suggesting they are expressed in comparable levels. For the mutants which did not bind the fluorescent ligand anymore, we cannot make any statements regarding expression levels.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the third round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Although two of the reviewers who saw your earlier manuscript think the new revised manuscript is considerably improved, one of the reviewers would like to see data on the expression levels of the mutants to verify that they express to comparable levels. The reviewers also have several minor comments that should be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors present a thorough and thoughtful revision of their manuscript, largely addressing prior reviewer critiques. Most importantly, they have effectively addressed concerns about docking poses with new direct binding data (although these data are still somewhat noisy) and with analysis of not only the top-scoring pose but now the top three poses. I have one significant concern remaining, which I believe should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Specifically, a variety of mutants are presented, but it appears these were evaluated only for DAMGO sensitivity in signaling and in competition assays, but not expression per se. A surface staining experiment or similar would be required to ensure that expression levels of mutants are not radically altered compared to WT. DAMGO activation is a proxy for expression and folding in some sense, but will also be influenced by mutation effects on DAMGO potency/efficacy, and might reflect pathway-saturated conditions where partial agonists would be sensitive to expression differences while full agonists like DAMGO are not. In general, evaluating receptor point mutants can be complex because they may affect expression, trafficking, ligand potency, and ligand efficacy. Direct measurements of many of these properties help to ensure correct interpretation of why mutations have the effects they do.</p><p>A variety of mutants are presented, but it appears these were evaluated only for DAMGO sensitivity in signaling and in competition assays, but not expression per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the editor and reviewers again for their critical remarks.</p><p>As reviewer 1 pointed out, we did not evaluate the expression levels of the receptor mutants per se. To address this, we performed western blot analysis with all mutants and compared their expression levels with the expression of the WT receptor. With this, we could confirm that all the mutants were expressed in comparable levels as the WT receptor. You can find these updated results in Figure 3 —figure supplement 4</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the paper seems to have improved, both in terms of presentation of results and high-level ideas and in terms of additional efforts made to directly characterize ligand-binding affinity via displacement assay.</p><p>One small recommendation is to avoid presenting main-text data as numerical tables in figures, e.g. especially in Figure 3D, I recommend presenting the data in perhaps a bar graph format, and using some sort of scheme to indicate the predicted vs. actual effect of the mutant on binding and activation (the latter may go in the paper's supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment.
