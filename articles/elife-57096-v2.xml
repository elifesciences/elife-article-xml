proton-gated cation channels that are involved in diverse neuronal processes including pain sensing. The peptide toxin Mambalgin1 (Mamba1) from black mamba snake venom can reversibly inhibit the conductance of ASICs, causing an analgesic effect. However, the detailed mechanism by which Mamba1 inhibits ASIC1s, especially how Mamba1 binding to the extracellular domain affects the conformational changes of the transmembrane domain of ASICs remains elusive. Here, we present single-particle cryo-EM structures of human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) and the hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex at resolutions of 3.56 and 3.90 Å, respectively. The structures revealed the inhibited conformation of hASIC1a upon Mamba1 binding. The combination of the structural and physiological data indicates that Mamba1 preferentially binds hASIC1a in a closed state and reduces the proton sensitivity of the channel, representing a closed-state trapping mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acid-sensing ion channel</kwd><kwd>snake toxin</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM structure</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0505201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31600601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Changlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91753205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0400903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Demeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0505403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21778051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Changlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GJHZ201946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Changlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mambalgin1 binds to the thumb domain of human ASIC1a channel and inhibits the channel through hindering the proton-induced transitions from the resting closed state to the active and/or desensitized state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are a group of voltage-independent proton-gated cation channels belonging to the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kellenberger and Schild, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krishtal and Pidoplichko, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Waldmann et al., 1997</xref>).

Therefore, ASICs have emerged as potential therapeutic targets in the management of psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron and Lingueglia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rash, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wemmie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wemmie et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Peptide toxins from venom are the most potent and subtype-selective ASIC modulators and thus have been very powerful tools for studying the gating and modulation mechanisms of ASICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalia et al., 2015</xref>). In the past decade, structures of chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) in different states have been reported. These include structures of the apo-form cASIC1 in the inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>), desensitized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>) and resting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>) states and of venom-bound states: the MitTx-bound open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>), and the PcTx1-bound ion-selective, nonselective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>), and inactive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>). Structural studies of cASIC1-toxin complexes, combined with the structure of cASIC1 alone, have revealed a comprehensive molecular mechanism for proton-dependent gating in ASICs. In the resting state, the position of the thumb domain lies farther away from the threefold molecular axis, thereby expanding the ‘acidic pocket’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). In the open and desensitized states, the ‘closure’ of the thumb domain into the acidic pocket expands the lower palm domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>), leading to an iris-like opening of the channel gate.</p><p>Mambalgin1 (Mamba1), a 57-residue three-finger toxin isolated from the venom of the black mamba snake (<italic>Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis),</italic> has been proven to be a potent, rapid and reversible inhibitor of ASIC1a- or ASIC1b-containing channels in both central and peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diochot et al., 2012</xref>). Mamba1 has an analgesic effect that is as strong as that of morphine but does not involve opioid receptors, highlighting its potential utility for the management of pain. A detailed investigation of the binding of Mamba1 to human ASICs and its resulting modulatory effect could provide insights into the mechanism of interaction between toxins and ASICs and could offer crucial clues for the development of new drugs targeting ASICs.</p><p>It should be pointed out that, to date, all ASIC structures solved and gating mechanism reported have been of chicken ASIC1, which can be pharmacologically quite different when compared to human ASIC1a despite ~89% sequence identity. Functional studies have shown that human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) and cASIC1 exhibit different responses to the channel activity modulation toxins Mamba1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In our own experiments, synthetic Mamba1 was observed to inhibit the channel currents of both recombinant hASIC1a and cASIC1 in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The inhibitory effects of Mamba1 on both full-length hASIC1a and cASIC1 are concentration dependent, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 197.3 ± 37.4 and 123.6 ± 28.5 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Interestingly, in the presence of 500 nM Mamba1, hASIC1a and cASIC1 showed decreases of 60.4 ± 12.9% and 19.6 ± 6.1% respectively, in the measured sodium currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). At saturation (10 μM Mamba1), hASIC1a and cASIC1 showed decreases in the measured sodium currents of 78.9 ± 6.2% and 31.9 ± 4.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These data indicated that Mamba1 acts as an inhibitor targeting both hASIC1a and cASIC1, with comparable affinities but different efficacies. These observations suggested that functional and pharmacological differences exist between chicken ASIC1 and human ASIC1a, thus leading to the question of whether the structures of cASIC1 can fully recapitulate the functional states of hASIC1a. Therefore, structural studies on human ASICs are necessary to define functional states and provide comprehensive insights into the gating and toxin peptide modulation mechanisms of human ASICs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional analysis of hASIC1a and hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Typical current traces representing the inhibition of recombinant hASIC1a (left), cASIC1 (middle) and hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> (right) by Mamba1 toxin in CHO cells.

The structure of apo-hASIC1a was shown to be highly similar to that of cASIC1 in the resting state. Comparison of the structures of hASIC1a in the apo-form and the Mamba1-bound state revealed minor structural deviations. Electrophysiological studies revealed that Mamba1 prefers to bind hASIC1a in a closed state. Direct interactions between residues in Mamba1 and acid-sensing residues in the ‘acidic pocket’ of hASIC1a were observed to reduce the apparent proton sensitivity of the hASIC1a channel, leading to channel inhibition. These data indicate that the mechanism by which Mamba1 inhibits hASIC1a channel is closed-state trapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional characterization and structure determinations</title><p>To facilitate the expression and purification of hASIC1a, a series of truncations of full-length hASIC1a was performed. Finally, truncated hASIC1a with the 60 carboxyl terminal residues removed (named hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>) was determined to be functional by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. The hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> channel exhibits electrophysiological properties very similar to those of the full-length channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). Mamba1 inhibits hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> channels with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 106.6 ± 23.6 nM, which is comparable to the reported IC<sub>50</sub> of full-length hASIC1a in CHO cells (148.6 ± 33.2 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To better understand the structure and toxin modulation of human ASICs, we set out to purify hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>, construct the hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>-Mamba1 complex in vitro and subject the protein and protein complex to single-particle cryo-EM studies.</p><p>The hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> protein was overexpressed and purified from <italic>sf9</italic> insect cells.

The details of protein purification, complex construction, cryo-sample preparation, image acquisition, data processing, model building, and structure refinement can be found in the Materials and methods section. Briefly, recombinant hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> protein was purified from <italic>sf9</italic> cells in the presence of 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and subjected to cryo-EM studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Micrographs were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit detector. A 3D EM map of apo-form hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> was reconstructed to an overall resolution of 3.56 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Following a similar protocol, the EM map of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> in complex with Mamba1 was obtained at 3.90 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cryo-EM structure of apo-hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup></title><p>The trimeric hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> shows a canonical chalice-like architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). Each subunit of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> harbors a cysteine-rich extracellular domain (ECD). The ECD resembles a hand-like architecture with the palm, knuckle, finger and thumb domains clenching a ‘ball’ of β strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In the transmembrane domain (TMD) of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>, two transmembrane helices, TM1 and TM2, are observed to connect to the β1 and β12 strands of the palm domain at a juncture called the ‘wrist’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The density map of TM2 provides convincing evidence that the helix is not a continuous α-helix but rather has a break in the helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The helical structure of TM2 ends at Ile443 and resumes at Ile447. Residues Gly444, Ala445, and Ser446 adopt a nonhelical conformation, dividing TM2 into segments TM2a and TM2b.

However, the relatively low resolution (5.7 Å) could not show a reliable binding interface analysis between Mamba1 and cASIC1. Herein, the cryo-EM structure of the hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>-Mamba1 complex at 3.9 Å resolution illuminates a more detailed binding interface between Mamba1 and hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>. The binding of Mamba1 to hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> induces a conformational change in Finger-II of Mamba1. The tip region of Finger-II flips to the thumb domain of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> to facilitate the interaction between the toxin and the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>). In the tip region of Finger-II, Arg28 is oriented toward the α5 helix of the thumb domain, thus becoming closer to Asp347 and Asp351. The measured distances between the Cα atoms of Arg28-Asp347 and Arg28-Asp351 are 10.5 and 10.2 Å, respectively. Although the side chains of Arg28, Asp347 and Asp351 cannot be clearly assigned, it seems there could be salt bridges between Arg28 and Asp347 or Asp351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Phe352, a residue that is conserved in ASIC1 orthologues, is nestled within a hydrophobic cluster composed of Met25, Phe27, Leu32 and Leu33 in Finger-II of Mamba1, mediating a hydrophobic interaction between Mamba1 and hASIC1a<sup>ΔC </sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Moreover, Mamba1 could form multiple polar contacts with hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> through its Finger-I region. Mamba1-Gln5 and His6 could form hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Tyr360 of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>. Mamba1-Lys8 could form salt bridges with Asp300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Notably, Finger-III of Mamba1 is located farther from the thumb domain of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>, pointing in the opposite direction from the threefold axis of the channel core. Finger-III thus has no contact with hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The upper scaffold region of Mamba1 likewise does not contact hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>.</p><p>To verify the toxin-channel interactions, individual mutations were introduced into Mamba1 and the possible counterpart interaction regions on hASIC1a. The inhibition of hASIC1a activity by Mamba1 is greatly reduced when residue Mamba1-Gln5, His6, Lys8, Phe27 or Arg28 is mutated to Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Mamba1 is significantly less effective in inhibiting the hASIC1a mutants Asp347Ala, Asp351Gly, Phe352Leu and Tyr360Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

One-dimensional <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectra indicate a significant change in chemical shift for residues Mamba1-Phe27 (within Finger-II) upon hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> protein titration, and slight changes for Leu30 and Leu32, whereas no change is observed for residue Phe18 (as a negative control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

It has been reported previously that the neutralization of Asp346 and Asp350 in cASIC1 (corresponding to Asp347 and Asp351 in hASIC1a) has profound effects on either pH<sub>50</sub> or the apparent Hill coefficient, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). The Asp346Asn mutation shifts the pH dependence of cASIC1 activation to more acidic values (6.35 ± 0.04 to 5.58 ± 0.02) and reduces the Hill coefficient from approximately 9 to 5, and the Asp350Asn mutation diminishes the Hill coefficient to approximately three and has little effect on pH<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). Our data show that hASIC1a-Asp347Ala and hASIC1a-Asp351Gly both shift the pH-dependent activation curves to more acidic pHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d</xref>). The Asp347Ala and Asp351Gly mutations shift the activation curve of hASIC1a by 0.59 and 0.42 pH units, respectively, with pH<sub>50</sub> values of 5.88 ± 0.03 and 6.04 ± 0.05. The mutations reduce the Hill coefficient from approximately 4 to 2. Meanwhile, Mamba1 is able to shift the activation curves of the hASIC1a-Asp347Ala and hASIC1a-Asp351Gly mutants further, with pH<sub>50</sub> values of 5.72 ± 0.01 and 5.79 ± 0.02, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d</xref>). We suggest that probable interactions between Asp347 and/or Asp351 of hASIC1a and Mamba1 shield the protonation of the two residues, thus reducing the proton sensitivity of hASIC1a. On the other hand, the interaction between Asp351 and Mamba1 could hinder the interaction between Asp351 and Arg190 (located at the β-ball), which is critical for the collapse of the acidic pocket in active or desensitized channels. Therefore, we suspect that Mamba1 inhibits the hASIC1a channel by hindering proton-induced transitions from the resting closed states to the active and/or desensitized states in a model of closed-state trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><p>Notably, Asp347 and Asp351 are not the only proton-sensing residues in hASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). Glu79, Glu219, Glu409 and Glu418, which are located in the palm domain, which have no direct contact with Mamba1, were also found to participate either in proton binding or in subsequent conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krauson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramaswamy et al., 2013</xref>). This observation may explain why Mamba1 can inhibit only approximately 80% of the hASIC1a current and loses its inhibitory effect on hASIC1a at a lower pH, such as pH 4.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The intradomain interaction affects the Mamba1 inhibition of ASIC</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, although Mamba1 has similar affinity to hASIC1a and cASIC1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 197.3 ± 37.4 and 123.6 ± 28.5 nM, respectively), the toxin shows a stronger inhibitory effect on hASIC1a than on cASIC1 channels. In fact, the amino acid sequences of hASIC1a and cASIC1 are highly similar (89% identity), and the sequences of the thumb domain of the two orthologues are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This similarity may explain the similar affinity of Mamba1 in targeting hASIC1a and cASIC1. Comparison of the apo-form structure of hASIC1a with the resting-state structure of the cASIC1 channel, together with the structure of the hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex, showed comparable expansion of the acid pocket between chicken and human ASIC1a channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>). The key residues (such as Asp346 and Phe351) on the α5 helix in the thumb domain of chicken ASIC1 channels that participate in Mamba1 binding are also critical in human ASIC1a channels. These observations suggest that the different inhibitory efficacies of Mamba1 on cASIC1 and hASIC1a channels could not be due to the toxin-channel interaction.</p><p>Through sequence alignment analysis and structure comparison, several key residues that do not contribute to Mamba1 binding were found to contribute to the different inhibitory effects of Mamba1 on hASIC1a and cASIC1. These residues include Gln102, Arg155 (both located in the finger domain of hASIC1a) and Asp167 (located in the palm domain), which are mapped to Arg103, Leu156 and Glu168 of cASIC1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). In cASIC1, Leu156 is observed to interact with the hydrophobic pocket composed of Phe189, Val327 and Tyr334 in the thumb domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The hydrophobic contact could participate in the interaction between the finger and thumb domains. Meanwhile, Arg103 and Glu168 could form electrostatic interaction pairs with each other (the distance between the Cα atom of the two residues was measured to be 13.3 Å), mediating the contact between the finger and palm domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). It was reported that the movement of the finger domain plays a critical role in the activation of ASICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gwiazda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauson and Carattino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramaswamy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). The replacement of Leu156 by Arg155 and of Arg103-Glu168 by Gln102-Asp167 in hASIC1a result in disruption of intradomain interactions, thus leading to enhanced inhibition of the channel by Mamba1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Structural basis for the differing activities of hASIC1a versus cASIC1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequence alignment of hASIC1a and cASIC1 indicates key residues that may contribute to the inhibitory effect of Mamba1 on ASIC.

The same was true for the Arg and Glu substitutions at hASIC1a-Gln102 and Asp167, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e–f</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that intrasubunit interactions play critical roles in the activity modulation of ASICs from different species by toxins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, many electrophysiological studies of ASIC1 channels have been based on mice, rats and chickens. Crystal or cryo-EM structures of chicken ASIC1 in different states were reported as illustrating the gating mechanism of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we report the first structure of the human ASIC1a channel determined using single-particle cryo-EM with a resolution of 3.56 Å.</p><p>The structure of hASIC1a in the apo-form at pH 8.0 reflects the resting state of the channel. hASIC1a in the resting state has an identical structure to that of the cASIC1 channel, especially the expanded acidic pocket and the extended ‘GAS’ motif. In fact, the human ASIC1a channel and chicken ASIC1 channel have high-sequence homology (89% identity). These indicate that hASIC1a and cASIC1 channels may share a similar gating mechanism. That is, the resting-state hASIC1a channel has an expanded acidic pocket, with the thumb domain far away from the central β-ball and the finger and palm domains. Activation and desensitization of the channel both involve the collapse of the acidic pocket, which allows the thumb and finger domains to approach and interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). However, the structures of human ASIC in the active or desensitized state remain unknown. Resolving the structures of the active or desensitized hASIC1a will help to address this supposition.</p><p>In recent decades, venom toxin peptides have been observed to bind ASICs with high affinity and specificity, providing an excellent resource for the definition of different functional states of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohlen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diochot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diochot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escoubas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>). We also report here the structure of the human ASIC1a channel in complex with the snake peptide toxin Mamba1 with resolution 3.90 Å, reflecting the toxin-inhibited state of the channel. A first important conclusion is that, the structure of the hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex confirms that the Mamba1 binding site is located in the thumb domain of the hASIC1a channel. Compared with the previously reported structures of the cASIC1 channel in complex with toxins PcTx1, MitTx or Mamba1, these toxins interact with the ASIC channel through overlapping, but not identical surfaces. The thumb domain is a hot spot that mediates toxin-channel interactions. However, the Mamba1-binding site is totally located in the thumb domain of the hASIC1a channel, and does not involve other sub-domains. In contrast, the toxin-binding surfaces for MitTx and PcTx1 involve the β-ball and the palm domain in addition to the thumb domain. These observations could explain the fact that MitTx and PcTx1 have much higher affinity than Mamba1 targeting ASIC channels.</p><p>Moreover, structure comparison of hASIC1a in the apo-form and in complex with Mamba1 reveals that Mamba1 binding does not alter the closed structure of hASIC1a in a resting state. Therefore, we conclude that Mamba1 inhibits hASIC1a through a closed-state trapping mechanism, precluding the previously proposed allosteric-based channel modulation mode. Furthermore, the binding of Mamba1 to hASIC1a is state-dependent. The toxin preferentially binds to the closed state but not the active or desensitized state of ASICs. Mamba1 inhibits ASICs by shifting the pH-dependence of activation to a more acidic pH, decreasing their apparent affinity for protons. In fact, the state-dependent trapping mechanism has been found in the modulation of voltage-gated ion channel activity by peptide toxins. It is proposed that voltage sensor trapping is the fundamental mechanism of action of polypeptide toxins that alter the voltage-dependent gating of sodium, calcium, and potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cestèle et al., 1998</xref>). For the ASIC channel, the two Asp residues in the α5 helix of the thumb domain contribute to proton sensing during channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the thumb domain could act as the ‘proton sensor’ of the channel. Accordingly, we conclude that Mamba1 toxin inhibits ASIC channel activity through a closed-state dependent ‘proton sensor trapping’ mechanism, sharing a common mechanism of polypeptide toxins modulating ion channel activity.</p><p>Mamba1 showed a stronger effect on hASIC1a than on cASIC1. Previous reported key residues (such as Asp346 and Phe351) on the α5 helix in the thumb domain of the chicken ASIC1 channel that participated in Mamba1 binding were also critical in the human ASIC1a channel. The structural analysis and mutation experiments suggested that the different inhibitory effects of Mamba1 targeting cASIC1 and hASIC1a channels might be due to the mechanism of channel activation rather than the difference in toxin-channel interactions. Several key amino acid differences between hASIC1a and cASIC1, including Arg155 and the Glu102-Asp165 pair in hASIC1a (corresponding to Leu156 and Arg103-Glu168 in cASIC1, respectively), are found to contribute to the different responses of hASIC1a and cASIC1 to Mamba1. Due to the relatively low resolution, our structures reported here could not provide detailed structural evidence sufficient to support this finding. It is important to address how the coupling among the extracellular subdomains of ASIC, including the thumb, finger, palm and β-ball, affects channel activity and toxin action on the channel.</p><p>ASIC channels are of fundamental importance and are also considered potential drug targets in therapeutic interventions against pain and ischemic stroke. There is no doubt that analysis of interactions between venom toxin and hASIC1a or peptide toxin-based drug development should follow structure and function studies on human source target proteins, as data on homologous target proteins from other species might not precisely reflect the modulatory effects of the peptide or of other ligands on the target proteins, which will strongly influence the process of drug development for human target proteins. Our studies on the human ASIC1a channel could obviously be very valuable for drug development targeting ASIC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>hASIC1a</td><td>GeneBank</td><td>NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001086.2</td><td>All hASIC1a mutants transfected in the paper were obtained starting from this wild-type cDNA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>Top10</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# 18258012</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DH10Bac</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# 10361012</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>)</td><td>Sf9</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# 11496015;

Cryo-EM sample of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>-Mamba1 complex was prepared similarly with the concentration of 3.1 mg/ml. Grids were transferred to a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI) operated at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detection camera. Images of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup> and hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>-toxin complexes were collected using the automated image acquisition software SerialEM in counting mode with 29,000 × magnification yielding a pixel size of 1.014 Å. The total dose of 50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> was fractionated to 40 frames with 0.2 s per frame. Nominal defocus values ranged from −1.8 to −2.5 μm.

Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated with Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang, 2016</xref>). For particle picking, 2000 particles were picked manually to generate references for autopicking. The atuopicked particles were extracted by four-times downscaling resulting in the pixel size of 4.056 Å and then subjected to reference-free 2D classification in Relion-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref>). For the dataset of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>, 213,605 particles from well-defined 2D averages were selected for 3D classification with a pixel size of 2.028 Å. A 3D initial model de novo from the 2D average particles was generated using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm in Relion-2. The 50 Å low-pass filtered initial model was used as a template for 3D classification into four classes. A selected subset of 122,890 particles were used to obtain the final map with a pixel size of 1.014 Å and C3 symmetry imposed in the last round of 3D refinement in Relion-2. The global resolution of this map was estimated to be 3.56 Å based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using the 0.143 criterion. The dataset of hASIC1a<sup>ΔC</sup>-Mamba1 complex was similarly processed in Relion, with a subset of 119,901 particles producing a final map with global resolution of 3.90 Å.

All site-directed mutations were generated with overlap PCR and inserted into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). The mutants were sequenced to verify that no unwanted mutations had been introduced. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

The electrodes were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries with filaments (1.5 mm diameter; Sutter Instruments) on a four-stage puller (P-1000; Sutter, USA) and had resistances of 2–5 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution containing 140 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, (pH 8.0,~297 mOsm). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The experiments were performed at room temperature with an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Electronic) with the data acquisition software PatchMaster. Membrane potential was held at −70 mV in all experiments. Acid-induced currents were recorded by rapidly exchanging local solution from pH 8.0 to acidic pH through a Y-tube perfusion system. Toxins were applied 30 s before the pH decreased and persisted during low pH application. Channels were activated by acid perfusion at least every 2 min to allow for a complete recovery of the channels from desensitization. Recordings in which access resistance or capacitance changed by 10% during the experiment were excluded from data analysis. Mamba1 was added when the currents were stable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Patch-clamp electrophysiological data analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed with Clampfit and SigmaPlot.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leon D Islas (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>ASIC channels are important proteins that sense and gate as a result of extracellular increases in proton concentration. These channels participate in pain pathways and are considered important pharmacological targets. A toxin derived from the African mamba snake targets ASICs and these toxins have been used as tools for structure function studies.</p><p>In this manuscript, Sun et al. present the structure of the human ASIC1a channel in complex with the toxin Mambalgin 1 (Mamba1) as well as an apo structure. The authors show that the mechanism of inhibition of Mamba1 on hASIC is likely a negative allosteric effect on pH-induced conformational changes that normally lead to channel opening. Interestingly, the several residues have been identified that may be responsible for differences in the mode of action of Mamba1 on the human vs. the chicken channel orthologs.</p><p>The data is of high quality and the authors have produced a clear manuscript. The structures and accompanying data represent a nice contribution to the field since these are the first structures of a human ASIC channel. The main new finding is the reporting on the first human ASIC1 structure and the authors should emphasize this, especially in the Discussion section.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3E and F shows summary data from current inhibition experiments in several ASIC1a-deltaC mutants. It is important to show that the resulting mutations do not alter too much the function of the channel. The inhibition observed could be caused not only by the proposed reduced interaction of Mamba1 with the channel. At least show as complimentary figure a comparison of the mutant's expression level with WT and if available, the extent of activation induced by pH changes.</p><p>2) Figure 4E shows a small but significant change in the pore diameters at about a distance of 90, the pore being wider in the presence of Mamba1 toxin. Are there differences in the single channel conductance of the currents activated in the absence and presence of these toxins? Also, please define the reference for the distance that is defined in Figure 4E. Is it distance from the inner leaflet of the membrane?</p><p>3) The paper presents the first structure of human ASIC, bound to mambalgin1. As already shown in earlier work from the same group(s), the study reiterates that the thumb domain is the interaction site for mambalgin1 and proposes a possible mechanism of action for the toxin. The manuscript contains insightful electrophysiology data, but novelty and impact are low because the authors (and/or others) have shown similar experiments in the past. Also, the structural basis used to propose the mechanism is questionable, as the local resolution at the mambalgin1 binding site and in the TMs is not sufficient for detailed conclusions.</p><p>4) Both key aspects of functional and structural data have been shown previously in Sun et al., 2018 and Diochet et al., 2012. The only key advance of this work is the presentation of a structure of a truncated human ASIC1a construct, which looks extremely similar to the chicken ASIC1 structure. The authors should give special weigh to the fact that this is the first structure of a human ASIC1 channel.</p><p>5) The overall resolution of the structures shown here are low, especially in regions critical for mambalgin1 binding and in the lower TM2, where the authors claim to see the largest differences between apo and toxin-bound structures. The authors should make clear what are the limitations on the interpretation of their data imposed by this low resolution.</p><p>6) The Discussion section is much more of a summary than a discussion. The authors miss the opportunity to discuss the possible mechanism in the broader context of ion channel modulation, and that of ASICs in particular. This should be improved.</p><p>7) The presentation of structural data in almost all figures needs substantial revision to make it more accessible and improve readability.</p><p>8) Subsection “Mamba1 Reduces the Proton Sensitivity of hASIC1a”. In the experiment illustrated in Figure 5A, at the end of the co-application, the current is visibly reduced to ~40% of the initial control value. After that, there is additional and longer (!) application of the toxin that leads to additional current reduction. This experiment does not allow comparison of the rates of toxin binding in the presence and absence of activating protons. It does show an additive effect of toxin applications (the rate of current recovery and correspondingly dissociation of the toxin is extremely slow according to the same experiment) but does not support author's conclusion about toxin favoring the resting state. This experiment should be redone in the form where the same duration toxin applications will be administered either in the presence (one experiment) or absence (second experiment) of the stimulating pH 6.0 application. The authors should then measure the current amplitude at the end of such applications and statistically compare them. Based on such comparison, the authors may then make conclusions whether the toxin favors a certain state or not. As of now, the data presented in Figure 5A rather argue that toxin binds hASIC1a indiscriminately of the activation state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57096.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>ASIC channels are important proteins that sense and gate as a result of extracellular increases in proton concentration.

Meanwhile, we would like to point out that, the expression level of hASIC1a or hASIC1a mutants could not affect the inhibition of the channel by Mamba1 toxin represented in this article. As we have stated in the manuscript, the channel currents were recorded using the single cell patch clamp method. The inhibition effect of Mamba1 on the channel was represented using the ratio of current amplitudes in the presence and absence of the toxin recorded from the same cell membrane fraction. Therefore, the difference in channel expression level between single cells does not affect the measured inhibitory effect of the toxin on the channel.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cell surface expression levels of wild-type hASIC1a and hASIC1a mutants.</title><p>Cell surface expression level of the protein were determined by flow cytometry.

While the mutants D347A, D351G and F352L have their pH-dependence curves shift toward more acidic pH (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Moreover, we found that the presence of Mamba1 toxin do not alter the pH-dependence curves of these mutants, but can shift the curve of wild-type hASIC1a (Figure 5C and 5D). These data could support that the inhibition of hASIC1a mutants by Mamba1 observed are caused by the proposed reduced interaction of Mamba1 with the channel, rather than the alteration of the channel function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4E shows a small but significant change in the pore diameters at about a distance of 90, the pore being wider in the presence of Mamba1 toxin.

The overall resolution of the human ASIC1a channels reported in this article (3.56 Å for hASIC1a<sup>∆C</sup>, 3.90 Å for hASIC1a<sup>∆C</sup>-Mamba1 complex) are higher than that of cASIC1 (5.7 Å). Especially the transmembrane domains can be clearly observed in hASIC1a structure in this manuscript, while not observed in cryo-EM structure of cASIC1 in our previous work.</p><p>Although the electrophysiology data in this manuscript are similar with those in our previous paper, the experimental results in this manuscript are essential for verifying the interaction between Mamba1 toxin and human ASIC1a. The data in this manuscript provide direct evidences supporting the structural mechanism underlying the interaction between human ASIC1a channel and Mamba1 toxin.</p><p>We agree that the reported resolution of the hASIC1a cryo-EM structures are not high enough to illustrate more detail interactions between toxin-peptide and hASCI1a. However, we do have tried our best to obtain high resolution structures of hASIC1a and hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex through optimizing the sample conditions (detergents, lipodisc, …) and grid lyophilization parameters.</p><p>In the process of cryo-EM structure determination, we noticed that the relatively small transmembrane domain (containing only 6 transmembrane helices), and the non-continuous TM2 (bent at GAS motif) are the major obstacles for resolution improvements of the transmembrane domain. Moreover, the thumb domain of hASIC1a in resting or inhibition state was observed to shift away from the core of the trimeric channel, which lead to the unstable conformation of thumb domain and consequent low local resolution at the toxin-channel binding site. Combinations of these limitations might be the major obstacles preventing us to structures reach high resolution of hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex.</p><p>Nevertheless, relatively high resolution (reached to 3 Å) was observed at the extracellular core domain of hASIC1a in this manuscript, including the finger, the β-ball and the palm domains. The binding interface between Mamba1 and the thumb domain of hASIC1a, the extended conformation of the acidic pocket of hASIC1a-Mamba1 complex, are supported well by the cryo-EM map. More importantly, the key residues of Mamba1 that mediate toxin-channel interaction could be well assigned. These could provide solid, although not sufficient, evidence for the proposed mechanism of action for the toxin onto the hASIC1a channel. While the detailed contacts between residues and the conformational change in the TMD are waiting for further verification and investigation.</p><p>Parallel with the cryo-EM structure determination of hASIC1a and hASIC1a-Mmaba1, we have worked hard to resolve the structures using X-ray crystallography. We do have obtained the crystals of hASIC1a<sup>∆C</sup> and hASIC1a<sup>∆C</sup>-Mamba1 complex. Unfortunately, the diffraction data of the crystals were quite poor (4.5 Å for the best), preventing us to resolve the structures.</p><p>In this manuscript, it is the first time for us to understand the detail inhibition mode of Mamba1 to hASIC1a channel, and this mechanism might be a good reference to decipher interactions of other toxin-peptides to hASIC1a channel.

Whereas co-application of 500 nM Mamba1 in the presence of the pH 6.0 stimulation could not decrease the channel current, even though prolong the co-application of the toxin and pH 6.0 stimulation.</p><p>The current amplitude at the end of such applications were measured and compared statistically, as shown in Figure 5B.</p><p>We believe these data could provide more evidences to support our hypothesis that “Mamba1 toxin favoring the resting state of hASIC1a channel”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
