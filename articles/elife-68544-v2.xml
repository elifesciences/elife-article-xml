protein kinase domains. TRPM7 plays a fundamental role in the cellular uptake of divalent cations such as Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and thus shapes cellular excitability, plasticity, and metabolic activity. The molecular appearance and operation of TRPM7 channels in native tissues have remained unresolved. Here, we investigated the subunit composition of endogenous TRPM7 channels in rodent brain by multi-epitope affinity purification and high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. We found that native TRPM7 channels are high-molecular-weight multi-protein complexes that contain the putative metal transporter proteins CNNM1-4 and a small G-protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 15 (ARL15). Heterologous reconstitution experiments confirmed the formation of TRPM7/CNNM/ARL15 ternary complexes and indicated that complex formation effectively and specifically impacts TRPM7 activity. These results open up new avenues towards a mechanistic understanding of the cellular regulation and function of TRPM7 channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd><kwd>TRPM7 complexes</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 152 P15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chubanov</surname><given-names>Vladimir</given-names></name><name><surname>Gudermann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 152 P02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulte</surname><given-names>Uwe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1328 P15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicke</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fakler</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Training Group 2338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gudermann</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicke</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 152 P14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zierler</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution proteomics in conjunction with biochemical and electrophysiological experiments revealed that the channel-kinase TRPM7 in rodent brain forms macromolecular complexes containing the metal transporters CNNM1-4 and a small G-protein ARL15.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7) encodes a bi-functional protein with a transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel domain fused to a C-terminal α-type serine/threonine-protein kinase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chubanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleig and Chubanov, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryazanov et al., 1997</xref>).

In line with this observation, cleaved TRPM7 kinase was detected in several cell lines and shown to translocate to the nucleus, where it promotes histone phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the current knowledge about TRPM7 was derived from in vitro experiments with cultured cells, whereas insights into the operation of both channel and α-kinase activity of TRPM7 in native tissues are limited. We, therefore, investigated the molecular architecture of TRPM7 in rodent brain by using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and multi-epitope affinity purifications (ME-APs) in combination with high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). These approaches showed that native TRPM7 channels are macromolecular complexes with an apparent size of ≧1.2 MDa and identified proteins CNNM1-4 and ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 15 (ARL15) as complex constituents. Subsequent functional studies in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes and HEK293 cells suggested ARL15 and CNNM3 as hitherto unrecognised regulators of the TRPM7 ion channel and kinase activity, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ME-AP proteomic analyses of native TRPM7 channels</title><p>TRPM7 channels assemble from four subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleig and Chubanov, 2014</xref>), each of which is about 1860 aa in length and comprises several distinct domains in its extended intracellular N- and C-termini in addition to a transmembrane channel domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, analysis by native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) of TRPM7 channels either endogenous to HEK293 cells or exogenously expressed in these cells via transient transfection, elicited a molecular mass of at least 1.2 MDa considerably exceeding the molecular mass of ~850 kDa calculated for TRPM7 tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel). To see whether this large molecular size is a peculiarity of HEK293 cells, we recapitulated the analysis for TRPM7 channels expressed in mouse brain using a recently developed technique that combines BN-PAGE with cryo-slicing and quantitative mass spectrometry (csBN-MS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2019</xref>).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel, csBN-MS analysis of mouse brain membranes detected the TRPM7 protein with an apparent molecular mass between 1.2 and 2.6 MDa, comparable to the results obtained from HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel). Moreover, the determination of the total protein amount by signal integration over all slices showed that TRPM7 levels in the brain are rather low compared to other members of the TRP family of proteins. Thus, the abundance of TRPM7 is about one to three orders of magnitude below that obtained for TRPC4, TRPM3, or TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower right).</p><p>Together, these results indicated that native TRPM7 complexes exceed the predicted molecular size of bare tetrameric assemblies in different cellular environments suggesting that the rather simplistic view on the molecular make-up of native TRPM7 channel complexes has to be revised.</p><p>To identify proteins that may co-assemble with TRPM7, we used affinity purifications with multiple antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of the TRPM7 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and evaluated the respective eluates of HEK293 cells and rodent brains by high-resolution quantitative MS analysis (ME-APs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwenk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwenk et al., 2010</xref>). HEK293 cells were selected because these cells are widely used for the functional assessment of endogenous and overexpressed TRPM7. The brain was chosen since TRPM7 plays a critical role in neurological injuries and synaptic and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). For these ME-APs, membrane fractions prepared either from whole brains of adult mice and rats or from WT HEK293 cells were solubilised with detergent buffers of mild (CL-47) or intermediate (CL-91) stringency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwenk et al., 2010</xref>) prior to TRPM7 purification.

The specificity of co-purification was assessed by comparing protein amounts in APs targeting TRPM7 with protein amounts obtained with stringent negative controls. Thus, (i) APs with five different target-unrelated control (TUC) antibodies were used as negative controls for <italic>anti</italic>-TRPM7 APs from rodent brain, (ii) <italic>anti</italic>-TRPM7 APs from a <italic>TRPM7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HEK293 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abiria et al., 2017</xref>) served as negative controls for <italic>anti</italic>-TRPM7 APs from WT HEK293 cells, and (iii) HEK293 cells heterologously expressing TRPM7-myc were used as negative controls for <italic>anti</italic>-HA APs from HEK293 cells overexpressing TRPM7-HA. A protein was considered consistently co-purified if detected in APs with at least two antibodies under the same solubilisation condition. Together, these specificity and consistency criteria identified five proteins as high-confidence interaction partners of TRPM7: ARL15 and the cyclin M family proteins CNNM1-4, putative Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Neither of these proteins was detected in any of the negative controls. Moreover, they were not only consistently co-purified with several antibodies but with the exception of CNNM1 also from both rodent brain and HEK293 cells. Comparison of the degree of association under the two solubilisation conditions revealed that the interaction between TRPM7, ARL15, and CNNMs was weakened by the more stringent detergent CL-91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Protein constituents of native transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7) channels identified by multi-epitope affinity purifications (ME-APs).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">Protein ID</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">Acc.

To assess the activity of the TRPM7 kinase, we relied on the <italic>anti-</italic>(p)Ser1511 M7 antibody, which specifically recognises the known autophosphorylation site (Ser1511) of mouse TRPM7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romagnani et al., 2017</xref>). To verify that autophosphorylation of Ser1511 is dynamic, and changes of the TRPM7 kinase activity could therefore be visualised by the anti-(p)Ser1511 M7 antibody we treated HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing TRPM7 with TG100-115, a drug-like TRPM7 kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Song et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that the exposure of living cells to TG100-115 led to suppression of (p)Ser1511 TRPM7 immunoreactivity in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Hence, detection of (p)Ser1511 TRPM7 levels seems a reliable means to monitor the TRPM7 kinase activity.

We show that TRPM7 forms macromolecular complexes by assembling with CNNM proteins 1-4 and ARL15. Moreover, functional expression in heterologous expression systems showed that ARL15 strongly affects TRPM7 channel function, while CNNM3 appears to act as a negative regulator of TRPM7 kinase activity.</p><p>BN-PAGE of membrane fractions isolated from rodent brain and cultured HEK 293 cells identified endogenous TRPM7 in high ~1.2 MDa molecular weight complexes exceeding the calculated molecular mass of TRPM7 tetramers (~850 kDa) and suggesting that the TRPM7 channel kinase is predominantly embedded in a large macromolecular complex. Compared to other native TRP channels, such as TRPC4, TRPM3, and TRPV2, the expression level of TRPM7 was found to be up to three orders of magnitude lower, thus classifying TRPM7 as a very low-abundant protein in the rodent brain and indicating that comprehensive determination of the TRPM7 complexome is technically challenging. The unbiased ME-AP approach paired with stringent negative controls nevertheless allowed for the identification of high-confidence interaction partners based on their specific and consistent co-purification with TRPM7. Consequently, five proteins were found to assemble with native TRPM7, including four members of the <italic>CNNM</italic> gene family encoding putative Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters CNNM1-4 and a small G-protein ARL15. The fact that we did not detect all the interactors seen in mouse brain also in APs from rat brain is most likely due to the low abundance of endogenous TRPM7 (~50% less TRPM7 compared to APs from mouse brain). The interaction of TRPM7 with ARL15 and CNNM proteins was successfully confirmed in heterologous expression experiments. We also noted that previous proteome-wide interactome screens in cultured cells suggested an association of ARL15 with TRPM7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>), in line with our results.</p><p>To obtain first insight into a possible functional impact of ARL15 and CNNM3, the most prominent interaction partners of TRPM7 in our experimental settings, we measured the channel activity of TRPM7 expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and HEK293 cells. We found that co-expression of TRPM7 with CNNM3 did not lead to significant changes in TRPM7 currents applying a broad range of experimental conditions. Consistently, we observed that the ability of TRPM7 to increase cellular Mg levels was not affected by CNNM3. However, CNNM3 appears to act as a negative regulator of the TRPM7 kinase activity, resembling the action of the drug-like kinase inhibitor TG100-115. Collectively, these results suggest that CNNM3 may represent the first known protein acting as a physiological modulator of the TRPM7 kinase activity.</p><p>In contrast to CNNM3, co-expression of TRPM7 with ARL15 in oocytes, but not with the closely related small G-protein ARL8A, caused robust suppression of TRPM7 currents regardless of the experimental conditions applied. Of note, transient expression of ARL15 in HEK 293 cells resulted in inhibition of endogenous TRPM7 currents, reinforcing our conclusion that ARL15 acts as a potent and specific negative regulator of the TRPM7 channel.</p><p>The <italic>CNNM</italic> (Cyclin M; CorC) gene family encodes highly conserved metal transporter proteins identified in all branches of living organisms, ranging from prokaryotes to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Funato and Miki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giménez-Mascarell et al., 2019</xref>).

Functional expression studies proposed that CNNMs operate as Na<sup>+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchangers responsible for the efflux of cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Funato and Miki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giménez-Mascarell et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to this view, other investigators proposed that CNNM proteins indirectly regulate the influx of Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arjona and de Baaij, 2018</xref>). Recently resolved crystal structures of two prokaryotic CNNM-like proteins revealed that CNNMs form dimers and that each monomer contains three transmembrane helices harbouring Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites consistent with the suggested Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport function of CNNMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). While the majority of CNNM proteins in a cell is not bound to TRPM7, the direct association identified in this study suggests a new concept implying that two transporting mechanisms, TRPM7-mediated influx of divalent cations (Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and CNNM-dependent Na<sup>+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchange, can be physically coupled under native conditions, thus, warranting future studies to examine the exact functional interplay between the channel-kinase TRPM7 and CNNMs.</p><p>ARL15 is a member of the <italic>ARF</italic> gene family of small G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillingham and Munro, 2007</xref>). A common feature of ARFs is their ability to bind and regulate effector proteins in a GTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillingham and Munro, 2007</xref>). GDP- and GTP-bound states of ARFs are controlled by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) in conjunction with GTP exchange factors (GEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillingham and Munro, 2007</xref>). The best-characterised ARFs are involved in membrane trafficking, phospholipid metabolism and remodelling of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillingham and Munro, 2007</xref>). While genome-wide association studies have linked ARL15 to systemic Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and energy metabolism in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richards et al., 2009</xref>), the particular functional role and corresponding GAP, GEF, and effector proteins of ARL15 remain to be established. To this end, the strong effect of ARL15 in suppressing TRPM7 currents observed in our study may suggest that TRPM7 serves as a specific effector protein of ARL15. The significance of this modulatory effect for native TRPM7 in the rodent brain, however, remains to be shown.</p><p>In some TRPM7-APs from HEK293 cells, we detected TRPM6, a genetically related channel, and two proteins representing the gene family of phosphatase of regenerating liver 1 and 3 (also entitled protein tyrosine phosphatases type 4A1 and 3, TP4A1 and 3) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

In the present study, TRPM6, even though detected, could not be consistently co-purified with multiple anti-TRPM7 antibodies, likely because TRPM6 is expressed at very low levels in the brain and HEK293 cells. Nevertheless, a previous study reporting that heterologously expressed ARL15 positively modulates TRPM6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corre et al., 2018</xref>) might suggest an overlap between the TRPM6 and TRPM7 interactomes.</p><p>Interestingly, a recent interactome screen based on lentiviral overexpression of tagged proteins in HEK293 and HTC116 cells revealed that TP4A1 and TP4A2 also interact with ARL15 and CNNMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a hypothesis-driven search for interaction partners of CNNMs has shown that TP4A proteins assemble with CNNMs and that such interactions shape Mg<sup>2+</sup> efflux from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Funato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gulerez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kostantin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giménez-Mascarell et al., 2017</xref>).

conjunction with earlier interactome experiments and functional expression studies, it is tempting to speculate that TRPM7/ARL15/CNNMs/TP4As form a protein network orchestrating transport of divalent cations across the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Generation of a rabbit polyclonal <italic>anti-</italic>(p)Ser1511 TRPM7 antibody (<italic>anti-</italic>(p)Ser1511 M7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romagnani et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, rabbits were immunised with a phosphorylated peptide H2N-DSPEVD(<bold>p</bold>)<underline>S</underline>KAALLPC-NH2 ((p)Ser1511 in mouse TRPM7) coupled via its C-terminal cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentec, Belgium). The generated serum was subjected to two rounds of affinity chromatography: a fraction of the antibody was purified using the phosphorylated peptide. Next, an additional round of chromatography was conducted using a non-phosphorylated variant of the peptide (H2N-DSPEVD<underline>S</underline>KAALLPC-NH2). The latter fraction of antibody was used in AP experiments (<italic>anti</italic>-M7c antibody, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Anti-TRPM7 2C7 mouse monoclonal antibody (<italic>anti</italic>-M7d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was produced by Eurogentec (Belgium) as follows. The nucleotide sequence coding for His<sub>6</sub>-tag followed by a cleavage site sequence for TEV protease and the amino acids 1501–1863 (kinase domain, KD) of mouse TRPM7 protein was synthesised in vitro and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pT7. The resulting expression construct pT7-His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>Trpm7</italic>-KD was verified by sequencing and transformed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (BL21 DE3 pLysS). Next, the transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was amplified in LB medium at 25°C; 1 mM IPTG was used for induction of the His<sub>6</sub>-TRPM7-KD protein expression. The harvested cell pellet was disrupted by sonication. His<sub>6</sub>-TRPM7-KD was identified in the soluble fraction of the lysate. His<sub>6</sub>-TRPM7 was purified on an Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column on an AKTA Avant 25 (GE Healthcare) using an imidazole gradient of 20–500 mM. The fraction containing His<sub>6</sub>-TRPM7-KD was dialysed against a Tris buffer (0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5). His<sub>6</sub>-TRPM7-KD was subjected to TEV protease (New England Biolabs) digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, non-digested His<sub>6</sub>-TRPM7-KD and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged fragments were removed using an Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column. The flow-through containing the cleaved TRPM7-KD was concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml in the Tris buffer and stored at –80°C. SDS-PAGE was used to verify the removal of the His<sub>6</sub>-tag.</p><p>The standard mouse monoclonal antibody production program of Eurogentec (Belgium) was conducted to immunise four mice using the TRPM7-KD protein and to produce a library of hybridomas. ELISA and Western blot were used to screen the hybridomas and to perform a clonal selection. Two hybridoma clones, 2C7 and 4F9 (isotypes G1;K), were selected based on the antibody quality released in the culture medium. Both clones were propagated, and the corresponding cell culture media were collected for large-scale purification of the IgG fraction using Protein G affinity chromatography. The IgG fractions from 2C7 (0.8 mg/ml) and 4F9 (1.4 mg/ml) were dialysed in PBS and stored at –80°C. The specificity of the 2C7 and 4F9 IgGs (dilution 1:1000) was verified by Western blot analysis of HEK293T cells overexpressing the TRPM6 and TRPM7 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 2C7 antibody detected the mouse or human TRPM7, but not the mouse or human TRPM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the 4F9 antibody detected only the mouse TRPM7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To examine the effects of ARL15 on endogenous TRPM7 currents, HEK293T cells were transfected by 1 µg WT <italic>Arl15</italic> (in pCMV6-Entry) and 0.1 µg <italic>EGFP</italic> cDNAs (in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TA-TOPO).</p><p>Patch-clamp measurements were conducted with EGFP-positive cells 18–22 hr after transfection, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chubanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferioli et al., 2017</xref>), with minor modifications. Whole-cell currents were measured using an EPC10 patch-clamp amplifier and PatchMaster software (Harvard Bioscience). Voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV. Currents were elicited by a ramp protocol from –100 to +100 mV over 50 ms acquired at 0.5 Hz and a holding potential of 0 mV. Inward and outward current amplitudes were extracted at –80 and +80 mV and were normalised to the cell size as pA/pF. Capacitance was measured using the automated capacitance cancellation function of EPC10. Patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (Science Products) and had resistance 2–3.5 MΩ. Unless stated otherwise, a standard extracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES-NaOH, and 11 glucose (all from Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.2. For assessing Mg<sup>2+</sup> currents, the extracellular solutions contained (in mM): 10 HEPES-NaOH, 260 mannitol, and 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.2. Solutions were adjusted to 290 mOsm using a Vapro 5520 osmometer (Wescor Inc). The standard divalent cation-free intracellular pipette solution contained (in mM): 120 Cs-glutamate, 8 NaCl, 10 Cs-EGTA, 5 Cs-EDTA, 10 HEPES-CsOH (all from Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.2. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (means ± SEM). Statistical comparisons (Prism 8.4.0) were made using one-way ANOVA or a two-tailed t<italic>-</italic>test, as indicated in the figure legends. Significance was accepted at p <italic>≤</italic> 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Determination of cellular Mg contents</title><p>The total content of Mg in <italic>TRPM7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abiria et al., 2017</xref>) was determined by ICP-MS in ALS Scandinavia (Sweden) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mittermeier et al., 2019</xref>) with several modifications. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Merck) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a humidified cell culture incubator (Heraeus, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To conduct ICP-MS experiments, <italic>TRPM7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> HEK293T cells were plated in 10 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes at ~50% confluence in standard DMEM (without additional 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and transiently transfected with 20 µg <italic>Trpm7</italic>, 10 µg <italic>Cnnm3</italic>, or 20 µg <italic>Trpm7</italic> plus 10 µg <italic>Cnnm3</italic> plasmid cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 24 hr, the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM, mechanically detached, and cell suspensions collected in 10 ml plastic tubes. After centrifugation (3 min, 1000 rpm), the medium was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml PBS and passed to a fresh 10 ml tube. The cell suspension was centrifuged (3 min, 3500 rpm), the supernatant removed, and the cell pellet frozen at –20°C. Cell pellets were analysed by ICP-MS in ALS Scandinavia (Sweden). The experiment was repeated five times. Elementary Mg levels were normalised to elementary contents of sulphur (S) and represented as mean ± SEM. Data were compared by one-way ANOVA (Prism 8.4.0). Significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Numerical data for peak volumes, abundance norm values, relative abundance, and ratio distance values obtained through analysis of the mass spectrometry (MS) data.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68544-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Mass spectrometry (MS) spectra of phosphorylated transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7), CNNM3, and CNNM4 peptides identified in affinity purifications (APs) from HEK293 and rodent brain.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68544-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation sites in transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7), CNNM3, and CNNM4 identified in affinity purifications (APs) from transfected HEK293 cells and rodent brain.</title><p>Excel file contains one worksheet: The phosphorylated residues of TRPM7, CNNM3, and CNNM4 identified by mass spectrometry (MS) in the present study are outlined in conjunction with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including László Csanády as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Voets (Reviewer #2); Rajan Sah (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors' conclusions are based on MS analysis of co-immunoprecipitated endogenous proteins and on classical co-IP studies in cells overexpressing the target proteins. The conclusions would be strengthened by a more rigorous assessments of the demonstrated interactions through classical co-IP experiments between endogenous proteins in mammalian cells. This would eliminate the possibility of artifactual interactions that may occur with overexpression studies, and provide more direct support for the MS results.</p><p>2. The authors should provide an explanation of why ARL-15 co-IP's with TRPM7 only in the presence of CNNM3 (Figure 3), but suppresses TRPM7 currents in oocytes also when CNNM3 is not present. Is the inhibitory influence of ARL15 on TRPM7 currents indirect, not requiring the physical association of ARL-15 with the channel? If so, what is the relevance of the demonstrated physical interaction? One possible control experiment could be to co-express in oocytes TRPM7 with some other small GTPase (which does not co-IP with TRPM7).</p><p>3. Some additional experiments would be needed to address the functional consequence of the presence of the interaction partners on Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeation and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of TRPM7. For instance, patch-clamp experiments in HEK cells to determine relative Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeability and to address whether the regulation by intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP is affected.</p><p>4. Some assessment of modulation of magnesium homeostasis by the TRPM7-CNNM interaction would be desirable, ideally in a mammalian cell.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a concise manuscript which focuses on the identification of TRPM7 reaction partners of functional relevance in native tissues. Using native gel electrophoresis the authors show that TRPM7 is present in complexes with an apparent molecular weight (MW) that greatly exceeds the calculated MW of the homotetramer. They then find that upon affinity purification of TRPM7 from rodent brain or TRPM7-expressing HEK293 cells, using a variety of different epitopes, the magnesium transporters CNNM1-4 and the small G protein ARL15 consistently co-purify with the channel. Functional studies in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> co-expressing various combinations of TRPM7, CNNM3, and ARL15 show that TRPM7 currents are unaffected by co-expression of CNNM3, but robustly suppressed by co-expression of ARL15. The latter effect is specific to TRPM7 (over TRPV1), scales with ARL15 expression levels, and is not mediated by a reduction in TRPM7 surface expression.</p><p>To my judgement the experiments are carefully performed and seem to support the key conclusions. Although the simple functional experiments do not offer mechanistic insight into the TRPM7-ARL15 interaction, this study opens up a completely novel avenue of research.</p><p>My only concern is an apparent logical contradiction between the findings presented in Figure 3 and those presented in Figures 1C and 4.</p><p>First, in Figure 3 the authors show that the interaction between TRPM7 and ARL15 depends on the presence of CNNM proteins: when CNNM3 is not co-expressed, TRPM7 does not co-precipitate ARL15 from HEK293 cells. On the other hand, in Figure 1C they show that CNNM3 is natively expressed in HEK293 cells, as it co-precipitates with heterologously expressed TRPM7.</p><p>Second, in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, co-expression of ARL15 alone is sufficient to suppress TRPM7 currents. Thus, either CNNM3 (or a homolog) is indeed required for the TRPM7-ARL15 interaction (as suggested by Figure 3), but is endogenously expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, or the inhibitory influence of ARL15 on TRPM7 currents is indirect, and does not require the physical association of ARL-15 with the channel. If so, what is the relevance of the demonstrated physical interaction? The authors should comment on these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>To understand the function and regulation of ion channels in the plasma membrane, knowledge of other proteins that are associated with channels in functional complexes is important. Here, Kollewe et al., used high resolution proteomics to assess the composition of native complexes containing TRPM7, a plasma membrane cation channel involved in cation transport, and containing a functional kinase in its C terminus.</p><p>Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, they convincingly identify a specific interaction of TRPM7 with members of the CNNM family of putative magnesium transporters and with the small G protein ARL15. This interaction can be reproduced in heterologous expression system. Moreover, in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, increasing levels of ARL15 lead to a dose-dependent inhibition of TRPM7 currents.</p><p>Overall, this work represents an important next step in TRPM7 channel research, by systematically identifying the composition of the channel interactome, and how it affects channel functionality. The study can serve as a paradigm for similar studies on other (TRP) channels, which may yield a wealth of information on channel functional regulation.</p><p>At this point, the (patho)physiological relevance of the interactions with ARL15 and CNNM1-4 remain unclear. Further work is needed to pinpoint potential effects of these proteins on TRPM7-dependent (magnesium) ion transport or kinase activity.</p><p>Overall, this is meticulous study identifying potentially important interaction partners of the cation channel TRPM7. A weaker point of the paper is that the functional effects of the interaction partners are studied/described in a somewhat superficial manner:</p><p>1) The analysis of the currents measured in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> only includes currents at +80 mV, which is far from the physiological range. It would be of interest to also provide additional data regarding the inward currents and, especially seen the interaction with CNNMs, the magnesium permeability of the complex.</p><p>2) TRPM7 is a channel and an enzyme. However, the authors only investigate the effects of the binding partners on channel activity, not on kinase activity. Would it be possible to include an assay investigating the effect of ARL15 or CNMMs on kinase activity? In any case, such a potential regulatory effect should be discussed.</p><p>Labeling in Figure 1B seems incorrect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Chubanov et al., applied multi-epitope affinity purification and high-resolution quantitative MS analysis and identified TRPM7 forming a ternary complex with CNNM proteins and ARL15. CNNM1-4 proteins, like TRPM7, are thought to be magnesium transporters, so this finding is very intriguing as it relates to the mechanisms by which TRPM7 and CNNM, either directly or indirectly regulate magnesium homeostasis. The authors confirm these interactions with overexpression co-IP experiments in HEK cells and then evaluate the effects of ARL15 expression on TRPM7 function in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. They reveal that ARL15 is a negative regulator of TRPM7 channel function while maintaining TRPM7 plasma membrane localization. These studies are overall well performed, and technically rigorous. These initial findings are also very interesting and potentially impactful as they may finally explain a longstanding controversy about how TRPM7 (and TRPM6) may regulate magnesium homeostasis.</p><p>1. The finding that TRPM7 forms a complex with CNNM proteins, another putative magnesium transporter, now with a recent cryo-EM structure that supports a role in magnesium transport, is a very important finding that deserves to be further explored in this paper. As the authors recognize, the connection of TRPM7 to CNNM proteins has been previously described as has the connection between CNNM proteins and ARL15, which reduces novelty. Moreover, this manuscript appears to end at these initial findings which would normally be the beginning of a more impactful and meaningful paper.</p><p>2. Relevant to the point above, how are CNNM protein expression and localization altered in TRPM7-/- cells? Could CNNM mistrafficking or impaired function account for the differences in magnesium homeostasis observed in TRPM7-/- cells?</p><p>3. Ion channel functional studies are performed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> and the rationale is well explained with respect to titrating expression levels, but why not perform these studies in HEK cells to confirm that this holds true in the more relevant mammalian cells?</p><p>4. Are there differences in intracellular magnesium upon expression of TRPM7 +/- CNNM proteins +/- ARL15 in overexpression studies in mammalian cells?</p><p>5. TRPM7 antibodies are notoriously challenging with respect to specificity. The authors described negative control experiments using TRPM7-/- cells. Where is the TRPM7 KO negative control data?</p><p>6. The co-IP experiments with overexpression of TRPM7 and then each of identified TRPM7 interactors, CNNM1-4, ARL15 is the least specific experiment possible for confirmation. Why not perform endogenous TRPM7 IP (since the Abs seem to work for IP) and then probe for endogenous, or even overexpressed CNNM and ARL15? Conversely, is it possible to IP endogenous, or overexpressed CNNM or ARL15 and detect endogenous TRPM7 on WB? These additional co-IP would strengthen this finding.</p><p>7. The new phosphosites identified are interesting, but what is their functional significance?</p><p>8. For the experiments in Figure 4, ARL15 expression is titrated based on injected mRNA, but it would also be advisable to show the actual levels of overexpressed protein by WB.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68544.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Rigorous analysis of native TRPM7 channels present in the rodent brain was the major goal of the present study. For this purpose, we isolated native TRPM7 channels by affinity-purifications (APs) with four different <italic>anti-TRPM7</italic> antibodies – in other words: We performed ‘classical APs’ that were evaluated by quantitative MS-analysis. In contrast to Western-blotting, MS-analysis is highly sensitive (dynamic range of four orders of magnitude), quantitative and unbiased (independent of antibody-specificities) – and thus the preferred method of choice for readout and evaluation of AP-based studies. In this sense it is important to note, that CNNMs and ARL15 were identified as interactors of native TRPM7 channels, which are, in fact, macro-molecular complexes assembled from the aforementioned proteins (Figure 1). Subsequent APs from un-transfected HEK-cells, as well as from HEK cells (over)-expressing TRPM7 protein confirmed these interactions by specific co-purification of endogenous CNNM and ARL15 proteins (Figure 1). For better clarity, we changed the labeling for the APs from HEK cells to highlight that endogenous proteins were purified in these experiments (Figure 1C, third panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Heterologously expressed TRPM7 co-assembles with ARL15 even in the absence of overexpressed CNNM3, although at lower efficiency (Figure 3 (now Figure 2), right panel, lane 5 versus lane 7). Currently, we cannot exclude that the effect of ARL15 expression observed in oocytes is based on co-assembly with <italic>Xenopus</italic>-endogenous CNNMs. Nevertheless, the effect is ARL15-specific.</p><p>We appreciate the advice of the reviewers about the importance of assessing other small G-proteins to demonstrate a specific effect of ARL15. We have made extensive additional efforts to address this issue. Using TEVC, we found that a genetically related protein, ARL8A, is not able to affect TRPM7 currents (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Next, we performed patch-clamp experiments with ARL15 and demonstrated that ARL15 can also inhibit endogenous TRPM7 currents (new Figure 3—figure supplement 4), showing that the inhibitory action of ARL15 is specific and does not depend on the expression system used. Finally, we examined the kinase-dead TRPM7 K1646R mutant to show that TRPM7 kinase activity is not required for the inhibitory action of ARL15 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3C). Collectively, these data significantly extend the mechanistic insight into the functional interaction between ARL15 and TRPM7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As suggested, we conducted patch-clamp experiments with HEK293 cells transfected with TRPM7 and CNNM3 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We did not detect any impact of CNNM3 on TRPM7 channel characteristics.</p><p>In addition, we conducted TEVC experiments using an external solution solely containing 3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and no other divalent cations (new Figure 4). In line with our patch-clamp experiments, this approach did not show any functional effects of CNNM3 on TRPM7 currents. In contrast to CNNM3, investigating ARL15 coexpression in two expression systems (HEK293 cells and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes) using different experimental conditions consistently showed that ARL15 efficiently inhibits TRPM7 currents (new Figure 3—figure supplement 4, new Figure 4). Therefore, we conclude that ARL15 elicits a general suppression of TRPM7 channel activity and does not selectively impinge on specific channel characteristic such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeability.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that during TEVC measurements of TRPM7 currents, cytosolic levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mg-ATP were not manipulated, whereas patch-clamp measurements of whole-cell TRPM7 currents were performed with a divalent cation free internal solution that also contained the Mg<sup>2+</sup> chelators EGTA and EDTA and therefore efficiently removed intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mg-ATP. Hence, the effects of ARL15 and CNNM3 on TRPM7 were examined in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (or Mg-ATP) with a similar outcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Thus, either CNNM3 (or a homolog) is indeed required for the TRPM7-ARL15 interaction (as suggested by Figure 3), but is endogenously expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, or the inhibitory influence of ARL15 on TRPM7 currents is indirect, and does not require the physical association of ARL-15 with the channel. If so, what is the relevance of the demonstrated physical interaction? The authors should comment on these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, Figure 3 (now Figure 2) appears to be misinterpreted. Heterologously expressed TRPM7 co-assembles with ARL15 even in the absence of overexpressed CNNM3, although at lower efficiency (Figure 3 (now Figure 2), right panel, lane 5 versus lane 7). Currently, we cannot exclude that the effect of ARL15-expression observed in oocytes is based on co-assembly with <italic>Xenopus</italic>-endogenous CNNMs. Nevertheless, the effect is ARL15-specific, since co-expression of the related ARL8A protein, as suggested by the reviewers, did not alter TRPM7 currents. This was added to the revised manuscript (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>To understand the function and regulation of ion channels in the plasma membrane, knowledge of other proteins that are associated with channels in functional complexes is important. Here, Kollewe et al., used high resolution proteomics to assess the composition of native complexes containing TRPM7, a plasma membrane cation channel involved in cation transport, and containing a functional kinase in its C terminus.</p><p>Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, they convincingly identify a specific interaction of TRPM7 with members of the CNNM family of putative magnesium transporters and with the small G protein ARL15. This interaction can be reproduced in heterologous expression system. Moreover, in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, increasing levels of ARL15 lead to a dose-dependent inhibition of TRPM7 currents.</p><p>Overall, this work represents an important next step in TRPM7 channel research, by systematically identifying the composition of the channel interactome, and how it affects channel functionality. The study can serve as a paradigm for similar studies on other (TRP) channels, which may yield a wealth of information on channel functional regulation.</p><p>At this point, the (patho)physiological relevance of the interactions with ARL15 and CNNM1-4 remain unclear. Further work is needed to pinpoint potential effects of these proteins on TRPM7-dependent (magnesium) ion transport or kinase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the note of Reviewer 2 about the stimulatory impact of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this is meticulous study identifying potentially important interaction partners of the cation channel TRPM7. A weaker point of the paper is that the functional effects of the interaction partners are studied/described in a somewhat superficial manner:</p><p>1) The analysis of the currents measured in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> only includes currents at +80 mV, which is far from the physiological range. It would be of interest to also provide additional data regarding the inward currents and, especially seen the interaction with CNNMs, the magnesium permeability of the complex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important question. TRPM7 inward currents at negative membrane potentials are very small and prone to errors in quantitative assessment, for instance, due to the presence of endogenous Cl<sup>-</sup> currents. Therefore, quantification of the comparably large TRPM7 outward currents is commonly used in the field. Nevertheless, to address the concern of Reviewer 2, we analysed TRPM7 inward currents in different experimental settings (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3, new Figure 4, new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Of note, these additional analyses corroborate our conclusions derived from assessments of TRPM7 outward currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) TRPM7 is a channel and an enzyme. However, the authors only investigate the effects of the binding partners on channel activity, not on kinase activity. Would it be possible to include an assay investigating the effect of ARL15 or CNMMs on kinase activity? In any case, such a potential regulatory effect should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 2 that the functional assessment of the TRPM7 kinase in the presence of CNNMs and ARL15 would benefit the impact of our study. It should be stressed that a kinase assay for the full-length TRPM7 protein was not available to address this question in the initial version of the paper. Therefore, we made substantial efforts to develop such an assay. We tested the <italic>anti</italic>-TRPM7 antibody, which specifically recognizes the known autophosphorylation site (Ser1511) in TRPM7 and TG100-115, a drug-like TRPM7 kinase inhibitor (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We observed that exposure of living cells to TG100-115 led to suppression of (p)S1511 TRPM7 immunoreactivity in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. We concluded that detecting (p)Ser1511 TRPM7 levels is a reliable means to monitor TRPM7 kinase activity. Consequently, we investigated whether <italic>ARL15</italic> would modulate TRPM7 kinase activity and found no changes in (p)Ser1511 TRPM7 immunoreactivity (new Figure 5A). However, co-expression of CNNM3 resulted in a significant reduction of the (p)Ser1511 TRPM7 signal (new Figure 5), compatible with the notion that CNNM3 acts as a negative regulator of the TRPM7 kinase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Labeling in Figure 1B seems incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>The labelling of Figure 1B was corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Chubanov et al., applied multi-epitope affinity purification and high-resolution quantitative MS analysis and identified TRPM7 forming a ternary complex with CNNM proteins and ARL15. CNNM1-4 proteins, like TRPM7, are thought to be magnesium transporters, so this finding is very intriguing as it relates to the mechanisms by which TRPM7 and CNNM, either directly or indirectly regulate magnesium homeostasis. The authors confirm these interactions with overexpression co-IP experiments in HEK cells and then evaluate the effects of ARL15 expression on TRPM7 function in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. They reveal that ARL15 is a negative regulator of TRPM7 channel function while maintaining TRPM7 plasma membrane localization. These studies are overall well performed, and technically rigorous. These initial findings are also very interesting and potentially impactful as they may finally explain a longstanding controversy about how TRPM7 (and TRPM6) may regulate magnesium homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for an overall positive evaluation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The finding that TRPM7 forms a complex with CNNM proteins, another putative magnesium transporter, now with a recent cryo-EM structure that supports a role in magnesium transport, is a very important finding that deserves to be further explored in this paper. As the authors recognize, the connection of TRPM7 to CNNM proteins has been previously described as has the connection between CNNM proteins and ARL15, which reduces novelty. Moreover, this manuscript appears to end at these initial findings which would normally be the beginning of a more impactful and meaningful paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasize that our manuscript does not present original data related to the interaction of CNNMs with ARL15 and cryo-EM structures of CNNMs, and we do not foresee how publications on this topic can compromise the novelty of our study. Moreover, after careful re-assessment of the current literature, we found no published works showing the direct interaction of CNNMs with TRPM7.</p><p>In the Discussion section, we refer to two manuscripts reporting proteome-wide screens performed in HEK293 and HTC116 cell lines using lentiviral overexpression of tagged proteins. These experiments proposed the interaction of recombinant TRPM7 with ARL15 but not with CNNMs (CNNMs were mentioned mistakenly in our text and we corrected it in the revised paper accordingly). By its experimental design, both screens only suggest a link between TRPM7 and ARL15 – which does, however, neither indicate direct interaction nor does it show co-assembly of native TRPM7 and ARL15 into macromolecular complexes in the rodent brain as identified de novo in this study. In addition, several other TRPM7 interactions were suggested in both screens but not confirmed by our experiments. Collectively, we do not think that the current scientific literature compromises the novelty of our findings.</p><p>However, we agree with Reviewer 3 that the assembly of CNNMs and ARL15 with TRPM7 is an intriguing finding that deserves further functional analysis. Accordingly, we conducted additional electrophysiological and biochemical experiments to elucidate the functional impact of ARL15 and CNNM3 on TRPM7. The obtained results further supported our initial hypothesis that ARL15 acts as a potent negative regulator of the TRPM7 channel. In contrast, our systematic assessment of CNNM3 effects on the channel and kinase moiety of TRPM7 revealed that CNNM3 represents the first known protein, which acts as a negative regulator of TRPM7 kinase activity. Both claims are novel and undoubtedly will stimulate follow-up studies across different research areas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Relevant to the point above, how are CNNM protein expression and localization altered in TRPM7-/- cells? Could CNNM mistrafficking or impaired function account for the differences in magnesium homeostasis observed in TRPM7-/- cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above (Essential revision point 4), we used ICP-MS to measure total concentrations of magnesium in TRPM7<sup>-/-</sup> HEK293T cells transfected with TRPM7, CNNM3 or TRPM7 with CNNM3 cDNAs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We found that the ability of TRPM7 to regulate cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels was not affected by CNNM3.</p><p>It is important to note that the amount of CNNM proteins in the rodent brain exceeds that of TRPM7 by a factor of 400 as determined by quantitative MS-analysis. This means that only a minor portion of CNNMs occurs in complex with TRPM7 (while all TRPM7 proteins may co-assemble with CNNMs). We, therefore, did not investigate the localization of CNNM proteins in TRPM7<sup>-/-</sup> HEK293Tcells.</p><p>It should also be stressed that the current literature provides conflicting views on the functional role of CNNMs. While some investigators suggested that mammalian CNNMs can function as Na<sup>+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchanger responsible for Mg<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the cell, other researchers proposed that CNNMs are responsible for Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake into cells. To the best of our knowledge, electrophysiological characterization of CNNM proteins was not achieved yet. Along these lines, resolving existing controversies over the functional role of CNNMs by using TRPM7 as a readout system may be misleading and is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As requested, we conducted patch-clamp experiments with HEK293 cells expressing CNNM3 or ARL15 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 4, new Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

TRPM7 antibodies are notoriously challenging with respect to specificity. The authors described negative control experiments using TRPM7-/- cells.

The co-IP experiments with overexpression of TRPM7 and then each of identified TRPM7 interactors, CNNM1-4, ARL15 is the least specific experiment possible for confirmation. Why not perform endogenous TRPM7 IP (since the Abs seem to work for IP) and then probe for endogenous, or even overexpressed CNNM and ARL15? Conversely, is it possible to IP endogenous, or overexpressed CNNM or ARL15 and detect endogenous TRPM7 on WB? These additional co-IP would strengthen this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out in (1) of <italic>‘Essential revision’</italic>, TRPM7 was first affinity-isolated from native tissue (rodent brain), and the identified interactors CNNMs and ARL15 were verified in subsequent experiments. Given the large excess of CNNM proteins over TRPM7 in membranes of cells/tissues tested so far, reverse purification does not appear to be a promising approach. Furthermore, it would require exceptionally efficient <italic>anti-CNNM</italic> antibodies and KO controls which are unfortunately not yet at hand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
