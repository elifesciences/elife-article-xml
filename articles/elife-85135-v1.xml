Investigations of the transcriptome and epigenome have revealed important gene regulatory networks underlying this crucial developmental event. However, the posttranscriptional control of gene expression and protein abundance during human corticogenesis remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue by using human telencephalic brain organoids grown using a dual reporter cell line to isolate neural progenitors and neurons and performed cell class and developmental stage-specific transcriptome and proteome analysis. Integrating the two datasets revealed modules of gene expression during human corticogenesis. Investigation of one such module uncovered mTOR-mediated regulation of translation of the 5’TOP element-enriched translation machinery in early progenitor cells. We show that in early progenitors partial inhibition of the translation of ribosomal genes prevents precocious translation of differentiation markers. Overall, our multiomics approach proposes novel posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms crucial for the fidelity of cortical development.</p></abstract><kwd-group

highly elaborate process occurring over several months. During this process multipotent neural progenitors give rise initially to excitatory neurons of the different layers of the cerebral cortex and later to glial cells. Studies using mouse model systems, human fetal samples, as well as brain organoids have revealed elaborate spatiotemporal gene regulatory networks that orchestrate mammalian corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadwell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shibata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vaid and Huttner, 2020</xref>). However, an emerging theme from mouse corticogenesis studies highlights the additional role of posttranscriptional gene regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and translational repression, in determining progenitor cell fate and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoye and Silver, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lennox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zahr et al., 2019</xref>). Whether similar mechanisms play a role in human neurodevelopment remains elusive. Hence, investigating the posttranscriptional control of gene expression and protein abundance is crucial to comprehensively understand gene regulation during human neurodevelopment.</p><p>Transcriptome analyses have placed a lot of importance on transcript abundance, however, the relationship between transcript and protein abundance remains elusive. While previous studies have investigated posttranscriptional regulation of specific genes or the impact of loss of key RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoye and Silver, 2021</xref>), proteome-scale analyses of gene regulation during human corticogenesis have been lacking. Currently available proteome data from hiPSC-derived neural progenitors and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djuric et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Varderidou-Minasian et al., 2020</xref>), cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McClure-Begley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melliou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nascimento et al., 2019</xref>), and the fetal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djuric et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melliou et al., 2022</xref>) are an important step toward establishing a human neurodevelopmental proteomic repertoire. However, these studies suffer from some of the following limitations: (a) due to the inherent diversity of cell types present during corticogenesis, bulk tissue data do not provide cell type-specific information, (b) cell sorting strategies result in datasets that suffer from low number of successfully detected proteins, and (c) importantly, a direct comparison of the transcript and protein expression to understand posttranscriptional gene regulation has been missing.</p><p>We addressed these issues by using a dual reporter cell line to separate progenitors and neurons from the human brain organoid tissue and performed cell class- and developmental stage-specific transcriptome and proteome analysis. We integrated the two datasets to identify gene expression modules active during neural progenitor proliferation and subsequent neurogenesis in the developing cortical tissue. This dataset is available as a resource for the community in the form of a Shiny app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://organoid.multiomics.vbc.ac.at">https://organoid.multiomics.vbc.ac.at</ext-link>). We followed up on one gene expression module in detail and found that the genes of the core translational machinery, containing the ‘5' terminal oligopyrimidine’ (5’TOP) motif in their 5’UTR, are coregulated posttranscriptionally during neurodevelopment. We show that in contrast to neurons, translation of 5’TOP transcripts is partially inhibited in early progenitors, resulting in discordant RNA-protein relationship between the two cell classes. This regulation of the 5’TOP element-enriched translational machinery is due to lower mTOR activity in early progenitors and is crucial for the fidelity of cortical development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA-protein multiomics of neural progenitors and neurons isolated from telencephalic organoids</title><p>To investigate progenitor and neuron-specific gene regulatory programs, we generated a dual reporter H9 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line that enables sorting of neural progenitors and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To label neural progenitors, we replaced the stop codon of one allele of the pan-neural progenitor marker gene <italic>SOX2</italic> with P2A-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Tagging the endogenous gene would recapitulate the endogenous gene regulatory programs with minimal interference. On the other hand, to label neurons, we inserted dTomato driven by human Synapsin1 (hSYN1) promoter in the AAVS1 safe harbor locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using this dual reporter line, we generated brain organoids enriched in dorsal telencephalic tissue using a previously published organoid culture protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) to recapitulate the key stages of corticogenesis, when multipotent progenitors give rise to diverse excitatory neurons of distinct layer identities. Immunostaining for EGFP and dTomato confirmed broad expression of the fluorophores in the progenitor and neuronal zones, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Analysis of sparsely labeled organoids set up using 5% dual reporter hESCs and 95% non-reporter, wild-type hESCs allowed us to dissect the expression of the markers at cellular level. First, it confirmed expression of EGFP and dTomato in the progenitor-rich ventricular zone (VZ) (SOX2), and the surrounding neuron-rich region (NeuN), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). It was observed that in accordance with their cytoplasmic localization, both fluorescent proteins marked the entire cell body and therefore also the long cellular processes characteristic of radial glia and neurons. A few cells expressed both EGFP and dTomato probably indicative of a transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, some EGFP positive cells were also located outside the typical VZ and stained positive for EOMES, a marker for intermediate progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, the dual reporter strategy exhibited the expected neurodevelopmental expression for progenitors and neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA-protein multiomics of progenitors and neurons in human brain organoids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental design.

Dissociation of the organoids followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) confirmed the occurrence of EGFP positive (EGFP+) and dTomato positive (dTomato+) cell populations across different stages of organoid development (days 40, 60, 90, and 120) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Additionally, an EGFP/dTomato double positive cell population was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). RNA-seq-based whole transcriptome analysis of these sorted cell populations and subsequent principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the double positive population at days 40 and 60 matched a transition stage between progenitors and neurons, while at days 90 and 120 it was more similar to EGFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, we focused on cells exclusively positive for single fluorophores as stringent criteria for bona fide progenitors (<italic>SOX2</italic>::EGFP+) and neurons (<italic>hSYN1</italic>::dTomato+). PCA showed that <italic>SOX2</italic>::EGFP+ cells and <italic>hSYN1</italic>::dTomato+ cells clustered separately and showed transcriptomic signatures of progenitors and neurons, respectively (PC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). These samples further separated according to the organoid developmental stages with little batch effect (PC2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>).</p><p>For proteome analysis, proteins from the cells sorted from the same organoid culture batches and time points as used for RNA-seq were tandem mass tag (TMT) labeled and combined for each batch separately. In total, 6740 proteins were detected by mass spectrometry of the sorted cell populations. Initial analysis confirmed that similar to the transcriptome, the proteome of sorted neurons (<italic>hSYN1</italic>::dTomato+) and progenitor cells (<italic>SOX2</italic>::EGFP+) segregated according to the cell class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C and D</xref>). Segregation by age was less striking potential due to technical limitations reported for TMT-labeling experiments, such as ratio compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Savitski et al., 2013</xref>) and channel cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Searle and Yergey, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptome and proteome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) confirmed that EGFP and dTomato expression matched the expression of endogenous <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SYN1,</italic> thus highlighting the suitability of our dual reporter strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Furthermore, this analysis revealed that the <italic>SOX2</italic>::EGFP+ population encompassed all different classes of cortical progenitors including ventricular radial glia (expression of <italic>SOX1, PAX6</italic>), intermediate progenitors (<italic>EOMES</italic>), as well as outer radial glia (<italic>HOPX</italic>). The expression patterns of these markers followed the expected temporal trajectories of cortical development. While the markers of ventricular radial glia were expressed at all stages, markers of intermediate progenitors and outer radial glia showed enrichment at days 60 and 90, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>hSYN1</italic>::dTomato+ population included excitatory neurons of all different cortical layers and followed the expected temporal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with deep-layer markers (<italic>TBR1, BCL11B</italic>) being expressed before upper-layer markers (SATB2, CUX2). The enrichment of dorsal telencephalic fate was confirmed by the expression of above stated markers of cortical progenitors and neurons along with high expression of FOXG1 and EMX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and undetectable levels of ventral markers (NKX2.1, LHX6) (TPM values below 1). In line with the PCA, the excluded double positive population at days 40 and 60 showed expression of progenitor and neuronal markers at levels intermediate to those in <italic>SOX2</italic>::EGFP+ population and <italic>hSYN1</italic>::dTomato+ population. This is indicative of a transition state between progenitors and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). However, at days 90 and 120, the double positive population showed mixed marker expression including high expression of general progenitor and outer radial glia markers, enrichment of gliogenic markers, as well as moderate expression of neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). These observations suggest that the double positive population does not represent a particular cell class but rather cellular transition states and mixtures of different cell types. It further supported our decision to focus on cells exclusively positive for single fluorophores.</p><p>Finally, we asked if the organoid dissociation and cell sorting strategy resulted in the loss of specific proteins and cell types. Therefore, we performed a proteome analysis of intact organoids pooling the four time points and compared the protein expression to a pool containing all sorted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). We observed that mainly extracellular matrix (laminins, collagens) and cell adhesion proteins (e.g. AGRN, VCAN), as well as markers for astrocytes (GFAP) and choroid plexus (TTR) were lost upon tissue dissociation and dual reporter-based FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Overall, we generated a time-resolved transcriptome and proteome dataset of neural progenitors (<italic>SOX2</italic>::EGFP+) and neurons (<italic>hSYN1</italic>::dTomato+) sorted from telencephalic organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Integrated transcriptome and proteome analysis reveals gene expression modules active during neurodevelopment</title><p>Next, we examined the general degree of correlation between mRNA and protein levels. We detected mean TPM values greater than 0 and at least one peptide for 6714 genes. Similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>), we observed only a limited correlation between absolute mRNA and protein levels, which seemed comparable between cell classes and developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Given the very different measurement units of RNA-seq and Mass-spec, a PCA on the combined datasets revealed that almost 80% of the variation was explained by the omics method (PC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>) and not by cell class or developmental time point highlighting the importance of data normalization. Furthermore, to identify groups of genes that follow similar relative gene expression profiles at RNA and protein level in progenitors and neurons over time, we combined the two datasets upon rescaling using gene-by-gene z-score normalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). PCA of the combined datasets confirmed that the scaled data grouped by cell classes and developmental age and not by the omics method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Using the z-score scaled dataset we first fit a global regression model to identify genes differentially expressed between the two cell classes on RNA and/or protein level. In a second regression step, genes showing significant temporal profile differences for RNA and protein expression in progenitors and neurons were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nueda et al., 2014</xref>). Out of the 6714 genes, we could successfully fit regression models for 5978 genes, 3668 of which showed significant temporal expression changes between cell classes on RNA and/or protein levels. Finally, we performed hierarchical clustering to identify genes with underlying common trends of RNA-protein expression. To estimate an optimal number of biologically meaningful clusters, we used the ‘within cluster sums of squares’, ‘average silhouette’, and ‘gap statistics’ methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6C</xref>). In the end, a total of 3368 genes were classified into nine modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The remaining 2310 genes were considered as ‘not clustered’ and 736 genes for which the first regression fit failed as ‘not fit’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). These genes lacked specific expression patterns and were enriched in house-keeping genes, including core components of the proteasome, spliceosome, and RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7F</xref>).

Furthermore, the average global trends of relative expression of RNA and proteins helped to postulate potential regulatory mechanisms for each module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, we examined the absolute expression levels of a few individual member genes, to verify that the global trends are reflected for individual genes without normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Modules 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9 showed very strong cell class-specific expression patterns matching the sorting strategy for progenitors and neurons (defined here as ‘C’ modules) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Modules 1 and 2 showed higher relative expression in the progenitors than neurons across all time points and were enriched in DNA replication and cell activation-related genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). For module 2, progenitor-enriched expression increased with time, in line with the observation that many outer radial glia markers were members of this cluster. Genes in modules 7, 8, and 9 showed higher expression in neurons than progenitors across all time points. Module 7 was enriched in genes related to mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which is in agreement with the metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation observed during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwata and Vanderhaeghen, 2021</xref>). Modules 8 and 9 were enriched in axonal and pre- and postsynaptic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Importantly, in ‘C’ modules, global relative expression of RNA and protein followed largely similar trends, indicating that the regulation of these genes might occur via cell class-specific transcription or transcript retention and decay.</p><p>Interestingly, the global profiles of relative RNA and protein expression did not follow similar trends for other modules, which instead showed a temporal or cell class-specific discrepancy. Modules 4 and 6 showed relative gene expression changing with time (‘T’ modules) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In module 4, expression decreased with time and the average RNA trends for these genes were similar for progenitors and neurons. However, progenitors expressed relatively higher amounts of protein. Such a trend might be explained by less efficient translation or reduced protein stability of these genes in neurons. This module includes known early fate specification genes such as <italic>FEZF2</italic>, as well as genes related to glycolysis, a process more prominent in progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwata and Vanderhaeghen, 2021</xref>). In contrast, module 6 genes were expressed more at later stages. The average RNA trends of these genes were similar for progenitors and neurons, but protein levels were higher in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting less efficient translation or reduced protein stability in progenitors over neurons. This cluster includes upper-layer fate regulators such as SATB2 and CUX2.</p><p>The remaining modules 3 and 5 showed more ambiguous patterns of expression (‘A’ modules) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Genes from module 3 showed considerably higher transcript levels in progenitors than neurons, although protein levels between the two cell classes were more similar. This observation suggested that translation of these genes is either less efficient in progenitors or enhanced in neurons, or that protein stability is different between the two cell classes. Gene enrichment analysis suggested enrichment of translational machinery proteins including those of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Lastly, module 5 genes showed opposite patterns for RNA and protein relation in progenitors and neurons. The relative RNA levels showed a temporal increase in the two cell classes, with late-stage neurons expressing even higher amounts than corresponding progenitors. Despite this trend, the relative protein levels were higher in progenitors than neurons and with the difference being highest at early stages. This pattern suggested higher translational efficiency or higher protein stability of these genes in progenitors over neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This module is enriched in RBPs like DEAD box proteins and proteins important for rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the correlation of the relative abundance of RNA to protein for each gene expression module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Modules that show a high cell class-specific expression (‘C’ modules) showed a higher correlation than modules with broader expression patterns (‘T’ and ‘A’ modules) reflected in the coherency between RNA and protein trends. Thus, by combining RNA and protein expression data, we identified gene modules with cell class-specific and temporal gene expression patterns, as well as modules with seemingly ambiguous expression patterns that show divergent coherency between relative RNA and protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Analysis of module-specific RNA regulatory features highlights the 5'TOP gene module</title><p>The emergence of highly distinct expression modules raises the possibility that the genes within each module are regulated transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally by common cell class- or stage-specific mechanisms.

To this end, we performed module-wise over- and underrepresentation analysis for RBP-binding motifs in the 5’ and 3’UTR elements of the member genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Modules 1 and 9, whose member genes showed most cell class-specific expression, showcased high numbers of RBP motifs that were significantly enriched or depleted in the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The RBPs identified in our analysis include several RBPs (SMAUG2/SAMD4B, IMP1/IGF2BP1, HUR/ELAVL1, NOVA2, PTBP1, RBFOX1) previously shown to play an important role in neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lennox et al., 2017</xref>). Upon comparing over- and underrepresented motifs among different modules, we observed that there was a reciprocal relationship between motifs enriched in the progenitor modules 1 and 2 and the neuronal module 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that the RBP motifs we identified and their associated proteins might play a prominent role in cell class-specific expression to promote progenitor or neuron-specific gene regulation. For instance, we observed that motifs for the RBP RBFOX1, which was shown to promote neuronal expression of synaptic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), were enriched in the 3’UTRs of module 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) in line with the enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms for synaptic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As another example, ELAVL1 protein was shown to be important to maintain progenitor state by stabilization of key cell cycle and notch signaling transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Domínguez et al., 2011</xref>). In line with this, motifs for the ELAVL family, especially ELAVL1, were enriched in the 3’UTRs of modules 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) that showed enrichment for GO terms for cell cycle and neural progenitor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we searched for miRNA-binding sites in the 3’UTR, which are known to repress the expression of transcripts they bind to. Module-wise analysis showed a significantly higher density of miRNA-binding sites for genes of modules 6 and 8, indicating that the expression of some fate regulators and neuronal genes is regulated by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For example, the upper-layer neuronal fate regulator gene SATB2, a member of module 6 is regulated through the binding of miR-541 and miR-92a/b to its 3’UTR thereby preventing its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martins et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, these data indicated that trans-regulatory factors play a major role in the regulation of transcripts with cell class-specific expression (‘C’ modules).</p><p>Next, we analyzed cis-regulatory features inherent in the mRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). We compared the lengths of coding sequences (CDS) and the 5’ and 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Compared to all other modules, module 3 transcripts were overall shorter in all these features, whereas modules 8 and 9 seemed to have longer 5’ and 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Secondary structures in a transcript can be estimated by prediction of minimum free energy (MFE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathews and Turner, 2006</xref>), which is positively correlated with translation rate and a measure of RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nomura et al., 1984</xref>). Our analysis revealed that the MFE for the CDS as well as the 5’ and 3’UTRs were overall higher for module 3, indicative of less stable secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). In contrast, the 5’UTRs of modules 8 and 9 genes showed overall significantly lower MFE indicating more stable structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Previous studies have shown that neurons are particularly enriched for longer genes that are susceptible to differential transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sugino et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis supports these observations and additionally raises the possibility that the long transcripts of neuron-enriched genes and their complex UTRs might also contribute to complex posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. On the contrary, short and simpler transcripts in the ribosome-enriched module 3 might circumvent some of the gene regulatory mechanisms and govern their unique expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p><p>Translation initiation efficiency is directly influenced by the Kozak sequence, which refers to the six nucleotides preceding the AUG start codon and the nucleotide immediately downstream. We computationally calculated a Kozak context score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floor and Doudna, 2016</xref>) that describes the overall similarity to the consensus sequence GCCRCCAUGG (<italic>R</italic>=A or G) for all transcripts. Interestingly, genes in ‘C’ modules have weaker Kozak context scores, suggesting reduced translational initiation rates that potentially allow precise translational regulation of these transcripts via additional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, genes in ‘A’ modules have the overall highest Kozak scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar differences between ‘C’ and ‘A’ modules were also observed for the occurrence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5’ UTR. It has been suggested that uORFs do not affect mRNA levels but can significantly reduce translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa et al., 2013</xref>). We predicted uORFs by occurrence of [ACT]TG sequence upstream of the main ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floor and Doudna, 2016</xref>). We observed a reduced number of uORFs predicted in modules 3, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting a limited role of uORFs in their expression pattern in contrast to gene expression in the ‘C’ modules. Lastly, we observed that the 3’UTRs of genes in module 6 are enriched in adenylate/uridylate (AU)-rich sequences that promote cellular context-dependent mRNA decay or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Otsuka et al., 2019</xref>). This mode of regulation probably supports the expression pattern of this module, where transcripts are translationally silenced in late progenitors and active in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, module 9 has significantly less AU-rich elements in the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>) that corroborates the observed depletion of binding motifs for the ELAV-like family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which is a major binding partner of AU-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 1997</xref>). Overall, this analysis revealed that cell class-specific gene expression seems to be regulated by diverse posttranscriptional mechanisms: trans-regulatory factors, secondary structures in UTRs, imperfect Kozak and uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>). These mechanisms might contribute to the high correlation of relative RNA and protein abundances. However, despite having perfect Kozak sequences, ‘A’ module genes have the lowest correlation of relative levels of RNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>GO-term analysis showed that ‘A’ modules (modules 3 and 5) were enriched in ribosome and ribosomal biogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This was especially striking for module 3 which was enriched in ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic translation initiation factors that contain the unique regulatory 5’TOP motif in their 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Philippe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>). This observation raised the possibility that 5’TOP genes exhibit a unique RNA-protein expression pattern during corticogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Relative protein yield of 5’TOP mRNAs is lower in early progenitors compared to early born neurons</title><p>Analyzing the expression pattern of all 5’TOP genes showed that although expressed highly in both progenitors and neurons, 5’TOP transcripts were relatively more abundant in progenitors compared to neurons, with this effect being the most striking at early stage of organoid development at day 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Analyzing the transcript distribution by RNA-FISH for two example 5’TOP genes <italic>RPL5 and RPL11</italic> in 40-day-old organoids confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), with high intensity of fluorescence being present in the progenitor-rich VZ, and low in the surrounding neuron-rich region. This pattern was not observed by RNA-FISH for the immature neuron marker <italic>DCX</italic> and in the no-probe control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). At protein level, however, a relative difference in the immunostaining in progenitor- and neuron-rich regions was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This discrepancy was also replicated in the absolute levels of RNA and protein for RPL5 and RPL11 (data available in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://organoid.multiomics.vbc.ac.at/#section-temporal">R shiny app</ext-link>), indicating that it is not an artifact of the normalization strategy. To verify this RNA-protein discrepancy at cellular resolution, we grew sparsely labeled organoids using 95% of unlabeled control H9 cells and 5% of the dual reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we stained cryosections from these organoids for transcripts and protein of the 5’TOP genes <italic>RPL5</italic> and <italic>RPL11</italic> by RNA-FISH and by immunostainings, respectively. We quantified the average RNA and protein intensity per cell of individual progenitors labeled by EGFP and neurons labeled by dTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Indeed, we could validate that <italic>RPL5</italic> and <italic>RPL11</italic> show higher transcript levels in progenitors than neurons, but protein levels were not different between the two cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

In contrast, transcripts of cell class-specific modules 1 and 9 showed not only a cell class-specific expression in the cytosol but also coherently their specific occurrence in the translated polysome fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Hence, we hypothesized that some of the excess 5’TOP transcripts present in the progenitors might reside in a translationally inhibited stage.</p><p>To test if similar mechanisms operate in the 3D organoid tissue and if the translation of 5’TOP genes is indeed different between early progenitors and neurons, we generated hPSC lines (H9 and Rozh-5 backgrounds) carrying a reporter that contained a 5’TOP motif in the 5’UTR of a doxycycline-inducible tagBFP fluorescent protein. As a negative control we generated non-5’TOP control reporter lines, in which the 5’TOP nucleotides were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Initially, the fidelity of these reporter lines was evaluated at hPSC stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Untreated hPSCs did not show leaky tagBFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), whereas doxycycline treatment induced strong tagBFP fluorescence in all six reporter cell lines and no differences between the 5’TOP and non-5’TOP reporters were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As the translation of 5’TOP mRNAs is known to be inhibited upon mTOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>), we treated cells with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. As expected, we observed reduced tagBFP expression in the 5’TOP compared to the non-5’TOP reporter lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This observation confirmed that tagBFP expression in the reporter lines is indeed mTOR pathway-regulated and thus suitable to study 5’TOP translation during organoid development. Hence, we used these reporter lines to grow organoids that we treated at day 40 with doxycycline to induce the expression of tagBFP. Three days after doxycycline induction, the organoids were dissociated to make a single cell suspension and immunostained for progenitor (SOX2) and neuron (TUJ1) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The expression of tagBFP and cell class-specific markers was analyzed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). We observed that only ~30% of the cells in the organoids expressed tagBFP, indicating that it is difficult to achieve uniform doxycycline-mediated activation of the construct in 3D organoid tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We therefore only analyzed cells that expressed tagBFP and were SOX2-PE or TUJ1-488 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In progenitors (SOX2+), the 5’TOP reporter showed more cells with lower tagBFP fluorescence compared to the non-5’TOP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, in neurons (TUJ1+), the 5’TOP reporter showed the tendency toward higher tagBFP expressing cells compared to the non-5’TOP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was observed consistently between different human pluripotent stem cell lines (H9 and Rozh-5 backgrounds) and experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>), indicating that in general, the presence of 5’TOP motif lowers the effective tagBFP protein yield in progenitors. Together, we provide multiple pieces of evidence indicating that despite higher mRNA levels, 5’TOP element-containing mRNAs do not give higher protein yield in early progenitors than neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Early progenitors exhibit developmental use of a stress-associated 5’TOP translational control mechanism</title><p>5’TOP translation is mainly known to be regulated during cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>). During stress conditions, 5’TOP RNAs localize to stress granules (SGs), which are dense RNA-protein condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damgaard and Lykke-Andersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilbertz et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we hypothesized that a similar mechanism might play a role during corticogenesis in organoids and asked if we observe stress granule-like (SGL) structures in the brain organoid tissue. We immunostained for the SG marker G3BP1 in untreated organoids and organoids treated with sodium arsenite (NaAs), a strong inducer of cellular stress. As expected, more G3BP1-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>) with higher fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>) were observed in the NaAs-treated organoids. However, the occurrence of weak G3BP1 puncta in control organoids, particularly in the VZ was supportive of our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Similar G3BP1-positive puncta were also observed in the VZ of organoids grown from the Rozh-5 hPSC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Analyzing the distribution of another stress marker phospho-EIF2 confirmed that unlike NaAs-treated organoids, the control organoids did not show generally high levels of phospho-EIF2. This observation showed that the control organoid tissue is not under acute stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4E and F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked if 5’TOP transcripts localize to G3BP1-positive SGL structures. For this, we generated a G3BP1 reporter line (H9 background) in which we endogenously tagged G3BP1 with the fluorescent protein mScarlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We generated organoids from this line and observed mScarlet-positive puncta that co-stained with an anti-G3BP1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>) mostly in the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5C</xref>).

The intensity of the FISH signal was similar in the SGL structures and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which would suggest that only a small fraction of the mRNA is sequestered in the granules, in agreement with reduced protein yield and not a translational block. In contrast, RPL5 and RPL11 transcripts were strongly enriched in G3BP1-positive granules in NaAs-treated organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5D</xref>) in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damgaard and Lykke-Andersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilbertz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To reinforce our observation that 5’TOP transcripts are partially translationally silenced, we estimated the relative RNA stability from the fold change of exonic to intronic reads using our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkallas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s6sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 6—source data 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that 5’TOP RNAs are more stable in the progenitors than neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A</xref>) and that this difference is most prominent at day 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B</xref>). In contrast, the cell class-specific modules 1 and 9 showed higher transcript stabilities in progenitors and neurons, respectively, in line with our transcript and protein expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Thus, early progenitors seem to have excess mature 5’TOP mRNAs with higher RNA stability and a fraction of these is not actively translated and sequestered into G3BP1-positive SGL structures.</p><p>The mTOR pathway is a major regulator of 5’TOP translation, which is inhibited upon mTOR pathway inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the status of the mTOR pathway by immunostaining for phosphorylated forms of two of its substrates: 4E-BP1 and RPS6 (S6). The uniform distribution of phospho-4E-BP1 (p4E-BP1) across the tissue indicated generally active mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, as reported previously for organoid and fetal samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eze et al., 2021</xref>) phospho-S6 (pS6) staining showed enrichment outside the VZ in neuronal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These observations suggest that differential mTOR activity in early progenitors, especially ventricular radial glia, and neurons might regulate differential 5’TOP translation. Based on these results we propose that the mTOR-5’TOP translational regulation axis is active in early neural progenitors and might play a crucial role in neuronal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>mTOR-mediated regulation of 5’TOP mRNA translation is crucial for the fidelity of cortical development</title><p>We hypothesized that mTOR pathway overactivation should result in increased translation of ribosomal and other 5'TOP-containing genes in neural progenitors. To upregulate the mTOR pathway during organoid development, we generated hPSCs (H9 and Rozh-5 background) with loss of function mutations in TSC2 (TSC2<sup>-/-</sup>), a negative regulator of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Immunostainings of organoid tissue confirmed the absence of TSC2 protein in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids showed significantly higher signal of pS6 throughout the VZ when compared to the control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating overactivation of the TSC2-mTOR pathway. To check if increased TSC2-mTOR signaling indeed leads to excess translation of 5’TOP genes, we performed polysome profiling from control and TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids (Rozh-5 background, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and sequenced the ribosome-bound transcripts in the monosome (80S), low- and high-polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Due to the large amount of material needed for polysome profiling, we used 37-day-old intact organoids that contain a vast majority of cells in the progenitor state. Initially, we performed differential gene association analysis between TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> and control samples for each fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We indeed found an enrichment for ribosomal genes specifically in the high-polysome fraction of TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> over control organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). When specifically analyzing 5’TOP transcripts we found overall increased levels in the high-polysome fractions in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids compared to control organoids, whereas similar levels were detected in the low-polysome and monosome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Accordingly, the relative fraction of 5’TOP transcripts actively translated in high-polysomes over the translationally less active monosomes was increased in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> over control organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). To confirm that the upregulation of 5’TOP transcripts in the polysome fraction results in increased protein levels, we performed RNA-FISH and immunostainings in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> and control organoids for RPL5 and RPL11. While we could not detect differences in their RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), we observed an increase in protein levels in the VZ of TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids in H9 as well as Rozh-5 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). Taken together, these results verify an increase in 5’TOP mRNA translation upon mTOR overactivation and indicate that physiological mTOR activity is crucial to regulate protein levels of 5’TOP genes in early progenitors. Thus, our results suggest that the translational machinery itself is uniquely regulated posttranscriptionally during neurodevelopment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>mTOR overactivation causes increased translation of 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5’TOP) transcripts leading to precocious differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining of 40-day-old TSC2<sup>+/+</sup> and TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoid sections (Rozh-5 background) with anti-TSC2 antibody.

We checked if the genes differentially associated with ribosome fractions in polysome profiling were enriched in any of the nine gene expression modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) by over- and underrepresentation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). For genes, which were significantly higher in the high-polysome fraction of TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> over those of control, we observed a significant enrichment for modules 4, 7, and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Module 7 is enriched in mitochondrial genes known to be differentially expressed in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> at transcript level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koyanagi et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the enrichment of neuronal module 9 to be highly translated in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> is striking. In contrast, the genes which were less translated in the TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> organoids over control were significantly enriched in progenitor-specific modules 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This data suggests that mTOR overactivation and the subsequent impact on the translation machinery shifts the state of the tissue toward precocious differentiation. These observations were also corroborated in the underrepresentation analysis. Genes with higher translation in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> were significantly depleted in modules 1 and 2 (progenitor-specific expression), whereas genes with lower translation in TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> were significantly depleted in module 9 (neuron-specific expression) as well as module 3, which is enriched in 5’TOP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>We next tested if the increased translation of differentiation-related genes is reflected by an increased neuronal differentiation using the H9 dual reporter line. For this, we performed flow cytometry using dual reporter TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> and TSC2<sup>+/+</sup> organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C and D</xref>). In agreement with the polysome profiling data from Rozh-5 organoids, we observed a significant reduction in the fraction of EGFP+ cells (progenitors) and a significant increase in the fraction of dTomato+ cells (neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Overall, the ratio of dTomato+ cells to EGFP+ was increased in the TSC2<sup>-/-</sup>, indicative of an increased differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Apart from an increase in neuronal markers, we also observed precocious occurrence of the glial marker S100B in the TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> tissue at day 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E</xref>), reinforcing our observation that the progenitors are shifted toward a precocious differentiation state. This was already observed at day 40 and possibly explains the premature gliogenesis observed at later stages of TSC2<sup>-/-</sup> cortical spheroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blair et al., 2018</xref>). While it is difficult to separate the primary and secondary effects of mTOR overactivation, we propose that the partial translational inhibition of 5’TOP mRNAs in early neural progenitors is crucial for cortical development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that multiple transcripts encoding components of the translational machinery that contain 5’TOP motifs are regulated on a posttranscriptional level during neurodevelopment. 5’TOP transcripts are abundantly expressed in all cells and yet show a unique regulation compared to other cellular transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). During mitosis, 5’TOP transcripts skip the global translational inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2016</xref>), whereas in stress context these transcripts are the first ones to be translationally inhibited to conserve the resources and energy of the cell by downregulating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). While translational regulation of 5’TOP transcripts is intensely studied in the context of stress, we propose that it also plays a major role during corticogenesis. Our observation of SG-like RNA granules in early ventricular radial glia in human brain organoids suggests possible occurrence of stress-associated processes during human corticogenesis. A recent report suggests that the energetic stage of a cell can impact the formation of SGLs under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the well-documented difference in the metabolic states of glycolysis-dependent early progenitors and oxidative phosphorylation-heavy neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwata and Vanderhaeghen, 2021</xref>) might contribute to the regulation of 5’TOP mRNAs through the formation of SGL structures. Another stress-related pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is physiologically active at early stages of mouse corticogenesis to promote neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laguesse et al., 2015</xref>). Overactivation of the UPR beyond its physiological levels affects the generation of intermediate progenitors in the mouse and human cortical tissue, resulting in a microcephalic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laguesse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pașca et al., 2019</xref>).

Recently, a role of the translational regulation of 5’TOP transcripts has been suggested in germline stem cell differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2022</xref>) and in mouse adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baser et al., 2019</xref>). It will be exciting to investigate if stress-associated pathways play a physiological role during the development of not only the cerebral cortex but also other tissues.</p><p>Regulation of the 5’TOP mRNA translation ultimately determines the availability of ribosomes in the cells. Ribosome availability is proposed to be a critical factor determining the translation of mRNAs with complex 5’UTRs with secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hetman and Slomnicki, 2019</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, we found that module 9 neuronal genes that feature more complex 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>) are particularly deregulated upon 5’TOP translation deregulation accompanying mTOR overactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Our data suggests that regulating the number of ribosomes is particularly important in the early progenitors. An imbalance of ribosomal components caused by deregulation of 5’TOP transcripts likely causes aberrant translation of differentiation markers and affects the fidelity of cortical development. Reduced ribosome biogenesis and availability is also indicated at an early stage of mouse corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harnett et al., 2021</xref>). While many gene-specific examples of neural priming in radial glia are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zahr et al., 2018</xref>), our data suggest that radial glia regulate the translation of the translational machinery itself. We speculate that this regulation is crucial to maintain the multipotency of early progenitors to prevent aberrant translation of pre-existing transcripts of differentiation genes. Two new studies have alluded to the role of 5’TOP transcript regulation in the pathophysiology of human 7q11.23 copy variation disorders. These studies also show that perturbed 5’TOP translational regulation seems to impact the timing of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopez-Tobon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mihailovich et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, more studies show the importance of posttranscriptional regulation of ribosomal proteins in human brain development.</p><p>A global regulation of the translational machinery has been recently reported for mid-gestation stages of mouse corticogenesis, with gradual reduction in the translational efficiency of 5’TOP genes and the availability of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harnett et al., 2021</xref>). It would be interesting to test if similar changes occur during late corticogenesis in humans, which includes a complex repertoire of neural progenitors, especially the outer radial glia.</p><p>The mTOR pathway is a major regulator of 5’TOP mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>) and is a key feature of any healthy cell. The role of the mTOR pathway in progenitor proliferation and neuronal morphology and function is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Switon et al., 2017</xref>). However, the cell type- and developmental stage-specific roles of the mTOR pathway are becoming clear only recently. Our results in human brain organoid tissue show that early radial glia show lower mTOR activity in interphase. Studies using mouse, 2D neuronal cultures and cortical spheroid cultures have also reported a drop in mTOR activity during early stages of corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blair et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chau et al., 2018</xref>). Analysis of human fetal transcriptome of early stages has also suggested a similar trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eze et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, human outer radial glia that arise at later stages of corticogenesis exhibit higher mTOR activity, both in primary fetal tissue and in brain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates that the ventricular and outer radial glia feature different mTOR regulation. In line with this observation, the 5’TOP RNA-protein discrepancy in the progenitors and neurons is reduced at late stages, when the progenitor pool consists of a large population of outer radial glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, despite its general role, mTOR pathway activity undergoes modulation during distinct neurodevelopmental stages. Additionally, downstream effects of mTOR signaling are linked to diverse cellular processes such as translation, cell cycle, and actin biology. Therefore, linking the defects in the pathway to a final cellular phenotype remains challenging. We provide an alternative molecular role of this pathway to directly regulate ribosome availability and thus indirectly control many other downstream cellular pathways. Mutations in mTOR pathway-related genes are associated with many genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, and megalencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crino, 2016</xref>). Thus, to understand the disease mechanisms, it will be crucial to consider cell type- and stage-specific regulation of the mTOR pathway.</p><p>Beyond 5'TOP genes of the translational machinery, our dataset highlights distinct gene expression modules based on transcript and protein abundance traits. This includes cell class-specific ‘C’ modules with coherent RNA-protein expression as well as ‘T’ and ‘A’ modules where transcript and protein do not follow the same trajectories. Additionally, analysis of cis and trans regulatory factors alludes to distinct RNA regulation mechanisms that are potentially predominant for these genes and contribute to their expression patterns. For instance, the reciprocal relation in the RBP motif enrichment in 3’UTRs of ‘C’ modules 1 and 9 highlights interesting roles of RBPs to regulate cell class-specific gene expression. Thus, our approach opens new avenues to study RNA regulation during corticogenesis.</p><p>Finally, our integrated dataset describes cell class- and developmental stage-specific gene expression, both at RNA and protein level and is available to browse for the wider community in the form of a R-based Shiny app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://organoid.multiomics.vbc.ac.at">https://organoid.multiomics.vbc.ac.at</ext-link>). To our knowledge, this is the first time RNA and protein datasets for human corticogenesis have been integrated. Only looking at transcript or protein data wouldn’t have revealed the posttranscriptional regulation of the ribosomal genes, which are usually considered housekeeping genes and ignored for example in sc-RNA-seq analysis and often used as normalizers for gene expression. This rich resource can be used to browse RNA-protein expression patterns of various other genes across the human organoid developmental timeline. For instance, our data indicates that the gene regulation of the upper-layer marker SATB2 observed during mouse corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harnett et al., 2021</xref>) also holds true in humans. As characterized by the general trend of module 6, where the RNA expression of <italic>SATB2</italic> is high in progenitors and neurons of later stages, the trends at protein level suggest translational inhibition of the <italic>SATB2</italic> transcripts in progenitors. Integration with information on protein abundance is crucial for the comprehensive understanding of gene expression. This approach opens a new avenue to study the regulation and expression pattern of individual genes and gene modules. Thus, integrative omics approaches can reveal new biological mechanisms underlying diverse developmental events.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Our study highlights distinct gene expression modules based on transcript and protein abundance traits. To identify common posttranscriptional mechanisms that contribute to observed transcript and protein abundance, this study focused on transcript features influencing translational regulation. In future, it is also crucial to consider additional regulatory mechanisms such as RNA splicing and protein turnover, which were not analyzed in the current study and will contribute to a holistic understanding of posttranscriptional regulation in human corticogenesis.</p><p>Our current analysis was performed using human brain organoids, an experimentally amenable system for human corticogenesis. Use of a dual reporter line helped us to assess cell class-specific transcriptomic and proteomic features. Nevertheless, it is important to note that tissue dissociation impacts the morphology of the cells and can cause a bias in the transcripts and proteins sampled in the omics datasets. Hence, it is very crucial to validate the results using intact tissue as done for the 5’TOP motif containing genes in this study. Additionally, future studies are required to validate some of the findings in ethically derived human fetal tissue. Overall, our approach provides a powerful way to propose new hypotheses for posttranscriptional regulation in human corticogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs and cloning</title><p>All the oligos used in the manuscript are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The distribution was calculated as granule density, the number of granules was normalized to the number of nuclei in the field and as (b) the percentage of granules within the VZ per field. For measuring G3BP1 and FISH signal intensity in the granule-like structures, ROIs were drawn by tracing the outline of the granules. For measuring FISH signals in the nucleus and cytoplasm, similar ROIs were drawn in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Average intensities for each ROI were measured using the multi-measure tool. For measuring average antibody staining intensity in the VZ, a rectangular ROI was marked in the maximum intensity projection of the VZ. Average intensities for each ROI were measured using the multi measure tool. To enable integration of data from different experiments, results were z-score normalized per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA extraction, library generation, and RNA-seq</title><p>FACSed cells were pelleted and used for RNA isolation.

Each cell pellet was resuspended in 72.5 µl 10 M urea 50 mM HCl and incubated 10 min at room temperature. Then, 7.5 µl 1 M TEAB (triethylammonium bicarbonate) buffer (pH 8) was added and total protein amount determined by Bradford assays. Following, 1 µl benzonase and 1.25 µl 1 M DTT (dithiothreitol) was added to each sample and incubated for 37°C for 1 hr. Protein alkylation was performed with 2.5 µl of 1 M IAA (iodoacetamide) and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature and the reaction quenched with 0.6 µl 1 M DTT. All samples were diluted with 100 mM TEAB buffer to a urea concentration of 6 M and proteins digested with LysC (Wako) for 3 hr at 37°C using an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50. After the first digestion with LysC the samples were diluted with 100 mM TRIS buffer to a final urea concentration of 2 M. The final tryptic digestion (Trypsin Gold, Promega) was performed with an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50 overnight at 37°C. To evaluate the digest efficiency 100 ng of all samples were analyzed on a monolithic HPLC system. Following, peptides were desalted using C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak Vac 1 cc [50 mg], Waters) that were equilibrated with 500 µl methanol/water 50:50, 2×0.5 ml 80% acetonitrile (ACN) 0.1% formic acid (FA), and 3×0.5 ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) applying gentle pressure with compressed air. The pH of all samples was adjusted to pH &lt;2 with 10% TFA before they were loaded on the columns. All columns were washed with 6×0.5 ml 0.1% TFA applying gentle pressure using compressed air. To elute the sample 2×200 µl of 80% ACN and 0.1% FA were used and to remove the solvent completely from the column, gentle pressure was applied with compressed air. The organic content of the eluates was removed by using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator and samples were diluted to a volume of 200 µl with 0.1% FA, snap frozen with liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized overnight. The dried samples were dissolved in 100 µl 100 mM HEPES and quantified using a monolithic HPLC system. One bridge channel was produced from all FACS sorted cells.

Labeling efficiency was determined by LC-MS/MS on a small aliquot of each sample. Samples were mixed in equimolar amounts and equimolarity was evaluated again by LC-MS/MS. The mixed sample was acidified to a pH below 2 with 10% TFA and was desalted using C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak Vac 1 cc [50 mg], Waters).

The flow-through was collected as single fractions, along with the gradient fractions that were collected every minute. In total 60 fractions were collected, and low abundant fractions were pooled. ACN was removed by vacuum centrifugation and the samples were acidified with 0.1% TFA and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The UltiMate 3000 HPLC RSLC nano system (Thermo Scientific) was coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), equipped with a Proxeon nanospray source (Thermo Scientific).

MS/MS spectra were acquired using normalized collision energy of 35, isolation width of 0.7 m/z, resolution of 45,000, a target value of 1e5, and maximum fill time of 250 ms. For the detection of the TMT reporter ions a fixed first mass of 110 m/z was set for the MS/MS scans. Precursor ions selected for fragmentation (exclude charge state 1, 7, 8, &gt;8) were put on a dynamic exclusion list for 60 s.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Anita Bhattacharyya as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Replication of key findings/validation in at least one independent cell line. The data is from organoids from one human stem cell line, the female H9 human embryonic stem cell line, and so it is critical to validate the results on 1-2 additional stem cell lines, to rule out the possibility that these results are unique to this one cell line/individual.</p><p>2) Verification of stress response in primary tissue. The authors identified a stress-related role for processes in corticogenesis, although, without comparison to human tissue, it's possible that some of the results are due to the artificial nature of the organoids as at least some human brain organoid protocols have been reported to lead to ectopic activation of cellular stress pathways (Bhaduri et al., Nature 2019). This aspect of the study should be confirmed in primary tissue (mouse or human).</p><p>3) Modify claims or add additional data to address Reviewers' comments. There are several instances in which the authors make statements that are not supported by the data or neglect previously published data, as detailed in the reviews below.</p><p>a) Additional discussion or experiments should convey the impact of the results on progenitor subtypes and highlight the fact that oRGs are a population that is uniquely subject to mTOR activation.</p><p>b) Many RBPs have an important role in the regulation of mRNAs during brain development and neuronal differentiation (and are implicated in developmental disorders), including several of the proteins/families listed in Figure 3C. Please provide some examples and references to identify specific examples of proteins in the list that may play a role.</p><p>c) The results themselves do not suggest that the length of neuron-enriched genes contributes to their complex regulatory mechanisms, but add to the existing literature that should be cited</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12504</p><p>https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/13/i422/5045809</p><p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25232122/</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14319</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638137/</p><p>d) There are some limitations of the specific reporter and knockout hPSC lines that could be discussed more, as well as providing additional quality control measures including whether the lines remain karyotypically normal throughout the targeting procedure, whether gene expression faithfully recapitulates the activity of the promoters controlling their expression. Specifically, it appears that a significant GFP signal is detected within the neuronal layer (Figure 1B) and that there is a much larger double reporter-positive population than expected (Figure S2A).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This was a nice paper, and generally quite strong. A few questions/suggestions:</p><p>1. Profiling the &quot;in-between&quot; population would be a very interesting and important characterization with regards to the model of mTOR regulation and the progenitor/neuron transition.</p><p>2. The normalization is important, but did it impact the results? Can you validate protein levels in the cases where RNA and protein are dysregulated (ie RNA higher but protein lower and vis versa), specifically by looking more expansively at protein levels?</p><p>3. Subtypes are critical to cortical development. This approach clearly highlights progenitor/neuronal differences but could the observations be extended to one or two subtypes? Specifically, oRGs come to mind as a population that is uniquely subject to mTOR activation.</p><p>4. The TSC experiments are nice, but also are specific to that pathway and manner of regulation of mTOR signaling. It is possible that mTOR broadly has more complex or nuanced impacts upon 5'-TOP regulation. Thus, I would suggest pharmacologically overactivating and repressing it to explore similar impacts, or limiting the degree to which mTOR is described to overall control the regulation of these transcripts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors identified a stress-related role for processes in corticogenesis, although, without comparison to human tissue, it's possible that some of the results are due to the artificial nature of the organoids as they have been reported to have elevated stress (Bhaduri et al.,). The authors should tone down the statement &quot;Our observation of SG-like RNA-granules in early ventricular radial glia further supports the occurrence of stress-associated processes during corticogenesis,&quot; in the discussion as the organoid system does not completely mimic corticogenesis.</p><p>2. The data is from organoids from one human stem cell line, the female H9 human embryonic stem cell line and so it is critical to validate the results on 1-2 additional stem cell lines, to rule out the possibility that these results are unique to this one cell line/individual.</p><p>3. There are several instances in which the authors make statements that are not supported by the data or neglect previously published data.</p><p>a) Title:</p><p>a. The use of the word &quot;reveals&quot; in the title implies that post-transcriptional regulation of ribosomal genes has not been seen before, which isn't true, since it is established in other cell types. I think instead the title should reflect that the authors have shown posttranscriptional regulation of ribosomal genes in human neural tissues</p><p>i. https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/25/5/995/2360248</p><p>ii. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11029573/</p><p>iii. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18498749/</p><p>b.

The data is from organoids from one human stem cell line, the female H9 human embryonic stem cell line, and so it is critical to validate the results on 1-2 additional stem cell lines, to rule out the possibility that these results are unique to this one cell line/individual.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. We would like to point out that in the original manuscript we already used an additional hiPSC line – Rozh-5 to validate the key findings. In the mentioned figures, we observe the replication of the findings in this additional hPSC background for the pS6 distribution in the tissue (Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G), the 5’TOP reporter assay (Figure 4D,E and Figure 4—figure supplement 3) and the impact of TSC2 KO on RPL5 and RPL11 protein distribution (Figure 5G and Figure 5—figure supplement 3). In the revised version we have also validated occurrence of G3BP1 positive stress granule-like structures in the ventricular zone of Rozh5 organoids (Figure 4—figure supplement 4D).</p><p>Furthermore, the polysome profiling experiment in the original manuscript in Figure 5 was done in the Rozh-5 background. This was specifically done to address the point of genetic background. The results of the polysome profiling validated our hypothesis on mTOR-mediated regulation. The effect on neurogenesis identified through these experiments was later validated in the H9 dual reporter background (Figure 5—figure supplement 4D,E).</p><p>Overall, these results help to reduce the possibility that our observations are unique to one cell line/individual. We apologize that this was not clear in the first version of the manuscript, and we now mention it explicitly in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Verification of stress response in primary tissue. The authors identified a stress-related role for processes in corticogenesis, although, without comparison to human tissue, it's possible that some of the results are due to the artificial nature of the organoids as at least some human brain organoid protocols have been reported to lead to ectopic activation of cellular stress pathways (Bhaduri et al., Nature 2019). This aspect of the study should be confirmed in primary tissue (mouse or human).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. We would like to raise attention to the following points:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Indeed, the occurrence of stress in the brain organoids has been an important field of investigation. However, we would like to point out that recent publications from the group of Paola Arlotta (Uzquiano et al., Cell 2022; DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2022.09.010 ) and our own group (Vertesy and Eichmüller, EMBO journal 2022; DOI: 10.15252/embj.2022111118 ) have shown that the ‘stress levels’ are not as broadly distributed as initially proposed by Bhaduri et al. Nature 2019; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-1962-0. These studies show that only a minority of cells are present in the so called ‘stressed’ condition, which are mainly located towards the center of the organoid and predominant at 2 month and older stages of organoid growth. Keeping these points in mind, we think our microscopic observations of G3BP1-positive granular structures at day 40 do not focus on particularly stressed cells.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our analyses indicate that the same molecular regulation involved in 5’TOP translational inhibition in acute stress seems to play a role here in early progenitors. However, we do not propose that early progenitors are in a stressed state. In line with this hypothesis, we do not expect and do not observe occurrence of stress granules and other stress feature in every progenitor. While we observe G3BP1 positive stress granule-like structures in the organoids, they are overall rare as seen from the quantification. As a positive control for stress condition, we used sodium arsenite (NaAs) treatment which indeed resulted in very high number of G3BP1 positive granular structures observed almost in every cell. Additionally, in the revised manuscript we analyzed the distribution of phospho-EIF2a, a typical marker of stress response (As reviewed by Pakos-Zebrucka et al., EMBO report 2016 DOI: 10.15252/embr.201642195).</p></list-item></list><p>We found that while the tissue in NaAs-treated organoids shows very high levels of phosphoEIF2a, the control organoid tissue shows very low levels of phospho-EIF2a (Figure 4—figure supplement 4E,F). These observations further suggest that the organoid tissue is not under a general acute stress.</p><p>1. Another study by Esk et al., Science 2020 DOI: 10.1126/science.abb5390 analyzed ER morphology in the ventricular zone of telencephalic brain organoids grown using the same protocol. In this study the authors found that the control organoids show normal ER morphology, unlike organoids showing unfolded protein response and ER stress caused by loss of IER3IP1 protein. These results further provide another positive control for a stress condition and highlight absence of a general acute stress in brain organoids.</p><p>Bhaduri et al. Nature 2019 and the other studies mentioned in the first point conclude stress state based solely on transcriptomic signature and do not include any protein level investigation or cell biological assays to validate if the cells indeed show other signs of stress. Firstly, as pointed out by the reviewers, the general anecdotal evidence in the field and our own study highlights the importance of considering both RNA and protein information. Furthermore, research from the stress biology field indicates that there are important cellular changes independent of transcriptional changes that are exhibited by a stressed cell (protein aggregation, stress granule formation, phosphorylation of EIF2a, ER inflation), which are not directly observed in control organoids. Thus, the conclusion about stress in organoids proposed by Bhaduri et al. Nature 2019 should be considered with caution.</p><p>We do not have access to human fetal material where the associated ethical permissions would allow us to perform the suggested experiments at a suitable stage of fetal development. Instead, as suggested by the reviewers we tested occurrence of G3BP1 positive structures in the E12.5 developing mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). While we could observe a few G3BP1 puncta, these structures were not observed commonly. Hence, it is difficult to state if the same mechanism is at play in the developing mouse brain. There could be species differences due to different subtypes of progenitors and the timescale differences of cell cycle and development. Nevertheless, upon analysing a sc-RNAseq dataset for the developing mouse brain (Telley et al., Science 2019; DOI: 10.1126/science.aav2522 ), we could verify that the RNA difference between progenitors and neurons for 5’TOP genes can also be seen in the developing mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). This is in line with the analysis of the human fetal scRNA seq data (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F. Eze et al., Nat Neuroscience 2021; DOI: 10.1038/s41593-02000794-1).</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the raised concern, in addition to the newly added data mentioned above, we have made several text changes (Page 15, line 14-16; Page 22 line 3-6) to align our conclusions with the observations in the manuscript, including the title of the manuscript. We have explicitly mentioned this caveat and the need to replicate these findings in primary human tissue in a limitations paragraph at the end of the manuscript (Page 25, line 15 to Page 26, line 4).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of developing mouse brain tissue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal scans of ventricular zones in E12. 5 Mouse developing cortex stained with anti-EGFP, anti-G3BP1, anti-SOX1 and anti-MAP2 antibodies and DAPI.

A few questions/suggestions:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive review and comments on our manuscript. We have addressed many of the questions and suggestions as pointed out below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Profiling the &quot;in-between&quot; population would be a very interesting and important characterization with regards to the model of mTOR regulation and the progenitor/neuron transition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. We have added more analysis on the double positive population (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) (Page 7 line 7-17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The normalization is important, but did it impact the results? Can you validate protein levels in the cases where RNA and protein are dysregulated (ie RNA higher but protein lower and vis versa), specifically by looking more expansively at protein levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that normalizations can have an impact on results and their interpretation. Therefore, we show in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 5 the absolute TPM and intensity values of the RNAseq and mass spectrometry results, respectively. Furthermore, we independently validated RNA and protein levels by RNA FISH and IHC for the genes RPL5 and RPL11. We agree that additional stainings would be necessary before designing any follow-up studies that would aim to study the discrepancy between RNA and protein levels for specific genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Subtypes are critical to cortical development. This approach clearly highlights progenitor/neuronal differences but could the observations be extended to one or two subtypes? Specifically, oRGs come to mind as a population that is uniquely subject to mTOR activation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has rightly pointed out that our current strategy highlights progenitor/neuron differences. To focus on subtypes of progenitors and neurons, one would need to opt for single cell analysis or sort specific subpopulations and then perform RNA-protein multiomics. This is currently challenging and would be an important step in the future. Nevertheless, using our temporal data, we can already observe some differences in early stages devoid of outer radial glia and later stages featuring outer radial glia. For instance, 5’TOP transcript-protein discrepancy observed in our data is prominent at early stage and reduces overtime. This is probably linked to the emergence of oRGs with higher mTOR activity and thus not featuring the same regulation as at early stages. This is also reflected in the reduced RNA-stability of 5’TOP transcripts in late-stage progenitors. We have elaborated on this point in the discussion (Page 23 line 28 to Page 24 line 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The TSC experiments are nice, but also are specific to that pathway and manner of regulation of mTOR signaling. It is possible that mTOR broadly has more complex or nuanced impacts upon 5'-TOP regulation. Thus, I would suggest pharmacologically overactivating and repressing it to explore similar impacts, or limiting the degree to which mTOR is described to overall control the regulation of these transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment and suggestion. Indeed, the mTOR pathway has a complex regulation. Here we used TSC2 KO only as a tool to overactivate mTOR pathway (page 19 line 18-21). However, the native regulation of the mTOR pathway in the tissue remains elusive. The link between mTOR and 5’TOP regulation was based on the previous literature in other cellular systems. Future investigations would shed light on the upstream regulation of mTOR and its downstream effects to gain a molecular understanding of the pathway during corticogenesis. We have mentioned this in the discussion (Page 24 line 13-14).</p><p>Two very recent studies from the Giuseppe Testa group have eluded to the role of ribosomal 5’TOP transcript regulation in the pathophysiology of 7q11.23 copy variation disorders and that the perturbation of this regulation seems to also impact the timing of neurogenesis (Mihailovich Biorxiv, 2022; DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.10.511483; Lopez-Tobon Biorxiv 2022; DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.10.511434). These conditions also show a deregulation of the mTOR pathway. Thus, the importance of posttranscriptional regulation of the ribosomal proteins in human brain development and its link with the mTOR pathway is becoming slowly clear. We have also added this information in the discussion of the revised manuscript (Page 23, line 9-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors identified a stress-related role for processes in corticogenesis, although, without comparison to human tissue, it's possible that some of the results are due to the artificial nature of the organoids as they have been reported to have elevated stress (Bhaduri et al.,). The authors should tone down the statement &quot;Our observation of SG-like RNA-granules in early ventricular radial glia further supports the occurrence of stress-associated processes during corticogenesis,&quot; in the discussion as the organoid system does not completely mimic corticogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern.

We believe that the RNA-protein multiomics resource is a major part of the study and has created a useful dataset for the community and necessitates the broad title. We hope that the new title also clarifies that have we identified the posttranscriptional regulation of ribosomal genes in context of human brain organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Page 11, Lines 5-8, and Page 11 Lines 13-15</p><p>&quot;Effective&quot; is not the right word to use here.
