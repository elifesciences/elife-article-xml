haem and provides an uptake route for trypanolytic factor-1, a mediator of innate immunity against trypanosome infection. In this study, we report the structure of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> HpHbR in complex with human haptoglobin-haemoglobin (HpHb), revealing an elongated ligand-binding site that extends along its membrane distal half. This contacts haptoglobin and the β-subunit of haemoglobin, showing how the receptor selectively binds HpHb over individual components. Lateral mobility of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HpHbR, and a ∼50<sup>o</sup> kink in the receptor, allows two receptors to simultaneously bind one HpHb dimer. Indeed, trypanosomes take up dimeric HpHb at significantly lower concentrations than monomeric HpHb, due to increased ligand avidity that comes from bivalent binding. The structure therefore reveals the molecular basis for ligand and innate immunity factor uptake by trypanosomes and identifies adaptations that allow efficient ligand uptake in the context of the complex trypanosome cell surface.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05553.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05553.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05553.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>African Trypanosomes are a group of single-celled parasites that are a major concern for livestock farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. They are carried by the tsetse fly and can cause disease in domestic livestock that diminishes productivity through reduced growth, and may ultimately lead to death. The parasites are coated in a dense layer of protein that help them evade the host’s immune system by preventing immune cells from identifying them.</p><p>Humans have evolved immunity to many trypanosome species by exploiting a weakness in their lifestyle. Trypanosomes need to get haem—a molecule found in the protein haemoglobin—from their host to survive. In blood plasma, haemoglobin is found associated with a carrier protein called haptoglobin. To acquire haem, the parasites have a protein called HpHbR that binds to these haptoglobin-haemoglobin ‘complexes’. However, in humans there are two complexes of proteins called TLFs that contain haemoglobin and a protein related to haptoglobin. The TLFs are also able to bind to HpHbR and are taken into the parasite. Once inside, TLFs cause internal compartments called lysosomes to swell, which leads to the death of the trypanosome.</p><p>Two subspecies of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> are the only trypanosomes that infect humans as they can overcome the TLF1 defense. However, the details of how TLFs cause cell death at the molecular level are not clear.</p><p>Lane-Serff et al. used a technique called x-ray crystallography to generate 3-D images of the HpHbR protein from <italic>T. brucei</italic> bound to the haptoglobin-haemoglobin complexes. These images show that HpHbR is elongated so that it only binds to haemoglobin and haptoglobin when they are together as a complex.</p><p>The images also reveal that the shape of HpHbR enables it to hold apart the proteins in the protective layer that coats the trypanosome. This allows the haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex to bind to HpHbR, but in humans also makes HpHbR more likely to bind to TLF1. These findings may help to guide future efforts to protect humans and livestock from the diseases caused by trypanosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05553.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05553.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>trypanosome</kwd><kwd>haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>trypanolytic factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L008246/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGregor</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Edward D</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101020/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lane-Serff</surname><given-names>Harriet</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the trypanosome haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor bound to its ligand reveals the molecular basis for ligand recognition in innate immunity and identifies molecular determinants that aid efficient uptake.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>African Animal Trypanosomiasis is one of the major constraints on the productivity of pastoralists in sub-Saharan Africa and can be caused by infection by a range of trypanosome species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shaw, 2004</xref>), while infections of humans are caused by only two subspecies of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laveran, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pays and Vanhollebeke, 2009</xref>). The disease is persistent as the host immune system is usually unable to clear the infection. This is due to the trypanosome having evolved a population survival strategy based on autoregulation of parasitaemia and antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacGregor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horn, 2014</xref>). The trypanosomes also internalize and degrade surface bound immunoglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>), increasing the survival of an individual cell and thereby increasing the likelihood of transmission. Both of these strategies require a densely packed cell surface coat of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) that acts as a barrier, preventing access of host immunoglobulins to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwede and Carrington, 2010</xref>). This coat also undergoes antigenic variation through expression of a single VSG gene from a genomic repertoire of hundreds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horn, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the VSG coat restricts immunoglobulin access, it must be permissive for receptor-mediated binding and uptake of macromolecular ligands. <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and the closely related <italic>T. congolense</italic>, have receptors for both transferrin (TfR) for iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steverding et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schell et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>) and haptoglobin-haemoglobin (HpHbR) for haem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). These are held on the external face of the plasma membrane by covalent attachment of the C-terminal carboxyl group to a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol to form a GPI-anchor. All have free movement in the lateral plane of the membrane, although the receptors are concentrated in the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the plasma membrane at the base of the flagellum and the site of all endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mussmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Humans, together with a few other primates, display innate immunity to most trypanosome species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laveran, 1902</xref>) through the action of trypanolytic factors-1 and -2 (TLF1 and TLF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raper et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">1999</xref>). Although containing different scaffold components, these factors both include apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) together with complexes of haemoglobin bound to haptoglobin-related protein (HprHb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vanhamme et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pérez-Morga et al., 2005</xref>). TLF1 enters trypanosomes via receptor-mediated endocytosis, through binding of the HprHb component to HpHbR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Widener et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). This delivers ApoL1 to the endosome where it causes lysosomal swelling and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pérez-Morga et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the uptake route for TLF2 is unclear as, unlike TLF1, it is able to kill HpHbR null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capewell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uzureau et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Just two subspecies of <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic>) have evolved counter measures to the trypanolytic factors, allowing them to cause Human African Trypanosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pays et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of human-infective group 1 <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic>, a unique point polymorphism is found in HpHbR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Symula et al., 2012</xref>) that reduces the monovalent affinity for ligand by 20-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). This contributes to resistance to TLF1, illustrating the importance of HpHbR.</p><p>Haptoglobin-haemoglobin is an elongated ‘dumbell-shaped’ complex consisting of a dimer of haptoglobin molecules, each joined to an αβ haemoglobin dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). Trypanosomes take up this HpHb complex but not the individual components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). The structure of the <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR is an elongated three-helical bundle with a small membrane distal head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). Residues involved in HpHb binding are part of a small conserved patch ∼25 Å below the tip of the receptor, but details of ligand binding and uptake were not characterized.</p><p>Here, we present the structure of <italic>T. brucei</italic> HpHbR. We show that the receptor adopts a similar architecture to its <italic>T. congolense</italic> homologue, but with a ∼50° kink a third of the way along from the membrane proximal end. We also present the structure of TbHpHbR in complex with HpHb, revealing the molecular basis for ligand binding and selectivity. Finally, we show that the kink allows two independent membrane attached receptors to interact with a single dimeric HpHb molecule and confirm using cell uptake experiments that this causes dimeric ligand to be taken up with greater efficiency than monomeric ligand. This reveals the molecular basis for the uptake of HpHb and trypanolytic factor-1 and identifies adaptations in the trypanosome receptor that allow efficient ligand uptake in the context of the tightly packed VSG coat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TbHpHbR binds to the HpSP domain:Hb head structure</title><p>To provide detailed molecular knowledge of the mechanism of uptake of haptoglobin-haemoglobin and trypanolytic factor-1 (TLF1), we aimed to determine the structure of <italic>T. brucei</italic> HpHbR (TbHpHbR) alone and bound to a human haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex.</p><p>TbHpHbR is longer than its homologue from <italic>T. congolense</italic> due to the presence of an additional C-terminal membrane-proximal domain. We therefore used the previously determined structure of <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>) to design a construct containing the corresponding region of TbHpHbR (residues 36–299). This region of the protein is identical in the human infective <italic>T. b. rhodesiense</italic>.</p><p>Haptoglobin-haemoglobin consists of a dimer of haptoglobin chains, each interacting with an αβ dimer of haemoglobin, and adopts a dimeric ‘dumbell-shaped’ architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). At each end, a serine protease (HpSP) domain of haptoglobin forms a stable complex with a haemoglobin dimer. Dimerisation occurs through an interface formed by the CCP domains of haptoglobin, linking together these HpSPHb ‘heads’.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that TbHpHbR interacts with the HpHb complex but not with either haptoglobin or haemoglobin alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that that the receptor most likely binds to the heads of HpHb, where its two constituent components come together. We therefore designed a human haptoglobin construct containing just the SP domain (residues 148–406). This was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and was combined with haemoglobin extracted from human blood to assemble HpSPHb complexes. We used surface plasmon resonance to determine the affinity of these HpSPHb complexes for TbHpHbR, and showed binding with an affinity of 0.7 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), similar to the 1 μM affinity observed for intact human HpHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Proteolytic cleavage of haptoglobin normally occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum after residue R102 but this cleavage event did not occur in the insect cell expressed HpSP domain. However, this did not affect the affinity for TbHpHbR. The shortened TbHpHbR construct and the HpSPHb complex therefore interact together with the same affinity as the full-length components, providing reagents for structural determination. These findings also confirm that TbHpHbR binds to the ‘head’ structure of dimeric HpHb, raising the possibility of two receptors simultaneously interacting with one HpHb complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Determination of the structure of TbHpHbR alone and in complex with HpSPHb</title><p>To investigate the molecular basis for HpHb binding by TbHpHbR, crystallisation plates were set up for HpSPHb, TbHpHbR and a complex containing TbHpHbR bound to HpSPHb.

Both structures were then completed using iterative cycles of model building and refinement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05553.004</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>X-ray refinement statistics</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05553.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05553.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Complex</th><th align="center">HpSPHb</th><th align="center">Tbb HpHbR</th><th align="center">TbbHpHbR:HpSPHb</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Resolution (Å)</td><td align="center">2.05</td><td align="center">1.85</td><td align="center">3.1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">No. reflections</td><td align="center">43,170</td><td align="center">44,685</td><td align="center">17,302</td></tr><tr><td align="center">R<sub>work</sub> / R<sub>free</sub> (%)</td><td align="center">18.0 / 22.4</td><td align="center">19.84 / 23.95</td><td align="center">19.5 / 21.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">No. of protein residues in model</td><td align="center">544</td><td align="center">523</td><td align="center">782</td></tr><tr><td align="center">rmsd bond lengths (Å)</td><td align="center">0.020</td><td align="center">0.017</td><td align="center">0.012</td></tr><tr><td align="center">rmsd bond angles (°)</td><td align="center">2.0</td><td align="center">1.6</td><td align="center">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Ramachandran plot</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="center">Allowed region</td><td align="center">89.0%</td><td align="center">98.8%</td><td align="center">92.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Additional allowed region</td><td align="center">11%</td><td align="center">1.2%</td><td align="center">7.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Generously allowed region</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Disallowed region</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">0%</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The structure of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor</title><p>Like <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR, the <italic>T. brucei</italic> receptor is elongated, consisting primarily of a three-helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): helix I (red; residues 42–110), helix II (orange; residues 116–182), and helix V (dark blue; residues 224–296) with a total length of 118 Å.

Each of the three helices is affected, with the backbone carbonyl groups of Asp88, Ala89, Glu123, Asn124, Asp270 and Ala271 no longer forming hydrogen bonds. This kink is not caused by flexibility, but is a rigid feature of the receptor, as it adopts the same confirmation in crystals of receptor alone, and in crystals of its complex with HpSPHb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and is also observed in molecular envelopes derived from small angle x-ray scattering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Instead it is caused by changes in the pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues around the kink site in each of the three helices. The three long helices of the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor are characterised by an alternating pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, leading to continuous hydrophobic strips along the length of each helix that pack in the core of the helical bundle, stabilising its fold. In the <italic>T. brucei</italic> receptor, this pattern is disturbed at each kink site, breaking the organisation of the helix and leading to an alteration in the surface that displays the hydrophobic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Indeed, this arrangement was confirmed in solution by small angle x-ray scattering. Native (dimeric) human HpHb was mixed with TbHpHbR, and gel filtration was performed, with SAXS data collected from samples as they emerged from the column.

HpHb (dimeric), HpSPHb (monomeric) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, as a control to assess fluid phase uptake), were each fluorescently labelled. In addition, we prepared a null cell line, TbHpHbR<sup>−/−</sup>, in which both copies of the receptor were disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These reagents allowed us to investigate the concentration dependence of ligand uptake. In wild-type <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells, uptake of HpHb reached saturation below a concentration of 4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, the uptake of HpSPHb was negligible at a concentration of 4 nM and continued to increase at 62.5 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Uptake of HpSPHb and HpHb observed in wild-type cells was due to the TbHpHbR, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>), as uptake of both ligands into TbHpHbR<sup>−/−</sup> cells was comparable to that of BSA in the range of ligand concentrations assayed (0–62.5 nM).</p><p>Therefore, uptake of dimeric HpHb into trypanosomes occurs efficiently at a significantly lower concentration than that of monomeric HpSPHb. As the monovalent affinities of the receptor for HpHb and HpSPHb are indistinguishable, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, this suggests that more efficient uptake of HpHb is caused by the dimeric ligand simultaneously binding to two receptors. Indeed, measurements of the binding of HpHb to immobilised receptor, using a very high surface density of HpHbR to measure bivalent binding, gave an affinity of 4.5 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>), which is in the same range as the concentration at which HpHb uptake becomes saturated in live parasites. Therefore, it appears as though TbHpHbR has evolved a kink to increase accessibility of its ligand-binding site and to allow simultaneous binding of two receptors to one HpHb ligand, increasing ligand avidity and uptake efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The external surface of an African trypanosome is covered with a tightly packed layer of variant surface glycoprotein that shields epitopes that lie close to the plasma membrane from antibody binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwede et al., 2011</xref>). Receptors such as those required for the uptake of transferrin and haptoglobin-haemoglobin complexes must operate within the context of this coat, with their structures organised such that ligand binding sites are not masked by the VSG layer.</p><p>Here, the first structure of a trypanosome receptor in complex with its ligand is presented: that of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor bound to haptoglobin-haemoglobin. Remarkably, the ligand-binding site extends more that half the way along the receptor, forming distinct binding surfaces for the β-subunit of haemoglobin and for haptoglobin. The simultaneous binding of both components explains the specificity of the receptor for haptoglobin-haemoglobin complexes over each individual component. However, the extent of the binding surface places it below the top of the VSG layer, apparently increasing the likelihood that it will be masked by VSG.</p><p>However, a ∼50° rigid kink occurs as an adaptation in the three helical bundle of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> receptor, and we propose that it has two main functional consequences. Firstly, the direction of the kink is precisely arranged to bend the receptor such that the ligand-binding site becomes more exposed at the membrane surface. The kink will also increase the effective diameter of the receptor in the plane of the membrane. This combination is likely to increase the separation of VSG molecules in the region of the receptor and to increase the accessibility of the binding site for bulky macromolecular ligands such as HpHb and trypanolytic factors. Increased separation of VSG molecules by a trypanosome receptor is not a novel phenomena, with bulky glycan chains attached to the transferrin receptor proposed to have a similar effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mehlert et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that different receptors increase the accessibility of binding sites for bulky ligands by different means.</p><p>The precise nature of the integration of TbHpHbR into the VSG layer remains unresolved as the effect of the C-terminal domains of both the receptor and VSG on the vertical disposition of each molecule remains unknown. An attractive model is that the ligand, whether HpHb or TLF1, is bound above the top of the VSG. However, the dimensions of the structures of VSG and the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex suggest that this may not be the case and that the HpHb ligand is held at least partially within the VSG layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The TLF1 ligand is ∼4 times the size of HpHb and this must, at least partially, protrude above the top of the VSG layer. <fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05553.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A comparison of the dimensions of the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex with those of the N-terminal domains of the variant surface glycoproteins (shown in grey).</title><p>This suggests that HpHb will lie at least partially within the VSG layer when bound to two receptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05553.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05553.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05553-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>A second consequence of the kink is to allow two receptors to simultaneously bind to one dimeric HpHb complex when their membrane-proximal C-termini are membrane-attached. The affinity of a single receptor for HpHb is modest, at ∼1 μM, with a rapid off-rate. By enabling two receptors to bind simultaneously, the kink will increase the ligand avidity, changing the effective affinity to something in the low nanomolar range, as previously measured for bivalent binding by TbHpHbR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>) and to live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drain et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>What is the likelihood of two receptors interacting with a single ligand on the cell surface? The receptor copy number is 200–400 and it is concentrated in the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). The surface area of the flagellar pocket in live cells is 4.3 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grünfelder et al., 2002</xref>). If there are 200 receptor molecules in the membrane of the flagellar pocket then the density is one receptor per 0.022 µm<sup>2</sup>. The diffusion constant for HpHbR is unknown, but the diffusion constant for another GPI-anchored protein, VSG, has been measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to be 0.01 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulow et al., 1988</xref>); this means that the receptor will contact a receptor molecule approximately every 2 s. The t<sub>1/2</sub> for release of monovalently bound HpHb is 70–100 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), so if it is assumed that the receptor has a similar diffusion coefficient to the VSG, then it is very likely that a monovalently bound ligand will become bivalently bound. Indeed our analysis of uptake of dimeric HpHb and monomeric HpSPHb into <italic>T. brucei</italic> confirmed that this increased avidity does occur in vivo, with HpHb uptake saturating at a concentration below 4 nM, while HpSPHb uptake is far from saturation at 62.5 nM.</p><p>Whether other trypanosome receptors use a similar avidity-increase mechanism to improve the efficiency of ligand uptake remains to be seen, and whether it is required will depend upon the receptor affinity for monomer and the sera concentration of the nutrient. However, it is clear from the example of TbHpHbR that this mode of ligand binding is potentially applicable to other GPI-anchored cell surface proteins.</p><p>While the evolution of the kink allows increased accessibility of the binding site for HpHb, it would also increase accessibility for the large TLF1 complex. One mechanism used by human infective <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> to avoid TLF1-mediated innate immunity is a point polymorphism in HpHbR that reduces the monovalent affinity for HpHb by 20-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>) and reduces TLF1 uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kieft et al., 2010</xref>). It remains to be seen whether TLF1 contains one or multiple HprHb complexes, and whether these are in a suitable arrangement to allow bivalent binding. However, even if bivalent binding does occur in TLF1, the difference in affinity due to the <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> polymorphism will be amplified under conditions where two receptors bind to a single ligand.</p><p>As the kink in the receptor appears to have a number of functional consequences that facilitate ligand uptake, it is surprising that the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor lacks such a kink. One reason for this difference might be the lack of a C-terminal domain in <italic>T. congolense</italic> surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). Perhaps the direct attachment of the ligand-binding domain to a GPI-anchor provides enough flexibility to allow the receptors to adopt an angle that allows simultaneous uptake, or perhaps the VSG coat of <italic>T. congolense</italic> parasites is less densely packed. These questions will need further study.</p><p>In conclusion, we present the first structure of a trypanosome receptor in complex with its ligand and reveal a number of adaptations that are tailored to facilitate efficient ligand binding in the context of the VSG coat. These will decrease the packing of VSG molecules in the immediate vicinity of the receptor and increase accessibility of the ligand-binding site. They also allow two receptors to bind to a single ligand, thereby increasing avidity and dramatically decreasing the ligand concentration at which efficient uptake occurs. While different adaptations might facilitate each of these goals in different receptors, we would expect them to be general principles, frequently used by the parasite to aid nutrient uptake and survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>T. brucei</italic> HpHbR cloning, expression and purification</title><p>Full-length <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> HpHbR, without the N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal GPI-anchor addition sequence, had been previously cloned for expression in a modified pET-15b to generate a polypeptide with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a cleavage site for TEV protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>).

A CM5 chip was prepared by flowing over a 1:1 mixture of ethyl-dimethylaminopropyl-carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. TbHpHbR was diluted into 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5 to a final concentration of 0.1 μM.</p><p>Ligands were diluted into HBS (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% vol/vol Tween 20). Both channels were equilibrated with HBS before injection of binding partner, and the level of specific binding obtained from a subtraction of the response from channel 2 from that of channel 1. Values for K<sub>D</sub> were obtained by equilibrium binding analysis using the BIAevaluation software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Size exclusion chromatography-multiangle laser light scattering</title><p>Purified samples were loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare), then analysed using laser light scattering detected at 662 nm wavelength at 8 scattering angles between 20.6° and 149.1° using a Heleos 8 instrument (Wyatt Technology, Germany). ASTRA 6.1 (Wyatt Technology) was used to calculate molecular weights using the Zimm equation. The samples were loaded at concentrations of 10 μM for HpHb and 40 μM for TbHpHbR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Trypanosome cell culture and construction of <italic>T. brucei</italic> HpHbR<sup>−/−</sup> cell line</title><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> blood stream form cells were grown in HMI-9 at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989</xref>). The linear DNAs used to replace HpHbR genes by homologous recombination were produced by PCR. First, one allele was replaced in procyclic form Lister 427 cells using a PCR product that contained 80 bp from upstream of the HpHbR gene, followed by the blasticin resistance cassette, followed by 80 bp from downstream of the HpHbR gene. The same approach was used with a G418 resistance cassette. Genomic DNA was prepared from blasticin or G418 resistant cell lines and used as a template for a PCR using oligonucleotides 500 bp upstream and downstream of the HpHbR gene. These second PCR products were used to serially transfect Lister 427 bloodstream form cells expressing VSG118.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Uptake assays for monitoring uptake of fluorescently labelled ligands into live cells</title><p>When used for uptake experiments, Hp, HpSP and BSA were labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 using the protein labelling kit (Life Technologies). The manufacturer's protocol was adapted, extending the reaction time to overnight at 4 °C to increase labelling efficiency. Hp and HpSP were then subsequently mixed with Hb to form complex as above. For each assay, 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> wild type Lister 427 or <italic>HpHbR</italic> <sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells were resuspended in 100 µl of serum free HMI-9 with 1% BSA and incubated with 2 µM protease inhibitor FMK-024 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with 1–62.5 nM fluorescently labelled protein for 2 hr at 37 °C before being washed twice in serum free HMI-9 with 1% BSA. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and resupended in PBS. Uptake was assayed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) and quantified on FlowJo software. Mode increase in fluorescence was measured relative to a no ligand negative control, and all assays were carried out in triplicate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Medical Research Council Project Grant MR/L008246.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Volker Dötsch (Reviewing editor) and Michael Ferguson (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the structural investigation of the haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor (HpHbR) of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> in complex with human haptoglobin-haemoglobin(HpHb) by x-ray crystallography as well as SAXS measurements. This is an important interaction in trypanosome molecular biology, as it allows the parasite to acquire haem, and it is relevant to the innate immune response humans have to many species of trypanosome parasites. While the structures of the individual components were largely known previously, the details of their complex were hitherto unknown and are revealed for the first time here. The biological experiments, demonstrating the different efficiencies of receptor-mediated uptake of monomeric and dimeric HpHb ligands are an important component of the paper that nicely supports the structure-based hypotheses on increased ligand avidity made possible by a 'two receptors bind one ligand dimer' model.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers consider this a very nice paper showing important results. The reviewers have not found any major concerns but have pointed out some minor issues and questions that are summarized below.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>1) I would suggest that the authors consider presenting a final figure of how they think a receptor pair/ligand dimer would 'sit' in a sea of VSG molecules (top and side view).

When TbHpHbR adopts a tilted conformation on binding to HpHb it is approximately the same height as a VSG molecule, making it likely that the HpHb will lie, at least partially, within the VSG layer. We have now included a figure to show this similarity, but do not feel comfortable to go further in proposing a detailed model.</p><p><italic>2) While I like the receptor pair/ligand dimer model (particularly since it is supported by uptake data) it leaves one quandary not discussed in the paper: how do two HpHbR molecules find each other to bind the ligand dimer with high-avidity?

Is the model of transient single receptor-ligand dimer interactions that are occasionally 'locked down' when another receptor arrives by chance? Some discussion I think is called for (but not additional experiments)</italic>.</p><p>The point made about the likelihood of two receptors colliding with a single HpHb is an interesting one. Assuming that the receptors are predominantly localised at the flagellar pocket, and using the known receptor copy number and VSG diffusion rates, we have calculated that each receptor should contact another receptor approximately once each second. As the t<sub>1/2</sub> for the dissociation of HpHb from a single receptor is in the region of 70-100 s, there is a strong likelihood that an HpHb attached to a single receptor will interact with a second receptor before it dissociates, leading to higher avidity bivalent binding. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to make this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p><italic>I am not an expert on small angle X-ray scattering, but it seems to me that the envelope is a tight fit for the model in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>and a generous fit in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>.

We have made two changes to the manuscript to present data that strengthens this conclusion. Firstly, we now include SAXS data for HpHb alone, allowing comparison with that for the HpHbR:receptor complex. The envelopes derived from these data, together with the accompanying molecular weights, support the binding of two receptors to each HpHb. In addition, we have included SEC-MALLS data, which also shows the formation of a complex containing two receptors bound to a single HpHb. These biophysical data support the conclusions derived from crystallography and explain the in vivo effects observed in HpHb uptake experiments.</p><p><italic>Many of the structure Figures (and especially</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) would benefit from stereo views</italic>.</p><p>We have added a new figure supplement for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to show a stereoview of the TbHpHbR:HpSPHb complex.</p><p><italic>The paragraph “TLF1enters trypanosomes via receptor mediated endocytosis…”, in the Introduction section, is confusing and does not clearly explain what TLF1 and TLF2 are.

This is, in part, due to the use of additional restraints from the higher resolution structures of the receptor and the HpSPHb complex during refinement. As neither structure showed any conformational change upon complex formation, these additional restraints were used to improve the stereochemistry of the refined model. We were careful, by comparison of the final maps with those obtained without use of these restraints, to show that their use did not lead to major changes in the model. We have increased our explanation of our refinement procedure in the Materials and methods to clarify this.</p><p>In addition, we have deposited the pdb codes and diffraction data to the protein data bank with codes 4X0I, 4X0J and 4X0L.</p></body></sub-article></article>
