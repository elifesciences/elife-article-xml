arrive at target sites either via random search or following signals by other leukocytes. Here, we reveal independent emergent behaviour in CTL populations attacking tumour masses. Primary murine CTLs coordinate their migration in a process reminiscent of the swarming observed in neutrophils. CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling, in part mediated via the diffusion of chemokines CCL3 and CCL4. Newly arriving CTLs augment the chemotactic signal, further accelerating mass recruitment in a positive feedback loop. Activated effector human T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells similarly employ intra-population signalling to drive rapid convergence. Thus, CTLs recognising a cognate target can induce a localised mass response by amplifying the direct recruitment of additional T cells independently of other leukocytes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Immune cells known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs for short, move around the body searching for infected or damaged cells that may cause harm. Once these specialised killer cells identify a target, they launch an attack, removing the harmful cell from the body. CTLs can also recognise and eliminate cancer cells, and can be infused into cancer patients as a form of treatment called adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy. Unfortunately, this kind of treatment does not yet work well on solid tumours because the immune cells often do not infiltrate them sufficiently.</p><p>It is thought that CTLs arrive at their targets either by randomly searching or by following chemicals secreted by other immune cells. However, the methods used to map the movement of these killer cells have made it difficult to determine how populations of CTLs coordinate their behaviour independently of other cells in the immune system. To overcome this barrier, Galeano Niño, Pageon, Tay et al. employed a three-dimensional model known as a tumouroid embedded in a matrix of proteins, which mimics the tissue environment of a real tumour in the laboratory. These models were used to track the movement of CTLs extracted from mice and humans, as well as human T cells engineered to recognise cancer cells.</p><p>The experiments showed that when a CTL identifies a tumour cell, it releases chemical signals known as chemokines, which attract other CTLs and recruit them to the target site. Further experiments and computer simulations revealed that as the number of CTLs arriving at the target site increases, this amplifies the chemokine signal being secreted, resulting in more and more CTLs being attracted to the tumour. Other human T cells that had been engineered to recognize cancer cells were also found to employ this method of mass recruitment, and collectively ‘swarm’ towards targeted tumours.</p><p>These findings shed new light on how CTLs work together to attack a target. It is possible that exploiting the mechanism used by CTLs could help improve the efficiency of tumour-targeting immunotherapies. However, further studies are needed to determine whether these findings can be applied to solid tumours in cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>swarming</kwd><kwd>emergent behaviour</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>NSERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN 50503-10477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1135687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nisbet</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001774</institution-id><institution>University of Sydney</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centre for Advanced Food Enginomics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Read</surname><given-names>Mark N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBL Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biro</surname><given-names>Maté</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>NSERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>50503-10476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Killer T cells swarm around tumour targets by accelerating the recruitment of distant T cells, which upon arrival and target engagement augment the chemotactic signal in a positive feedback loop.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitutively migrate as single cells in search of infected or malignant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weninger et al., 2014</xref>). CTLs are key effectors of adoptive cell transfer immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guedan et al., 2019</xref>), but their efficacy remains limited with solid tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Woude et al., 2017</xref>), which they infiltrate in insufficient numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galon et al., 2006</xref>). Thus far, CTLs have been thought to arrive at target sites either via random search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>) or following signals by other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harlin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Intravital imaging studies have been instrumental in uncovering some of the complex migration patterns of CTLs at various stages of an immune response. They have revealed, for instance, that CTLs employ highly evolved cell-intrinsic search strategies that are more efficient than Brownian motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). During priming in lymph nodes, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can follow local chemoattractant gradients to migrate directionally towards sites of antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castellino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hickman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hugues et al., 2007</xref>). In the tumour microenvironment (TME), the movements of CTLs and their interplay with various cells have been unveiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boissonnas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deguine et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies indicate that lymphocytes can recruit each other indirectly into tumours; natural killer (NK) lymphocytes produce chemokines that attract dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böttcher et al., 2018</xref>), which in turn can recruit CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spranger et al., 2017</xref>). Although intravital microscopy enables imaging of cellular interactions in the TME in situ, it is typically restricted to relatively short imaging periods and sub-millimetre fields of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gabriel et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the inherent complexities of the TME, its constituent cell populations and its biochemical landscape have limited our ability to uncover the contribution of an individual immune subset or signalling mechanism to progressive, large-scale phenomena.</p><p>Here, we developed a 3D tumouroid model and in silico simulations to reveal independent collective behaviour in CTL populations attacking tumour masses. We show that CTLs coordinate their migration in a process reminiscent of the swarming observed in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avitabile et al., 1975</xref>) and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>). CTLs engaging tumour targets induce rapid chemotaxis in distant T cells through homotypic chemokine signalling. Newly arriving CTLs augment the chemotactic signal, further accelerating mass recruitment in a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, we show that local chemokine delivery triggers directed CTL movement through dense tumour tissue in vivo, and sustained secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 from tumours promotes CTL recruitment. Human effector and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells similarly employ intra-population signalling to drive rapid convergence. Our findings provide insights into how CTL populations amplify directed recruitment to an effector site independently of other leukocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CTLs swarm towards cognate tumouroids</title><p>We sought to investigate the population-wide movements and signals mediating interactions between CTLs during tumour clearance. To this end, we developed an ex vivo model enabling us to study the large-scale movements of primary CTLs around solid tumouroids embedded in three-dimensional (3D) collagen matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used primary murine CTLs isolated from OT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hogquist et al., 1994</xref>) and gBT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coles et al., 2003</xref>) T cell receptor transgenic mice that recognise ovalbumin (SIINFEKL) or herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B (SSIEFARL) residues, respectively, both in the context of the H-2K<sup>b</sup> class I major histocompatibility complex. CTLs engaging a cognate tumouroid were rapidly recruited to its edge, where they accumulated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The marked accumulation of CTLs at the edge of the tumouroid is reminiscent of swarming, the coordinated collective convergence of large numbers of self-propelled individuals, which has been observed in as varied biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okubo, 1986</xref>) as mammals, birds, fish, insects, and, at the cellular level, neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>).

Indeed, cell-free supernatant from the co-incubation of CTLs with cognate tumour cells (cognate supernatant) attracts other CTLs in a transmigration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and thus contains the soluble chemoattractants mediating the recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Interestingly, 10-fold dilutions of cognate supernatants also induced CTL transmigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that the CTL response to the soluble chemotactic factors is highly sensitive.</p><p>To distinguish whether the factors originate from CTLs or lysed tumour cells, we replaced tumour cells with polystyrene beads coated with cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and found that recruitment of CTLs was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). CTLs engaging cognate targets therefore produce factors that induce distal recruitment via homotypic signalling. Combined, our experimental and simulation data reveal emergence in CTL mass recruitment, which is progressively amplified by the arrival of further CTLs that contribute to a diffusive homotypic signal.</p><p>We next tested whether the homotypic signal extends to T cells of different antigen specificities. Tumouroids containing monospecific CTLs and their cognate tumour targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) are equally proficient at recruiting T cells of the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and polyclonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) specificity. No recruitment is observed towards tumouroids containing CTLs engaging non-cognate target cells. Therefore, whilst production of the homotypic signal requires recognition of specific cognate antigen, the signal recruits CTLs irrespective of the T cell receptor (TCR) they express. CTLs of unrelated specificity would however not be able to contribute to the amplification of the signal upon arrival at the tumour mass.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Long-range diffusing gradients emanate from CTLs engaging cognate tumouroids</title><p>Next, we studied the movements of CTLs up to 1.6 mm from tumouroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the onset of the experiment (0 hr), CTLs were distributed uniformly adjacent to both cognate and non-cognate tumouroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). After 2 hr, the distribution of CTLs was biased towards the cognate tumouroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), whereas the CTL distribution adjacent to a control tumouroid remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Cell tracking analysis revealed that even the most distant CTLs show directional movement towards the cognate tumouroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>) and reveals a moving wave of chemoattraction over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Cells close to the tumouroid start moving towards it at early timepoints but lose some of their directionality over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). It has previously been shown that chemotactic responses can be lost under excess local concentrations of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 2018</xref>), which could account for the behaviour observed here.

PTX inhibits the enhanced average speed and directional migration of CTLs towards cognate tumouroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that GPCR ligands mediate the chemoattractive signal. This result is consistent with previous work where the formation of small CTL clusters around malaria-infected hepatocytes required GPCR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cockburn et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike neutrophils that employ lipid signalling via leukotriene B4 to swarm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>), this result suggests that chemokines, which are sensed by GPCRs, underpin homotypic signalling in CTLs. We then compared the transcriptomes of CTLs engaging cognate and non-cognate targets (dataset available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Differentially expressed genes were filtered for secreted factors, among which the following GPCR ligands were identified: Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 1 (CCL1), CCL3, CCL4, CCL9, and X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (XCL1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>); their upregulation was further validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of cognate versus non-cognate secretomes reveals that CCL1, CCL3, CCL4, and XCL1 are more abundant in cognate supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), confirmed by quantitative detection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The recombinant chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL12 could attract CTLs in transwell migration assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), in each case effectively inhibited by the corresponding neutralising antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, only CCL3 inhibition consistently disrupted CTL transmigration in transwell chambers towards cognate supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Directional migration towards a cognate tumouroid in more physiological 3D matrices was abolished only when both CCL3 and CCL4 were blocked using neutralising antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that these two chemokines act redundantly in the homotypic attraction. Therefore, CCL3 and CCL4 constitute the diffusive homotypic signal that attracts distant CTLs during target engagement. Secreted CCL3 forms a gradient from the site of antigen-specific target engagement, visualised by in situ capture and staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

To this end, we engineered CAR T cells targeting Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) that is abundantly overexpressed in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). A truncated CD19 domain co-transferred with the CAR construct allows enrichment of genetically-modified CAR-expressing human primary T cells by magnetic sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Human CD19<sup>+</sup> EphA2-specific CAR T cells efficiently killed glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When EphA2-specific CAR T cells were embedded in a tumouroid with glioblastoma cells, surrounding CAR T cells swarmed towards the tumouroid, whereas no recruitment was observed when CAR T cells were co-embedded with EphA2-negative fibroblasts in the tumouroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>).

At the immune cell level, swarming has been described for neutrophils, during parasite infection in the lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chtanova et al., 2008</xref>) and in response to tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>). Here, our data reveal that CTLs engaging targets employ homotypic signalling via secretion of the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 to accelerate the direct recruitment of distant T cells. As additional antigen-specific CTLs are recruited and engage cognate targets, they contribute to the chemoattractive signal, thus further amplifying CTL recruitment in a positive feedback loop, which leads to swarming behaviour. Interestingly, it appears as though CTLs closest to the source of the chemotactic signal become desensitised over time and lose directional bias, which could be due to exposure to excess ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 2018</xref>) or rapid internalisation of the CCR5 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Escola et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pioneering work had uncovered that in lymph nodes, naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells follow CCR5 ligands, including CCL3 and CCL4, to migrate towards dendritic cells interacting with CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castellino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hickman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hugues et al., 2007</xref>), to optimise the efficiency of T cell priming. Maximal priming and generation of CTLs in infected or draining lymph nodes during antiviral and antitumour responses also depend on CCR5 expression on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">González-Martín et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hickman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Rather than the behaviour of naïve T cells within secondary lymphoid organs, our study focused on interactions between effector CTLs, T cells that are active in peripheral tissues following priming and emigration from lymph nodes. Our findings reveal that CTLs can independently induce mass recruitment around an antigen-specific target. Our data also reveal that lymphocytes can promote the recruitment of distant lymphocytes into peripheral tissues, thus far thought to only occur indirectly through the action of professional antigen-presenting cell (APC) intermediaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spranger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böttcher et al., 2018</xref>). Although the concept of bacterial quorum sensing has been applied to coordinated population responses by T cells, the amplification of local T cell densities was shown to occur via differentiation or proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonioli et al., 2019</xref>), relatively long-term effects compared to the rapid directional recruitment of distal CTLs discussed here.</p><p>CTLs engaging tumour targets that do not present cognate antigen induce chemokinesis in distant CTLs, which could be mediated via the induced secretion of netrins, autotaxin, or semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boneschansker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katakai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takegahara et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, only CTLs that have directly engaged a cognate antigen-presenting target secrete the homotypic recruitment signal that induces chemotaxis in distant T cells. Unconjugated CTLs exposed to cognate supernatant (containing abundant CCL3, CCL4, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor) did not themselves upregulate CCL3 or CCL4 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). This therefore excludes the possibility of a signal relay, whereby CTLs that sense the recruitment signal away from the target start secreting the homotypic signal themselves, which could presumably lead to aberrant local CTL clustering.</p><p>We thus propose that the individuals of a CTL population exist in three distinct states: a ‘searcher’ state whilst scanning for cognate antigen unaffected by the homotypic signal; a ‘responder’ state when they sense the homotypic signal and move rapidly towards the effector locus; and an ‘engager/recruiter’ state upon target cell recognition when they concurrently deliver their effector function and secrete CCL3 and CCL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The first CTLs to recognise a cognate target directly transition from search into engagement and recruitment, whereas subsequent cells arrive in a responder state. It is interesting to note that CTLs can also remain in an exclusive recruiter state for nearly 24 hr following target elimination in the absence of active engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of multistate mass recruitment of CTLs to a target site.</title><p>‘Searcher’ CTLs migrate randomly in search of target cells. When they recognise targets, they become ‘engager/recruiter’ CTLs that secrete CCL3 and CCL4. CCR5-expressing CTLs within range migrate rapidly and directionally towards the effector site in a ‘responder’ state. Newly arriving CTLs engage and convert to recruiters: they contribute to the chemoattractive signal, thus further amplifying recruitment of other ‘responder’ CTLs from distal regions, resulting in sustained accumulation of large numbers of CTLs at the target site (swarming).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56554-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>This multistate recruitment model explains prior observations of non-specific T cells only deeply infiltrating tumour tissues in the presence of tumour-reactive CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boissonnas et al., 2007</xref>). Although antigen recognition is specific, the chemoattractive signal that is raised to amplify recruitment is generic and thus able to recruit a repertoire of CTLs regardless of their TCR specificity. Indeed, there have been prior observations of bystander recruitment of effector T cells to sites of inflammation or tumours initiated by unrelated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boissonnas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Topham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickman et al., 2015</xref>). During an immune response resulting in the clonal expansion of antigen-specific CTLs, which increases their frequency up to 10<sup>4</sup>-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murali-Krishna et al., 1998</xref>), such a generic recruitment mechanism is likely efficient in their local amplification in sufficient numbers for an effective response.</p><p>Interestingly, studies that compared tumours infiltrated by leukocytes (‘hot’) to those that excluded immune cell infiltration (‘cold’) identified more abundant CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 in hot tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravarthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spranger et al., 2015</xref>), including via single-cell transcriptomics that ascribed their expression to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roider et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst we have identified CCL3 and CCL4 as the key mediators of homotypic signalling in CTLs isolated from mice, CCL5 may also have a central role in homotypic recruitment of human CTLs.</p><p>We demonstrated that CTLs exhibit chemotaxis towards CCR5 ligands within dense tumour tissue by intravital imaging, and revealed that the presence of antigen-specific CTLs within a tumour promotes the recruitment of distant CTLs into the tumour in a manner partially dependent on CCR5. The activation of intratumoural CTLs were found by others to promote the recruitment of not only CTLs, but also natural killer cells and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosato et al., 2019</xref>). Alternate chemokine signalling circuits centred on CXCR3 and BLT1 have been implicated in CTL tumour trafficking and infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chheda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikucki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, IFNγ, produced by activated CTLs and abundant in inflamed tumours, can induce CXCL9 and CXCL10 secretion in various intermediary cells, including tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dobrzanski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon-Alonso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickman et al., 2015</xref>), which may enhance the role of CXCR3 in homing.</p><p>CCR5-expressing CTLs have been associated with severe autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mackay, 2014</xref>), and CCR5 ligands are abundant in the upper respiratory tract during acute hyperinflammation associated with viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chua et al., 2020</xref>); silencing homotypic recruitment may well prove beneficial in such contexts. Ultimately, the homotypic recruitment mechanism could be exploited to enhance control over positioning and tissue infiltration of T cells in adoptive cell transfer immunotherapies, not least given our findings that engineered CAR T cells, following antigen recognition via the CAR, are able to induce homotypic recruitment of distal T cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rag-deficient B6.129S7-Rag &lt; tm1mom &gt; JAusb <break/>(RAG1)</td><td valign="top">Australian BioResources</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Used for in vivo experiments</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyJAusb <break/>(PTPRCA)</td><td valign="top">Australian BioResources</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Used for in vivo experiments</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.129p2-ccr5 tm1Kuz/J <break/>(CCR5<sup>-</sup>/<sup>-</sup>)</td><td valign="top">Australian BioResources</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">7–12 week mice used to isolate CCR5KO CTLs</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6-Tg-OTI <break/>(OT1)</td><td valign="top">Australian BioResources</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">7–12 week mice used to isolate OT1 CTLs</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6-Tg(CAG-Lifeact/EGFP)-OTI <break/>(OT1<sup>GFP</sup>)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galeano Niño et al., 2020</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">7–12 week mice used to isolate LifeactGFP OT1 CTLs</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.gBT-I/uGFP <break/>(gBT1-GFP)</td><td valign="top">Gift from W.

secretomes from EL4 (tumour cells only) and OT1 (T cells only) (n = 3 per group) were prepared for mass spectrometry analysis as previously described (40, 41) with the following modifications. For all our experiments with magnetic beads, we used a 1:1 combination mix of the two types of commercially available carboxylate beads (Sera-Mag Speed beads, #65152105050250, #45152105050250, ThermoFisher Scientific). Beads were prepared freshly each time by rinsing with water three times prior to use and stored at 4°C at a stock concentration of 20 μg/μl. Samples were transferred to a 2 ml LoBind deep well plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and reduced with 2 M Dithiothreitol (DTT, 50 mM final conc.) for 1 hr at 37°C. Samples were then alkylated with 1M Iodoacetamide (IAM) (100 mM final conc.) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature (RT). Samples were quenched with 2M DTT (250 mM final conc.) and 5 μl of the concentrated bead stock carboxylate beads (20 μg/μl) were then added to each sample followed by the addition of acetonitrile (ACN) to a final concentration of 70% (v/v). Mixtures were left to incubate upright at RT for 20 min to allow proteins to precipitate onto the beads. The beads were placed on a magnetic rack and washed twice with 70% ethanol and once with ACN (500 μl washes). ACN was completely evaporated from the plate using a CentriVap (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) prior to the addition of 40 μl digestion buffer (10% 2-2-2-Trifluorethanol (TFE)/100 mM NH4HCO3) containing 1 μg Trypsin-gold (Promega, V5280) and 1 μg Lys-C (Wako). The plate was briefly sonicated in a water bath to disperse the beads, and the plate transferred to a ThermoMixer instrument (Eppendorf) for enzymatic digestion at 37°C for 1 hr (1200 rpm). The supernatant comprising of peptides was then collected from the beads using a magnetic rack (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an additional elution (40 μl 2% Dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, Sigma) was performed on the beads. The eluates were pooled together and transferred to pre-equilibrated C18 stage tips for sample clean-up. Briefly, two plugs of C18 resin (3M Empore, 66883 U) were prepared in 200 μl unfiltered tips, pre-wetted with 100 μl methanol followed by sequential washes with 100 μl 80% ACN/5% formic acid (FA), 50% ACN/5% FA and 5% FA. The pooled peptides were then added to the spin tip and the eluate collected into a fresh lo-bind Eppendorf tube. Bound peptides were washed twice with 5% FA. Elutions (50 μl) were performed sequentially with 50% ACN/5% FA followed by 80% ACN/5% FA and collected into fresh Eppendorf tubes. All spins were performed on a benchtop centrifuge at 500 × g (1000–2000 rpm) speeds. The eluates were lyophilized to dryness in MS vials using a CentriVap (Labconco) prior to reconstituting in 20 μl Buffer A (0.1% FA/2% ACN) ready for MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Detection of secreted chemokines in supernatant by ELISA and CBA</title><p>The absolute concentration of chemokines present in supernatants was assessed by ELISA for CCL1 and CCL9 (Sandwich ELISA kits, OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) and Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) for CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL10 (LEGENDplexTM Multi-Analyte Flow Assay Kit, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) as per manufacturers’ instructions. All samples were run in triplicate. Chemokine levels in the supernatants were interpolated from standard curves generated using recombinant proteins provided in the kits.

The beads were resuspended in a second collagen gel mixture that was deposited adjacent to the tumouroid, and allowed to polymerise at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 10 min to create a 3D collagen matrix with dispersed CBA beads. 2 ml of warm TCM was added to the dish, which was then returned to 37°C for either 2 or 3 hr to allow formation of a CCL3 gradient from the tumouroid. The TCM was then removed and 1 ml of 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF, Sigma Aldrich) was added to the dish to fix the gel, which was placed on a plate rocker to incubate for 1 hr at room temperature. The 10% NBF was then removed, and the dish washed 3x with 2 ml FACS wash for 30 min per wash, on the plate rocker at room temperature. The FACS wash was then removed, and the gel resuspended in 2 ml of 1 µg/ml anti-murine CCL3 biotinylated rabbit antibody in FACS wash (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and incubated for 3 hr at room temperature, rocking. The gel was then washed twice with FACS wash as described previously, and then a third time with an overnight incubation at room temperature. The wash buffer was then removed and replaced with Streptavidin-PE (also from the LEGENDplexTM Multi-Analyte Flow Kit) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature, rocking.

Fmoc-Asp-Wang resin, Fmoc protected amino acids, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), and 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)−1,1,3,3-Tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai, China), with other reagents sourced from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia). Solution-phase anion exchange with excess aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to remove the TFA counterion, followed by lyophilization. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) confirmed 95% purity. Gelation was initiated using a well-established pH switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, one wt% hydrogels were prepared from amorphous Fmoc-DDIKVAV powder. This was suspended in deionized water, before the pH was subsequently raised with a minimal amount of 0.5 M NaOH to ensure solubilization. Gelation occurred spontaneously when the pH was lowered to 7.4 using dropwise 1 M HCl, and water used to ensure a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to verify synthesis and structure of the desired nanofibrillar structure (data not shown). CCL3 was loaded within the molecular hydrogel via our recent shear-containment methodology (Nisbet D. R.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nisbet et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the peptide hydrogels were disrupted via the application of shear force until a gel-solution transition was observed and then 10 µg/ml of recombinant CCL3 and 20 µg/ml of 10 kDa Dextran labelled with AlexaFluor647 (Dextran-AF647) were added prior to syringe administration and spontaneous re-assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Intravital microscopy</title><p>-week-old Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice were engrafted by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> EL4 tumour cells into contralateral flanks.

Tumours were surgically exposed and prepared for intravital microscopy by skin flap surgery. The tumour was stabilized on a coverslip on a microscope stage with intact vasculature and innervation. Intravital imaging was performed on a Nikon A1R inverted laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with a CFI APO LWD Lambda series 20×/0.95 NA water immersion objective, an Okolab humidified temperature-controlled microscope enclosure, objective heater and a custom-made stage insert. Heating was adjusted to maintain the temperature at 34°C within the chamber. Cell Trace Violet was excited with a 405 nm laser, CFSE with a 488 nm laser and Dextran-AF647 with a 640 nm laser.

Tumouroids and CTLs were segmented using the Imaris ‘surface’ and ‘spots’ functions, respectively. The shortest distance between each CTL and the tumouroid surface was then calculated for each timepoint using the ‘Distance transform’ ImarisXT module employing MATLAB (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA), for CTLs located either outside or inside the tumouroid surface. MATLAB was then used to calculate the fraction of total CTLs infiltrated into the tumouroid as well as the mean infiltration depth into the tumouroid (measured as the shortest distance from the tumouroid edge for infiltrated CTLs). For visualisation and preparation of movies and figures, Fiji/ImageJ was employed in conjunction with Imaris. For the visualisation of experiments with human T cells, Fiji/ImageJ bleach correction (histogram matching) was applied to eliminate fluctuations in laser power that occurred over the 14 hr of imaging.</p><p>Kymographs were generated to quantify the density of cells with respect to the tumouroid interface over time.

Briefly, this index ranges between −1 and 1, with −1 indicating an even distribution of all cells along the well perimeter, and one indicating all cells as residing within the tumouroid. A value of 0 represents a uniform distribution of cells within the well, but outside of the tumouroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The swarming index is independently quantified for each imaging frame, and the subsequent timeseries denotes the spatial evolution of cells with respect to the tumouroid over time.

Code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marknormanread/TcellSwarming">https://github.com/marknormanread/TcellSwarming</ext-link>. T cells are modelled as non-overlapping spheres of 12 µm diameter in a spatially explicit 3D environment. We modelled a whole well environment of 6.8 mm diameter containing a concentric tumouroid environment of 2.4 mm diameter, both with height 60 µm; these boundaries are impermeable. In all cases, a total of 35,000 cells are simulated within this environment.</p><p>T cell motility patterns are sampled from the tracks of OT1 CTLs observed through 3D ex vivo imaging of space immediately adjacent to a tumouroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The sampling methodology is performed via ‘bootstrapping’: each modelled T cell samples (with replacement) and then re-enacts 10 min blocks of observed ex vivo CTL motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The pool of blocks to be sampled comprises all unique consecutive 10 min durations of track data, across all imaged CTLs in the source data. Each block describes a given CTL’s sequence of displacements, and their relative orientations, within the 10 min window.</p><p>Modelled agents conducting ‘undirected’ motion sample their motilities from experiments involving random migration of CTLs in the absence of a tumouroid. Conversely, ‘chemotactic’ agents sample the motilities of CTLs imaged in the presence of a tumouroid containing cognate tumour cells and embedded CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In this case, each block captures CTL motility with respect to the tumouroid, and the modelled agent reinterprets this with respect to the chemokine gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>); ‘up’ (0<italic>x</italic>, 0<italic>y</italic>, 1<italic>z</italic>) is maintained during these rotational translations. Agents entering the tumouroid environment cease bootstrapped motility reconstruction and instead move towards the tumouroid centre through the <italic>xy</italic> plane, holding a stable <italic>z</italic>-location, at 0.15 µm/min. Upon entering the tumouroid, agents in the ‘positive attraction’ simulation scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) secrete a soluble chemotactic factor. No such secretion takes place in the simulated ‘no attraction’ scenario.</p><p>Chemokine-secreting agents do so at 1000 molecules/min. The chemokines have a diffusion coefficient of 250 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (2.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec), given CCL3 and CCL4 molecular weights of 10 kDa approximately. The chemokine concentration at a given point in space and time is resolved through applying the heat kernel to all prior secretion events, having recorded their location, time and quantity. The heat kernel is a numerical solution for the modelling of diffusion. Agents determine the chemokine concentration at six points around their spherical extremity (where the sphere intersects the ±<italic>x</italic>,±<italic>y</italic> and±<italic>z</italic> axes, relative to the agent), and from this determine the chemokine gradient direction. Agents are ‘chemotactic’ only whilst the maximum perceived chemokine concentration lies above a ‘chemotaxis actuation’ threshold, and below another ‘desensitisation’ threshold. Both thresholds are agent-specific, with each agent sampling a threshold from a log-normal distribution; agents hence differ in their sensitivity to chemokines.</p><p>Whilst agents are permitted to move freely within this three-dimensional space during simulation, only the locations of agents intersecting an <italic>xy</italic> plane at depth 30 µm are recorded for downstream analysis; this is reflective of the restricted <italic>z</italic>-depth of the whole well imaging experiments, facilitating comparison of results. Agent location changes are updated in 20 s increments of simulated time, but recorded at 5 min intervals, in line with experimental whole well imaging. Agent diameters are enlarged to 48 µm to facilitate visualisation in simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Non-cognate or cognate EL4 tumour cells were labelled with 10 μM CMTMR for 20 min in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and washed twice.

The plates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min before incubation for 2.5 hr at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. OT1 and CMTMR+ tumour cells were then sorted (two-way sort) on the FACS-Aria III flow sorter (BD Biosciences). To prepare OT1 stimulated by cognate beads, OT1 CTLs were incubated with beads (prepared as described above) for 3 hr. Non-cognate (OT1 CTLs conjugated with EL-4) or cognate (OT1 CTLs conjugated with EL-4 pulsed with SIINFEKL as described above) supernatants were prepared and filtered as described above and were then used to incubate 3 × 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in 250 μl OT1 CTLs for 3 hr prior to RNA extraction.

Low-quality reads that did not pass this step were removed from downstream analysis. The reads were aligned against the GRCm38 reference mouse genome with Tophat2 using default parameters. Read counts were quantified by FeatureCounts (version 1.5.1) (results provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The authors provide strong data that upon engaging cognate antigen on tumour cells or artificial APCs, CTLs produce CCL3/4, which promote directed recruitment of distant CTLs via CCR5 in a positive feedback loop. These core findings are reproduced using human T cells and engineered tumour cells and also with a CAR-T cell model. The in vivo data show observations consistent with these interpretations. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that homotypic, long-range signalling could lead to a CTL swarming response and enhance tumour killing in vivo.</p><p>While the manuscript is of great interest, there are concerns that require to be addressed as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Issues related to the in vitro work:</p><p>1A) A major argument of this manuscript is that early &quot;searcher&quot; CTLs that arrive at the tumour sites are responsible for the sustained, feed-forward amplification of further recruitment of the later &quot;responder&quot; CTLs in a multi-step process (Figure 7). This hypothesis is not adequately supported by the tumour organoid experiment in which the authors have pre-embedded CTLs with the tumour cells in a 1:1 ratio and showed that CTLs were positively attracted to the tumour site when pre-embedded antigen-specific CTLs are present (Figure 2). At 2x10^6 CTLs and tumour cells each, the starting experiment condition implies that a fairly large number of CTLs have already been recruited into the tumour site. This is ~7-fold more CTLs than the 'dispersed' CTLs (3x10^5) that were seeded outside of the tumour site for their migration to be tracked. To demonstrate that early arriving CTLs can induce and drive a cascade of CTL self-recruitment, the authors should titrate the pre-embedded CTLs to much lower numbers and examine if biased directionality in adjacent CTLs can still be observed in this case.</p><p>1B) The authors observe enhanced infiltration of CTLs when a separate CTL population is pre-embedded in the tumour organoid carrying cognate antigen. They use this observation as evidence of enhanced directed recruitment of distant CTLs. However, pre-embedding CTLs should also enhance killing of the tumour cells and alleviate physical space constraints within the tumouroid itself (based on the increased number of &quot;black&quot; holes in the tumoroid observed in Video 2). How do the authors distinguish between increased CTL infiltration due to enhanced directed recruitment versus more physical space available in the tumouroid due to killing? This &quot;physical constraint&quot; issue could be addressed by comparing infiltration of a non-embedded tumouroid vs. CTL-embedded cognate tumouroid by CCR5- effector T cells of a different specificity. This would be a simple extension of the study shown in Figure 2 using two different specificities of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but with infiltration in a central tumouroid now examined rather than the FMI alone in an asymmetric model.</p><p>1C) The data suggest that CCL3 and/or CCL4 gradients form; do the authors have experimental evidence for this?</p><p>1D) 6- Are both CCL3 and CCL4 needed? Or are individual chemokines enough?</p><p>1E) In Figure 2B, cell speed also increases when tumours are preloaded with CTLs in the presence of non-cognate antigens. The likely explanations need to be explained.</p><p>1F) Why are the transcriptomic profiles of CTLs embedded with antigen-loaded tumor cells or antigen-loaded beads different (Figure 4B)?</p><p>1G) 7- If CTLs and neutrophils use different mechanisms to be recruited to swarm, why are their recruitments mutually exclusive (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2)?</p><p>1H) Methodological clarifications: the authors should clearly describe (a) what 'cognate' and 'non-cognate' antigens are (in addition to Materials and methods), and (b) how beads are co-embedded with CTLs (Figure 2C legend).</p><p>1I) The results need to be discussed in light of Hugues et al., (2007), where the authors have shown that in lymph nodes, the antigen-specific CD8 T cells that interact with DCs attract CD8 T cells of other antigen specificities in a CCR5-dependent manner. This important paper is not cited or discussed and clearly provides the initial report of a CD8 T cell capacity to induce recruitment of other CD8 T cells. The present manuscript expands on this core observation and goes further to provide data on the capacity of peripheral effector T cells to drive such a circuit.</p><p>2) Issues related to the in vivo work:</p><p>2A) Unfortunately, the authors do not provide direct and specific data on the role of this mechanism in tumour rejection in vivo and they understate the existing evidence that homotypic signalling occurs among CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. There is prior evidence, from dynamic imaging work, of T cell production of chemokines that leads to attraction of other T cells to facilitate immunity. The new aspect proposed here is the operation of such circuits in the peripheral tumour microenvironment rather than in secondary lymphoid organs. The organoid data are somewhat limited with respect to tumour relevance, as made clear by the ability of the authors to get the same in vitro data using antigen-bearing beads. The in vivo experiments do not completely address the point of the manuscript with respect to the plausible role of a homotypic CCL3/4-CCR5 signalling pathway in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell mediated tumor infiltration and killing. This is because the experiments in vivo are all with tumor cells engineered to express CCL3/4, not with non-engineered tumor cells and T cells with an inability to make the relevant chemokines, to express the relevant receptor, or where these interactions are inhibited by some of the drugs used in vitro in the paper. Transfer studies done in mice lacking their own cognate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells response to a tumor expressing the antigen relevant to the transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (e.g., in RAG KO) would be the easiest approach to addressing this question, as the transferred cells can be made to lack CCR5 or CCL3/4 expression or the animals treated with inhibitors of this pathway as done in vitro. Without such experiments, the authors provide no functional data to demonstrate that CTL engagement of a tumour cell expressing cognate antigen drives recruitment of distant CTLs in vivo that in turn contributes to tumor growth inhibition or destruction.</p><p>Similarly, the authors have engrafted EL4 or CCL3/4-secreting EL4 on Rag KO mice to show that CTL recruitment was enhanced in CCL3/4-secreting tumours and have argued that these &quot;sustained production of CCL3 and CCL4 by activated CTLs is sufficient to induce swarming and tumor infiltration.&quot; However, the experimental result here does not support the claim that CTL tumor infiltration is mediated by direct, long-range CCL3/4 chemotactic sensing by CD8 T cells nor that this increased recruitment is caused by CTL-secreted CCL3/4, as other cell types, including myeloid cells (such as pDCs, NK cells, some of which the authors also show in Figure 4—figure supplement 2J) can also respond to CCL3/4 signals and drive further inflammation and chemotactic factors that amplify CTL recruitment indirectly. The critical control of CCR5- null CD8bT cells is not included in this set of experiments, only in subsequent studies.</p><p>Further, in Figure 5E-F, the authors performed a dual flank experiment where CCL3/4-secreting and non-secreting EL4 tumor cells were engrafted on contralateral flanks and transferred WT and CCR5 KO CTLs and argue that CCR5 is required for CTL recruitment. However, it is possible to interpret these data, of an almost equal ratio of WT:CCR5 KO CTLs in the non-secreting tumor, to suggest that CCR5-mediated recruitment is not the primary mechanism that results in CTL tumor infiltration.</p><p>A major claim of the paper, and a new advance if it were to be properly demonstrated, is that this circuit plays a relevant and important role in tumors AFTER the action of such circuits in secondary lymphoid organs. However, additional data, as pointed out above, are needed to make this point. This is especially important as several recent papers have shown a key role for the other chemokine-chemokine receptors circuits such as CXCL9/10 – CXCR3 in mediating effective CD8 T cells immunity in tumors (for example, Chow et al., 2019 andCD8<sup>+</sup> Chheda et al., 2016), so whether different sets of CK and CR contribute in non-reductant ways to anti-tumor immunity is unknown. Given that these other data cited involve in vivo tumor experiments, one needs comparable in vivo studies to place the present findings with CCL3/4 in context.</p><p>2B) Given the observation of peripheral rimming of T cells in the in vitro studies in the absence of CCL3/4 and invasion with these mediators operative, transcriptomic datasets from human samples that are classified as cold (excluded) and hot (infiltrated) would be useful to probe to see if there is a difference in CCL3/4 mRNA expression in the two cases, and would be even better if this involved single cell work that ascribed production to the CD8 T cells themselves. This would be in silico work to see if the right data sets exist and if mined, show the expected outcome, although it is possible, of course, that no such differences may be identifiable in CCL3/4 expression between hot and cold tumors, which would neither invalidate nor support a potential role played by these chemokines in CD8 T cell swarming in tumours.</p><p>2C) In the absence of data from additional work as in 2A above, and/or if efforts in 2B above do not show any informative correlation, it is recommended that the paper be re-written to focus on effector CD8 T cells driving concerted recruitment to sites of antigen recognition, with the underlying mechanism carefully documented, and with only the discussion suggesting that this might be a mechanism active in the in vivo tumor setting, making clear that future experiments will show whether this mechanism is indeed prominent in primary tumors in vivo.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytotoxic T Cells Swarm by Homotypic Chemokine Signalling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In Figure 2B, the exogenously added CTLs exhibit swarming (increased FMI) towards the cognate tumour even in the absence of pre-embedded antigen-specific CTLs. However, in Figure 2F, exogenously added CTLs do not exhibit swarming unless there are pre-embedded antigen-specific CTLs. What is the cause of this discrepancy?</p><p>2) Subsection “CTL recruitment is driven by secretion of CCL3 and CCL4” – Clarification is required. The authors state &quot;only CCL3 and CCL4 inhibition disrupted CTL transmigration towards cognate supernatants.&quot; However, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1F, CCL4 blocking Abs alone have no effect on transmigration, despite that fact that both CCL3 and CCL4 blocking antibodies are required to block directional migration in Figure 4G. Can the authors provide an explanation for this discrepancy in the text?</p><p>3) Figure 5F – OT1 WT and OT1 CCR5-/- both exhibit a large increase in recruitment to the tumour when gBT1 cells are pre-transferred. This observation suggests that CCL3 and CCL4 actually play a very minor role in T cell &quot;swarming&quot; in this in vivo system. The authors should alter the wording of the abstract since it currently states that &quot;CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling via the diffusion of secreted chemokines CCL3 and CCL4&quot;. This statement suggests that CCL3/CCL4 play a major role in T cell swarming, but this claim isn't fully supported by the in vivo data.</p><p>4) Figure 5 and accompanying supplements – The small differences observed between WT and CCR5-/- CTLs in vivo, both in terms of recruitment and tumour killing, could be due to the fact that the authors co-transferred 5x106 of each CTL into recipient mice. This high transfer number may diminish the role of CCR5/CCL3/CCL4 mediated recruitment of CTLs into the tumour in vivo. At the very least, the authors should comment on this issue in the text.</p><p>5) Figure 5—figure supplement 2 – This figure would be even more convincing if the authors showed the distribution of the WT and CCR5-/- CTLs in a cognate tumour without an exogenous source of CCL3.</p><p>6) Subsection “CTL recruitment is driven by secretion of CCL3 and CCL4” – Figure 4—figure supplement 4A-C. Overexpression of CCL3/4 in the tumors seems to have no effect (at least statistically) on the recruitment of OT1 CTLs or endogenous CTLS into the tumor in vivo. These observations seem to contradict the main point of the paper. The authors should provide a convincing explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have properly addressed all my concerns and provide an important number of new experiments.

First, a point of clarification: in the experiments of Figure 2, the CTLs embedded within the tumouroid and those that are dispersed adjacent to the tumouroid are differentially labelled, and thus only the latter are tracked in terms of speed and directionality towards the tumouroid. Any CTLs pre-embedded in the tumouroids therefore do not contribute to the CTL migration data shown in the figure.</p><p>We have followed the reviewers’ suggestion and now include a titration of the number of CTLs embedded in the cognate tumouroids, whilst keeping the tracked CTL population adjacent to the tumouroid constant. New Figure 2B shows motility data for cases where CTLs are pre-embedded in the cognate tumouroid at a 1:1 ratio with tumour cells, at a 1:5 ratio and in the complete absence of pre-embedded CTLs.</p><p>In all 3 cases, even in the absence of CTLs pre-embedded in the cognate tumouroid, the dispersed CTLs display enhanced directionality towards the tumouroid (FMI &gt; 0). In the context of non-cognate tumouroids, whether CTLs were pre-embedded or not, the surrounding CTLs do not display directional motion. These results demonstrate that CTLs randomly arriving at a cognate target in the absence of a chemotactic signal (‘searcher’ CTLs), engage the target in an antigen-specific manner (turning into ‘engager/recruiters’) and induce directional motility in distant CTL populations (which become ‘responders’) as illustrated in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B) The authors observe enhanced infiltration of CTLs when a separate CTL population is pre-embedded in the tumour organoid carrying cognate antigen. They use this observation as evidence of enhanced directed recruitment of distant CTLs. However, pre-embedding CTLs should also enhance killing of the tumour cells and alleviate physical space constraints within the tumouroid itself (based on the increased number of &quot;black&quot; holes in the tumoroid observed in Video 2). How do the authors distinguish between increased CTL infiltration due to enhanced directed recruitment versus more physical space available in the tumouroid due to killing? This &quot;physical constraint&quot; issue could be addressed by comparing infiltration of a non-embedded tumouroid vs. CTL-embedded cognate tumouroid by CCR5- effector T cells of a different specificity. This would be a simple extension of the study shown in Figure 2 using two different specificities of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but with infiltration in a central tumouroid now examined rather than the FMI alone in an asymmetric model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the excellent suggestion to extend our central tumouroid data to control for infiltration not merely arising due to additional space created by the elimination of tumour cells by pre-embedded CTLs. We have implemented the suggested experiments by replacing tumour cells with antigen-coated beads that cannot be lysed (as previously done in the asymmetric model depicted in Figure 2C) and therefore cannot progressively give way to more physical space for infiltrating CTLs. As suggested, we tested the following conditions:</p><p>- Cognate beads: a central bead mass coated with cognate antigen (SIINFEKL), without pre-embedded CTLs and surrounded by OT1 CTLs.</p><p>- Cognate beads + CTLs: a central bead mass coated with cognate antigen (SIINFEKL), pre-embedded with CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> OT1 CTLs and surrounded by gBT1 CTLs (non-cognate for the SIINFEKL antigen).</p><p>and the following control:</p><p>- Non-cognate beads: a central mass with uncoated beads, surrounded by OT1 CTLs.</p><p>The cognate bead scenarios are illustrated in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>Similarly to tumouroids composed of real tumour cells and pre-embedded tumour-reactive CTLs, in the condition where the bead mass contains pre-embedded cognate CTLs, the surrounding CTLs infiltrate the mass more than when the cognate bead mass does not contain pre-embedded CTLs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-E). Thus, this increased infiltration occurs independently of any alleviation of space constraints. Interestingly, in cognate contexts the infiltration depth is greater in the case of the pre-embedded bead-mass than real cell tumouroid (compare to Figure 1D); this is due to the lack of antigen specificity of the surrounding gBT1 CTLs, which therefore do not arrest to engage the beads coated with antigen specific for the pre-embedded OT1 CTLs. The absence of this antigen-specific arrest is most evident in the lack of accumulation at the edge of the pre-embedded bead mass (see confocal images and density kymographs of Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E). Together, these results demonstrate that antigen-specific activation of CTLs deep within a solid mass induces enhanced directed recruitment of distal CTLs (that do not need to be cognate for the target), which then also infiltrate the target mass to a greater extent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1C) The data suggest that CCL3 and/or CCL4 gradients form; do the authors have experimental evidence for this?</p></disp-quote><p>This helpful question prompted us to devise an experiment in which the chemokine gradient formed by CTLs engaging cognate targets can be visualised and quantified. CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines are small molecules (~10kDa) that rapidly diffuse in aqueous mediums and cannot be readily visualised in solution. We therefore employed cytometric bead array (CBA) particles (beads), which are normally used in solution and subjected to flow cytometry to measure soluble chemokine and cytokine concentrations in supernatants (see for example Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Here, we embedded CBA beads in a 3D collagen matrix surrounding a cognate tumouroid to immobilise CCL3 diffusing from the tumouroid. Following fixation, the addition of an anti-CCL3 antibody allowed for the imaging of the extent of diffusion of CCL3 away from the tumouroid, as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and 2E. We obtained such samples at 2 and 3 hours following embedding of the tumour-reactive CTLs in the tumouroid. Simple image analysis, consisting of a maximum intensity z-projection followed by quantification of mean intensities along the x-axis (which defines the distance from the tumouroid), revealed that the CBA beads were uniformly distributed in the matrix surrounding the tumouroid. By contrast, the anti-CCL3 signals displayed a clear gradient with higher concentrations near the tumouroid than at distant positions, and a steeper gradient and increased overall signal at 3hours compared to 2hours, consistent with the continual secretion and diffusion of CCL3 from CTLs in the tumouroid (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F). These results provide direct evidence for the establishment of chemokine gradients from the site of antigen-specific target engagement by CTLs, which in turn leads to the progressive recruitment of distant CTLs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1D) 6- Are both CCL3 and CCL4 needed? Or are individual chemokines enough?</p></disp-quote><p>This question was partly addressed in the original submission but prompted us to expand our data. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1G we had used neutralising antibodies to selectively block CCL3 and CCL4 signalling, and in combination, in 3D collagen matrices containing a side (asymmetric) tumouroid. Those data showed that CCL3 and CCL4 act redundantly. Inhibition of CCL3 or CCL4 alone was insufficient to abolish the directional recruitment of distant CTLs, whereas concurrent inhibition of both CCL3 and CCL4 fully abolished the directional recruitment. Thus, both CCL3 and CCL4 are not needed simultaneously to underpin homotypic recruitment of CTLs. In order to conclusively address the second part of the question as to whether the diffusion of individual CCL3 or CCL4 chemokines are sufficient to generate swarming, we expanded our data to include tumouroids that exclusively secrete CCL4 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2I-K), in addition to the double CCL3/4-secreting and CCL3-secreting contexts shown previously in Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-H. Untransduced EL4 tumour cells do not secrete any factors that induce directional recruitment of CTLs (see Figure 2B). EL4 tumouroids engineered to exclusively secrete CCL3 or CCL4 both give rise to CTL swarming. These experiments show that the diffusion of either CCL3 or CCL4 alone is sufficient to generate CTL swarming around a source. Importantly, swarming is observed in the case where the tumour cells are non-cognate, and thus in these experiments arriving CTLs cannot contribute to a chemotactic signal, which is exclusively composed of tumour-secreted CCL3 or CCL4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1E) In Figure 2B, cell speed also increases when tumours are preloaded with CTLs in the presence of non-cognate antigens. The likely explanations need to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that centres on the concept of chemokinesis, increased motility without a directional component, as opposed to chemotaxis, which involves directional motion towards a source of a gradient (Weninger, Biro and Jain, 2014); the former as well as the latter are often observed in response to cytokine or chemokine signalling (Worbs et al., 2007). It is highly interesting that CTLs do recognise non-cognate tumour cells and in response upregulate various genes, including some that are exclusively upregulated in the case of non-cognate contacts and not during cognate contacts (for full transcriptomic data see Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Amongst genes that are exclusively up in non-cognate contacts are netrin-1, semaphorin 5A, and autotaxin. Netrins are well-characterised proteins that provide axonal guidance cues in neurons, and promote general cell migration. Netrin-1 has indeed been shown to induce chemokinesis in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro and enhance in vivo inflammation (Boneschansker et al., 2016). The netrin-1 receptors neogenin, uncoordinated-5 (UNC5)A, and UNC5B that are upregulated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon activation (Boneschansker, 2015) are also expressed by OT1 CTLs.</p><p>Similar to netrins, the action of semaphorins in axon growth and guidance extend beyond the brain to regulate migration in diverse cell types, including leukocytes (Takegahara, Kumanogoh and Kikutani, 2005). Sema5a drives angiogenesis, and is a potent activator of T cells and NK cells (Gras et al., 2014). Its receptor plexin3b is expressed by OT1 CTLs but it is not known whether Sema5A triggers chemokinesis in CTLs.</p><p>A third candidate that could drive chemokinesis is the ectoenzyme, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase-phosphodiesterase 2 (ENPP2). Widely known as “autotaxin” (Ninou, Magkrioti and Aidinis, 2018), ENPP2 is a secreted lysophospholipase D largely responsible for extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) production. LPA is a bioactive phospholipid that has been shown to induce LFA-1– independent chemokinesis in T cells in vitro (Katakai et al., 2014). LPA signals through at least six type I rhodopsin-like receptors (LPARs) (Yung, Stoddard and Chun, 2014), three of which (LPAR 2,5 and 6) are expressed by OT1 CTLs. It will be interesting in future studies to identify the specific triggers of non-cognate contact-induced chemokinesis. Here, we simply discuss the interesting observation in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1F) Why are the transcriptomic profiles of CTLs embedded with antigen-loaded tumor cells or antigen-loaded beads different (Figure 4B)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that principally addresses the molecular mechanisms, and structure and function of antigen-specific activation via T cell receptors, the dependence on co-receptors and the sufficiency of peptide-MHC in the absence of other surface signals to invoke complete T cell activation; as such it is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>It should however be noted that the beads are only coated with peptide-MHC and completely lack integrin ligands such as ICAM-1. Expression of the integrin LFA-1 by CTLs and its binding to ICAM1 on targets plays an important role in the arrest of CTLs upon target recognition, synapse formation and ultimately in target killing (Evans et al., 2011; Hogg, Patzak and Willenbrock, 2011). Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that the mechanical landscape of target cells plays an important role in the degree of activation and efficiency of effector function delivery of T cells (Basu et al., 2016). Beads are evidently considerably stiffer than our target tumour cells.</p><p>Whether the transcriptomic differences we observe are due to co-receptor engagement, paracrine signalling through factors secreted by real tumour cells, by integrin or other surface receptor activations, or biophysical effects such adhesion strengths or mechanical properties of the targets, remains to be explored in future studies.</p><p>Whilst the question as to why there are differences in gene expression between bead- and tumour cell-conjugated CTLs is interesting per se, it should be noted that the transcriptomic profiles of these two samples are far more similar to one another than to resting CTLs or those engaging non-cognate tumour cells (as shown by the hierarchical clustering tree at the top of Figure 4B). Observed differences are mostly in the extent of expression, as most genes, with the exception of only a few, are either similarly up- or down-regulated in both the cognate bead and cognate tumour cell samples. Indeed, genes that code for proteins that are important in this study are well correlated in expression between the cognate bead and cognate tumour cell samples. We used beads here in conjunction with tumour cells precisely to identify effects that arise due to antigen-mediated activation of the CTLs and are therefore consistent between the two samples, and not to investigate the underlying molecular and structural mechanisms that govern TCR-activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1G) 7- If CTLs and neutrophils use different mechanisms to be recruited to swarm, why are their recruitments mutually exclusive (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this question, which prompted us to further evaluate the concept of mutual exclusion between neutrophils and CTLs. It should be noted that we did not claim to have demonstrated that such a mutually exclusive recruitment mechanism is in force. We had found that upon increased CTL infiltration into tumours there was an associated decrease in infiltrating neutrophils as a percentage of CD45+ leukocytes, and simply reflected that this is “consistent with a recently suggested mutually exclusive recruitment mechanism between CTLs and neutrophils to the TME” et al.(Stoll et al., 2018). A more recent report also indicates an inverse correlation between CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tumour infiltration on the one hand, and neutrophils on the other (Jackstadt et al., 2019). However, in response to minor point 1 below where it was requested that we plot absolute counts of tumour-infiltrating cells rather than as percentages, we found there to no longer be a significant difference in neutrophil infiltration.</p><p>In any event, the reviewers are correct in that neutrophils and T cells use dissimilar mechanisms to achieve similar swarming phenomena. Swarming by immune cells was first described in neutrophils (Chtanova et al., 2008; Lammermann et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2011), which instead of chemokine signalling utilise lipid signalling via Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and its corresponding receptor LTB4R1 to achieve homotypic signalling and swarming around targets. CCR5 is only minimally expressed by circulating neutrophils (Rudd et al., 2019) and it is therefore highly unlikely that T cell-secreted CCL3 and CCL4 can constitute a direct cross-signal that would influence neutrophils. Interestingly however, CTLs do express LTBR1 (transcriptomics data available in Supplementary file 1), which raises the possibility that neutrophils may attract T cells via LTB4. Such an asymmetric attraction would on its own invalidate the concept of mutual exclusion. We cannot exclude that activated tissue-infiltrating CTLs may still generate a signal that somehow directly influence neutrophils via factors other than CCL3 and CCL4. However, the reviewers’ question led us to realise that for the avoidance of confusion for the readers, it would be prudent not to suggest that such a mechanism may be at play here. We have therefore removed the comment and associated reference from the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1H) Methodological clarifications: the authors should clearly describe (a) what 'cognate' and 'non-cognate' antigens are (in addition to Materials and methods), and (b) how beads are co-embedded with CTLs (Figure 2C legend).</p></disp-quote><p>a) Murine CTLs were generated from the OT1 and gBT1 T cell receptor transgenic mice that recognise ovalbumin (SIINFEKL) or herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B (SSIEFARL) residues respectively, both in the context of the H-2K<sup>b</sup> class I major histocompatibility complex. For preparation of target cells to present cognate antigens for OT1 or gBT1 CTLs, EL4 tumour cells were pulsed for 16 hours with 1 µg/ml SIINFEKL or SSIEFARL peptide, respectively. Non-cognate controls were un-pulsed EL4, or EL4 cells pulsed with the irrelevant peptide. In the in vivo tumour homing and rejection experiments performed during revision, cognate antigen was presented by EL4 cells transduced to express SIINFEKL- or SSIEFARL-expressing proteins fused to mTagBFP2. Non-cognate controls included untransduced EL4, EL4 expressing mCherry, or EL4 expressing the irrelevant peptide epitope.</p><p>b) For stimulating OT1 CTLs with “cognate beads”, streptavidin-coated polystyrene particles (6-8 µm diameter) were bound to monobiotinylated H-2K<sup>b</sup>/SIINFEKL for 45min and washed before mixing with OT1 CTLs in liquid phase collagen at 4ºC, before the matrix was allowed to polymerise for at least 10 min at 37ºC. Non-cognate beads were uncoated. Where side (asymmetric) tumouroids were constructed, 20 µl of the cold collagen preparation containing 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> each of cognate beads and CTLs were deposited on one side of a 14-mm microwell within a 35-mm glass-bottom dish. Where central tumoroids were constructed, 2.5 µl of the cold collagen preparation containing 3.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cognate or non-cognate particles, or 1.75 x 10<sup>5</sup> each of cognate particles and CTLs were deposited in the centre of a well in a glass-bottom 96-well optical plate.</p><p>We have now provided these details in the main text and figure legends, as well as in Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1I) The results need to be discussed in light of Hugues et al., (2007), where the authors have shown that in lymph nodes, the antigen-specific CD8 T cells that interact with DCs attract CD8 T cells of other antigen specificities in a CCR5-dependent manner. This important paper is not cited or discussed and clearly provides the initial report of a CD8 T cell capacity to induce recruitment of other CD8 T cells. The present manuscript expands on this core observation and goes further to provide data on the capacity of peripheral effector T cells to drive such a circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the relevant publication by Hugues et al., 2007et al. that shows that naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells engaging cognate antigen presented by dendritic cells within lymph nodes provide “help” to recruit polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of other antigen specificities. We had only cited the publication by Castellino et al., 2006 that shows CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells guide CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to sites of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-dendritic cell interactions. In the Discussion section, we have now referenced the Hugues et al., study, together with additional studies that implicate CCR5 and its ligands in the directional migration of T cells within tumour-draining lymph nodes (Gonzalez-Martin et al., 2011) and infected lymph nodes (Hickman et al., 2011). In these studies, naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recruitment within lymph nodes to sites of antigen presentation was CCR5-dependent, but such an effect had not been shown in peripheral effector CTLs. In addition, the sources of the CCR5 ligands were not unambiguously ascribed to the T cells, but merely to interactions between DCs and T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Issues related to the in vivo work:</p><p>2A) Unfortunately, the authors do not provide direct and specific data on the role of this mechanism in tumour rejection in vivo and they understate the existing evidence that homotypic signalling occurs among CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. […] Given that these other data cited involve in vivo tumor experiments, one needs comparable in vivo studies to place the present findings with CCL3/4 in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that there have been prior reports of homotypic signalling leading to attraction of distant naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymph nodes, to sites of interactions between dendritic cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Castellino et al., 2006) or naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Hugues et al., 2007), and have discussed these references in our manuscript as per point 1I above. We also agree that investigating CTL homing towards non-secreting tumours containing activated CTLs would more directly address if homotypic signalling drives recruitment of distant CTLs in vivo. As suggested by the reviewers, we performed adoptive transfer experiments in Rag1-deficient (<italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice (that lack endogenous T- and B cells) bearing non-secreting EL4 tumours.</p><p><italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice engrafted with SSIEFARL-expressing tumours received a primary transfer of tumour-reactive gBT1 CTLs (cognate). 48 h later a secondary cohort of WT and CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> OT1 CTLs (both non-cognate) were co-transferred (Figure 5E). The presence of tumour-reactive CTLs (Figure 5—figure supplement 3 E,F) markedly increased the overall recruitment of subsequent non-cognate CTLs into the tumours (Figure 5F). Furthermore, subsequent to a primary transfer of cognate CTLs, significantly more non-cognate WT CTLs infiltrated the tumours than the co-transferred CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> CTLs (p=0.015). In the absence of a primary transfer of cognate CTLs, there was no significant difference in the ability of WT and CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> CTLs to infiltrate the tumours (p=0.394), in line with what we had previously found in the control tumours engrafted on the contralateral flanks of CCL3/4-secreting tumours (previously Figure 5E,F; now Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B).</p><p>It should be noted that CCR5-/- CTLs also home in greater numbers to tumours containing previously transferred tumour-reactive CTLs. Therefore, circuits other than the homotypic CCL3/4-CCR5 signalling axis we identify here must also be at play. Whether these are indirect circuits arising in inflamed tumours, mediated for instance via NK and dendritic cells, or more direct circuits driven by alternate chemokine receptor-ligand interactions or pro-inflammatory cytokines remains to be established (see also below for response regarding the CXCR3 circuit). For instance, CCL3 or CCL4-producing tumours recruit NK cells, where they directly contribute to IFNγ, CCL5 and XCL1 production (Allen et al., 2018; Bottcher and Reis e Sousa, 2018), and recruit DC intermediaries that amplify CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL5 production (Allen et al., 2018; Bottcher et al., 2018; Spranger, Bao and Gajewski, 2015; Wong et al., 2013), in turn facilitating the accumulation of effector T cells. Nevertheless, our results show that CTLs engaging a cognate tumour can drive the recruitment of distant CTLs into the tumour, and that this recruitment is partly dependent on CCR5.</p><p>In light of the reviewers’ comments on the relevance of the in vivo experiments with CCL3/4-secreting tumours, we have moved the corresponding data previously shown in Figure 5E-H to Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-D, and instead include the above new findings in Figure 5E, F.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also investigated tumour clearance in <italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We found that SIINFEKL-expressing tumour clearance by adoptively transferred cognate CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> OT1 CTLs was not impaired compared to WT OT1 CTLs (in separate hosts) (Figure 5—figure supplement 3G). Therefore, whilst CTL engagement of tumours expressing cognate antigen may increase recruitment of distant CTLs, CCR5 expression on transferred CTLs was not critical for tumour clearance. This finding may not be completely unexpected given that (i) CCR5-deficient CTLs also home relatively effectively into tumours with active antigen-specific engagement (as per above, Figure 5E,F), (ii) our results and reports by others implicating circuits other than the CCR5-dependent one in antitumour immunity (see further response below), and (iii) CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> CTLs are fully effective at eliminating cognate antigen-presenting target cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1H).</p><p>We are confident that the CCR5-dependent homotypic signalling circuit is operational and influences CTL recruitment into tumours in vivo, but it is only one such circuit among a complex array of chemotactic, pro-inflammatory and retention signals, and abrogation of this circuit alone does therefore not result in the impairment of tumour rejection over many days by adoptively transferred CTLs. The long time-scales and concerted immunological interactions involved in tumour rejections may over time mask the role of the homotypic CTL signalling circuit. Acute, local chemotactic effects occurring over a shorter time period may in fact be operational but are not reflected in macroscopic tumour volume data. In order to test whether CTLs can indeed effectively swarm towards a CCL3 source within the dense and complex landscape of real tumour tissue, we used intravital microscopy to interrogate the positioning of WT and CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> OT1 CTLs up to 6h around an acute release of CCL3, locally delivered by stereotactic injection of a shear-reversible hydrogel containing the chemokine (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Indeed, we found a CCR5-dependent accumulation of CTLs in the tumour tissue around the delivered CCL3.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that without performing experiments with CCL3/CCL4-deficient CTLs, which we do not have timely access to, we cannot rule out that increased recruitment into tumours containing cognate CTLs is also caused by other CCR5 ligand-secreting cell types. Therefore, we have followed the reviewer’s advice to amend the text and remove the unsupported claim that “sustained production of CCL3 and CCL4 by activated CTLs is sufficient to induce swarming and tumour infiltration”, also in line with point 2C below. We now state that “sustained release of CCL3 and CCL4 is sufficient to promote CCR5-dependent homing into tumours in vivo, and that the presence of tumour-reactive CTLs in a tumour promotes the recruitment of distant CCR5<sup>+</sup> CTLs. Homotypic CTL recruitment via CCR5 is however likely not the only or primary signalling circuit that results in CTL tumour infiltration or clearance.”</p><p>In a first experiment in <italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mice, before we had conclusively identified CCR5 as the receptor mediating the homotypic signal, we had interrogated the ability of OT1 CTLs to home to CCL3/4-secreting tumours compared to non-secreting tumours engrafted on the contralateral flanks (previously Figure 4—figure supplement 2I, now Figure 4—figure supplement 4A). In parallel, we also performed an experiment to evaluate endogenous leukocyte recruitment to the CCL3/4-secreting tumours in PTPRCA host mice via CD45.1 staining (previously Figure 4—figure supplement 2J, now Figure 4—figure supplement 4B), in the absence of CTL transfer. The difference between these experiments was indicated in the legends but was not clear in the main text, for which we apologise. We have now amended the text to better distinguish the different in vivo experiments. We have also followed the reviewers’ suggestion and reported absolute cell counts per tumour, and included a new experiment evaluating endogenous dendritic cell recruitment into CCL3/4-secreting tumours. In Figure 4—figure supplement 4, this new analysis indicates a significant (p=0.035) increase in NK cells within CCL3/4-secreting tumours, but not other cell types, including dendritic cells.</p><p>Subsequently, to investigate the role of CCR5 in tumour recruitment, we co-transferred WT OT1 CTLs and CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> OT1 CTLs (the “CCR5- null CD8b T cells” requested by the reviewers)(previously Figure 5F, now Figure 5—figure supplement 3B) in mice bearing CCL3/4-secreting tumours on one flank, and non-secreting tumours on the contralateral flank. These experiments showed impaired recruitment of CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> CTLs into CCL3/4-secreting tumours. With these experiments, we aimed to study how T cells and leukocytes in general respond to the CCR5-dependent homotypic signalling axis, and not the CCR5-dependence to elicit such a signal.</p><p>We acknowledge the prior studies that reported potentially homotypic chemokine signalling in secondary lymphoid organs. Here, we demonstrated the action of the CCR5-CCL3/4 signalling circuit in the recruitment of CTLs to tumours, in particular with the 2-step adoptive transfer experiment where a secondary population of non-cognate CTLs homes in a partially CCR5-dependent manner towards tumours containing previously transferred cognate CTLs (new Figure 5E,F). We thank the reviewers for pointing out the papers that highlight the role of the alternate chemokine signalling circuit centred on CXCR3 in T cell antitumour immunity. In the mentioned studies, chemokine receptor-mediated tumour trafficking and infiltration were shown to be dependent on CXCR3 and BLT1/Ltbr4 using a variety of experiments involving adoptive transfer of receptor-deficient CTLs into immune competent or Rag<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice, tumour engraftment of receptor- or chemokine-deficient hosts, and chemokine blockades (Chheda et al., 2016; Chow et al., 2019). In fact, two other publications report similar findings using adoptive transfer models most similar to our experimental design (Mikucki et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2013). Sharma et al., 2013 and Mikucki et al., 2015 showed impaired homing of CXCR3- or BLT1-deficient tumour-experienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that were adoptively transferred into tumour-bearing Rag<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup> hosts compared to WT CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, resulting in impaired tumour clearance. All of these studies used B16 melanoma tumour models. We had carefully selected the EL4 tumour model as these cells do not themselves secrete chemokines that elicit a directional response in CTLs (see Figure 2, Figure 3C-E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 B,C, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 C). In fact, we had considered using the B16 model but when we tested chemokine expression via qPCR, we found that our B16 cancer cells secrete significant levels of chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CXCL9 and CXCL10, and therefore judged that tumour model to be unsuitable to study homotypic recruitment between T cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>mRNA expression levels of various chemokines in B16 tumour cells relative to EL4 tumour cells as measured by qPCR.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56554-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The redundant role of CCR5 in tumour clearance in our model may be due to a switch to alternative receptor-ligand pairs. OT1 CTLs also express CCR1, CCR2, CXCR3, XCR1 and BLT1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and Supplementary file 1), and their ligands may be generated by various stromal or tumour infiltrating cells. Tumour cell lysis may also contribute to the attraction of neutrophils that self-amplify production of LTB4, the BLT1 ligand (Lammermann et al., 2013).</p><p>Furthermore, IFNγ, abundant in inflamed tumours, can induce CXCL9 and CXCL10 secretion in various intermediary cells, including tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells (Dobrzanski, Reome and Dutton, 2001; Gordon-Alonso et al., 2017; Hickman et al., 2015), which may enhance the role of CXCR3 in homing. These points are briefly discussed in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2B) Given the observation of peripheral rimming of T cells in the in vitro studies in the absence of CCL3/4 and invasion with these mediators operative, transcriptomic datasets from human samples that are classified as cold (excluded) and hot (infiltrated) would be useful to probe to see if there is a difference in CCL3/4 mRNA expression in the two cases, and would be even better if this involved single cell work that ascribed production to the CD8 T cells themselves. This would be in silico work to see if the right data sets exist and if mined, show the expected outcome, although it is possible, of course, that no such differences may be identifiable in CCL3/4 expression between hot and cold tumors, which would neither invalidate nor support a potential role played by these chemokines in CD8 T cell swarming in tumours.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this idea, which led us to a number of studies where transcriptomic data from ‘hot’ tumours show significant CCR5 ligand expression, including CCL3 and CCL4, by tumour-infiltrating T cells.</p><p>In a 2015 study, metastatic melanomas from 197 cancer patients were grouped according to low (cold) vs high (hot) expression of T cell signature genes.

In ‘hot’ tumours, infiltrated by T cells, CCL3 and CCL4 expression was strongly associated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Author response image 2). At the single cell level, CCL3 and CCL4 were found to be significantly expressed by tumour-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as by NK cells and macrophages (Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018).</p><p>In an even more recent study of patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in malignant lymph nodes, intratumoural CTLs were specifically found to express CCL4 and CCL5 (both CCR5 ligands) by scRNA-seq (Roider et al., 2020).</p><p>Finally, a report on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients found that hot tumours display significantly higher CTL activity and increased CTL:Treg ratios, as well as upregulation of several chemokines and chemokine receptors, including CCL5 and CCR5 (Chakravarthy et al., 2018).</p><p>Taken together, these reports support a role in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tumour infiltration for CCR5 ligands, produced by both malignant cells and tumour-infiltrating T cells, and which in addition to CCL3 and CCL4 may also include CCL5 in humans. We now cite and discuss the above-mentioned studies in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2C) In the absence of data from additional work as in 2A above, and/or if efforts in 2B above do not show any informative correlation, it is recommended that the paper be re-written to focus on effector CD8 T cells driving concerted recruitment to sites of antigen recognition, with the underlying mechanism carefully documented, and with only the discussion suggesting that this might be a mechanism active in the in vivo tumor setting, making clear that future experiments will show whether this mechanism is indeed prominent in primary tumors in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to revise the text regarding the role of homotypic CTL recruitment towards sites of antigen recognition versus tumour infiltration. In light of the reviewers’ suggestion, and our new data on tumour infiltration and rejection from above, we have elected to err on the side of caution and carefully restrict our language on the homotypic recruitment mechanism to act towards antigen specific targets in general, rather than playing a major role in tumour infiltration in vivo. We specify explicitly what role CCR5-mediated recruitment has in our intravital imaging and in vivo tumour homing experiments, without ascribing the effects to homotypic signalling directly, instead discussing the potential for a contribution of such a direct signalling circuit amongst others. We have already indicated some of these changes above in the context of responses to specific comments on the in vivo work. We have for instance amended the language as follows:</p><p>- In the Abstract, we changed “Thus, CTLs recognising a tumour target can induce a localised mass response by amplifying the direct recruitment of additional T cells independently of other leukocytes” to “Thus, CTLs recognising a cognate target can induce a localised mass response by amplifying the direct recruitment of additional T cells independently of other leukocytes.”</p><p>- In the Introduction, we changed “Furthermore, we show that sustained secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 mediates the swarming behaviour and can promote deep tumour infiltration of primary mouse CTLs” to “Furthermore, we show that local chemokine delivery triggers directed CTL movement through dense tumour tissue in vivo, and sustained secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 from tumours promotes CTL recruitment”.</p><p>- In our multistep recruitment model (Figure 7), we now depict and refer more generally to “cognate targets” or simply “targets” rather than “cognate tumour cells”.</p><p>- In the Discussion section, we state that “it is also evident that CCR5-mediated homotypic recruitment is not the exclusive signalling circuit underpinning tumour infiltration in vivo, and in fact CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> CTLs were not impaired in their ability to clear tumours in mice”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to clarify the results in Figure 2B (right panel) and Figure 2F. In Figure 2B, the exogenously added CTLs exhibit swarming (increased FMI) towards the cognate tumour even in the absence of pre-embedded antigen-specific CTLs. However, in Figure 2F, exogenously added CTLs do not exhibit swarming unless there are pre-embedded antigen-specific CTLs. What is the cause of this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their perceptiveness and for raising the lack of clarity in the difference between the two above-mentioned experiments. In order to keep the volume and density of tumouroids constant, they are always constituted by similar total number of cells, whether they contain tumour cells alone, or a combination of CTLs and tumour cells. In Figure 2F, all tumouroids contain pre-embedded CTLs at a 1:1 ratio with the tumour cells. Hence, these tumouroids contain only half the number of tumour cells compared to the samples of Figure 2B where the tumouroids contain no pre-embedded CTLs. In the short timespans of these experiments (1hour), the probability of surrounding CTLs arriving at the tumouroid via random search, engaging cognate tumour cells and inducing long-range attraction in distant CTLs is evidently diminished when the tumour cells are interspersed with non-tumour reactive CTLs (Figure 2F), compared to scenarios where the tumouroid is entirely made up of cognate tumour cells (fourth from left, Figure 2B). We have now clarified the discrepancy in the figure legend. It should be noted that the experiments of Figure 2F where designed to evaluate whether a pre-embedded CTL population engaging a cognate target can induce the directional recruitment of distant CTLs of different specificities, and not to evaluate whether first arriving randomly searching CTLs can induce directional movement in other CTLs of the same population, an effect appreciable in Figure 2B but best conveyed in the longer time-course experiments with central tumouroids in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “CTL recruitment is driven by secretion of CCL3 and CCL4” – Clarification is required. The authors state &quot;only CCL3 and CCL4 inhibition disrupted CTL transmigration towards cognate supernatants.&quot; However, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1F, CCL4 blocking Abs alone have no effect on transmigration, despite that fact that both CCL3 and CCL4 blocking antibodies are required to block directional migration in Figure 4G. Can the authors provide an explanation for this discrepancy in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this lack of clarity in the text. Migration across transwells (Boyden chambers) towards cognate supernatant was abrogated by CCL3 inhibition but not by CCL4 inhibition (now clarified in the text), whereas migration within 3D collagen gels towards cognate tumoroids was inhibited only when both CCL3 and CCL4 were blocked. The redundant activities of CCL3 and CCL4 is apparent only in the 3D collagen system, which is a more physiological assay than migration across transwells, mainly employed as a screening tool to identify chemokines of interest. CTLs produce about ~2.5 fold more CCL3 than CCL4 during cognate interactions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). In addition, at similar concentrations, CCL3 appears to be more potent than CCL4 in inducing CTL transmigration in transwells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D), which may further account for observed differences between the two systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5F – OT1 WT and OT1 CCR5-/- both exhibit a large increase in recruitment to the tumour when gBT1 cells are pre-transferred. This observation suggests that CCL3 and CCL4 actually play a very minor role in T cell &quot;swarming&quot; in this in vivo system. The authors should alter the wording of the abstract since it currently states that &quot;CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling via the diffusion of secreted chemokines CCL3 and CCL4&quot;. This statement suggests that CCL3/CCL4 play a major role in T cell swarming, but this claim isn't fully supported by the in vivo data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now amended the abstract to state that recruitment through homotypic signalling is only partly mediated by CCL3 and CCL4, to more accurately represent both the in vitro and in vivo data. The sentence now reads: “CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling, in part mediated via the diffusion of chemokines CCL3 and CCL4”. In light of our in vivo findings, we had already stated in the Results section that “Homotypic CTL recruitment via CCR5 is however likely not the only or primary signalling circuit that results in CTL tumour infiltration or clearance”, and in the Discussion section that “the presence of antigen-specific CTLs within a tumour promotes the recruitment of distant CTLs into the tumour in a manner partially dependent on CCR5”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5 and accompanying supplements – The small differences observed between WT and CCR5-/- CTLs in vivo, both in terms of recruitment and tumour killing, could be due to the fact that the authors co-transferred 5x106 of each CTL into recipient mice. This high transfer number may diminish the role of CCR5/CCL3/CCL4 mediated recruitment of CTLs into the tumour in vivo. At the very least, the authors should comment on this issue in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point, which we now comment on in the discussion with relevant references. It is indeed likely that different parameters across tumour models (e.g. numbers of T cells transferred, when they are transferred with respect to tumour engraftment, their state of activation, tumour growth, antigenicity and tumour composition) influence the kinetics of T cell infiltration and tumour clearance, as well as chemokine receptor dependence. We now state in the Results section that “It remains to be explored whether adoptive transfers using lower CTL numbers or earlier following tumour engraftment (Sharma et al., 2013, Chheda et al., 2016) would result in a more dominant role for CCL3 and CCL4-mediated homotypic signalling in recruitment into solid tumours.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5—figure supplement 2 – This figure would be even more convincing if the authors showed the distribution of the WT and CCR5-/- CTLs in a cognate tumour without an exogenous source of CCL3.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of this experiment was to use intravital real-time microscopy to investigate whether long-range, CCR5-dependent CTL recruitment can occur within the dense and complex tissue of real tumours. The acute injection of exogenous CCL3 into the non-cognate tumours allowed us to exert temporal control over the initiation of such a recruitment, and to subsequently compare the dynamics of WT and CCR5<sup>-/-</sup> CTLs. This would not have been feasible in cognate tumour tissue within the time constraints imposed by imaging live animals, because CTLs arrest upon engagement of cognate target cells and demonstrate severely reduced motility, especially during the earlier phases of tumour rejection that we studied (Boissonas et al., 2007).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “CTL recruitment is driven by secretion of CCL3 and CCL4” – Figure 4—figure supplement 4A-C. Overexpression of CCL3/4 in the tumors seems to have no effect (at least statistically) on the recruitment of OT1 CTLs or endogenous CTLS into the tumor in vivo. These observations seem to contradict the main point of the paper. The authors should provide a convincing explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point, which we in fact tried to address since the last submission. In Figure 4—figure supplement 4A a couple of the adoptive transfers had in essence failed, with only very scarce cells found in both contralateral tumours, but we nevertheless included those results for the sake of transparency and completeness. We had since repeated the experiment with 4 additional mice, and have now added these additional data to the figure and performed associated statistical tests, which show that CCL3/4-secreting tumours indeed do recruit more OT1 CTLs than contralateral non-secreting tumours (p=0.0408 for all data, n=10 mice). As to Figure 4—figure supplement 4C, that experiment was performed with only 3 mice in response to a reviewer request to analyse dendritic cell infiltration of the tumours, and given additional capacity in our flow antibody panel, we had also counted endogenous CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. As is evident from the figure, in 2 out of the 3 mice, the CCL3/4-secreting tumours recruited more endogenous CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We have not performed additional repeats of this particular experiment as we believe that the figure is clear even in the absence of the statistics that would accompany a larger cohort study, and combined with the above-mentioned new figure, the data conclusively show that more T cells infiltrate the CCL3/4-secreting tumours.</p></body></sub-article></article>
