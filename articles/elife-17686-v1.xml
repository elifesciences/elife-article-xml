We report here a comprehensive map of neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system that contain the neurotransmitter GABA, revealing twice as many GABA-positive neuron classes as previously reported. We define previously unknown glia-like cells that take up GABA, as well as 'GABA uptake neurons' which do not synthesize GABA but take it up from the extracellular environment, and we map the expression of previously uncharacterized ionotropic GABA receptors. We use the map of GABA-positive neurons for a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulators that define the GABA phenotype. We synthesize our findings of specification of GABAergic neurons with previous reports on the specification of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons into a nervous system-wide regulatory map which defines neurotransmitter specification mechanisms for more than half of all neuron classes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17686.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17686.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitters</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>neuronal differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gendrel</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gendrel</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS039996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gendrel</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobert</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gendrel</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobert</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobert</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37NS039996-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobert</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GABAergic neurons in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been comprehensively mapped allowing analysis of regulatory factors that program GABAergic neuron identity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the days of Ramón y Cajal, the generation of maps of the brain constitutes a central pursuit in the neurosciences. The nervous system of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> constitutes the currently best mapped nervous system. Available <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system maps include a lineage map of all neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sulston, 1983</xref>) and an anatomical map that describes all individual neuron types not just in terms of overall morphology but also synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1986</xref>). One type of map that complements anatomical maps and that is critical to understand neuronal communication is a map that assigns a neurotransmitter identity to all neurons in the nervous system. Comprehensive maps of modulatory, monoaminergic neurons (e.g. serotonergic, dopaminergic) have been known for some time in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>), but comprehensive maps of the most prominent small molecule neurotransmitter systems employed throughout all animal nervous systems – glutamate (Glu), acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA – are only now emerging. We have recently defined the complete set of glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>) and cholinergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>) and in this third neurotransmitter-mapping paper, we describe our analysis of GABA-positive neurons, expanding previous work that had begun to define GABAergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>).</p><p>GABA is a neurotransmitter that is broadly used throughout all vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. In vertebrates, GABA is used as a neurotransmitter by many distinct neuron types throughout the CNS (30–40% of all CNS synapses are thought to be GABAergic; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Docherty et al., 1985</xref>]) and alterations of GABAergic neurotransmission are the cause of a number of neurological diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Webster, 2001</xref>). One intriguing issue, unresolved in vertebrates due to the complexity of their nervous systems, is the cellular source of GABA and the fate of GABA after cellular release. The expression of the biosynthetic enzyme for GABA, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), defines neurons that have the capacity to synthesize GABA, but the existence of plasma membrane transporters for GABA (called GAT) indicates that GABA can also be ‘acquired’ by neurons via transport and not synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou and Danbolt, 2013</xref>). Does GABA uptake merely occur to clear GABA, thereby controlling the duration of a GABAergic signal, or do cells take up GABA to then reemploy it, e.g. by using vesicular GABA transporters (VGAT) to synaptically release GABA? Also, is GABA only taken up by neurons that are innervated by GABA neurons? A precise map of GAD-, GAT- and VGAT-expressing neurons with single neuron resolution would shed light on these issues, but has not yet been produced in vertebrate nervous systems. In this resource paper, we provide such a map in the nematode <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p><p>Previous studies have ascribed a GABAergic neurotransmitter identity to 26 <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, which fall into six anatomically and functionally diverse neuron classes. These numbers amount to less than 10% of all neurons (302 hermaphroditic neurons) and neuron classes (118 anatomically defined neuron classes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McIntire et al., 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schuske et al., 2004</xref>). Not only is this substantially less than the number of neurons that use conventional excitatory neurotransmitters (Glu: 39 classes, ACh: 52 classes; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>]), but, given the abundance of GABAergic interneurons in vertebrates, it is also striking that only one of the previously identified GABA neurons is an interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>). However, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome contains at least seven predicted ionotropic GABA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert, 2013</xref>) and at least some of them are expressed in cells that are not synaptically connected to the previously defined GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beg and Jorgensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jobson et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore suspected that additional GABAergic neurons may have been left undetected. Using a refined GABA antibody staining protocol and improved reporter gene technology, we extend here the original set of six GABA-positive neuron classes by another ten additional GABA-positive cell types, seven of them neuronal cell types.</p><p>Knowledge of the complete and diverse set of neurons sharing the expression of a specific neurotransmitter system allows one to ask how the expression of a shared identity feature is genetically programmed in distinct neuron types. As mentioned above, the usage of GABA as a neurotransmitter represents a unifying terminal identity feature for a diverse set of neurons in invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems. Given the diversity of GABAergic neuron types, it is perhaps not surprising that no unifying theme of GABAergic identity specification has yet been discovered. Nevertheless, while distinct GABAergic neuron types use distinct transcription regulatory codes, some transcription factors appear to be repeatedly used by distinct GABAergic neuron types. For example, in vertebrates, the GATA-type transcription factors GATA2/3 are employed for GABAergic identity specification by midbrain and spinal cord neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). We explore here whether the theme of reemployment of a transcription factor in different GABAergic neurons also exists in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p><p>Another question that pertains to the development of GABAergic neurons relates to the stage at which regulatory factors act to specify GABAergic neurons. Previous studies on the specification of vertebrate GABAergic neurons have so far uncovered factors that act at distinct stages of GABAergic neuron development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achim et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is still a remarkable dearth of knowledge about transcriptional regulators that are expressed throughout the life of GABAergic neurons to not only initiate but also maintain the differentiated state of GABAergic neurons. Such type of late acting transcriptional regulators have previously been called ‘terminal selectors’ and these terminal selectors have been identified to control the identity of distinct neuron types utilizing a variety of distinct neurotransmitter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobert, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2016a</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, previous work has shown that the Pitx2-type transcription factor <italic>unc-30</italic> selectively specifies the identity of D-type motor neurons along the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cinar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eastman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jin et al., 1994</xref>). As a terminal selector of D-type motor neuron identity, UNC-30 protein directly controls the expression of GABA pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eastman et al., 1999</xref>) as well as a plethora of other D-type motor neuron features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cinar et al., 2005</xref>), including their synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Howell et al., 2015</xref>). Since <italic>unc-30</italic> is expressed in non-GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jin et al., 1994</xref>), <italic>unc-30</italic> is not sufficient to induce the GABAergic neuronal identity, possibly because <italic>unc-30</italic> may act with as yet unknown cofactors in the D-type motor neurons. We identify here a putative cofactor for <italic>unc-30</italic> in the form of the <italic>elt-1</italic> gene, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the vertebrate Gata2/3 transcription factors, which specify GABAergic neurons in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The acquisition of GABAergic identity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons other than the D-type GABAergic motor neurons was less well understood. The RIS, AVL and DVB neurons display differentiation defects in animals lacking the <italic>lim-6</italic> homeobox gene, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the vertebrate <italic>Lmx1</italic> LIM homeobox gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hobert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsalik et al., 2003</xref>) and the RME neurons display differentiation defects in animals that either carry a mutation in the <italic>nhr-67</italic> orphan nuclear hormone receptor, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of vertebrate Tlx/NR2E1 gene and the fly gene Tailless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarin et al., 2009</xref>) or in animals lacking <italic>ceh-10,</italic> the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the vertebrate <italic>Vsx/Chx10</italic> Prd-type homeobox gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forrester et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). However, the extent of the differentiation defects in these distinct mutant backgrounds has not been examined in detail. We show here that <italic>nhr-67</italic> controls all GABAergic identity features in the AVL, RIS and RMEL/R and RMED/V motor neurons, where it collaborates with distinct homeobox genes, <italic>lim-6</italic> in AVL and RIS, <italic>ceh-10</italic> in RMED and a novel transcription factor, <italic>tab-1,</italic> the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of vertebrate Bsx, in RMEL/R. We identify additional homeobox genes that control the identity of GABAergic neurons that we newly identify here. Taken together, our systems-wide analysis of GABA-positive cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> identifies a number of distinct GABA-positive cell types that acquire and utilize GABA via diverse mechanisms and provides an extensive picture of the specification of this critical class of neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying GABAergic neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system</title><p>The previously reported set of GABAergic neurons (six neuron classes: RME, AVL, RIS, DVB, DD, VD; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were defined by anti-GABA antibody staining and expression of reporter transgenes that monitor expression of genes that encode the GABA biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD/UNC-25) and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT/UNC-47) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1997</xref>). Using a modified GABA staining protocol, we observed the presence of GABA in the six previously described GABAergic neuron classes RME, AVL, RIS, VD, DD and DVB, but also detected staining in an additional set of seven neuronal cell types (RIB, SMDD/V, AVB, AVA, AVJ, ALA, AVF; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The identity of these GABA-positive neurons was confirmed by GABA-staining of transgenic animals that express cell-type specific markers (data not shown). Staining of these newly identified GABA-positive cells is generally weaker than in the previously identified GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In the vertebrate CNS, distinct GABAergic neuron types also show different levels of anti-GABA staining (J. Huang, pers.comm.). Anti-GABA staining in all cells, including the newly identified cells, is completely abolished in animals lacking the <italic>unc-25</italic> gene which codes GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, thereby corroborating that the staining indeed reports on the presence of GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The same pattern of staining is observed in early larvae and adult worm, with the sole exception of the AVJ neuron pair which stains more strongly in larval compared to adult stages.<table-wrap

For example, spinal cord motor neurons in the rat do not synthesize GABA but take up GABA after its release from presynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Snow et al., 1992</xref>). GABA synthesis is usually examined by analyzing the expression pattern of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), encoded by the <italic>unc-25</italic> gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A previously published reporter transgene for the <italic>unc-25</italic> locus shows expression in the set of previously identified GABA neurons listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jin et al., 1999</xref>). We also detect expression of this previously described reporter in the newly identified GABA-positive RIB interneuron pair but not in any of the other newly identified GABA-positive neurons (data not shown). To test the possibility that the lack of expression in other GABA-positive neurons may be due to missing regulatory elements in the previously described reporter, we inserted a <italic>SL2::gfp</italic> cassette into the endogenous <italic>unc-25</italic> locus using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed expression in the same set of neurons as the previously described reporter transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; more sensitive GFP antibody staining did not reveal additional staining; data not shown). This corroborates the newly identified GABAergic identity of the RIB neuron class, but raises the question how the other newly identified GABA-positive neurons acquire GABA. To further explore this issue, we performed three sets of experiments: (a) we stained, with anti-GABA antibodies, animals that are unable to release GABA because they lack the GABA vesicular transporter VGAT/SLC32, called UNC-47 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McIntire et al., 1997</xref>); (b) we stained, with anti-GABA antibodies, animals that lack the sole ortholog of the GABA uptake transporter GAT/SLC6A1, called SNF-11 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mullen et al., 2006</xref>); and (c) we analyzed the expression pattern of SNF-11/GAT. We find that GABA staining of the ALA and AVF neurons is abolished in either <italic>unc-47</italic> mutants (no GABA release from other neurons) or <italic>snf-11</italic> mutants (no GABA uptake), further corroborating that these neurons do not synthesize their own GABA, but obtain synaptically released GABA by uptake via the plasma membrane transporter SNF-11/GAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In support of this notion, both ALA and AVF express a fosmid-based reporter that we generated for the <italic>snf-11/GAT</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We therefore termed the AVF and ALA neurons ‘GABA uptake neurons’. Within the nervous system, the <italic>snf-11</italic> fosmid-based reporter is also expressed in the previously characterized, GABA-synthesizing RME and AVL neurons, but not the other ‘classic’ GABA-synthesizing RIS, DVB or D-type neurons nor in any other neuron in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17686.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reporter gene constructs recapitulate GABA antibody staining in the nervous system of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GABA synthesis, secretion, uptake and degradation pathway.

According to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> connectivity map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1986</xref>), the unpaired ALA neuron is not a direct postsynaptic target of any GABA-positive neurons. However, as assessed by the examination of electron micrographs produced by White et al., the processes of ALA are directly adjacent to the newly identified GABAergic SMD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1986</xref>) (S. Cook, pers.comm.). This indicates that ALA may absorb GABA released by the SMD neurons, thereby modulating GABA transmission between SMD and its target neurons. Consistent with this notion, we find that prevention of GABA release in <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> mutants results in a considerable increase in GABA staining in the SMDD and SMDV neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The AVF uptake neuron class is located at a different position in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> head ganglia and displays projections very distinct from the ALA neuron. AVF neurons extend processes into the nerve ring, but also into the ventral nerve cord (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wormatlas.org/neurons/Individual%20Neurons/AVFframeset.html">http://wormatlas.org/neurons/Individual%20Neurons/AVFframeset.html</ext-link>) where they may take up GABA from proximal GABAergic D-type motor neurons which populate the nerve cord. To test this notion experimentally, we removed GABA selectively from D-type motor neurons, using the <italic>unc-30</italic> mutant strain in which D-type motor neurons fail to produce GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jin et al., 1994</xref>). In these animals GABA staining in AVF is abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that AVF indeed absorbs GABA from the D-type motor neurons.</p><p>Curiously, GABA staining of the AVA, AVB and AVJ neurons, which fail to detectably express <italic>unc-25/GAD::SL2::gfp</italic>, persists in <italic>snf-11/GAT</italic> mutants (consistent with <italic>snf-11</italic> not being expressed in these neurons). Animals lacking the SLC6A transporter most closely related to <italic>snf-11</italic>, the betaine transporter <italic>snf-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peden et al., 2013</xref>) also still show <italic>unc-25-</italic>dependent GABA staining in AVA, AVB and AVJ (data not shown). These neurons therefore either express very low levels of <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> that are not detectable via <italic>gfp-</italic>tagging of the <italic>unc-25</italic> locus or these neurons employ non-conventional GABA uptake mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>VGAT expression suggests the existence of ‘recycling neurons’ and ‘clearance neurons’</title><p>We next sought to assess which of the GABA-positive neurons have the ability to synaptically release GABA via the canonical vesicular GABA transporter VGAT/UNC-47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McIntire et al., 1997</xref>). To this end, we generated a fosmid-based <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> reporter construct which contains considerably more sequence information than previously described reporter constructs. This reporter shows a much broader pattern of expression compared to the original reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McIntire et al., 1997</xref>); it is expressed in the original set of GABAergic neurons and also in the newly identified GABA-positive ALA, RIB, SMDD and SMDV neurons, suggesting that these neurons not only contain GABA but can also synaptically release it (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We could not detect <italic>unc-47</italic> fosmid reporter expression in the AVF neurons, which do not synthesize but only take up GABA, indicating that these neurons may only function to clear, but not re-release GABA. We cannot exclude the possibility that GABA may be released by non-conventional mechanisms or by other members of the large SLC transporter family encoded by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert, 2013</xref>). We also could not detect <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> in the GABA-positive AVA, AVB and AVJ neurons. These neurons may use other members of the solute carrier family for GABA transport into synaptic vesicles or they may use non-conventional GABA release mechanisms, which are also thought to exist in the vertebrate CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koch and Magnusson, 2009</xref>). For example, the bestrophin ion channel has been shown to mediate GABA release from glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) and there are multiple, uncharacterized bestrophin genes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the above-mentioned GABA-positive cells, the <italic>unc-47</italic> reporter fosmid is expressed in a substantial number of additional neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Since those neurons are not GABA positive, <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> may transport an as yet unknown neurotransmitter in these neurons (perhaps glycine, whose use as a neurotransmitter in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is unresolved; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert et al., 2013</xref>).

One of them (SMDD/V) may synaptically release GABA (based on <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> expression and increased staining in <italic>unc-47(-)</italic> animals), but whether the other neurons (AVA, AVB, AVJ) employ GABA for neurotransmission is presently not clear.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>GABA in non-neuronal cells</title><p>In addition to neuronal staining, we also detected GABA in three classes of non-neuronal cells, the head mesodermal cell (hmc), the glia-like GLR cells and body wall muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The processes of the hmc are in proximity to the processes of a number of GABAergic neurons (RMED/V and D-type motor neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall and Altun, 2007</xref>) and therefore in the proper place to clear GABA. We indeed find that hmc expresses the GABA uptake transporter <italic>snf-11/GAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and that GABA staining of the hmc is abolished in <italic>snf-11/GAT</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We also find that GABA staining in the hmc is reduced in <italic>unc-30</italic> mutants (in which D-type motor neurons fail to be specified; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jin et al., 1994</xref>]), indicating that the sources of GABA in the hmc are indeed the D-type motor neurons. Since we do not detect <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> expression in the hmc, the hmc likely operates as a GABA clearance cell, like the AVF neurons.</p><p>The glia-like GLR cells are another intriguing GABA-positive cell type. GLR cells, which have no assigned function yet, are located directly adjacent to the nerve ring (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormatlas.org/ver1/handbook/mesodermal.htm/glr.htm">http://www.wormatlas.org/ver1/handbook/mesodermal.htm/glr.htm</ext-link>). Each GLR cell extends a thin, sheet-like process that lies inside the nerve ring. Like the AVF and ALA neurons and the non-neuronal hmc, the GLR cells express <italic>snf-11/GAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and GABA-staining is strongly reduced in <italic>snf-11/GAT</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Curiously, staining is still observed in <italic>unc-47/VGAT</italic> mutants. In these mutants, GABA may accumulate in RME neurons which are heavily gap-junctioned with the GLR glia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1986</xref>) and GABA may pass through these gap junctions. The passive transfer of neurotransmitters through gap junctions has been termed ‘neurotransmitter coupling’ and occurs, for example, in the amacrine and bipolar cells of the vertebrate retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vaney et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GABAergic neurons in the male nervous system</title><p>In males, we observed the same set of GABA-positive neurons as observed in hermaphrodites. In addition, GABA staining is observed in one prominent class of male-specific interneurons , the EF neurons, which had previously no neurotransmitter assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The EF1 and EF2 interneurons are located in the dorsorectal ganglion, whereas EF3 and the rarely generated EF4 are in the preanal ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The EF neurons are so-called ‘type II interneurons’, which relay sensory information from male-specific tail sensory structures into the sex-shared nervous system in the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>).

rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). <italic>lgc-36</italic> shows the most restricted expression (only in SABVL/R head motor neurons and a

As expected by their above mentioned genomic organization, <italic>lgc-37</italic> and <italic>gab-1</italic> fosmid reporters are indeed co-expressed in 25 neuron classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). The only neuron where just one of the two fosmid reporters is expressed in, <italic>gab-1</italic>, is the AVE command interneuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). All the regulatory elements for this co-expression appear to be harbored by the shared 5’ intergenic region, since transcriptional reporter fusions that contain only the 5’ intergenic region in either orientation (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) show an expression pattern similar to the fosmid reporter, with the sole exception of the AVE neuron, the only neuron that expresses the <italic>gab-1</italic> fosmid reporter, but not the <italic>lgc-37</italic> fosmid reporter (data not shown). Regulatory elements for AVE expression must therefore resides elsewhere in the <italic>gab-1 </italic>locus.</p><p>The co-expression of <italic>gab-1</italic> and <italic>lgc-37</italic>, as well as other patterns of GABA receptor co-expression (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) suggest that the respective receptors form heteromeric receptors in the respective neuron types. We mapped neurons that express any of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-type receptors onto a matrix of neurons innervated by GABA neurons, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> (and as indicated by blue letter coding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). This expression data provides a possible starting point to disrupt GABAergic signaling in a synapse-specific manner.</p><p>In addition to being expressed in neurons that show anatomic innervation by GABAergic neurons, it is clearly evident that GABA<sub>A</sub>-type receptors are also expressed in neurons that are not anatomically connected to GABA-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>, white labels; all neurons listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). These receptors may simply not function as GABA receptors or, more interestingly, these receptors may mediate GABA spillover transmission, a phenomenon observed in the vertebrate CNS as well as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jobson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rossi and Hamann, 1998</xref>).

Our expression analysis further extends this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>), identifying expression of, for example, several of the GABA receptor-encoding genes in the cholinergic A/B-type neurons that were previously reported to receive spillover GABA signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jobson et al., 2015</xref>). Spillover transmission may even extend into the pharyngeal nervous system, where we detect GABA<sub>A</sub>-type receptor expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), but no GABA staining.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The Tailless/Tlx orphan nuclear receptor NHR-67 controls the GABAergic identity of a diverse set of GABAergic neurons</title><p>We used the expanded map of the GABAergic nervous system as a starting point to elucidate transcriptional regulatory programs that specify GABAergic neuron identity.

Several of the neurons using a fast-acting transmitter also cotransmit a monoamine. For the 14 neuron classes for which no classic neurotransmitter system has been identified so far two scenarios can be envisioned: (1) some of these neurons may be dedicated to the use of neuropeptides, a notion consistent with a preponderance of dark synaptic vesicles and/or paucity of small synaptic vesicles (e.g. BDU, AVH, AVJ, RID); (2) other neurons do contain plenty of conventional small, clear synaptic vesicles (e.g. ASI, AWA, RIR, RMG) and may use presently unknown transmitter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert, 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17686.019</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Neurotransmitter atlas.</title><p>The current status of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurotransmitter atlas is shown.

Only nine neuron classes use GABA for synaptic signaling (based on anti-GABA staining and expression of the vesicular transporter) and of those, only two are pure interneurons (RIS and RIB ring interneurons; since AVB, AVA, AVJ and AVF express no known release machinery, we do not consider them as conventional GABAergic interneurons). Due to their locally restricted projections and connectivity, ring interneurons are the next closest thing to vertebrate GABAergic local inhibitory neurons. Yet only two of the 12 ring interneuron classes (collectively referred to as RI... neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1986</xref>) utilize GABA. We note that <italic>Ascaris suum</italic>, a distantly related, parasitic nematode, appears to display a remarkably similar set of GABA positive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guastella et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>In the complex male-specific tail circuitry, composed of 20 anatomically distinct neuron classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>), GABA is also very sparsely used. Only one out of the 20 neuron classes, the EF neuron class, constitutes a GABA neuron with conventional synthesis and release machinery. EF neurons, which project axons into the nerve ring, mostly innervate sex-shared circuitry, and, therefore, GABA may not to be used for communication among male-specific neurons in the tail at all.</p><p>The paucity of GABA usage contrasts the much broader usage of GABA in the vertebrate CNS, in which 30–40% of all synapses contain GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Docherty et al., 1985</xref>). However, the apparent paucity of GABA usage in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is no reflection of the paucity of inhibitory neurotransmission in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. First, due to the existence of ACh and Glu-gated chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>), GABA is not the only inhibitory neurotransmitter in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Second, while only relatively few neurons are GABA positive, a much larger number of neurons may be responsive to GABA. This can be inferred from the expression patterns of ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub>-type neurotransmitter receptors, which extend beyond the limited number of neurons that are innervated by GABA-positive neurons. Such expression is consistent with wide-spread spillover transmission. However, while spillover transmission definitely does occur in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jobson et al., 2015</xref>), it remains to be experimentally tested whether these GABA receptors indeed engage in GABA spillover transmission. Another indication for wide-spread spillover transmission is the notable restriction of expression of the GABA uptake transporter GAT that was already previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mullen et al., 2006</xref>). In vertebrates, these transporters are expressed widely throughout the CNS, with most GABA-positive neurons also expressing GAT (GAT1 or GAT3); many postsynaptic targets of vertebrate GABAergic neurons also express GAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou and Danbolt, 2013</xref>). In notable contrast, the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> GAT ortholog SNF-11 is only expressed in a small fraction of the GABA-positive neurons and it is only expressed in two types of GABAergic targets cells (AVL as a target of DVB and body wall muscle as targets of D-type motor neurons)(this paper; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mullen et al., 2006</xref>)). We hypothesize that the restricted expression of SNF-11/GAT is a reflection of GABA not being immediately cleared after release, but being able to spill over to signal to non-synaptic targets.</p><p>Some of the GABAergic neurons that we newly identified here cotransmit ACh (one of them, the RIB interneuron only expresses a very low level of the ACh synthesizing and transporting machinery) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>). ACh/GABA-cotransmitting neurons have been observed in multiple neuron types of the vertebrate CNS as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Granger et al., 2016</xref>). Neurons that use two neurotransmitters can, in principle, package both neurotransmitters into the same vesicles or package them separately into spatially segregated presynaptic zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vaaga et al., 2014</xref>). The GABA- and ACh-positive SMD neurons synapse onto two fundamentally distinct cell types – head muscles and a number of distinct inter- and motor neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">White et al., 1986</xref>) and may differentially segregate ACh and GABA to distinct target synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>GABA uptake: GABA recycling and GABA clearance neurons</title><p>Our studies define not only novel GABA-synthesizing and GABA-releasing neurons but also neurons that we term ‘GABA uptake neurons’. The GABA-positive nature of these neurons critically depends on the GABA uptake transporter SNF-11/GAT that is expressed in these neurons. Such GABA uptake neurons also exist in <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guastella and Stretton, 1991</xref>). Based on the expression of the vesicular GABA transporter UNC-47/VGAT, we propose that GABA uptake neurons fall into two categories, ‘GABA recycling neurons’ and ‘GABA clearance neurons’. GABA clearance neurons (the AVF neurons) take up GABA but because these cells do not express the GABA vesicular transporter UNC-47, they do not appear to be capable of re-utilizing GABA, i.e. packaging GABA in synaptic vesicles for re-release (however, we caution that GABA may be released by AVF via non-conventional means, as observed in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koch and Magnusson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2010</xref>]). The axon of AVF extends through the nerve ring and along the ventral nerve cord and AVF may therefore clear GABA released from several different GABAergic neuron types. GABA clearance by AVF may control communication between GABA-releasing neurons and their postsynaptic, GABA receptor-expressing targets. AVF may also restrict and spatially define non-synaptic GABA spillover transmission. Whether analogous GABA clearance neurons exist in the vertebrate CNS is as yet unclear, but it is notable that the vertebrate CNS does contain neurons that do not synthesize GABA but take it up via GAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swan et al., 1994</xref>). However, it is generally assumed that these neurons are postsynaptic to GABAergic neurons and hence, that GABA uptake occurs at the synapse. In contrast, AVF is not a synaptic target of GABAergic neurons.</p><p>Another potential type of GABA uptake neurons not only expresses the GABA uptake transporter GAT, but also expresses the UNC-47/VGAT vesicular transporter. We speculate that these neurons are possible ‘GABA recycling neurons’ that synaptically release GABA after uptake. The ALA neuron class falls into this category. ALA, which extends two processes in the nerve ring, may take up GABA released from any of the GABA-releasing neurons that also extend processes in the nerve ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with SMD neurons being the best candidates due to the direct adjacency of their processes. While we do not have direct evidence that ALA then re-releases GABA, ALA has previously been shown to inhibit the activity of the synaptically connected AVE command interneurons to control locomotory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fry et al., 2014</xref>). Since ALA does not express any other known fast-acting transmitter system, we posit that this inhibitory activity is mediated by GABA released by ALA and perceived by ionotropic GABA receptors expressed in AVE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). GABA uptake by ALA, followed by GABA release may serve to coordinate the activity of GABAergic neurons in the nerve ring (e.g. SMDs) with ALA and AVE and eventually locomotory activity. While further studies are required to test the concept of ‘GABA recycling neurons’ in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we note an interesting precedent of GABA recycling in the vertebrate CNS. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons do not synthesize GABA, but take it up via the GABA transporters GAT1 and GAT4 and then release GABA to inhibit postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2014</xref>).</p><p>We also discovered a group of unusual GABA-positive neurons, the AVA, AVB, AVJ head interneurons. These cells express low but clearly detectable levels of GABA and require <italic>unc-25/GAD</italic> for their GABA staining. However, these neurons fail to express the vesicular transporter UNC-47 or the GABA uptake transporter SNF-11 (which, in other systems is sometimes used to release GABA, rather than take up GABA). Their GABA-positive nature does not depend on SNF-11 and, under the perhaps incorrect assumption that no other transporter can uptake GABA, these neurons therefore do not serve to clear GABA. Since these neurons do not express known transporters to release GABA, they may either employ non-conventional release mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koch and Magnusson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) or may simply not engage in GABA signaling at all.</p><p>In conclusion, the extent to which GABA recycling or GABA clearance neurons exist in the vertebrate CNS remains unclear but we have used here the simplicity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system to precisely define the set of GABA synthesizing and GABA uptake neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Remarkable conservation of GABA receptor organization</title><p>The previous genome sequence analysis has revealed a remarkable conservation in the organization of GABA receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darlison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>). In all species examined, GABA receptor genes are located in genomic clusters. Based on the patterns of clustering, the existence of an ‘ancient’ cluster of GABA receptors has been proposed which then duplicated multiple times in vertebrates. One component of this cluster is the genes that code for alpha and beta subunit GABA receptors, the two obligatory subunits of a functional GABA receptor. Intriguingly, these two subunits are always located in a head-to-head manner throughout all animal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darlison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that alpha and beta genes share the same regulatory elements to be expressed in the same neuron types. However, this notion has not been examined in a nervous system-wide manner with single cell resolution. Our reporter gene analysis provides exactly that confirmation. Based on fosmid-based transgenes we find that the head-to-head organized <italic>gab-1</italic> and <italic>lgc-37</italic> genes are indeed co-expressed. Reporter gene fusions in which we examined the regulatory content of the intergenic region of <italic>gab-1</italic> and <italic>lgc-37</italic> in each orientation showed that this co-expression is indeed ensured by the same <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory control elements essentially operating in two different orientations. In the context of neurotransmission, we are only aware of one other case of such remarkably conserved genomic linkage; in this case, the enzyme for ACh synthesis and the vesicular transporter of ACh are located adjacent to one another and share the same first exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfonso et al., 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>GABA in non-neuronal cells</title><p>Apart from the easily explicable detection of GABA in muscle cells, the targets of the largest class of GABAergic motor neurons, we detected GABA in two intriguing and unexpected non-neuronal cell types, the unusual hmc and the glia-like GLR cells. Both cell types may operate in GABA clearance. In vertebrates, some glial cell types are thought to employ GABA as a ‘gliotransmitter’, releasing GABA via a reversal of the plasma membrane GABA transporter GAT-1 to signal to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barakat and Bordey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koch and Magnusson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoon and Lee, 2014</xref>).

Transcription factors that control the expression of distinct terminal identity features have been termed ‘terminal selectors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobert, 2008</xref>) and much of the data shown here support the terminal selector concept.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A cellular and regulatory map of the GABAergic nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kang Shen as the Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. Two of the three reviewers have agreed to reveal their identities: Piali Sengupta (Reviewer #1) and David M. Miller III (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers thought that it is an excellent addition to the set of papers from the Hobert and other labs describing the classical neurotransmitter and peptidergic maps in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Specific results that substantially expand our knowledge include the discovery of several additional GABA+ neurons that had not been previously reported and the novel finding of GABA+ glial cells. Transcription factors with necessary roles in the differentiation of specific GABA neurons are validated with genetic mutants, some of which were generated in this study. Together with the known anatomical connectivity, complete knowledge of the detailed transmitter expression patterns will be extremely useful in ultimately describing a functional connectivity map in this organism.</p><p>The reviewers did raise several points that are worth discussing:</p><p>1) Although the conserved enzyme UNC-25/GAD is necessary for GABA synthesis in most GABAergic neurons, a recent study determined that GABA can also be synthesized in the mammalian CNS from the polyamine putrescine by the successive action of the enzymes diamino oxidase (DAO) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ALDH) (Kim et al., 2015). Because this pathway is evolutionarily ancient with its initial discovery in plants, it offers a plausible explanation for the detection of GABA in the nematode neurons reported in this work that do not express UNC-25/GAD. Indeed, the putrescine pathway might explain the origin of GABA in neurons listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> that express neither <italic>unc-25</italic> nor the GABA uptake transporter, SNF-11 (e.g., SMDD).</p><p>Recent work, has also reported GABA release from dopaminergic neurons that depends on a vesicular monamine transporter, VMAT2, rather than VGAT/UNC-47 (Tritsch, Ding, &amp; Sabatini, 2012). The question then is whether VMAT/CAT-1 is expressed in GABA+ neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) that are negative for UNC-47 (e.g., AVA). This consideration is important because it suggests the possibility that this subset of neurons could actually modulate neuronal function by releasing GABA. At the very least, the authors should acknowledge these caveats in the Discussion.</p><p>Kim, J.-I., Ganesan, S., Luo, S.X., Wu, Y.-W., Park, E., Huang, E.J., Chen, L., and Ding, J.B. (2015). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 mediates a GABA synthesis pathway in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Science 350, 102-106.</p><p>Tritsch, N.X., Ding, J.B., and Sabatini, B.L. (2012). Dopaminergic neurons inhibit striatal output through non-canonical release of GABA. Nature 490, 262-266.</p><p>2) The paper assumes all expression is functional. Thus, if GABA is present in a neuron, there must be some functional role for this presence. In contrast, without selective pressure against its presence, many non-functional expression of proteins exist. Indeed, evolution requires some of these redundancies since, for example it is difficult to co-evolve release and receptor in one step.</p><p>In particular, the presence of GABA-A receptors in neurons that do not have GABA inputs is not 'evidence' for spillover transmission. Similarly, the presence of GABA in neurons that do not have the GABA transporter is not 'evidence' for unconventional GABA release mechanisms. It seems more likely that these two are examples of non-functional expression that is not selected against.</p><p>As stated in the text and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, the reporter for VGAT/UNC47 is present in many neurons that are not positive for GABA. A suggestion is made that in these neurons VGAT may transport an as yet unknown transmitter. This is a reasonable hypothesis, but it also suggests that in the absence of GAD, assuming that GABA immunoreactivity + VGAT necessarily indicates release of GABA may be an overstatement, without additional data that these neurons release GABA.</p><p>There are many transporters in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome and it is difficult to know with certainty that no other transporter can transport GABA. This should be a caveat of the assumption that neurons lacking SNF-11 generate their own GABA, despite being not positive for the GAD enzyme. While it is a possibility that this reporter is not complete, it is also possible that other transporters exist that can transport GABA. This should be acknowledged.</p><p>Our suggestion is to call those neurons &quot;putative GABAergic neurons&quot; in the title and throughout the manuscript, and to discuss these possibilities in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17686.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers did raise several points that are worth discussing:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Although the conserved enzyme UNC-25/GAD is necessary for GABA synthesis in most GABAergic neurons, a recent study determined that GABA can also be synthesized in the mammalian CNS from the polyamine putrescine by the successive action of the enzymes diamino oxidase (DAO) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ALDH) (Kim et al., 2015).

It seems more likely that these two are examples of non-functional expression that is not selected against.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree. In as far as GABA presence goes (particularly in the “unusual” neurons that don't have UNC-47), we do say “…whether and how they employ GABA for signaling is presently not clear” and “…may simply not engage in GABA signaling at all”. Regarding the GABA receptors and spill-over transmission, yes, we need to be more careful. We now state “These receptors may simply not function as GABA receptors or, more interestingly, these receptors may mediate GABA spillover transmission, a phenomenon observed in the vertebrate CNS as well as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>” and, in the Discussion, we reworded our conclusions to state: “…it remains to be experimentally tested whether these GABA receptors indeed engage in GABA spillover transmission.”</p><p><italic>As stated in the text and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, the reporter for VGAT/UNC47 is present in many neurons that are not positive for GABA. A suggestion is made that in these neurons VGAT may transport an as yet unknown transmitter. This is a reasonable hypothesis, but it also suggests that in the absence of GAD, assuming that GABA immunoreactivity + VGAT necessarily indicates release of GABA may be an overstatement, without additional data that these neurons release GABA.</italic></p><p>Also completely agree. We reworded a sentence to now make clear that VGAT expression only “suggests” GABA release: “…suggesting that these neurons not only contain GABA but can also synaptically release it”. We actually now also qualified our statement that UNC-47 may act as a transporter for other transmitters (which is still possible): that’s because the protein that traffics UNC-47 to synaptic vesicles (UNC-46) is <italic>not</italic> expressed in most of the “new” UNC-47(+) neurons. UNC-47 may have non-vesicular functions in these cells. We now mention this in the subsection “2 VGAT expression suggests the existence of ‘recycling neurons’ and ‘clearance neurons’”.</p><p><italic>There are many transporters in the C. elegans genome and it is difficult to know with certainty that no other transporter can transport GABA. This should be a caveat of the assumption that neurons lacking SNF-11 generate their own GABA, despite being not positive for the GAD enzyme. While it is a possibility that this reporter is not complete, it is also possible that other transporters exist that can transport GABA. This should be acknowledged.</italic> </p><p>Yes, good point, similar to the point above, on alternative VGATs. We have actually now also tested the transporter most closely related to SNF-11, called SNF-3, a validated betaine transporter. We do not see any effect on GABA staining in <italic>snf-3</italic> null mutants.</p><p><italic>Our suggestion is to call those neurons &quot;putative GABAergic neurons&quot; in the title and throughout the manuscript, and to discuss these possibilities in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We beg to differ on this point. We completely agree that we do not know whether GABA is indeed employed by some neurons – but we do not believe that proof of GABA release/usage is a reasonable criterion to call a neuron GABAergic. By this criterion most GABAergic neurons in the vertebrate nervous system would need to be called “putative”. In fact, by this criterion even some of “classic” GABAergic neurons would have to be called “putative” (e.g. the known function of RIS does not require GABA). At this point, we consider it more useful to call any neuron “GABAergic” that stains positive for GABA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
