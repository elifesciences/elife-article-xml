as an intermediate in active DNA demethylation is incomplete. We report high-resolution mapping of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, chromatin accessibility, and histone marks in developing postmitotic Purkinje cells (PCs) in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. Our data reveal new relationships between PC transcriptional and epigenetic programs, and identify a class of genes that lose both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC during terminal differentiation. Deletion of the 5hmC writers Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 from postmitotic PCs prevents loss of 5mC and 5hmC in regulatory domains and gene bodies, and hinders transcriptional and epigenetic developmental transitions. Our data demonstrate that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in vivo, and that acquisition of the precise molecular properties of adult PCs require continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC during the final phases of differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>At birth, the mammalian brain contains tens of billions of neurons. Although the number does not increase much as the animal grows, there are many dramatic changes to their size and structure. These changes allow the neurons to communicate with one another, develop into networks, and learn the tasks of the adult brain. One way that these changes occur is by the accumulation of chemical marks on each neuron’s DNA that help dictate which genes switch on, and which turn off.</p><p>One of the most common ways that DNA can be marked is through the addition of a chemical group called a methyl group to one of the four DNA bases, cytosine. This process is called methylation. When methylation occurs, cytosine becomes 5-methylcytosine, or 5mC for short.</p><p>In 2009, researchers found another modification present in the DNA in the brain: 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, or 5hmC. This modification appears when a group of proteins called the Tet hydroxylases turn 5mC into 5hmC. Converting 5mC to 5hmC normally helps cells remove marks on their DNA before they divide and expand. This is important because the newly generated cells need to be able to accumulate their own methylation marks to perform their roles properly. However, neurons in the brain accumulate 5hmC after birth, when the cells are no longer dividing, indicating that 5hmC may be required for the neurons to mature.</p><p>Stoyanova et al. set out to determine whether mouse neurons need 5hmC to get their adult characteristics by tracking the chemical changes that occur in DNA from birth to adulthood. Some of the mice they tested produced 5hmC normally, while others lacked the genes necessary to make the Tet proteins in a specific class of neurons, preventing them from converting 5mC to 5hmC as they differentiate. The results reveal that neurons do not mature properly if 5hmC is not produced continuously following the first week of life. This is because neurons need to have the right genes switched on and off to differentiate correctly, and this only happens when 5hmC accumulates in some genes, while 5hmC and 5mC are removed from others. The data highlight the role of the Tet proteins, which convert 5mC into 5hmC, in preparing the marks for removal and demonstrate that active removal of these marks is essential for neuronal differentiation.</p><p>Given the role of 5hmC in the development of neurons, it is possible that problems in this system could contribute to brain disorders. Further studies aimed at understanding how cells control 5hmC levels could lead to new ways to improve brain health. Research has also shown that if dividing cells lose the ability to make 5hmC, they can become cancerous. Future work could explain more about how and why this happens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>5-hydroxymethylcytosine</kwd><kwd>DNA demethylation</kwd><kwd>TET proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 CA210043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Anjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>5-Hydroxymethylcytosine-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in postmitotic neurons, and is required for their terminal differentiation and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of the mammalian brain requires generation of hundreds of millions of neuronal progenitors that differentiate into distinct cell types with refined functional properties. Although morphological and physiological maturation of most neurons occurs between mid-gestation and a few months or years after birth, the vast majority of CNS neurons must maintain a stable differentiated state for the life of the organism and remain sufficiently plastic to participate in novel behaviors. Studies of signaling molecules and transcriptional programs have identified many mechanisms that orchestrate critical steps in neurogenesis, cell type diversification, neuronal migration, axonal pathfinding, and differentiation. Although it has been established that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are critical for proper development of all cell types, our knowledge of the precise roles of these mechanisms in neuronal differentiation, function, and vitality remains rudimentary.</p><p>5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is produced from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by the Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (Tet1, Tet2, Tet3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). It is present at approximately 10-fold higher levels in neurons than peripheral cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Globisch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>), and its distribution across the genome of adult neurons is cell specific and correlated with active gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Szulwach et al., 2011</xref>). The initial discovery that 5hmC accumulates within active gene bodies, coupled with the discovery that MeCP2 can bind probes containing 5hmC with high affinity, led to the proposal that MeCP2 binding within active genes facilitates their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies demonstrating that MeCP2 binds 5hmC at high affinity in non-CG dinucleotides but does not bind to 5hmCG overturned this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayata, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>) by revealing that accumulation of 5hmCG and the depletion of 5hmCH in gene bodies is correlated with less MeCP2 binding and increased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayata, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>). Imaging of the binding and diffusion of single MeCP2 molecules in living neurons lacking Dnmt3a or Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 demonstrate that its binding is exquisitely sensitive to the levels of both 5mC and 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Piccolo et al., 2019</xref>). Given these data and the sensitivity of neuronal function to MeCP2 gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nan and Bird, 2001</xref>), relief of the repressive functions of MeCP2 through Tet-mediated conversion of high-affinity 5mCG-binding sites to low-affinity 5hmCG sites, which we have referred to as functional demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>), provides an important mechanism for modulation of chromatin structure and transcription.</p><p>In dividing cells, 5hmC serves as an intermediate in DNA demethylation because maintenance DNA methyltransferases do not recognize hemi-hydroxymethylated cytosines in order to reestablish methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu and Zhang, 2017</xref>). Consequently, 5hmC is lost passively and replaced by C due to replicative dilution. Loss of function studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawlaty et al., 2013</xref>) and lymphocyte lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lio and Rao, 2019</xref> have demonstrated that the role of Tet-mediated replicative DNA demethylation is to provide full accessibility to regulatory regions necessary for expression of genes required for differentiation. For example, at the activation-induced deaminase (AID) locus in B cells, Tet activity is required for demethylation and activation of enhancer regions that modulate AID expression to enable class switch recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lio et al., 2019</xref>). Tet-mediated replication-dependent passive demethylation is thought to be common in many dividing cell types, including progenitor cells in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacArthur and Dawlaty, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Most neurons exit the cell cycle during mid-gestation and remain relatively simple and undifferentiated until birth. Following parturition, they initiate an elaborate program of differentiation that includes dramatic increases in size, morphological complexity, and connectivity. Since these neurons are postmitotic and remain so throughout life, removal of the repressive effects of 5mC by passive demethylation cannot occur. However, in addition to functional demethylation and passive demethylation, a third pathway for DNA demethylation, often referred to as active demethylation, has been proposed based on the finding that 5hmC can be further oxidized by Tet proteins to produce 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Removal of 5fC and 5caC by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG)-dependent base excision repair (BER) provides another mechanism for 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2011</xref>). Clear evidence that this pathway can operate in cultured cells has been presented, and detailed biochemical studies have delineated the mechanisms operating in TDG-BER DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Active DNA demethylation is ideally suited for remodeling DNA methylation in postmitotic neurons.</p><p>Evidence that continued accumulation of 5hmC is required in differentiating neurons and that it can participate in active demethylation in vivo is beginning to emerge. In studies of cerebellar granule cell development in ESC-derived GC cultures, primary GC cultures, and slice preparations, manipulations of Tet activity and 5hmC levels provide strong evidence that 5hmC is required for expression of axon guidance and ion channel genes, and that proper development of the GC dendritic arbor requires 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Demethylation of 5hmC-GFP transfected DNA fragments retrieved after several days in culture display reduced 5hmC levels at several sites as assessed by bisulfite sequencing (BSSeq) in HEK 293 cells and primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). Changes in methylation levels at GGCC sites in the genome of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons in response to electroconvulsive shock have been documented using the methylation-sensitive cut counting method that employs the methylation or hydroxymethylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and its methylation-insensitive isoschizomer Msp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). Global measurements of 5mC and 5hmC by mass spectroscopy in the hippocampus have shown that both decrease in response to the induction of seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaas et al., 2013</xref>). And in germline Tet1 knockout mice, analysis of the Npas4 and c-Fos promoters has shown that Tet1 is required for their proper regulation in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudenko et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these observations, our knowledge of the roles of continued 5hmC accumulation in active DNA demethylation and postmitotic differentiation remains rudimentary.</p><p>We report here single nucleotide resolution studies of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, transcription, chromatin accessibility, and H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks in postmitotic, differentiating Purkinje cells (PCs). As PCs transition from relatively small, multipolar immature cells to fully elaborated large neurons with complex dendritic arbors and hundreds of thousands of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKay and Turner, 2005</xref>), 5hmC continues to accumulate, and DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation are reconfigured as epigenetic and transcriptional programs progress. Our data confirm previous studies of the relationships between transcription, DNA methylation, DNA hydroxymethylation, and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsagaratou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsagaratou et al., 2014</xref>), and they reveal several novel modes of transcriptional activation and repression. Notably, we identify a class of developmentally induced PC-specific genes that are highly expressed and lose both 5mC and 5hmC in the final stages of PC differentiation.</p><p>We report also studies of newly generated <italic>Tet1</italic>, <italic>Tet2</italic>, <italic>Tet3</italic> PC-specific triple knockout (Pcp2TetTKO) mouse lines in which recombination is activated in the first postnatal week. These data demonstrate that postmitotic transcriptional and epigenetic maturation in PCs, including transcription of many ion channels and active demethylation of late expressed genes, requires continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC. Taken together, our data demonstrate that active demethylation occurs in select genes in postmitotic neurons, and that 5hmC plays an essential role in refining the transcriptional and epigenetic status of PCs during the final stages of differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In mice, PC progenitors complete their final cell cycle between e10.5 and e13.5 within the ventricular zone of the developing cerebellar anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leto et al., 2016</xref>).

To characterize 5hmC accumulation, transcription and chromatin organization during their postmitotic development, we chose to analyze PCs at the start of their accelerated differentiation (P0), during their rapid phase of morphological development (P7) and as fully mature, differentiated neurons (adult) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). We employed fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) to purify Itpr1-positive PC nuclei in two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, Figure S1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Since PCs are extremely rare and difficult to isolate, we optimized low input protocols for genomic profiling. We used ~20,000 nuclei for transcriptional profiling, ~200,000 nuclei for BSSeq and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (OxBSSeq), 25,000 nuclei for the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATACSeq), and 25,000 nuclei for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPSeq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Analysis of biological replicates for each of the assays revealed that the sorted nuclei expressed markers of Purkinje neurons, and did not express genes marking the two most abundant cerebellar cell types, granule cells and glia (Figure S1B). The Pearson correlation coefficients between each replicate at all timepoints and techniques (RNASeq, OxBSSeq, ATACSeq, and ChIPSeq) were high (over 0.9), establishing that our data are reproducible and of very high quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>).

Given the distinct functions of these two modifications, analysis of their separate contributions to epigenetic regulation of the genome is more informative than BSSeq alone. For example, in many genes, 5mCG is depleted and 5hmCG accumulates in the gene body as its expression increases between P0 and adult. This is clearly evident for the gene encoding the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (<italic>Prkg1</italic>), whose expression in PCs has been shown to be essential for long-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feil et al., 2003</xref>).

As they begin the second postnatal week (P7), PCs undergo an important developmental transition that includes refinement of their climbing fiber input, formation of many thousands of parallel fiber synapses, and myelination of their axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKay and Turner, 2005</xref>). The tremendous increase in synaptogenesis and connectivity continues until PCs attain their mature morphology and functions at 3–4 weeks of age.

As previously reported for other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mo et al., 2015</xref>), there is a second class of silent genes in PCs that are enriched in transcription factors expressed in very early embryos (Hox clusters, other homeobox genes, etc.).

Furthermore, 5hmCG accumulated over the genes bodies early in development is stable or continues to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the presence of 5hmCG is not sufficient to maintain transcription. Interestingly, analysis of the repressive marks 5mCH and 5hmCH reveals at least two distinctly recognizable epigenetic patterns in genes that become repressed in PC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-G</xref>). Repressed genes that accumulate 5mCH and 5hmCH over their gene bodies (referred to as ‘highCHmod’ genes) are associated with lower promoter accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and enhanced accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) of H3K27me3 relative to those repressed genes with low levels of CH modification (referred to as ‘lowCHmod’ genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-G</xref>).

In these genes, the timing of changes in DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and dynamic histone marks varies from gene to gene, but the overall progression of events associated with their expression is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At birth, these genes are actively transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), 5hmCG is enriched in the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and 5mCG is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), their promoters are accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and H3K4me3 is present over their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These epigenetic properties resemble moderately expressed genes in many cell types. As differentiation proceeds and transcription increases, there is a gradual decrease in both 5mCG, 5hmCG, and H3K27me3 histone marks, and ATAC accessibility and H4K4me3 marks spread from the promoter into the gene body. To further support these data, we have included analysis of independent BSSeq experiments that detect the combined levels of 5mC and 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, BSSeq). These data also reveal that hypo-DMRs (differentially methylated regions) present at P0 expand and fuse as PCs lose both methylation and hydroxymethylation to form the very large DMRs that are characteristics of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, hypo-DMR track). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I-K</xref>, quantitation of these features demonstrates that that loss of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation occurs over the entire gene body for these genes as H3K4me3 activating histone marks accumulate and ATAC accessibility increases.</p><p>Interestingly, many of the active genes associated with broad DMVs are PC-specific and highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Although our mass spectroscopic analysis of genomic DNA from differentiating PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L</xref>) failed to detect 5fC or 5caC, their involvement as transient intermediates in the loss of 5mC and 5hmC cannot be ruled out because the small fraction of the genome covered by this gene class may preclude their detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Loss of 5mC and 5hmC in putative regulatory sites during PC differentiation</title><p>Previous studies of enhancers and other regulatory sites have established that their activation is accompanied by increased ATAC accessibility and loss of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lio et al., 2016</xref>).

Those that became more accessible between P0 and adult (log2 fold change &gt;4) experienced a ‘gain’ and those whose accessibility diminished during this time are characterized by a ‘loss’. As anticipated, those ATAC peaks that gain accessibility lose both 5hmC and 5mC as cells progress from P0 to adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>, Gain section) whereas no significant changes in methylation at ATAC peak centers occur in sites that lose accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>, Loss section).

These findings are consistent with prior studies indicating that enhancer activation is accompanied by enhanced ATAC accessibility and DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lio et al., 2016</xref>).

To determine whether disruption of ongoing 5hmC accumulation in postmitotic PCs results in altered transcriptional regulation despite the inability to utilize passive DNA demethylation as a regulatory mechanism, we compared the transcriptome of adult Pcp2TetTKO mice with floxed Cre-negative littermates (WT). Using p &lt; 0.05, log2 fold change of &gt;0.5 in either direction to filter these data, we identified 721 genes whose transcription increases in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs and 548 genes with decreased levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E-F</xref>). The large number of genes whose expression is impacted in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs is reminiscent of magnitude of changes documented in neurons in response to loss of MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>) and other proteins involved nuclear organization and chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyun et al., 2017</xref>). GO analysis of these two classes of genes revealed differences in the biological categories represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). It is noteworthy that genes whose expression increases in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs are enriched for functions involved in terminal developmental events such as cell projection organization, synaptic transmission, and neuron differentiation. These include many ion channels, and receptors that should impact the fine-tuned physiology of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>, dark blue dots, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), although given the complex firing patterns and action potential (AP) waveforms characteristic of PCs, it is difficult to predict the functional consequences of these changes. In contrast, genes whose expression is less in Pcp2TetTKO PCs are primarily involved in homeostasis and metabolic control. These are enriched in DNA transmembrane receptors and nucleic acid-binding proteins that may help regulate PC metabolism in response to external signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>DNA demethylation in postmitotic PCs requires 5hmC</title><p>To assess the loss of 5mC and 5hmC in differentiating PCs reflects a direct role of TET proteins in transcriptional regulation as a consequence of loss of 5mC in enhancers, promoters, and gene bodies, we first identified candidate regulatory domains by comparative analysis of P0 and adult ATACSeq data to detect changes in chromatin accessibility that occur during PC differentiation. We then focused on those regions associated with genes that are transcriptionally impacted in the Pcp2TetTKO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, PC regulatory sites that become more accessible as differentiation proceeds lose both 5mCG and 5hmCG between P7 and adult whether their expression increases or decreases in the Pcp2TetTKO cells. The increased 5mCG and 5hmCG evident over these sites in the Pcp2TetTKO relative to WT PCs indicates clearly that loss of both 5mCG and 5hmCG at these sites requires continued Tet oxidase activity.</p><p>The requirement for continued 5hmC production in DNA demethylation is particularly evident from analysis of those very highly expressed genes that lose both 5mCG and 5hmCG over the gene body as differentiation proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Genes with very large DMVs that are acquired early in development, for example, Hox cluster genes and Calb1, are not impacted in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). This is expected because DNA demethylation for these genes is evident before recombination and loss of Tet oxidase function occurs in the Pcp2TetTKO lines at approximately postnatal day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). In contrast, for those genes that acquire large DMVs between P7 and adult, for example <italic>Gpr63</italic> and <italic>Grid2</italic>, the loss of DNA methylation that is required for formation of the DMVs is strongly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). As shown in the metagene plots of DNA displaying 5mCG and 5hmCG levels of this class of genes over the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, right panel), the loss of both 5mCG and 5hmCG that occurs between P7 and adult is strongly impacted. Thus, the low levels of 5hmCG and 5mCG characteristic of this class of genes is not attained in the absence of Tet oxidase activity.</p><p>Formation of large DMVs in PC genes differs in detail depending on the timing and rate of transcription and the size of the gene. <italic>Gpr63</italic> is strongly activated during postnatal life to become one of the most actively transcribed genes in adult PCs and it becomes nearly completely demethylated over the entire 46 kb of its gene body. <italic>Grid2</italic> is a very long gene (~1.44 Mb) whose transcription also increases as differentiation proceeds. The <italic>Grid2</italic> DMV also fails to develop fully in the Pcp2TetTKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In this case, the large DMV develops over only the promoter and initial 5’ region of the gene. In these two cases, and in other genes of this class, the growth of the DMV is preceded by the accumulation of 5hmC, DNA demethylation is initiated at the 5’ end of the gene, and it spreads toward the 3’ end as differentiation proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). To understand better this variation in DNA demethylation in individual genes, we calculated the difference in the length of large DMVs over each gene in this class in the WT and Pcp2TetTKO PCs, and plotted these values as the negative length change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G, H</xref>). These data revealed a large variation in the length of the DMV that does not form in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs. We believe this reflects a complex relationship between the timing at which transcription is initiated, the rate of transcription over the entire gene body, the local activity of Tet oxidase within the gene as differentiation proceeds, and the timing of Tet oxidase loss from each cell following recombination at the <italic>Tet1</italic>, <italic>Tet2</italic>, and <italic>Tet3</italic> loci.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of DNA methylation occurs over specific subsets of regulatory sites and transcription units in postmitotic Purkinje neurons. This loss of 5mCG requires continued production of 5hmC by Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3. The simplest interpretation of these data is that Tet-mediated active demethylation can occur in neurons as a result of continued oxidation of 5hmC to 5fC and 5caC, followed by their removal through the BER pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since the discoveries that 5hmC is present at high levels in mammalian neuronal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>) and that it is produced from 5mC by the Tet oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>), its possible roles as a stable epigenetic mark and as an intermediate in DNA demethylation have been intensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu and Zhang, 2017</xref>). The present study adds to a growing body of work demonstrating that 5hmC plays a critical role in development and function of the nervous system. A central finding of this study is that continued Tet activity and 5hmC accumulation during PC differentiation is necessary for acquisition of their refined transcriptional and epigenetic properties. It is noteworthy that these phenotypes are evident despite loss of Tet function in the Pcp2TetTKO late in PC differentiation. It seems likely based on these findings and the gradual accumulation of 5hmC evident in our data that there is a continual requirement for 5hmC as a driver for epigenetic remodeling in most differentiating, postmitotic neurons. Although studies of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), and embryonic brain development have suggested that 5hmC plays a significant role in neural progenitors and developing granule cells, a continual requirement for 5hmC may be particularly important for PCs, pyramidal cells, and other long range projection neurons whose differentiation program includes postmitotic development of sophisticated morphological features and abundant synapses.</p><p>A second principle that has emerged from our studies is that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation occurs in postmitotic neurons. Our finding that loss of both 5mC and 5hmC in a specific subset of highly expressed gene bodies and ATAC accessible regulatory sites requires Tet oxidase activity provides critical in vivo evidence supporting studies in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2016</xref>) and in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2011</xref>) that have defined this pathway. For some genes (<italic>Gpr63</italic>, <italic>Grid2</italic>) the progression toward loss of modified C is easily appreciated. In these cases, conversion of 5mCG to 5hmCG over the gene body is clearly evident between P0 and P7, and continued Tet activity is required to remove both residual 5mCG and 5hmCG to result in DNA demethylation in the adult. Although we have been unable to detect 5fC and 5caC as transient intermediates in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1L</xref>), this is not surprising given the very small fraction of the PC genome that undergoes active DNA demethylation and the small amounts of genomic DNA that can be obtained from this very rare cell population. Identification of additional components of the of the DNA demethylation pathway that is occurring in PCs will require further genetic studies disrupting candidate genes in the TDG-BER pathway. Since important non-cell autonomous events are required for PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leto et al., 2016</xref>), we believe that additional PC-specific knockouts that are restricted to postmitotic cells will be most informative.</p><p>An important question arising from these findings is which cells in the nervous system require Tet-dependent active DNA demethylation to complete their developmental programs. Given these data, it seems likely other large neurons with complex and prolonged postmitotic differentiation programs share this requirement. Furthermore, reports that remodeling of DNA methylation may occur in response to a wide variety of stimuli in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudenko et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that additional studies of Pcp2TetTKO and other precisely constructed mouse models will help elucidate possible functions of 5hmC in neuronal plasticity.</p><p>A third advance reported here is the collection of very high-resolution data to understand details of the relationships between DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin organization in a single complex neuronal cell type as it develops from a primitive neuronal precursor to a fully articulated adult neuron. These data have highlighted several features of epigenetic development that remain to be explored including the definition of two distinct relationships between non-CG DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and transcriptional repression, and the mechanism for selection of specific genes as substrates for active DNA demethylation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that disruption of continued 5hmC formation in the Pcp2TetTKO postmitotic PCs leads to altered transcription of late expressed genes, including a set of ion channels that may be responsible for refining their adult electrophysiological properties.</p><p>Although our data reinforce prior studies of the general relationships between DNA methylation, transcription, and chromatin structure, we note that there are many exceptions that require further investigation. One intriguing example is the very different relationships between genes and de novo methylation in CG and non-CG contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2013</xref>). In PCs, as in other neurons, substantial enrichment of 5hmCG relative to its general accumulation genome wide occurs in active transcription units, suggesting a mechanism that targets Tet activity to these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While accumulation of 5mCH and 5hmCH can occur within a repressed transcription unit with very nice discrimination between the gene and its surroundings (e.g. Pitpnc1), there are many regions of 5mCH and 5hmCH accumulation that either partially overlap with a gene, or that are present in intergenic regions (e.g. <italic>Myo5b</italic>/<italic>Scarna17</italic>/<italic>Lipg</italic> locus). In all of these regions, however, 5hmC accumulation directly reflects 5mCH levels suggesting 5hmCH localization reflects the pattern of de novo DNA methylation rather than targeted Tet activity. We hope that continued analysis of these datasets will provide a stimulus for additional studies of the mechanisms determining the relative distributions of these important events.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The data we have reported here advances our understanding of three major functions for 5hmC in the nervous system. Based on extensive studies of the requirements for Tet-mediated replication-dependent passive DNA demethylation in mESCs, the maturation of the germline, and developing lymphocyte lineages, it is probable that 5hmC is required to provide accessibility to important regulatory sites as neuronal progenitors exit the cell cycle and begin differentiation. The lack of DNA methylation we have observed at P0 over transcription factor genes (<italic>Lhx5</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Ldb</italic>) that are expressed immediately after PCs exit from the cell cycle suggests that this may result from passive demethylation in dividing progenitors. Further support comes from the observation that DNA demethylation has been observed in comparisons of 5mC and 5hmC levels in the frontal cortex of fetal versus adult mouse and human brains, and the finding that a fraction of these loci retain their methylation status in <italic>Tet2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2013</xref>). A second function discovered in mature neurons involves stable accumulation of 5hmCG within active genes which helps to reverse the repressive effects of MeCP2 in a process we refer to as functional demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>). The finding that elevated 5hmC remains within genes that are repressed during PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) adds to this model the fact that functional demethylation is not sufficient to maintain gene expression. Finally, we report here that Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation is required for proper expression of a subset of highly expressed PC-specific genes, adding a third important function for 5hmC in the nervous system. These findings place additional emphasis on investigation of ongoing functions of the TDG-BER pathway as elements of normal neuronal development rather than responses to accumulating DNA damage. Given these data and recent studies linking Tet mutations to neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cochran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marshall et al., 2020</xref>), it is evident that further exploration of each of these functions in the context of development, aging, and degeneration will continue enhance our understanding of 5hmC and the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Purified RNA was converted to cDNA and amplified using the Nugen Ovation RNA-Seq System V2. cDNA was fragmented to an average size of 200 bp using a Covaris C2 sonicator (intensity 5, duty cycle 10%, cycles per burst 200, treatment time 120 s). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina. The quality of the libraries was assessed using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system with D1000 High Sensitivity ScreenTape. Libraries were sequenced at The Rockefeller University Genomics Resource Center on the Illumina NextSeq 500 to obtain 75 bp paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>ATAC-Seq</title><p>ATACSeq libraries were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) with minor modifications; ~25 k fixed nuclei were incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40). Nuclei were then resuspended in 50 µL 1× TD buffer containing 2.5 µL Tn5 enzyme from Nextera (Illumina) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C; 200 µL of reverse-crosslinking buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % SDS, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 ng/mL proteinase K) was added to the samples and they were incubated overnight at 65°C with shaking. The samples were then purified using the QiaQuick MinElute columns (Qiagen). Libraries were amplified by PCR using the Q5 High Fidelity Polymerase (NEB) for 12 cycles with barcoded primers. Libraries were size-selected with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).

The authors have previously published a method for isolation of FACS-based nuclear sorting for these cells and here they use it to isolate from P0, P7, and adult cerebellum with high quality RNA, mC/hmC, ATAC and ChIP-seq data at each time point in biological replicate. The chromatin data are correlated against developmental changes in gene expression and suggest broad mechanisms of chromatin control that are, for the most part, in line with previous studies of other cell types. The authors are particularly interested in regions of the genome that show loss of mCG (and hmCG) over developmental time and are near genes that show enhanced expression in adult PCs. They test the requirement for the Tets in the developmental demethylation of these regions by knocking out all three Tets in a PC specific manner at P7, then running RNA/mCG/hmCG sequencing in adult to compare between cTKO and control. </p><p>PCs are a biologically important class of neurons and they are a very different cell type from others that have been developmentally studied. For these reasons the descriptive chromatin data gathered here are of use to the community. However, the analyses performed on the data as presented here are somewhat underdeveloped.

In dividing cells, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase recognizes poorly of 5hmC, which leads to passive DNA demethylation through replacing the 5hmC sites with unmethylated cytosine after rounds of DNA replication. However, whether 5hmC undergoes demethylation in non-dividing cells, for example through TDG-BER dependent active DNA demethylation, and how it may impact gene transcription and cellular properties remain elusive. To answer these questions will particularly expand our current understanding of TET catalyzed methylcytosine oxidation in the brain, the organ that has not only the highest levels of 5hmC, but also thousands of millions of non-dividing neurons that remain plastic throughout life.</p><p>Purkinje neurons in cerebellum subject to orchestrated postnatal migration, arborization, and synaptogenesis after their final cell division at mid-gestation stage. The study focuses on this neuron type and generates single base resolution 5mC and 5hmC mapping at three developmental stages (P0, P7, young adult). In addition, it profiles the Purkinje neuron specific transcriptiome (nuclei RNAseq), epigenome (H3K4me3, H3K27me3), and chromatin accessibility (ATACseq). The study therefore displays novel modes of epigenomic alterations that are associated with transcription regulation, which also confirms DNA methylation turnovers during Purkinje neuron post-mitotic maturation. Furthermore, the study generates a conditional knockout mouse line with all three TET enzymes selectively deleted in Purkinje neurons. The deficiency of TET enzymes not only impedes the DNA methylation changes during Purkinje cell postnatal maturation, but also alters neuronal excitability that increases susceptibility to an excitotoxic drug. Therefore, the study demonstrates a requirement of dynamic 5mC/5hmC changes during cerebellum Purkinje neuron post-mitotic maturation and their implication in neuronal function.</p><p>The study has successfully addressed a few technical challenges, such as the low abundancy of Purkinje neurons, to profile 5mC and 5hmC separately, and to generate a cell type specific triple TET knockout mouse line. The data are of good quality (e.g. Figure S1). Overall, the conclusions are supported by the data. Epigenetic modifications have been known to play cell type specific functions. However, the majority of current research is limited by the heterogeneity of tissue samples that lack a cell type specific resolution. To study DNA modifications in a defined neuron type, as shown in this manuscript, provides valuable novel insights (e.g. as mentioned in the Discussion, the changes are specific to Purkinje cells, but not observed in cerebellum granule neurons). In addition to sequencing 5mC and 5hmC side by side, the study also analyzes CG and CH regions separately. The study recognizes unique patterns of 5mC, 5hmC, CG and CH changes, respectively, which suggest the complexity of DNA modification in the brain. The set of genes that are associated with DNA methylation valley dynamics are particularly interesting. The genomic datasets and the mouse line derived from this study will also serve as a good resource for related work.</p><p>Through RNAseq, less than 2000 genes are found to be differentially expressed during Purkinje neuron maturation. The study therefore spends major efforts on analyzing the epigenetic changes at these genes. However, it is not sufficiently clear of the epigenetic status of the vast majority of genome beyond the differentially expressed genes, even though some indicative findings are revealed at regions with &quot;gain&quot; or &quot;loss&quot; of chromatin accessibility (Figure 2K-N). To assess this, it will be helpful to further characterize intergenic regions in the future, for example through genomic profiling of enhancer markers H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.</p><p>An enhancer marker ChIPseq is preferred, but not required. Below are some suggested revision points.</p><p>1. It will be informative to demonstrate the transcription levels of the three TET family members during Purkinje neuron maturation. This can be obtained from the RNAseq data that the authors have generated.</p><p>2. The transcriptome and epigenome differential lists should be provided in supplements.</p><p>3.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Catherine Dulac (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the first round of review I raised two main concerns about the molecular data – the novelty of the findings and the depth of the analysis linking Tet-mediated DNA demethylation with PC maturation. One of the other reviewers raised concerns about the physiology of the Tet cKO mice.</p><p>1. Novelty of the findings</p><p>The first concern was the degree of novelty in showing Tet-mediated DNA demethylation in post-mitotic neurons. My concern arose from the language used by the authors in their manuscript. In the abstract of the revised manuscript they state, &quot;is it not known whether 5hmC is required for terminal differentiation or if it can serve as an intermediate in active DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons.&quot; This assertion does not jibe with my reading of the literature. My concern was amplified when I read the sentence at line 68 in the introduction that says, &quot;Tet mediated replication dependent passive demethylation is thought to be common in many dividing cell types, including progenitor cells in the developing forebrain (Rudenko et al. 2013), hippocampus (Guo et al. 2011) and cerebellum (Zhu et al. 2016).&quot; This is an inaccurate statement regarding these papers from the literature.</p><p>Rudenko et al. studied DNA methylation in adult brains of a Tet1 knockout mouse and found hypermethylation of activity-regulated gene promoters in the knockout compared with wildtype. I appreciate that because this was a germline knockout that this study does not rule out the possibility that the increases in methylation occurred in dividing progenitor cells and were maintained. However, the authors of the current manuscript are over-reaching to conclude that the changes in methylation seen in the Rudenko study were indeed the result of passive demethylation in progenitors, given that this was not tested in the study. The Guo and Zhu studies knocked down Tets in postmitotic neurons. In the Guo 2011 study the authors injected shRNA-bearing AAVs targeting Tet1 in adult dentate gyrus. In the Zhu 2016 study the authors lentivirally infected primary CGN cultures with shRNAs targeting Tets 1 and 3. Both studies showed increases in DNA methylation in knockdown compared with wildtype neurons. In the Guo study this was in the context of seizure-induced demethylation of the Bdnf and Fgf1b genes, and the demethylation was blocked by Tet1 KD. Although there are a few progenitors in the adult dentate gyrus, it is not reasonable to attribute the methylation effects to only these few cells if that is what the authors mean by saying this study was in progenitors. The authors of the Guo paper concluded that Tet1 acted to actively demethylate DNA in postmitotic hippocampal neurons, and their data support that conclusion. The Zhu 2016 used primary CGNs in culture, which have been shown by many groups (using the specific protocol derived from the Hatten lab) to be fully post-mitotic within the first 24 hours after plating. shRNA-mediated knockdown occurs on the order of days (cells were studied at 3DIV). Therefore, the assumption of Guo 2016 in their conclusions that the Tets are acting to mediate these changes in post-mitotic neurons is justified.</p><p>Later (line 274) the manuscript references Lio 2016 to cite that prior studies have established that the activation of enhancers is accompanied by increased accessibility and loss of DNA methylation. At line 291 the authors suggest that the DNA demethylation they find in PCs is novel because &quot;in this case…DNA demethylation does not require cell division.&quot; I agree it is true the PC data shows postmitotic demethylation, however it was also shown in PMID 32589877. In that study the authors purified nuclei of SST+ and VIP+ neurons from the mouse cortex during development. These experiments were done during comparing interneuron nuclei isolated at P7 with those from P13, both stages at which these neurons are already postmitotic.</p><p>These discrepancies in the manuscript between the authors' assertions of what these studies showed and the published data need to be corrected to be accurate.</p><p>It was because the authors suggested the novelty of their study as the first to show Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons that I questioned that novelty. As the literature review above shows, this manuscript is not the first to show Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons.</p><p>However, this manuscript does do a particularly nice job of it. I think the novelty of the study lies in linking the molecular characterization of PC chromatin regulation during development with the biology of this cell population. With this in mind, I agree with the authors that the body of the data and the analysis do make a significant new addition to the literature that will be of broad interest.</p><p>2. Depth of the analysis linking Tet-mediated DNA demethylation with PC maturation</p><p>In this revision the authors have significantly expanding and clarified the section on the molecular sequencing from Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 cKO mice, strengthening the impact of the data. However, even though this is a revised manuscript there are some important omissions and errors in this section that undermine the power of the data to support the model.</p><p>– Line 193, 5hmc continues to increase over highly expressed genes – where is that evidence?</p><p>– Line 202 &quot;Furthermore, 5hmCG accumulated over the genes bodies early in development is not removed (Figure 2C),&quot; actually what this figure shows is that for the downregulated genes there is an increase in 5hmCG over the gene bodies between P7 and adult, so it is not only not lost, it is gained. It looks no different for the downregulated genes than the upregulated genes.</p><p>– Where is the data that goes with line 372 – growth of the DMV preceded by 5hmC and starts at 5' end</p><p>– Line 376 -The text that follows this (to line 381) is entirely speculative and does not belong in the methods.</p><p>– Figure 4S2 E-G are not cited in the text.</p><p>– Line 496 – the authors state they have not seen demethylation in CGNs with no attribution and no data. Also, this contrasts with the Zhu 2016 paper so should be discussed in comparison.</p><p>Furthermore, one of the important parts of this section regards the relationship of the chromatin changes in the Tet cKO to the gene expression effects and this part would benefit from more discussion. For example, one of the best example genes for Tet mediated demethylation the authors show it Iptr and yet they specifically say this epigenomic change does not influence Iptr expression (which is key since this is the gene product used for PC isolation). Also, it is surprising that in the Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 cKO mice, expression of genes encoding synaptic proteins and differentiation markers are the major class elevated, not repressed. Might this suggest that the Tets actually slow differentiation rather than promoting it as the text seems to imply? Either would be interesting, but the data shown needs to be reconciled with the statement (line 106) that &quot;maturation in Purkinje Cells … require continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66973.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript the authors carry out epigenomic profiling purified Purkinje cells across key stages of cerebellar development to study the regulation and function of 5hmC.

We agree with this assessment, and we present them both to support our specific interests and as a resource for further analysis. With respect to our analysis being characterized as “somewhat underdeveloped”, these data are so massive that a complete study of all of their features will require many additional sets of analyses and follow up studies. There is little doubt in our minds that the data will be embraced by the community and additional biological inferences will emerge from them. Although we could populate several more figures with further analysis of these data, we have chosen to focus on only those findings supporting the most novel and important conclusions relative to the direct roles of 5hmC in differentiation.</p><p>Novelty. It has been demonstrated that the distribution of 5hmC in neuronal genomes is cell type specific and correlates with active gene expression, and that germline deletions of Tet oxidases disrupt development of the brain. Reviewer 1 is familiar with this “developmental role” of 5hmC covering the course of neuronal development – including proliferative phases of neuronal progenitor expansion where 5hmC is required for replication dependent DNA demethylation and chromatin remodeling. Replication dependent DNA demethylation is a fundamental feature of DNA methylation refinement that occurs in many cell types. However, the term “developmental demethylation” does not distinguish between the role of 5hmC mediated, replication dependent passive demethylation in progenitors and the proposed, but not proven, role of 5hmC mediated active demethylation in the absence of cell division (Ito et al., 2011). Our study was designed to arrest 5hmC formation in postmitotic differentiating PCs to address specifically this issue. The design of the study, the use of new cell type specific triple Tet1, Tet2, Tet3 triple knockout lines that activate well after the final division of PC progenitors, and the results obtained are novel and of high interest.</p><p>Figure 4. To address the remaining comments of Reviewer 1, we have edited substantially the section of the manuscript subtitled “Loss of 5mC and 5hmC in active genes during PC differentiation” presenting the data documenting loss of both 5mC and 5hmC in a specific class of highly expressed genes during PC differentiation. We believe that these new edits present the data in a concise yet very clear manner that is accessible to even a general reader. In doing so, they also augment the following section “Loss of 5mC and 5hmC in putative regulatory sites during PC differentiation”. We think this improved presentation of the data in Figure 3 establishes for the reader both that DNA demethylation occurs as PC differentiation proceeds, and that 5hmC accumulation is present in the P7 data at these sites prior to the evident loss of both 5mC and 5hmC in the adult. These new edits provide an improved introduction to Figure 4, and we believe they will help the reader understand more readily the molecular events that are disrupted as a consequence of loss of 5hmC.</p><p>Of course, to provide proof that loss of DNA methylation over the PC DMVs is dependent on 5hmC required disruption of continued 5hmC production in the Pcp2TetTKO mice. Figure 4 presents first the basic characteristics of the Pcp2TetTKO lines, establishing that their survival and body weight is normal (panels B,C), and that no gross motor phenotype is evident in rotarod performance measures (panel D). The remaining data in Figure 4 are meant to address directly the molecular events that occur in Pcp2TetTKO PCs and the requirement for 5hmC in the DNA demethylation described in Figure 3.</p><p>The description of the molecular events that occur in PCP2TetTKO PCs has been extensively lengthened to clarify each point revealed by the data. We have also changed panel G to box and whisker plots so that the reader can more easily evaluate the alterations in methylation over ATAC peaks (putative regulatory sites) that both increase in adult PCs and are associated with genes whose expression changes in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs. We hope that the additional detailed discussion of the data and our conclusions will address the comment that this section of the manuscript is “somewhat underdeveloped”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[…] Through RNAseq, less than 2000 genes are found to be differentially expressed during Purkinje neuron maturation.

Since many studies have documented a strong relationship between 5hmC accumulation and transcription, since ECS causes a large increase in transcription from these promoters, and since both the Tet1 and Apobec1 knock downs leave at least Tet 2 and Tet3 activity intact, it is equally likely that the increased “methylation” seen in the KD is 5hmC rather than 5mC.

However, we agree that this is a nice demonstration of the role of 5hmC in differentiation of granule cells and have edited the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Later (line 274) the manuscript references Lio 2016 to cite that prior studies have established that the activation of enhancers is accompanied by increased accessibility and loss of DNA methylation. At line 291 the authors suggest that the DNA demethylation they find in PCs is novel because &quot;in this case…DNA demethylation does not require cell division.&quot; I agree it is true the PC data shows postmitotic demethylation, however it was also shown in PMID 32589877. In that study the authors purified nuclei of SST+ and VIP+ neurons from the mouse cortex during development. These experiments were done during comparing interneuron nuclei isolated at P7 with those from P13, both stages at which these neurons are already postmitotic.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we thank Reviewer 1 for stimulating us to more accurately discuss the three papers cited above, we do not agree with the statement that postmitotic demethylation “was also shown in PMID 32589877”. The paper in this citation “An Activity-Mediated Transition in Transcription in Early Postnatal Neurons” (Stroud et al., Neuron, 2020) is a very nice study of enhancer activation and decommissioning in the developing brain. In the relevant section concerning the role of DNA methylation, the authors use Sst and Vip Cre drivers to knockout Dnmt3a in these interneuron types. The result is that the increase in methylation that occurs normally at these sites does not occur in the KO. The fact that there is less methylation in the KO reflects the failure of DNMT3A to methylate these sites, not DNA demethylation. The word “demethylation” does not appear in the paper. While the Stroud et al. study is very well done, it is not directly relevant and we have not cited it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These discrepancies in the manuscript between the authors' assertions of what these studies showed and the published data need to be corrected to be accurate.</p><p>It was because the authors suggested the novelty of their study as the first to show Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons that I questioned that novelty. As the literature review above shows, this manuscript is not the first to show Tet-mediated active DNA demethylation in postmitotic neurons.</p><p>However, this manuscript does do a particularly nice job of it. I think the novelty of the study lies in linking the molecular characterization of PC chromatin regulation during development with the biology of this cell population. With this in mind, I agree with the authors that the body of the data and the analysis do make a significant new addition to the literature that will be of broad interest.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these comments, we have edited the manuscript to state accurately what has been established in the literature. My strict technical interpretation of the cited papers is that the caveats discussed above prevent a definitive statement that DNA demethylation occurs in postmitotic neurons. This is the reason we went to great lengths to obtain precise data using the most advanced technology (oxBS) that can distinguish 5mC from 5hmC, and why we constructed PC specific triple knockout lines that are activated at P7 to complete this study. we understand, however, that we have been too strident and we have tried to edit the manuscript according to the comments of Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Depth of the analysis linking Tet-mediated DNA demethylation with PC maturation</p><p>In this revision the authors have significantly expanding and clarified the section on the molecular sequencing from Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 cKO mice, strengthening the impact of the data. However, even though this is a revised manuscript there are some important omissions and errors in this section that undermine the power of the data to support the model.</p><p>– Line 193, 5hmc continues to increase over highly expressed genes – where is that evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>This is shown in Figure 2S1E. As a result of an editorial error, we did not include the figure citation in the manuscript, and the text has now been edited to correct this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 202 &quot;Furthermore, 5hmCG accumulated over the genes bodies early in development is not removed (Figure 2C),&quot; actually what this figure shows is that for the downregulated genes there is an increase in 5hmCG over the gene bodies between P7 and adult, so it is not only not lost, it is gained. It looks no different for the downregulated genes than the upregulated genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we have edited the manuscript to state that 5hmC continues to increase over these genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Where is the data that goes with line 372 – growth of the DMV preceded by 5hmC and starts at 5' end</p></disp-quote><p>These two points are illustrated in (Figure 4H, I). In panel 4H, one can clearly see in the IGV panel that the level of 5hmC at significantly greater at P7 than in the adult over nearly the entire gene body for GPR63, and that this is also the case at the 5’end of Grid2. This is more difficult to appreciate for Grid2 because it is such a large gene and the demethylation occurs only over the first 50-100 kb of the gene. The metagene plots in Figure 4I also indicate that for this whole class of genes, the 5hmC levels are high at P7 and much less in the adult indicating that 5hmC accumulated during development is lost as the cells differentiate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 376 -The text that follows this (to line 381) is entirely speculative and does not belong in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Quote in question “<italic>These data revealed a large variation in the length of the DMV that does not form in the Pcp2TetTKO PCs. We believe this reflects a complex relationship between the timing at which transcription is initiated, the rate of transcription over the entire gene body, the local activity of Tet oxidase within the gene as differentiation proceeds, and the timing of Tet oxidase loss from each cell following recombination at the Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 loci.</italic> “</p><p>We agree with Reviewer 1 that this is speculation. The fact that the sentence starts with “We believe” clearly indicates that this is our conjecture and not a verified result. We see no reason why we can’t let the reader evaluate this idea for themselves, and we would like to leave this in the Results as it is stated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4S2 E-G are not cited in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We made an unfortunate typo while referring to the supplemental figures. Figures 4S2 E-G were incorrectly referred to as 4S1 E-G. This has been corrected in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, one of the important parts of this section regards the relationship of the chromatin changes in the Tet cKO to the gene expression effects and this part would benefit from more discussion. For example, one of the best example genes for Tet mediated demethylation the authors show it Iptr and yet they specifically say this epigenomic change does not influence Iptr expression (which is key since this is the gene product used for PC isolation). Also, it is surprising that in the Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 cKO mice, expression of genes encoding synaptic proteins and differentiation markers are the major class elevated, not repressed. Might this suggest that the Tets actually slow differentiation rather than promoting it as the text seems to imply? Either would be interesting, but the data shown needs to be reconciled with the statement (line 106) that &quot;maturation in Purkinje Cells…..require continued oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and we understand that in the simplest case one might interpret the findings as consistent with slowing differentiation. However, we don’t know whether late expressed genes in PCs may be expressed at higher levels during synaptogenesis than they are once they reach their steady state levels in the adult. We chose the word maturation to reflect this uncertainty. We have also edited the last sentence of this paragraph to state more precisely our conclusion “Taken together, our data demonstrate that active demethylation occurs in select genes in postmitotic neurons, and that 5hmC plays an essential role in refining the transcriptional and epigenetic status of Purkinje cells during the final stages of differentiation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
