making it an attractive vaccine antigen and biotherapeutic target. To uncover the biologically relevant structure of sNS1, we obtained infection-derived sNS1 (isNS1) from dengue virus (DENV)-infected Vero cells through immunoaffinity purification instead of recombinant sNS1 (rsNS1) overexpressed in insect or mammalian cell lines. We found that isNS1 appeared as an approximately 250 kDa complex of NS1 and ApoA1 and further determined the cryoEM structures of isNS1 and its complex with a monoclonal antibody/Fab. Indeed, we found that the major species of isNS1 is a complex of the NS1 dimer partially embedded in a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle. Crosslinking mass spectrometry studies confirmed that the isNS1 interacts with the major HDL component ApoA1 through interactions that map to the NS1 wing and hydrophobic domains. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that the sNS1 in sera from DENV-infected mice and a human patient form a similar complex as isNS1. Our results report the molecular architecture of a biological form of sNS1, which may have implications for the molecular pathogenesis of dengue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dengue infection</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis factor</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>high-density lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>flavivirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T2EP30220-0020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Dahai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOH-OFIRG20nov-0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Subhash G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sobota</surname><given-names>Radoslaw M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phoo</surname><given-names>Wint Wint</given-names></name><name><surname>Ser</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Sobota</surname><given-names>Radoslaw M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LKCMedicine Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chew</surname><given-names>Bing Liang Alvin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOHOFIRG18may-0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Subhash G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Fund 2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phoo</surname><given-names>Wint Wint</given-names></name><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Subhash G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular architecture of the secreted NS1 dimer from dengue virus infection in complex with a high density lipoprotein particle.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the flavivirus genus and is the cause of significant healthcare problems and economic burden worldwide, partially due to the lack of effective therapeutics and the limited efficacy of licensed vaccines, Dengvaxia and QDENGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diamond and Pierson, 2015</xref>). While the majority of DENV infections are mild or asymptomatic, severe dengue infections, marked by vascular leakage, can be life-threatening and even fatal. The severity of dengue infections has been demonstrated to be correlated to high sera levels of sNS1 in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Libraty et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paranavitane et al., 2014</xref>). The viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a highly conserved and multifunctional protein that exists as intracellular membrane-associated NS1, a presumed GPI-anchored outer plasma membrane-associated NS1, and secreted NS1 (sNS1) during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glasner et al., 2018</xref>). NS1 could interact with a myriad of proteins associated with its immune evasion and virotoxin roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Watterson et al., 2016</xref>). The interactions of NS1 with viral E protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scaturro et al., 2015</xref>) and the NS4A-2K-NS4B precursor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Płaszczyca et al., 2019</xref> have been shown to be important in virus production and replication, respectively. Intracellular NS1 found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen is an essential part of the membranous viral RNA replication compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scaturro et al., 2015</xref>). Upon release from the cells, sNS1 enters the blood circulation where in vitro and in vivo mouse evidence demonstrated its ability to induce vascular permeability, a hallmark of severe dengue, either independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Puerta-Guardo et al., 2016</xref>) or by inducing pro-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beatty et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The high-resolution crystal structures of NS1 dimer have been reported for DENV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akey et al., 2014</xref>), West Nile Virus (WNV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akey et al., 2014</xref>), and Zika Virus (ZIKV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 2016</xref>), which provide a conserved molecular view of flaviviral NS1. Mature NS1 is 352 amino acids long with an apparent molecular mass between 40 and 50 kDa depending on its glycosylation state. NS1 has a three-domain architecture, a hydrophobic β-roll (residues 1–29), an α/β wing (38–151), and a β-ladder (181–352). The connector segments between the wing and β-ladder domains, residues 30–37 and 152–180, form a three-stranded β-sheet. The dimer has a distinct cross shape with the wings extending from the central β-ladder, which has an extended β-sheet that faces the hydrophobic β-roll and a ‘spaghetti loop’ on the opposite hydrophilic outer face that lacks structured elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). sNS1 was reported to be a barrel-shaped hexamer with lipid cargo held together by hydrophobic interactions based on biophysical and low-resolution EM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flamand et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutsche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2012</xref>). Recent cryoEM structures of recombinant sNS1 (rsNS1) from DENV-2 showed mainly tetrameric rsNS1, with only 3% of the population found to be in the hexameric form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shu et al., 2022</xref>. While earlier studies by Gutsche et al, (2011) found that the lipid profile of DENV-1 infection-derived sNS1 to be similar to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutsche et al., 2011</xref>, the same research group now showed that DENV-2 rsNS1 could dock onto HDL with direct visualization using negative stain EM analysis as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benfrid et al., 2022</xref>. Additionally, sNS1 appears to utilize the scavenger receptor B1, a known receptor for HDL, as the cognate receptor in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcalá et al., 2022</xref>). Since the interactions of sNS1 with the target cells implicated in pathogenesis require the hydrophobic β-roll side to be exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akey et al., 2014</xref>), the mechanism by which the oligomeric sNS1 with its lipid load in the central channel dissociates and associates has been a topic of intense research interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benfrid et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avirutnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcalá et al., 2017</xref>). However, the native structure of the extracellular sNS1 during viral infection remains unclear.</p><p>To closely mimic sNS1 circulating in dengue patients’ sera, we obtained infection-derived sNS1 (isNS1) from the culture supernatant of Vero cells infected with either the DENV2 WT (isNS1wt) or T164S mutant (isNS1ts). The T164S mutation in the greasy finger loop between the wing and β-ladder interdomain of NS1 was identified from a DENV2 epidemic in Cuba in 1997, where a correlation with enhanced clinical disease severity was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Roche et al., 2005</xref>). We demonstrated that this single mutation in NS1 could directly cause lethality in mice and increased sNS1 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2019</xref>), which served as an epidemiologically relevant tool to study the biochemical and structural characteristics of sNS1 in this study.</p><p>We determined that the isNS1 is a complex of the NS1 dimer embedded on a single HDL particle composed of ApoA1. By applying integrative structural tools, we report the cryoEM structural model of the purified isNS1:HDL complex at ~8 Å resolution with protein–protein interactions between NS1 and ApoA1 defined by crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS). Furthermore, the Ab56.2 binding site model in the cryoEM model of isNS1:ApoA1 complex was elucidated using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) as well as NS1 peptide competition ELISA. Interrogation of DENV-infected mouse sera and a human patient suggests that the sNS1:HDL complex exists in vivo as a similar complex to isNS1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Native isNS1 is a complex of NS1 with ApoA1</title><p>We purified isNS1 using a monoclonal antibody 56.2 from the supernatant of the infected Vero cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

The eluted protein was then dialyzed against PBS and concentrated using a 100 kDa MWCO Amicon ultracentrifugal unit and stored at –80°C before use. The protein purity was determined via Coomassie blue after separation on a reducing SDS-PAGE. The protein bands observed on the gel were then validated in a western blot against NS1 and ApoA1.

Excised bands corresponding to 250 kDa on the Native gel, and 50 kDa and 25 kDa bands on the denatured gel as well as the elute in solution were also subjected to protein identification via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Purified isNS1wt and isNS1ts were separately complexed with Fab56.2 and Ab56.2 and analyzed through an analytical size exclusion chromatography to ensure formation of stable complexes for imaging via electron microscopy. Purified isNS1wt and isNS1ts were also crosslinked with disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO) to determine interaction sites between isNS1 and ApoA1 via LC-MS.

While the cryoEM map reconstructions remain limited at low resolutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), they could be fitted with the NS1 dimer and Fab56.2 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) predicted separately using AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>), with a correlation value of 0.75 to the fitted regions using a simulated 5 Å map from the NS1 dimer and Fab models. The AlphaFold2 predicted model of the NS1 dimer was used despite the availability of the crystallographic dimer model (PBS ID: 6WER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biering et al., 2021</xref>) given their high similarity (root mean square deviation (RMSD): 0.67) and that the latter had a few unmodeled residues (aa 118–128). The map-model fitting showed that the epitope sites were at the tip of the C-terminal β-ladder region. The approximate dimensions of the spherical HDL could also be measured at 82 Å by 65 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), which aligned with existing reports of spherical HDL being measured at 70–120 Å in diameter with predominantly homodimeric ApoA1 arranged as an anti-parallel double-belt stabilized by intermolecular salt bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Silva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2019</xref>).

The model has a cross-sectional distance of approximately 78 Å and fits into the spherical density in the cryoEM map. The NS1 dimer appears semi-embedded on the HDL particle through its hydrophobic surface, with a conformation that exposed only one end of the β-ladder domain to which Ab56.2 and Fab56.2 bind. Overall, the cryoEM model indicated that the purified ~250 kDa isNS1 is a complex of an NS1 dimer and HDL, consistent with the gel and LFQ analysis of LC-MS data presented above.</p><p>Similarly, we determined the structures of the ternary complex of isNS1ts mutant with Fab56.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>, the NS1 residues that are involved in both intra- and intermolecular crosslinks were located mainly on the β-roll and wing domains, with ~34% of the NS1:ApoA1 crosslinks being located on the β-roll domain. The NS1:NS1 intramolecular crosslink pairs were further validated on the predicted NS1 dimer model by implementing a 30 Å cutoff distance for the Cα atoms of crosslinked residues, a criterion that was met by 85% of the NS1:NS1 intramolecular crosslinks (24 out of 28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The NS1:ApoA1 intermolecular crosslinks for the immunoaffinity-purified isNS1wt were found to be located between the β-roll and wing domains of NS1 and the helices 3, 4, 8, and 10 of ApoA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and d</xref>). Applying the same cutoff value of &lt;30 Å distance between the Cα atoms of the NS1:ApoA1 intermolecular crosslinked residues and validating it on the cryoEM model of isNS1wt in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>) satisfied 76% of the crosslinks (19 out of 25 intermolecular crosslinks between NS1 dimer and ApoA1). In the case of ApoA1:ApoA1 intramolecular crosslinks, the &lt;30 Å distance between their Cα atoms cutoff satisfied 62% of the crosslinks (18 out of 29 ApoA1:ApoA1 intramolecular crosslinks). The higher number of violated crosslinks in ApoA1:ApoA1 compared to those in NS1:NS1 could be due to the flexible and dynamic nature of ApoA1 dimers, which may prevent it from assuming a fixed relative position among the ApoA1 dimer population in the HDL. A similar crosslink pattern to isNS1wt is observed in the XL-MS mapping of isNS1ts mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>) followed by rigid-body fitting into the corresponding cryoEM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>), except that there were fewer crosslink sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary file 2 and 3</xref>). This indicated that isNS1ts dimer may have a weaker affinity to HDL in comparison to the isNS1wt dimer.

We next examined if the isNS1:HDL complex can be detected in dengue patients using serum samples obtained from the CELADEN clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Low et al., 2014</xref>). A primary infection sample with high levels of sNS1 (&gt;15 µg/mL) detected by commercial Platelia NS1 ELISA was selected for this purpose to avoid the confounding factor of the presence of anti-NS1 Abs in the secondary infected patients and to pull-down sufficient sNS1 from the patient serum. The patient serum was first subjected to a pre-clearing step using Protein AG resin to reduce the abundance of human IgGs that may interfere with the downstream analysis. We then subjected the pre-cleared patient serum to immunoprecipitation using commercial polyclonal anti-ApoA1 antibodies to pull down and detect ApoA1 and possibly sNS1. Increasing the anti-ApoA1 antibody from 10 to 50 µg coupled onto Protein AG resin for pull-down resulted in a corresponding increase in the sNS1 amount detected by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), suggesting a specific association between sNS1 and ApoA1.

We determined the cryoEM structure of a natively secreted NS1 from DENV2-infected cells as a ternary complex of NS1 dimer embedded on a single HDL particle. Our in-solution XL-MS analysis captured interactions within a cutoff distance of 30 Å imposed by the linker-spacer between the β-roll and wing domains of NS1 and helices 3, 5, 8, and 10 of (bovine) ApoA1 – the main protein moiety of HDL. More importantly, we were able to detect NS1:HDL complexes in vivo in both the sera of DENV2-infected mice and in the serum of a DENV1-infected patient, highlighting the biological relevance of the NS1:HDL complexes in dengue infection.</p><p>Benfrid et al. (2022) recently reconstituted complexes of rsNS1 dimers bound to the surface of a spheroid human HDL particle in vitro at 1:1 to 3:1 ratio when up to 400 μg/mL of rsNS1 were used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benfrid et al., 2022</xref>. Similarly, in our studies with infection-derived sNS1 (isNS1), we observed up to two NS1 dimers docked onto an HDL particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is noteworthy that the concentration of isNS1:HDL in our study (~30 μg/mL) is closer to the maximum clinically reported concentration of sNS1 in the sera of DENV patients (50 μg/mL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Libraty et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Young et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alcon et al., 2002</xref>. Therefore, the ratio of sNS1 to HDL varies depending on the concentration of the proteins used for complex formation.</p><p>While our study is limited to only one antibody (56.2) for immunoaffinity purification, our key take-home message in terms of structure is that our data does not support the widely held view that sNS1 is composed of a trimer of NS1 dimers with an ~28 Å wide central channel filled with lipid as established in several seminal publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flamand et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutsche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, our data confirms the observations reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benfrid et al., 2022</xref>. In the rare instances where trimer of dimers have been experimentally shown by cryoEM of rNS1 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shu et al., 2022</xref>), only a single lipid molecule can be found in the narrow central channel and unlikely to be reflective of sNS1 circulating in serum. We argue that the amount of lipid associated with infection-derived sNS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutsche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2019</xref>) is consistent with NS1 dimer(s) associated with HDL. The interaction with HDL requires an exposed hydrophobic face of NS1 that is incompatible to the hexamer model of sNS1. Indeed, it is agreeable that the oligomeric state of NS1 is dynamic, which may vary depending on the context and environment. This point requires further independent studies.</p><p>Our previous functional studies comparing isNS1wt with isNS1ts (T164S) showed that incubating immunoaffinity-purified sNS1 with human PBMCs from three independent human donors triggered the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFα in a concentration-dependent manner and that it was more pronounced with the mutant than the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we have provisional transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay data with isNS1 proteins used in the structural studies with human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (hUVEC), which show that acid-eluted isNS1 proteins in this study induces endothelial hyperpermeability as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Puerta-Guardo et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of a significant population of free isNS1ts dimers in complex with Fab56.2 and fewer crosslinks identified between isNS1ts and ApoA1 point toward the possibility that isNS1ts is more dynamic in its association with host proteins than isNS1wt. The disease severity and increased complement protein expression in AG129 mice liver infected with NS1T164S carrying virus compared with WT that was observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2019</xref>) can be ascribed to weakly bound mutant NS1 with fast on/off rate with HDL being transported to the liver where specific receptors bind to free sNS1 and interact with effector proteins such as complement to drive inflammation and associated pathology. This notion also requires further validation with other mutations that can impact sNS1 –HDL interaction.</p><p>Overall, our work provided a refined understanding of the native structure of sNS1 in DENV pathogenesis. The functional role of HDL-bound NS1 protein in disease is now a topic of contention but one that will be resolved by more data obtained with infection-derived sNS1 by scientists in the field. Contrary to the known protective roles of HDL such as against endotoxic shock caused by lipopolysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trinder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tall, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harsløf et al., 2023</xref>), Benfrid et al. (2022) showed that sNS1:HDL complex triggers proinflammatory signals when tested with primary human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benfrid et al., 2022</xref>). The presence of sNS1:HDL complexes as a predominant population of sNS1 in our in vitro infection model corroborates with a previous report of an interaction between insect-derived recombinant NS1 and the classical HDL/ApoA1-binding receptor known as SR-BI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcalá et al., 2022</xref>), which is primarily expressed on hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acton et al., 1996</xref>). This interaction in hepatocytes has been suggested to trigger endocytosis of sNS1 and subsequent downstream effects including vascular permeability, which is a characteristic feature of severe dengue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcalá et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alcon-LePoder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Internalization of sNS1 is critical for increased virus production in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alcon-LePoder et al., 2005</xref>) and NS1-mediated permeability in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, NS1:HDL complexes have been shown to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and their presence has been detected in the sera of hospitalized DENV patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benfrid et al., 2022</xref>. Yet, this hypothesis is confounded by other reports. While rsNS1 has been shown to trigger a TLR4-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines to induce vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Modhiran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coelho et al., 2021</xref>), Coelho et al. (2021) further showed that lipid-free recombinant ApoA1 neutralizes the proinflammatory effects caused by insect-derived recombinant intracellular NS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coelho et al., 2021</xref>).

This underscores the need for physiologically relevant studies to reconcile these discrepancies and gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of NS1-HDL complex in DENV pathogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, despite the study limitations that our isNS1wt and isNS1ts were immunoaffinity purified with one specific monoclonal antibody (Ab56.2), our structural model, obtained by cryoEM and verified by XL-MS, of infection-derived sNS1 shows a NS1 dimer embedded on a single HDL particle composed of ApoA1 dimer. Future investigation of this work using infected mouse sera from other DENV strains and different flaviviruses would inform the structural and functional relevance of the HDL-bound NS1 protein complex among flaviviral NS1 as well as provide a basis for the development of NS1-directed therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, viruses, and antibodies</title><p>Vero cells (green African monkey kidney epithelial cells, ATCC) were cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

For reference, non-deuterated controls were also carried out by diluting the protein samples in aqueous PBS, followed by quench solution and mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>Each quenched sample was subjected to 3 min proteolytic digestion using an immobilized pepsin cartridge (Enzymate, Waters, USA) maintained at 12°C and built into an HDX sample manager coupled to nanoACQUITY M-class UPLC (Waters). The samples were pumped by 0.1% FA solution at 100 μL/min. The pepsin-digested peptides were then resolved by reverse-phased liquid chromatography using a C18 trap (Vanguard, Waters) and a C18 column (ACQUITYTM, Waters) maintained at 0–3°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wales et al., 2008</xref>). A gradient of 8–40% solvent A (0.1% FA in LCMS-grade water) to solvent B (0.1% FA in ACN) pumped at 40 μL/min by M-class binary solvent manager (Waters) was used to separate the peptides and identified through a coupled high-resolution Synapt G2-Si (Waters, UK) mass spectrometer. The peptides are ionized by electrospray ionization and detected in positive polarity mode. Ionized peptides were separated using HDMS<sup>E</sup> mode with ion mobility activated with the following parameters: low collision energy – trap (2 V), transfer (4 V); high collision energy – trap (4 V), transfer ramp (15–40 V); IMS wave velocity – 600 m/s, transfer wave velocity – 197 m/s; step-wave height at 30 V. A capillary voltage of 3 kV and 80°C source temperature were applied for ionization to detect the peptides and measure their absolute masses. For mass accuracy, 10 µL/min of 200 fmol/µL of Glu-fibrinogen peptide B was simultaneously sprayed as lockmass reference.</p><p>The mass spectrometry raw data acquired was processed using Protein Lynx Global Server v3.0 (Waters) to identify and annotate the peptides. Non-deuterated samples were used to match against the respective amino acid sequences of NS1c and Fab562 as the search database. The following search parameters were used for accurate matching and annotation: non-specific protease digestion, number of matches within peptide – 3, within protein – 7, a false positive rate of 4%, and a mass error of 1 ppm for precursor peptide. The annotated peptide list obtained was then filtered and analyzed using DynamX 3.0 (Waters) software. Peptides with a minimum intensity of 1000, minimum products per amino acid 0.1, and an MH<sup>+</sup> error of 10 ppm were used to filter out the poor quality and low-scoring peptides. This peptide list obtained from the non-deuterated controls was then used for deuterium exchange analysis using DynamX 3.0. The deuterium exchange data analyzed for the peptides in different sample conditions and across all time points was manually verified. Deuterium uptake was calculated as the difference in the masses of the centroids of the deuterated state and the corresponding non-deuterated control. The differences in deuterium exchange values between two states of the proteins were then checked for statistical significance using Deuteros 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lau et al., 2021</xref>). All peptides with p-value&lt;0.05 were only considered significant. The final analysis yielded 54 peptides covering 95% of NS1c, 31 peptides covering 94% of heavy chain of Fab562, and 33 peptides covering 92.5% of the light chain of Fab562. All HDX experiments were carried out in triplicate independent measurements, and the average deuterium exchange data is tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.

They infect vero cells with DV2-WT and DV2 NS1-T164S (a mutant virus previously characterized by the authors). The authors utilize an anti-NS1 antibody to immunoprecipitate NS1 from cell supernatants and then elute the antibody/NS1 complex with acid. The authors evaluate the eluted NS1 by SDS-PAGE, Native Page, mass spec, negative-stain EM, and eventually Cryo-EM. SDS-PAGE, mas spec, and native page reveal a &gt;250 Kd species containing both NS1 and the proteinaceous component of HDL (ApoA1). The authors produce evidence to suggest that this population is predominantly NS1 in complex with ApoA1. This contrasts with recombinantly produced NS1 (obtained from a collaborator) which did not appear to be in complex with or contain ApoA1 (Figure 1C). The authors then visualize their NS1 stock in complex with their monoclonal antibody by CryoEM. For NS1-WT, the major species visualized by the authors was a ternary complex of an HDL particle in complex with an NS1 dimer bound to their mAB. For their mutant NS1-T164S, they find similar structures, but in contrast to NS1-WT, they visualize free NS1 dimers in complex with 2 Fabs (similar to what's been reported previously) as one of the major species. This highlights that different NS1 species have markedly divergent structural dynamics. It's important to note that the electron density maps for their structures do appear to be a bit overfitted since there are many regions with electron density that do not have a predicted fit and their HDL structure does not appear to have any predicted secondary structure for ApoA1. The authors then map the interaction between NS1 and ApoA1 using cross-linking mass spectrometry revealing numerous NS1-ApoA1 contact sites in the beta-roll and wing domain. The authors find that NS1 isolated from DENV infected mice is also present as a &gt;250 kD species containing ApoA1. They further determine that immunoprecipitation of ApoA1 out of the sera from a single dengue patient correlates with levels of NS1 (presumably COIPed by ApoA1) in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>In the end, the authors make some useful observations for the NS1 field (mostly confirmatory) providing additional insight into the propensity of NS1 to interact with HDL and ApoA1. The study does not provide any functional assays to demonstrate activity of their proteins or conduct mutagenesis (or any other assays) to support their interaction predications. The authors assertion that higher-order NS1 exists primarily as a NS1 dimer in complex with HDL is not well supported as their purification methodology of NS1 likely introduces bias as to what NS1 complexes are isolated. While their results clearly reveal NS1 in complex with ApoA1, the lack of other NS1 homo-oligomers may be explained by how they purify NS1 from virally infected supernatant. Because NS1 produced during viral infection is not tagged, the authors use an anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody to purify NS1. This introduces a source of bias since only NS1 oligomers with their mAb epitope exposed will be purified. Further, the use of acid to elute NS1 may denature or alter NS1 structure and the authors do not include controls to test functionality of their NS1 stocks (capacity to trigger endothelial dysfunction or immune cell activation). The acid elution may force NS1 homo-oligomers into dimers which then reassociate with ApoA1 in a manner that is not reflective of native conditions. Conducting CryoEM of NS1 stocks only in the presence of full-length mAbs or Fabs also severely biases what species of NS1 is visualized since any NS1 oligomers without the B-ladder domain exposed will not be visualized. If the residues obscured by their mAb are involved in formation of higher-order oligomers then this antibody would functionally inhibit these species from forming. The absence of critical controls, use of one mAb, and acid elution for protein purification severely limits the interpretation of these data and do not paint a clear picture of if NS1 produced during infection is structurally distinct from recombinant NS1. Certainly there is novelty in purifying NS1 from virally infected cells, but without using a few different NS1 antibodies to purify NS1 stocks (or better yet a polyclonal population of antibodies) it's unclear if the results of the authors are simply a consequence of the mAb they selected.</p><p>Data produced from numerous labs studying structure and function of flavivirus NS1 proteins provide diverse lines of evidence that the oligomeric state of NS1 is dynamic and can shift depending on context and environment. This means that the methodology used for NS1 production and purification will strongly impact the results of a study. The data in this manuscript certainly capture one of these dynamic states and overall support the general model of a dynamic NS1 oligomer that can associate with both host proteins as well as itself but the assertions of this manuscript are overall too strong given their data, as there is little evidence in this manuscript, and none available in the large body of existing literature, to support that NS1 exists only as a dimer associated with ApoA1. More likely the results of this paper are a result of their NS1 purification methodology.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have not adequately addressed my concerns from the original review. My major concerns are that the binding modality of NS1 to ApoA1/HDL was not validated using a mutagenesis approach and that the overarching conclusion drawn by the authors, that the major species of NS1 in vivo is a dimer in complex with ApoA1, is not supported by the data in this study given the methodology of using a single monoclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate NS1. Certainly, the structures in this manuscript are valuable in confirming that NS1 interacts with HDL and captures a snapshot of NS1/HDL interaction dynamics, but the use of only a single antibody is a major source of bias that makes it challenging to draw conclusions about the oligomeric state of NS1. Further on this point, a critically important control that is missing from this study is to determine if the anti-NS1 mAb 56.2 prevents NS1 from interacting with cells, triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines from immune cells, or mediating endothelial dysfunction of endothelial cells. If this antibody inhibits these NS1-triggered events (linked to pathogenesis), it would suggest that the NS1 within this ternary complex is not active. Presumably some protective anti-NS1 antibodies may function by modulating the oligomeric state of NS1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90762.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Chew et al describe interaction of the flavivirus protein NS1 with HDL using primarily cryoEM and mass spec. The NS1 was secreted from dengue virus infected Vero cells, and the HDL were derived from the 3% FBS in the culture media. NS1 is a virulence factor/toxin and is a biomarker for dengue infection in patients. The mechanisms of its various activities in the host are incompletely understood. NS1 has been seen in dimer, tetramer and hexamer forms. It is well established to interact with membrane surfaces, presumably through a hydrophobic surface of the dimer form, and the recombinant protein has been shown to bind HDL. In this study, cryoEM and crosslinking-mass spec are used to examine NS1 secreted from virus-infected cells, with the conclusion that the sNS1 is predominantly/exclusively HDL-associated through specific contacts with the ApoA1 protein.</p><p>Strengths: The experimental results are consistent with previously published data.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>CryoEM:</p><p>Some of the neg-stain 2D class averages for sNS1 in Fig S1 clearly show 1 or 2 NS1 dimers on the surface of a spherical object, presumably HDL, and indicate the possibility of high-quality cryoEM results. However, the cryoEM results are disappointing. The cryo 2D class averages and refined EM map in Fig S4 are of poor quality, indicating sub-optimal grid preparation or some other sample problem. Some of the FSC curves (2 in Fig S7 and 1 in Fig S6) have extremely peculiar shapes, suggesting something amiss in the map refinement. The sharp drop in the &quot;corrected&quot; FSC curves in Figs S5c and S6c (upper) indicate severe problems. The stated resolutions (3.42 &amp; 3.82 Å) for the sNS1ts-Fab56.2 are wildly incompatible with the images of the refined maps in Figs 3 &amp; S7. At those resolutions, clear secondary structural elements should be visible throughout the map. From the 2D averages and 3D maps shown in the figures, this does not seem to be the case. Local resolution maps should be shown for each structure.</p><p>The samples were clearly challenging for cryoEM, leading to poor quality maps that were difficult to interpret. None of the figures are convincing that NS1, Ab56.2 or Fab56.2 are correctly fit into EM maps. There is no indication of ApoA1 helices. Details of the fit of models to density for key regions of the higher-resolution EM maps should be shown and the models should be deposited in the PDB. An example of modeling difficulty is clear in the sNS1ts dimer with bound Fab56.2 (figs 3c &amp; S7e). For this complex, the orientation of the Fab56.2 relative to the sNS1ts dimer in this submission (Fig 3c) is substantially different than in the bioRxiv preprint (Fig 3c). Regions of empty density in Fig 3c also illustrate the challenge of building a model into this map.</p><p>Mass spec:</p><p>Crosslinking-mass spec was used to detect contacts between NS1 and ApoA1, providing strong validation of the sNS1-HDL association. As the crosslinks were detected in a bulk sample, they show that NS1 is near ApoA1 in many/most HDL particles, but they do not indicate a specific protein-protein complex. Thus, the data do not support the model of an NS1-ApoA1 complex in Fig 4d. Further, a specific NS1-ApoA1 interaction should have evidence in the EM maps (helical density for ApoA1), but none is shown or mentioned. If such exists, it could perhaps be visualized after focused refinement of the map for sNS1ts-HDL with Fab56.2 (Fig S7d). The finding that sNS1-ApoA1 crosslinks involved residues on the hydrophobic surface of the NS1 dimer confirms previous data that this NS1 surface engages with membranes and lipids.</p><p>Sample quality:</p><p>The paper lacks any validation that the purified sNS1 retains established functions, for example the ability to enhance virus infectivity or to promote endothelial dysfunction. Peculiarities include the gel filtration profiles (Fig 2a), which indicate identical elution volumes (apparent MWs) for sNS1wt-HDL bound to Ab562 (~150 kDa) and to the ~3X smaller Fab56.2 (~50 kDa). There should also be some indication of sNS1wt-HDL pairs crosslinked by the full-length Ab, as can be seen in the raw cryoEM micrograph (Fig S5b).</p><p>Obtaining high quality structures is often more demanding of sample integrity than are activity assays. Given the low quality of the cryoEM maps, it's possible that the acidification step in immunoaffinity purification damaged the HDL complex. No validation of HDL integrity, for example with acid-treated HDL, is reported. Acid treatment is perhaps discounted by a statement (line 464) that another group also used immunoaffinity purification in a recent study (ref 20) reporting sNS1 bound to HDL. However the statement is incorrect; the cited study used affinity purification via a strep-tag on recombinant sNS1.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The Discussion reflects a view that the NS1 secreted from virus-infected cells is a 1:1 sNS1dimer:HDL complex with the specific NS1-ApoA1 contacts detected by crosslinking mass spec. This is inconsistent with both the neg-stain 2D class average with 2 sNS1 dimers on an HDL (Fig S1c) and with the recent study of Flamand &amp; co-workers showing 1-3 NS1 dimers per HDL (ref 20). It also ignores the propensity of NS1 to associate with membranes and lipids. It is far more likely that NS1 association with HDL is driven by these hydrophobic interactions than by specific protein-protein contacts. A lengthy Discussion section (lines 461-522) includes several chemically dubious or inconsistent statements, all based on the assumption that specific ApoA1 contacts are essential to NS1 association with HDL and that sNS1 oligomers higher than the dimer necessarily involve ApoA1 interaction, conclusions that are not established by the data in this paper.</p><p>Additional comments on the revised manuscript:</p><p>Comments on the structures:</p><p>The authors kindly provided their fitted atomic models for the 2 reported structures. The EM maps are available in the EMDB. Based on these materials, the derived structures are not well supported due to problems with the models, the maps, and the fit of models to maps.</p><p>Quick inspection revealed that the models for both structures are implausible due to a large steric clash of Fab56.2 and the end of the NS1. The Fab and NS1 protein backbones interpenetrate by nearly 20 Å. This substantial overlap exists for all 3 Fab56.2-NS1 interactions in the 2 structures, and is also visible in the perpendicular views of the NS1 dimer with 2 bound Fab56.2 in Fig. 2c. It appears that the Fab56.2 model was jammed into the NS1 model in order to bring all domains inside the density envelope at the threshold chosen to display the map. The poor fit of model to map is also clear in several protruding density regions without any model.</p><p>The fits of both atomic models to the maps are questionable because</p><p>- The maps suffer from severe preferred orientation problems, as seen in the streaky tubes of density. The streaks in both maps do not match the NS1 beta strands of the fitted models.</p><p>- The shape of the modeled ApoA1 helical ring surrounding the HDL does not match the shape of the EM density. In some regions, the ApoA1 helices are inside the rather strong density for the spherical HDL, but in other regions the helices are outside the density.</p><p>- Both maps have regions of strong density that are adjacent to NS1 but lack any protein model, while other parts of the structure, including the beta-roll domain, lack density.</p><p>- The claimed 4.3-Å resolution of the NS1-Fab56.2 complex is wildly overstated. The local resolution of ~2.5 Å for the &quot;best&quot; part of the structure (Supp Fig. 7E) appears to pertain to the beta strands at the center of the NS1 dimer. However, these density streaks do not match the beta strands of the fit model.</p><p>- The manuscript lacks statistics on the fit of model to map. A standard cryo-EM &quot;Table 1&quot; should include more than is presented in Supp Table 1. The fitted model for at least the higher resolution structure should be deposited in the PDB.</p><p>Comments on the structure interpretation:</p><p>By now it should be abundantly clear that the oligomer state of NS1 is dynamic and highly sensitive to environmental conditions and to each sample's &quot;history&quot;. For the reasons pointed out by reviewer 1, it is not clear that the immunoaffinity purification method captured all forms of sNS1 equally. Thus, the authors insistence that NS1 secreted from virus-infected cells is predominantly bound to HDL particles in a ratio of 1 NS1 dimer per HDL is not well supported. They employ similar arguments to challenge the discovery of sNS1 as a lipoprotein particle (PNAS 2011), contending that the 2011 finding was an artefact of recombinant NS1 production and is irrelevant to sNS1 from a virus infection. The several published structures of NS1 oligomers reveal a large degree of asymmetry in dimer-dimer interaction, consistent with the ability of NS1 to dynamically associate with a variety of hydrophobic entities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors of this study seek to visualize NS1 purified from dengue virus infected cells. They infect vero cells with DV2-WT and DV2 NS1-T164S (a mutant virus previously characterized by the authors). The authors utilize an anti-NS1 antibody to immunoprecipitate NS1 from cell supernatants and then elute the antibody/NS1 complex with acid. The authors evaluate the eluted NS1 by SDS-PAGE, Native Page, mass spec, negative-stain EM, and eventually Cryo-EM. SDS-PAGE, mas spec, and native page reveal a &gt;250 Kd species containing both NS1 and the proteinaceous component of HDL (ApoA1). The authors produce evidence to suggest that this population is predominantly NS1 in complex with ApoA1. This contrasts with recombinantly produced NS1 (obtained from a collaborator) which did not appear to be in complex with or contain ApoA1 (Figure 1C). The authors then visualize their NS1 stock in complex with their monoclonal antibody by CryoEM. For NS1-WT, the major species visualized by the authors was a ternary complex of an HDL particle in complex with an NS1 dimer bound to their mAB. For their mutant NS1-T164S, they find similar structures, but in contrast to NS1-WT, they visualize free NS1 dimers in complex with 2 Fabs (similar to what's been reported previously) as one of the major species. This highlights that different NS1 species have markedly divergent structural dynamics. It's important to note that the electron density maps for their structures do appear to be a bit overfitted since there are many regions with electron density that do not have a predicted fit and their HDL structure does not appear to have any predicted secondary structure for ApoA1. The authors then map the interaction between NS1 and ApoA1 using cross-linking mass spectrometry revealing numerous NS1-ApoA1 contact sites in the beta-roll and wing domain. The authors find that NS1 isolated from DENV infected mice is also present as a &gt;250 kD species containing ApoA1. They further determine that immunoprecipitation of ApoA1 out of the sera from a single dengue patient correlates with levels of NS1 (presumably COIPed by ApoA1) in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>In the end, the authors make some useful observations for the NS1 field (mostly confirmatory) providing additional insight into the propensity of NS1 to interact with HDL and ApoA1. The study does not provide any functional assays to demonstrate activity of their proteins or conduct mutagenesis (or any other assays) to support their interaction predications. The authors assertion that higher-order NS1 exists primarily as a NS1 dimer in complex with HDL is not well supported as their purification methodology of NS1 likely introduces bias as to what NS1 complexes are isolated. While their results clearly reveal NS1 in complex with ApoA1, the lack of other NS1 homo-oligomers may be explained by how they purify NS1 from virally infected supernatant. Because NS1 produced during viral infection is not tagged, the authors use an anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody to purify NS1. This introduces a source of bias since only NS1 oligomers with their mAb epitope exposed will be purified. Further, the use of acid to elute NS1 may denature or alter NS1 structure and the authors do not include controls to test functionality of their NS1 stocks (capacity to trigger endothelial dysfunction or immune cell activation). The acid elution may force NS1 homo-oligomers into dimers which then reassociate with ApoA1 in a manner that is not reflective of native conditions. Conducting CryoEM of NS1 stocks only in the presence of full-length mAbs or Fabs also severely biases what species of NS1 is visualized since any NS1 oligomers without the B-ladder domain exposed will not be visualized. If the residues obscured by their mAb are involved in formation of higher-order oligomers then this antibody would functionally inhibit these species from forming. The absence of critical controls, use of one mAb, and acid elution for protein purification severely limits the interpretation of these data and do not paint a clear picture of if NS1 produced during infection is structurally distinct from recombinant NS1. Certainly there is novelty in purifying NS1 from virally infected cells, but without using a few different NS1 antibodies to purify NS1 stocks (or better yet a polyclonal population of antibodies) it's unclear if the results of the authors are simply a consequence of the mAb they selected.</p><p>Data produced from numerous labs studying structure and function of flavivirus NS1 proteins provide diverse lines of evidence that the oligomeric state of NS1 is dynamic and can shift depending on context and environment. This means that the methodology used for NS1 production and purification will strongly impact the results of a study. The data in this manuscript certainly capture one of these dynamic states and overall support the general model of a dynamic NS1 oligomer that can associate with both host proteins as well as itself but the assertions of this manuscript are overall too strong given their data, as there is little evidence in this manuscript, and none available in the large body of existing literature, to support that NS1 exists only as a dimer associated with ApoA1. More likely the results of this paper are a result of their NS1 purification methodology.</p><p>Suggestions for the Authors:</p><p>Major:</p><p>(1) Because of the methodology used for NS1 purification, it is not clear from the data provided if NS1 from viral infection differs from recombinant NS1. Isolating NS1 from viral infection using a polyclonal antibody population would be better to answer their questions. On this point, Vero cells are also not the best candidate for their NS1 production given these cells do not come from a human. A more relevant cell line like U937-DC-SIGN would be preferable.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an optimization of sNS1 secretion from DENV infection in different cell lines (Author response image 1 below) to identify the best cell line candidate to obtain relatively high yield of sNS1 for the study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the levels of sNS1 in the tested human cell lines Huh7 and HEK 293T were at least 3-5 fold lower than in Vero cells. Although using a monocytic cell line expressing DC-SIGN as suggested by the reviewer would be ideal, in our experience the low infectivity of DENV in monocytic cell lines will not yield sufficient amount of sNS1 needed for structural analysis. For these practical reasons we decided to use the closely related non-human primate cell line Vero for sNS1 production supported by our optimization data.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>sNS1 secretion in different mammalian and mosquito cell lines after DENV2 infection.</title><p>The NS1 secretion level is measured using PlateliaTM Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA kit (Bio-Rad) on day 3 (left) and day 5 (right) post infection respectively.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90762-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors need to support their interaction predictions and models via orthogonal assays like mutagenesis followed by HDL/ApoA1 complexing and even NS1 functional assays.

Interestingly the TS mutant derived sNS1 induced a higher proinflammatory cytokines production than WT virus derived sNS1 that appears to correlate with the more lethal and severe disease phenotype in mice as also reported in our previous work (Chan et al., 2019). Additionally, the functionality of our immune-affinity purified infection derived sNS1 (isNA1) is now further supported by our preliminary results on the NS1 induced endothelial cell permeability assay using the purified WT and mutant isNS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, both the isNS1wt and isNS1ts mutant reduced the relative transendothelial resistance from 0 to 9 h post-treatment, with the peak resistance reduction observed at 6 h post-treatment, suggesting that the purified isNS1 induced endothelial dysfunction as reported in Puerta-Guardo et al., 2019, Cell Rep. It is noteworthy that the isNS1 in our study behaves similarly as the commercial recombinant sNS1 (rsNS1 purchased from the same source used in study by Puerta-Guardo et al., 2019) in inducing endothelial hyperpermeability. Collectively our previous published and current data suggest that the purified isNS1 (as a complex with ApoA1) has a pathogenic role in disease pathogenesis that is also supported in a recent publication by Benfrid et al., EMBO 2022.

We would like to reiterate that we have previously used sNS1 from immunoaffinity purification followed by acid elution to test its function in stimulating PBMCs to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chan et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Similar to Modhiran et al. (2015) and Benfrid et al. (2022), the sNS1 that we extracted using acid elution are capable of activating PBMCs to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have now further demonstrated the ability of both WT and TS isNS1 in inducing endothelial permeability in vitro in hUVECs, using the TEER assay (Author response image 3). Based on the data presented in the rebuttal figures as well as our previous publication we do not think that the acid elution has a significant impact on function of isNS1.</p><p>We performed affinity purification to enrich the complex for better imaging and analysis (Supp Fig. 1b) since the crude supernatant contains serum proteins and serum-free infections also do not provide sufficient isNS1. The major complex observed in negative stain is 1:1 (also under acidic conditions which implies that the complex are stable and intact). We agree that it is possible that other oligomers can form but we have observed only a small population (74 out of 3433 particles, 2.15%; 24 micrographs) of HDL:sNS1 complex at 1:2 ratio as shown in the Author response image 4 below and in the manuscript (p. 4 lines 114-117, Supp Fig. 1c). Other NS1 dimer:HDL ratios including 2:1 and 3:1 have been reported by Benfrid et al., 2022 by spiking healthy sera with recombinant sNS1 and subsequent re-affinity purification. However, this method used an approximately 8-fold higher sNS1 concentration (400 ug/mL) than the maximum clinically reported concentration (50 ug/mL) (Young et al., 2000; Alcon et al., 2002; Libraty et al., 2002). In our hands, the sNS1 concentration in the concentrated media from in vitro infection was quantified as 30 ug/mL which is more physiologically relevant.</p><p>We conclude that the integrity of the HDL of the complex is not lost during sample preparation, as we are able to observe the complex under the negative staining EM as well as infer from XL-MS. Our rebuttal data and our previous studies with our acid-eluted isNS1 from immunoaffinity purification clearly show that our protein is functional and biologically relevant.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative negative stain micrograph of sNS1wt (<bold>B</bold>) Representative 2D averages of negative stained isNS1wt.

Whitehorn, J., Farrar. J., Eds., Clinical Insights in Dengue: Transmission, Diagnosis &amp; Surveillance. The Future Medicine (2014), pp. 83-101. Our previous manuscript examined this mutation by engineering it into a less virulent clade 2 DENV isolated in Singapore and showed that sNS1 production was higher without any change in viral RNA replication. Transcript profiling of mutant compared to WT virus showed that genes that are usually induced during vascular leakage were upregulated for the mutant. We also showed that infection of interferon deficient AG129 mice with the mutant virus resulted in disease severity, increased complement protein expression in the liver, tissue inflammation and greater mortality compared to WT virus infected mice. The lipid profiling in our study (Chan et al., 2019) suggested small differences with WT but was overall similar to HDL as described by Gutsche et al. (2011). We were intrigued by our functional results and wanted to explore more deeply the impact of the mutation on sNS1 structure which at that stage was widely believed to be a trimer of NS1 dimers with a central channel (~ X Å) stuffed with lipid as established in several seminal publications (Flamand et al., 1999; Gutsche et al., 2011; Muller et al., 2012). In fact “This Week in Virology” netcast (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-725/">https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-725/</ext-link>) discussed two back-to-back publications in Science (Modhiran et al., 371(6625)190-194; Biering et al., Science 371(6625):194-200) which showed that therapeutic antibodies can ameliorate the NS1 induced pathogenesis and expert discussants posed questions that also pointed to the need for more accurate definition of the molecular composition and architecture of the circulating NS1 complex during virus infection to get a clearer handle on its pathogenic mechanism. Our current studies and also the recent high resolution cryoEM structures (Shu et al., 2022) do not support the notion of a central channel “stuffed with lipid”. Even in the rare instances where trimer of dimers are shown, the narrow channel in the center could only accommodate one molecule of lipoid molecule no bigger than a typical triglyceride molecule. This hexamer model cannot explain the lipid proeotmics data in the literature.</p><p>In our study we observed predominantly 1:1 NS1 dimer to HDL (~30 μg/mL) mirroring maximum clinically reported concentration of sNS1 in the sera of DENV patients (40-50 μg/mL) as we highlighted in our main text (P. 18, lines 461-471). What is often quoted (also see later) is the recent study of Flamand &amp; co-workers which show 1-3 NS1 dimers per HDL (Benfrid et al, 2022) by spiking rsNS1 (400 μg/mL) with HDL. This should not be confused with the previous models which suggested a lipid filled central channel holding together the hexamer. The use of physiologically relevant concentrations is important for these studies as we have highlighted in our main text (P. 18, lines 461-471).</p><p>Our interpretation for the mutant (isNS1ts) is that it is possible that the hydrophilic serine at residue 164 located in the greasy finger loop may weaken the isNS1ts binding to HDL hence the observation of free sNS1 dimers in our immunoaffinity purified (acid eluted sample). The disease severity and increased complement protein expression in AG129 mice liver can be ascribed to weakly bound mutant NS1 with fast on/off rate with HDL being transported to the liver where specific receptors bind to free sNS1 and interact with effector proteins such as complement to drive inflammation and associated pathology. Our indirect support for this is that the XL-MS analysis of purified isNS1ts identified only 7 isNS1ts:ApoA1 crosslinks while 25 isNS1wt:ApoA1 crosslinks were identified from purified isNS1wt (refer to Fig. 4 and Supp. Fig. 8).</p><p>Taken together, the cryoEM and XL-MS analysis of purified isNS1ts suggest that isNS1ts has weaker affinity for HDL compared to isNS1wt. We welcome constructive discussion on our interpretation that we and others will hopefully obtain more data to support or deny our proposed explanation. Our focus has been to compare WT with mutant sNS1 from DENV2 and we agree that it will be useful to study other serotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>CryoEM:</p><p>Some of the neg-stain 2D class averages for sNS1 in Fig S1 clearly show 1 or 2 NS1 dimers on the surface of a spherical object, presumably HDL, and indicate the possibility of high-quality cryoEM results. However, the cryoEM results are disappointing. The cryo 2D class averages and refined EM map in Fig S4 are of poor quality, indicating sub-optimal grid preparation or some other sample problem. Some of the FSC curves (2 in Fig S7 and 1 in Fig S6) have extremely peculiar shapes, suggesting something amiss in the map refinement. The sharp drop in the &quot;corrected&quot; FSC curves in Figs S5c and S6c (upper) indicate severe problems. The stated resolutions (3.42 &amp; 3.82 Å) for the sNS1ts-Fab56.2 are wildly incompatible with the images of the refined maps in Figs 3 &amp; S7. At those resolutions, clear secondary structural elements should be visible throughout the map. From the 2D averages and 3D maps shown in the figures this does not seem to be the case. Local resolution maps should be shown for each structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The same sample is used for negative staining and the cryoEM results presented. The cryoEM 2D class averages are similar to the negative stain ones, with many spherical-like densities with no discernible features, presumably HDL only or the NS1 features are averaged out. The key difference lies in the 2D class averages where the NS1 could be seen. The side views of NS1 (wing-like protrusion) are more obvious in the negative stain while the top views of NS1 (cross shaped-like protrusion) are more obvious under cryoEM. HDL particles are inherently heterogeneous and known to range from 70-120 Å, this has been highlighted in the main text (p. 8, lines 203 and 228). This helps to explain why the reviewer may find the cryoEM result disappointing. The sample is inherently challenging to resolve structurally as it is (not that the sample is of poor quality). In terms of grid preparation, Supp Fig 4b shows a representative motion-corrected micrograph of the isNS1ts sample whereby individual particles can be discerned and evenly distributed across the grid at high density.</p><p>We acknowledge that most of the dips in the FSC curves (Fig S5-7) are irregular and affect the accuracy of the stated resolutions, particularly for the HDL-isNS1ts-Fab56.2 and isNS1ts-Fab56.2 maps for which the local resolution maps are shown (Fig S7d-e). Probable reasons affecting the FSC curves include (1) the heterogeneous nature of HDL, (2) preferred orientation issue (p 7, lines 198 -200), and (3) the data quality is intrinsically less ideal for high resolution single particle analysis. Optimizing of the dynamic masking such that the mask is not sharper than the resolution of the map for the near (default = 3 angstroms) and far (12 angstroms) parameters during data processing, ranging from 6 - 12 and 14 - 20 respectively, did not help to improve the FSC curves. To report a more accurate global resolution, we have revised the figures S5-7 with new FSC curve plots generated using the remote 3DFSC processing server.</p><p>Regardless, the overall architecture and the relative arrangement of NS1 dimer, Fab, and HDL are clearly visible and identifiable in the map. These results agree well with our biochemical data and mass-spec data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The samples were clearly challenging for cryoEM, leading to poor quality maps that were difficult to interpret. None of the figures are convincing that NS1, Ab56.2 or Fab56.2 are correctly fit into EM maps. There is no indication of ApoA1 helices. Details of the fit of models to density for key regions of the higher-resolution EM maps should be shown and the models should be deposited in the PDB. An example of modeling difficulty is clear in the sNS1ts dimer with bound Fab56.2 (figs 3c &amp; S7e). For this complex, the orientation of the Fab56.2 relative to the sNS1ts dimer in this submission (Fig 3c) is substantially different than in the bioRxiv preprint (Fig 3c). Regions of empty density in Fig 3c also illustrate the challenge of building a model into this map.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the modelling challenge posed by low resolution maps in general, such as the handedness of the Fab molecule as pointed out by the reviewer (which is why others have developed the use of anti-fab nanobody to aid in structure determination among other methods). The change in orientation of the Fab56.2 relative to the sNS1ts dimer was informed by the HDX-MS results which was not done at the point of bioRxiv preprint mentioned. With regards to indication of ApoA1 helices, this is expected given the heterogeneous nature of HDL. To the best of our knowledge, engineered apoA1 helices were also not reported in many cryoEM structures of membrane proteins solved in membrane scaffold protein (MSP) nanodiscs. This is despite nanodiscs, comprised of engineered apoA1 helices, having well-defined size classifications.</p><p>Regions of weak density in Fig 3c is expected due to the preferred orientation issue acknowledged in the results section of the main text (p. 9, line 245). The cryoEM density maps have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under accession codes EMD-36483 (isNS1ts:Fab56.2) and EMD-36480 (Fab56.2:isNS1ts:HDL).

As the crosslinks were detected in a bulk sample, they show that NS1 is near ApoA1 in many/most HDL particles, but they do not indicate a specific protein-protein complex. Thus, the data do not support the model of an NS1-ApoA1 complex in Fig 4d. Further, a specific NS1-ApoA1 interaction should have evidence in the EM maps (helical density for ApoA1), but none is shown or mentioned. If such exists, it could perhaps be visualized after focused refinement of the map for sNS1ts-HDL with Fab56.2 (Fig S7d). The finding that sNS1-ApoA1 crosslinks involved residues on the hydrophobic surface of the NS1 dimer confirms previous data that this NS1 surface engages with membranes and lipids.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The XL-MS is a method to identify the protein-protein interactions by proximity within the spacer arm length of the crosslinker. The crosslinking MS data do support the NS1-ApoA1 complex model obtained by cryo-EM because the identified crosslinks that are superimposed on the EM map are within the cut-off distance of 30 Å. We agree that the XL-MS data do not dictate the specific interactions between specific residues of NS1-ApoA1 in the EM model. We also do not claim that specific residue of NS1 in beta roll or wing domain is interacting with specific residue of ApoA1 in H4 and H5 domain. We claim that beta roll and wing domain regions of NS1 are interacting with ApoA1 in HDL indicating the proximity nature of NS1-ApoA1 interactions as warranted by the XL-MS data.</p><p>As explained in the previous response on the lack of indication of ApoA1 helical density, this is expected given the heterogeneous nature of HDL. It is typical to see lipid membranes as unstructured and of lower density than the structured protein. In our study, local refinement was performed on either the global map (presented in Fig S7d) or focused on the NS1-Fab region only. Both yielded similar maps as illustrated in the real space slices shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig5">Author response image 5</xref>. The mask and map overlay is depicted in similar orientations to the real space slices, and at different contour thresholds at 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig5">Author response image 5e</xref>) and 0.135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa3fig5">Author response image 5f</xref>). While the overall map is of poor resolution and directional anisotropy evident, there is clear signal differences in the low density region (i.e. the HDL sphere) indicative of NS1 interaction with ApoA1 in HDL, extending from the NS1 wing to the base of the HDL sphere.</p><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p>Real Space Slices of map and mask used during Local Refinement for overall structure (<bold>a-b</bold>) and focused mask on NS1 region (<bold>c-d</bold>).

This is inconsistent with both the neg-stain 2D class average with 2 sNS1 dimers on an HDL (Fig S1c) and with the recent study of Flamand &amp; co-workers showing 1-3 NS1 dimers per HDL (ref 20). It is also ignores the propensity of NS1 to associate with membranes and lipids. It is far more likely that NS1 association with HDL is driven by these hydrophobic interactions than by specific protein-protein contacts. A lengthy Discussion section (lines 461-522) includes several chemically dubious or inconsistent statements, all based on the assumption that specific ApoA1 contacts are essential to NS1 association with HDL and that sNS1 oligomers higher than the dimer necessarily involve ApoA1 interaction, conclusions that are not established by the data in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer and have revised our discussion to cover available structural and functional data to draw conclusions that invariably also need further validation by others.
