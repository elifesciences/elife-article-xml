In this study, we develop a novel taste learning paradigm using closed-loop optogenetics.

As with olfactory memories, distinct dopaminergic subpopulations drive the parallel formation of short- and long-term appetitive memories. Long-term memories are protein synthesis-dependent and have energetic requirements that are satisfied by a variety of caloric food sources or by direct stimulation of MB-MP1 dopaminergic neurons.

The gustatory system plays a critical role in evaluating the nutritional qualities of foods, and is generally thought to evoke innate appetitive or aversive behavioral responses. However, the degree to which taste processing can be modified by learning is unclear.</p><p>In flies, taste detection is mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) located on the proboscis, pharynx, legs, wing margins, and ovipositor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stocker, 1994</xref>). GRNs express a range of chemosensory receptors for detecting sugars, bitters, salts, and other contact chemical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Dahanukar, 2020</xref>). GRNs project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) of the fly brain, where taste information is segregated based on modality, valence, and organ of detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although the valence of a specific taste is generally set, the intensity of the response can vary substantially according to internal state. Starvation increases a fly’s sensitivity to sweet tastes and blunts bitter responses through direct modulation of GRN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeDue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, flies lacking essential nutrients such as amino acids and salts exhibit increased nutrient-specific preference toward foods containing those substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steck et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to internal state-dependent changes in nutrient drive, fly taste responses can be altered by experience. Most notably, short-term taste-specific suppression of appetitive responses can be achieved through pairing the appetitive taste with either bitter stimulation or noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tauber et al., 2017</xref>). This plasticity requires an integrative memory association area called the mushroom body (MB), which is known to represent different sensory modalities, including olfaction and taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, while taste responses are executed by innate circuits, they also exhibit experience-dependent changes driven by the adaptable networks of the MBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The MBs are composed of approximately ~4000 intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs), whose dendrites receive inputs from different sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). KCs form <italic>en passant</italic> synapses with mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), and MBONs send projections to neuropils outside of the MBs to modulate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Each MBON receives KC input in a specific region of the MB called a ‘compartment’, and activation of an MBON typically evokes either a positive (approach) or negative (avoidance) valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). Integration across many MBON responses is thought to produce the final behavioral valence and intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Much of what we know about the mechanisms of associative memory formation in the MB comes from studies pairing olfactory stimuli with either sugar (reward) or electric shock (punishment). In these paradigms, an odor serves as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and produces sparse activation of a unique combination of KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tempel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tully, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). Meanwhile, sugar or electric shock serves as the unconditioned stimulus (US) by evoking activity in distinct populations of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) – protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) DANs are activated by sugar, while protocerebral posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) DANs are activated by shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Waddell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gervasi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomchik and Davis, 2009</xref>). DANs target specific MB compartments, where dopamine functions to depress the synaptic connections between active KCs and the compartment’s MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, rewarding PAM DANs generally target compartments with MBONs carrying negative valence, while PPL1 DANs target compartments with MBONs carrying positive valence. Thus, the resulting change in synaptic weights following concurrent activation of KCs with either PAM or PPL1 skews behavior toward either approach or avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this model, direct activation of DANs in the absence of any rewarding or punishing stimulus can function as a US in some fly associative learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Optogenetic or thermogenetic activation of PAM DANs following, or in coincidence with, an odor results in the formation of an appetitive memory. Meanwhile, activation of punishing PPL1 DANs leads to the formation of an aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). A similar phenomenon has also been demonstrated in mice, where phasic optogenetic activation of specific dopaminergic subsets can lead to the formation of conditioned behaviors, even in the absence of a physical reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>DAN populations are also segregated by the type of memory formed, as appetitive short-term memories (STM) and long-term memories (LTM) are formed by independent PAM subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Waddell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, whereas STM may be formed with a sweet tasting reward on its own, the formation of LTM requires a sweet and nutritious US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Waddell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Musso et al., 2015</xref>). Caloric sugars are thought to gate memory consolidation by promoting sustained rhythmic activity of MB-MP1 DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, this signaling may occur up to 5 hr post ingestion, suggesting that there is a critical time window for the formation of LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although flies are known to exhibit aversive short-term taste memories, the full extent to which taste behaviors are modifiable by learning is unknown. Can taste responses be enhanced by appetitive conditioning? Can flies form LTM about taste? These are difficult questions to answer using traditional methods for several reasons. First, appetitive association paradigms generally rely on food as the US, which interferes with the representation of a taste CS and can also modify future taste behaviors through changes in satiety state. Second, taste is an active sense, and animals typically have behavioral control over exposure to the stimulus. Thus, repeated temporal pairing of a taste CS with a US is difficult to achieve in flies without immobilization, making LTM difficult to test. Moreover, the self-control over taste exposure under more natural conditions could support operant learning with neural and molecular mechanisms that are distinct from classic olfactory conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brembs, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To probe the potential of taste learning, we developed an optogenetic learning paradigm that couples a taste (the CS) with optogenetic GRN or DAN stimulation (the US). Using this novel paradigm, we show that flies can form both appetitive and aversive short- and long-term taste memories. As in olfaction, appetitive taste memories are driven by discrete PAM populations, and activation of a single PAM subpopulation is sufficient to induce appetitive LTM. The formation of appetitive LTM requires de novo protein synthesis and is contingent on caloric intake. Moreover, sugar, certain amino acids, and lactic acid can provide the energy required to support LTM formation, and this requirement is also satisfied by thermogenetic activation of MB-MP1 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pairing GRN activation with a food source leads to taste memory formation</title><p>We previously developed a system called the sip-triggered optogenetic behavioral enclosure (STROBE), in which individual flies are placed in an arena with free access to two odorless food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musso et al., 2019</xref>). Interactions (mostly sips) with one food source triggers nearly instantaneous activation of a red LED, which can be used for optogenetic stimulation of neurons expressing CsChrimson.

Bitter GRN stimulation is known to activate PPL1 DANs, while sweet GRNs activate PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masek et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, bitter or sweet GRN activation with <italic>Gr66a-</italic> or <italic>Gr43a-Gal4</italic> is sufficient for STM induction in taste and olfactory associative learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether pairing GRN activation with feeding on a single taste modality could create an associative taste memory that altered subsequent behavior to the taste.</p><p>In the aversive taste memory paradigm, interactions with 25 mM sucrose (CS<sup>+</sup>) during training triggered LED activation of Gr66a bitter neurons expressing CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This led to CS<sup>+</sup> avoidance relative to plain agar (CS<sup>-</sup>) during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During testing, we disabled the STROBE lights and measured preference toward 25 mM sucrose (CS<sup>+</sup>) relative to agar (CS<sup>-</sup>) to see if flies have formed aversive taste memories. Indeed, 10 min after training, flies that experienced bitter GRN activation during training showed a lower sugar preference than control flies lacking the obligate CsChrimson cofactor all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal or not expressing CsChrimson. Like most of the experiments that will follow, there was high variance in the behavior of individual flies during both training and testing, undoubtedly reflecting a combination of individual variation in internal state, past experiences, response to training, as well as stochastic effects during the measurement time period. Examining the preference indices over time revealed that the difference in preference emerged after about 30 min of testing, which could either reflect a progressive divergence in behavior between the groups or, more likely, increased reliability of the preference measurement as sips accumulate over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A similar aversive memory was also produced by the activation of PPK23<sup>glut</sup> ‘high salt’ GRNs, which carry a negative valence in salt-satiated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Importantly, these effects are not due to heightened satiety in trained flies, because training in this paradigm is associated with fewer food interactions than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>For appetitive training, we chose 75 mM NaCl as the CS<sup>+</sup>, since flies show neither strong attraction nor aversion to this concentration of salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).

In both cases, sweet GRN activation produced an increased preference for the salt CS<sup>+</sup> during training and testing 10 min later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The increased preference is evident early during testing and maintained throughout the testing phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Like the aversive memory paradigm, the effects of appetitive conditioning cannot easily be explained through changes in internal state, since trained flies interacted more with the food during training and therefore should have a lower salt drive during testing. Interestingly, refeeding flies with standard medium directly after training in the appetitive paradigm led to a long-term preference for the CS<sup>+</sup>, revealed by testing 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

First, flies trained with NaCl as the CS<sup>+</sup> and agar as the CS<sup>-</sup> showed no preference between two identical agar options during testing, ruling out the possibility that the increased CS<sup>+</sup> preference observed in prior experiments was driven by a spatial memory or other non-CS<sup>+</sup> local cues such as deposited pheromones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This remains true when using sweet sensory neuron activation as the US, which, unlike PAM stimulation, drives elevated preference for the salt option during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we found that a second tastant, monopotassium glutamate (MPG), could replace NaCl as the CS<sup>+</sup>. MPG is approximately equally appetitive to NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and pairing of MPG with PAM activation resulted in a robust appetitive memory to MPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, training with NaCl as the CS<sup>+</sup> and MPG as the CS<sup>-</sup> produced an appetitive memory for NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, flies trained with NaCl as the CS<sup>+</sup> and agar as the CS<sup>-</sup> did not show elevated preference for MPG introduced as a novel tastant during testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

To confirm the necessity of this feeding, we tested flies that were not fed after training or were fed 7 hr post training, after the memory consolidation time period defined in olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Yet, little is known about how experience influences higher-order taste representations and contributes to the continuous refinement of food selection. In fact, a memory system for the recollection of appetitive taste memories has not been described in flies. In this study, we use the STROBE to establish a novel learning paradigm and further investigate the formation and expression of taste memories. We demonstrate that flies can form short- and long-term appetitive and aversive taste memories toward two key nutrients – salt and sugar. Much like olfactory memory, associative taste memory formation occurs within the MB and follows many of the same circuit and energetic principles.</p><p>It is perhaps not surprising that olfactory and taste memories share common principles; however, important distinctions exist between olfactory and taste learning paradigms that justify the possibility that this may not have been the case. Most notably, using taste as a CS in a free feeding situation where reinforcement is temporally coupled to food contact creates the potential for operant, rather than classical, conditioning. These two types of learning can employ distinct neural circuits in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>) and are separable by their synaptic properties and molecular mechanisms in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brembs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brembs and Plendl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hawkins and Byrne, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, when flies are tethered in a flight arena and punishment is predicted by a mixture of classical (color) and operant (self-motion) cues, the classical conditioning system overrides the operant conditioning system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brembs and Plendl, 2008</xref>). In the STROBE, our data suggests that the fly learns the tastant as a classical cue, despite the operant component of the reinforcement contingencies. Thus, the conservation between olfactory and taste learning mechanisms is consistent with past studies.</p><p>Although aversive taste memories have been established, prior evidence for appetitive taste memories has been sparse. Rats’ hedonic response to bitter compounds can be made more positive through pairing with sugar, and human studies suggest that children’s taste palates are malleable based on positive experiences with bitter vegetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breslin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Figueroa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forestell and LoLordo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wadhera et al., 2015</xref>).

This may be surprising, given that NaCl on its own activates sweet GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marella et al., 2006</xref>). However, 75 mM NaCl moderately activates only about one third of sweet GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dweck et al., 2022</xref>), and thus appetitive memory formation may be driven by strong activation of the broader sweet neuron population. Nevertheless, using direct stimulation of DANs as the US afforded us the ability to reduce this complication and also interrogate the roles of specific DAN populations. Taking a hypothesis-driven approach, we confirmed that PAM neural subpopulations reinforce taste percepts much like olfactory inputs, and that STM and LTM are processed by distinct subpopulations. For example, activating β’2, γ4, and γ5 compartments with <italic>R48B04-Gal4</italic> produces STM in both olfactory and taste paradigms, while activation of α1, β’1, β2, and γ5 with <italic>R15A04-Gal4</italic> produces LTM in both. These results confirm that appetitive short- and long-term taste memories are processed in parallel in the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Given that tastes, like odors, activate the KC calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>), we speculate that optogenetic stimulation of PAM neurons during feeding modulates the strength of KC-MBON synaptic connections. Notably, activation of single PAM cell types produced different forms of memory in the STROBE. For example, stimulating PAM-α1 neurons during feeding drives appetitive taste LTM, while activation of PAM-β’1 was immediately rewarding.</p><p>The activation of bitter GRNs paired with sucrose led to the formation of STM, which agrees with previous research demonstrating that thermogenetic stimulation of bitter GRNs can negatively reinforce short-term taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keene and Masek, 2012</xref>). However, unlike sweet neuron activation, bitter neuron activation was not sufficient for the formation of LTM in our assay. One possible explanation is that the strong feeding inhibition evoked by bitter GRN activation leads to an insufficient number of CS-US pairings to induce LTM. Consistent with this idea, PPL1 activation, which induced LTM, is less aversive than bitter neuron activation during training, and therefore allows more associations.</p><p>A unique aspect of our long-term taste learning paradigm is that we uncoupled the US from a caloric food source. By doing this we were able to probe the energetic constraints gating LTM formation. It has long been reported that LTM formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires the intake of caloric sugar. Here, we demonstrate that the caloric requirements of LTM formation can be fulfilled by food sources other than sucrose, including lactic acid and yeast extract. Moreover, it seems that at least one amino acid, L-alanine, is able to provide adequate energy, while others like L-aspartic acid cannot. We theorize that these foods may provide flies with readily accessible energy, as neurons are able to metabolize both lactic acid and L-alanine into pyruvate to fuel the production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Tredern et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Energy gating in the MB is thought to be regulated by the MB-MP1-DANs. MB-MP1 neuron oscillations activate increased mitochondrial energy flux within the KCs, which is both necessary and sufficient to support LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). To demonstrate sufficiency in our assay, we activated MB-MP1 neurons with TRPA1 directly after fly training. This effectively substitutes for a caloric food source and allows LTM formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that MB-MP1 neurons integrate energy signals during the formation of multiple types of LTM, and may be influenced by a variety of caloric foods.</p><p>Despite the advantages of replacing natural stimuli with optogenetic stimulation, there are also limitations. Most notably, optogenetic activation may not closely replicate temporal dynamics, intensity, or population features of natural stimulus encoding. Contact with food in the STROBE activates LED illumination with a relatively low latency of about 37±17 ms, but would not be expected to precisely mimic the onset of activation from natural taste stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musso et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, bitter and acidic stimuli are known to evoke OFF responses that would not be replicated in the STROBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>). Given the proposed importance of GRN temporal dynamics to higher-order neuronal plasticity, the critical role of timing between KC and DAN activation for MB plasticity, and the broad importance of timing to various synaptic plasticity mechanisms, it is easy to imagine that temporal differences between optogenetics and natural stimuli could differentially affect learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devineni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). Optogenetics and natural stimuli also undoubtedly activate different neuron populations. For example, <italic>Gr64f-Gal4</italic> labels most sweet sensory neurons, but the distribution of these neurons on different taste organs makes coincident activation of all these populations unlikely under natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, direct DAN stimulation affects only a small subset of the neurons activated upon sugar taste detection and consumption, and likely therefore does not capture all of the effects that sugar has on appetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the features of optogenetic activation are clearly sufficient to drive plasticity and learning.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that lasting changes in the value of specific tastes can occur in response to temporal association with appetitive or aversive stimuli, raising the possibility that such plasticity plays an important role in animals’ ongoing taste responses. It is interesting to speculate on what could serve as the US under more natural conditions. One obvious possibility is that pairing of different tastes (e.g. sugar and salt) in complex foods allows one taste to serve as the US and modifies future responses to the other. Intriguingly, tastes may also have the ability to self-reinforce over time, as shown for some odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato et al., 2022</xref>). Another possibility is that natural association of tastes with non-taste reinforcers such as pain or mating could modify subsequent behavior. Future experiments using the STROBE paradigm could further probe the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying taste memories and advance our understanding of how taste preferences may be shaped by experience over an animal’s lifetime.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Fly stocks were raised on a standard cornmeal diet at 25°C, 70% relative humidity.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Riemensperger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed a high interest and, provided you can address the following issues, are supportive of publication of your manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers were particularly impressed by the assay you have developed and its potential in resolving more dynamic aspects of perception and learning. In a revised version of the manuscript, please address especially the following points:</p><p>1. The reviewers recommend taking better advantage of your operant assay. Please show the data as original traces and not just box plots for the learning and recall phase. In addition, please explain why this is not 'simply' associative learning with one pairing as usually used in standard olfactory learning assays.</p><p>2. Explain the putative perceptual differences between optogenetic activation and real stimuli, for instance for sugar reward vs. exogenous activation of sweet taste neurons. Along the same lines, please show the data during learning as traces to help evaluate how actual stimulus perception during training impacts on learning.</p><p>3. Add reciprocal controls for at least one of the conditions.</p><p>4. We recommend making the manuscript more accessible to scientists not familiar with <italic>Drosophila</italic> memory paradigms by providing more explanation and interpretation of your data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few suggestions to improve the manuscript further:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>(Line numbering would have been helpful…)</p><p>You write at the end of the first page, that DANs are activated by reward and punishment. They are also activated/modulated, for instance, by metabolic state and movement. Both of these aspects might be highly relevant in your operant assay.</p><p>End of p 3: 'while maintaining similar satiation states': this statement contrasts somewhat with some other statements you make regarding interaction with the food source and even the shown bar graphs during training. This needs to be taken into consideration and explained a little better.</p><p>Beginning of page 8 and Figures 5 and 6: please correct the references to and/or labeling of the panels. In addition, I did not find the data for the 7-hour delayed refeeding. Figure 6C does not exist.</p><p>In the schemes, the light dot is always shown only on one side of the brain. Is this correct that you are activating only unilaterally? I guess not and I found it somewhat confusing…</p><p>There were several typos or small mistakes that must be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figures:</p><p>The authors describe the learning as a preference index, which is calculated from the number of interactions (sips) with the CSs. Does also the length of sip bouts change? Maybe it would be worth looking also at overall feeding time. This could be especially interesting as flies that have been trained with GR66a activation, still prefer the sugar CS over several minutes at the beginning of the test. Maybe these are just very short bouts. Is there an explanation for this phenotype? Are the flies maybe more food deprived, because they receive less sugar in the training?</p><p>It is unclear what L/R means in Figure 1C/E/G, as this is also not explained in the legend. I assume it is the left/right side of CSs. Could this be renamed as CS+/Cs-, or red light/ no red light?</p><p>The LLM/LTM can only be induced by feeding caloric food to the flies directly after training, this is a very important piece of information that does not show up in the figures. The authors should explain this fact a bit better in the text and maybe add this below the relevant graphs too (refeeding, yes/no), this would be especially helpful in Figure 6 where they do not receive food at all after training? For people not familiar with LTM this is hard to follow.</p><p>In Figure 3 some of the dots below the graphs do not seem to be in the right place. Please check 3A/B, they are different from 3C/D, but should be the same?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The paradigm that the authors present uses operant training, where the fly can decide how much they want to eat from each tastant presented. It would be great to have a paragraph in the discussion where the similarities and differences to previously studied classical conditioning are elucidated and results are compared. The authors could also cite work from the Brembs lab. In terms of reinforcement vs. US function of dopamine neurons, there was a recent biorxiv paper that could be cited if that is possible.: Pain is so close to pleasure: the same dopamine neurons can mediate approach and avoidance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> | bioRxiv Rohrsen et al., 2021.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript Optogenetic induction of appetitive and aversive taste memories in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Jelen and colleagues is interesting, well written and the experiments elaborated, and the data provided by the authors justifies the title of the manuscript. The technique provided by the authors is very interesting and will attract a broad readership mainly of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community as gustatory learning paradigms are yet tricky and not feasible for mass assays. The novel technique provided by Jelen and colleagues will pave the way to investigate gustatory learning now in more detail. In addition, the fact that the animals can freely move greatly improves the possibilities to investigate gustatory learning. Despite the high potential of the manuscript to reach out to a broad readership I would like to address some points of concern that the authors may want to address before publication.</p><p>In the first set of experiments the authors pair the artificial activation of bitter gustatory neurons with a low concentrated sugar solution as (CS+), whereas pure agar is presented as (CS-). To control for the learnability of a conditioned stimulus the authors have to ensure that the (CS-) and (CS+) are both equally learnable. Therefore, the authors should on the one hand provide first a naïve preference index between the two stimuli to demonstrate that both are equally perceived by the fly. On the other hand, the authors should equilibrate the conditioned stimuli in such a way that once agar is reinforced and once 25% sugar and display a learning index instead of the performance index. This of course should be done similarly for the NaCl conditioned stimulus.</p><p>It further appears that the (CS+) source is always situated on the left side of the experimental setup and the (CS-) always on the right side, if the indication of the interaction numbers are well understood. In order to avoid any place component that may interfere with the actual learning pathways the authors investigate the authors should also equilibrate the place of (CS+) presentation in relation to the (CS-).</p><p>According to many learning theories the learnability of a (CS+) is strongly increased when (CS+) and (US) are presented overlapping but with a time delay. Seen that the artificial activation of gustatory neurons together with the presentation of low-concentrated sugar may not only affect learning circuits but directly the perception of the (CS+) itself such a time delay would be even more important. Therefore, I suggest that the authors may introduce a time delay between the sipping and the opto-genetic activation of neurons in accordance with the published olfactory learning paradigms.</p><p>The authors need to explain the figures much more in detail. For example the given figure for figure 1C/D lets assume that the box blots in figure 1C reflect the data of the first ten minutes of the cumulative preference index. Indeed, this is apparently not the case, but the cumulative preference index is depicted over the entire 60 min but 10 min after the training. The figure description is misleading and would need some amendments. Further the authors should explain more in detail what the interaction values are and what they reflect. The information given by the authors is cryptic and does not allow a straight-forward understanding of the figure.</p><p>As stated above the cumulative preference index indicates a strong delay between the two groups in their memory retrieval (Figure 1D). The authors do not really discuss this effect in detail that per se is very interesting as it is very different in its dynamics compared with the other learning experiments provided by the authors.</p><p>For the statistical analysis the authors use an ANOVA with a Dunnet's post hoc correction throughout. In this regard it is unclear which of the data groups serve as a reference for the test. Normally a Dunnet's correction is used for multiple test groups that are compared to one single control group e.g., Placebo against different medical treatments. Here the Placebo group would serve as reference. In the case of the data provided by the authors, the situation is drastically different, as we have one test group and three control groups. As such the Dunnet's correction may not be the most adequate way for a multiple comparison of data and the authors may want to think about employing a more standard correction such as Bonferroni or Tukey.</p><p>The authors use two terms when referring to forms of memory exceeding short-term memory, long-term memory (LTM) and long lasting memory (LLM). However, they miss to explain when and why they employ the two different terms.</p><p>Further, the authors should help the reader and indicate more rigorously the compartments that are innervated by the individual lines. Descriptions like R48B04&gt;CsChrimson or the &quot;activation of R15A04-Gal4 neuron&quot; are difficult to follow for readers that not directly related to the field.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to encourage the authors to employ their intuitive technique to expand the field of gustatory learning instead of asking questions that were already answered for olfactory conditioning now for gustatory conditioning. Of course, it is interesting to see the parallels between gustation and olfaction but the cellular mechanisms and energy availability would rather be a surprise if they would differ in their mode of action between the two forms of learning. However, the technique described by Jelen and colleagues would allow much more detailed circuit-oriented and temporal analysis of gustatory learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81535.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers expressed a high interest and, provided you can address the following issues, are supportive of publication of your manuscript in eLife.

Our intention was to point out that changes in satiety could influence behavior in a way that appears to be learning, whereas in our experiments we point out that any differences in feeding during training are actually in the opposite direction to what could explain the change in behavior (e.g. flies eating more salt during training and then still showing increased salt feeding during testing).

We chose to focus on using NaCl and MPG as the conditioned stimuli, with PAM activation serving to drive appetitive memory formation. We show first that the naïve preference for NaCl vs MPG is roughly equal (panel C). Next, we show that, like NaCl, flies are able to learn to prefer MPG over agar when MPG is trained as the CS+ (panel D). We also show that an appetitive memory for NaCl can be formed when NaCl is the CS+ and MPG is the CS-. Finally, we show that the memory formed when NaCl is the CS+ is not generalized to MPG, as training with NaCl as the CS+ does not result in an elevated preference for MPG vs agar (panel E). Although we acknowledge that these are not the exact experiments requested, we were very limited in the number of additional experiments we were able to perform, and feel that these demonstrate the same qualities that the reviewer is looking for in their comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It further appears that the (CS+) source is always situated on the left side of the experimental setup and the (CS-) always on the right side, if the indication of the interaction numbers are well understood.

This is true whether the training is done with PAM activation (panel A) or sweet neuron activation (panel B). We performed both these experiments since sweet neuron activation drives a positive preference during training, while PAM activation does not. Along with the other experiments described above, these results demonstrate the specificity of training to the CS+ in the STROBE paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to many learning theories the learnability of a (CS+) is strongly increased when (CS+) and (US) are presented overlapping but with a time delay.

However, we do not currently have the expertise in the lab to modify the sip detection and light triggering algorithm to introduce a systematic delay. Nonetheless, we should point out that, while the STROBE LED activates with low latency, there is still a delay between sips and LED illumination. We previously measured this delay to be about 37 ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to explain the figures much more in detail.

We paid particular attention to the schematics and the presentation of timing. We have removed the timeline schematic for each figure, as they were redundant and, upon reflection, confusing for several reasons. We now rely on Figure 1A to clearly demonstrate the paradigm and the timing for both STM and LTM assays. The schematics associated with individual panels now illustrate only the neuron population being optogenetically activated and the identity of the CS+ and CS-, as these are the parameters that change from experiment to experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As stated above the cumulative preference index indicates a strong delay between the two groups in their memory retrieval (Figure 1D). The authors do not really discuss this effect in detail that per se is very interesting as it is very different in its dynamics compared with the other learning experiments provided by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in response to another reviewer’s comment above, we believe that the calculated preference indices are relatively unreliable in the early portion of testing, due to the small number of interactions during that period and the stochastic effects of flies encountering one choice vs the other. Thus, we caution against reading too much into changes in preference during these early times. Nonetheless, it is possible that the control group develops a stronger preference for sugar over the course of the assay as some hunger builds up after their feeding during training, and this combines with higher reliability as sips build up to drive a higher preference. We now mention our general interpretation of the testing dynamics in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the statistical analysis the authors use an ANOVA with a Dunnet's post hoc correction throughout.

Normally a Dunnet's correction is used for multiple test groups that are compared to one single control group e.g., Placebo against different medical treatments. Here the Placebo group would serve as reference. In the case of the data provided by the authors, the situation is drastically different, as we have one test group and three control groups. As such the Dunnet's correction may not be the most adequate way for a multiple comparison of data and the authors may want to think about employing a more standard correction such as Bonferroni or Tukey.</p></disp-quote><p>From a statistical standpoint, we struggle to see the distinction between comparing one control to several test groups and comparing one test group to several controls. The similarity between these situations is exactly why we chose the Dunnet’s test, and then report the lowest level of significance (highest p-value) across the comparisons with the different controls. Nonetheless, we tested several experiments with using a Bonferroni test instead of the Dunnet’s test and there was no difference in the categorical result (i.e. the number of stars). In the end we elected to continue with the Dunnet’s test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use two terms when referring to forms of memory exceeding short-term memory, long-term memory (LTM) and long lasting memory (LLM). However, they miss to explain when and why they employ the two different terms.</p></disp-quote><p>After further consideration, we have decided to simply use LTM throughout. Originally we used LLM in the portion of the manuscript preceding the demonstration that the memory is protein synthesis dependent. However, we agree this is unnecessarily confusing and have elected to simplify by only using LTM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the authors should help the reader and indicate more rigorously the compartments that are innervated by the individual lines. Descriptions like R48B04&gt;CsChrimson or the &quot;activation of R15A04-Gal4 neuron&quot; are difficult to follow for readers that not directly related to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this information to the text as we describe each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, I would like to encourage the authors to employ their intuitive technique to expand the field of gustatory learning instead of asking questions that were already answered for olfactory conditioning now for gustatory conditioning. Of course, it is interesting to see the parallels between gustation and olfaction but the cellular mechanisms and energy availability would rather be a surprise if they would differ in their mode of action between the two forms of learning. However, the technique described by Jelen and colleagues would allow much more detailed circuit-oriented and temporal analysis of gustatory learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and the sentiment behind it. As we performed all of the experiments presented in the manuscript, we were always pulled between the desire to demonstrate the robustness and utility of the assay versus the desire to tread new ground and explore major differences in learning mechanisms. For us, each result that confirmed a similarity with olfactory learning was additional evidence that the assay was really measuring what we thought it was measuring, and this contributed to the appeal of covering all the similarities with olfactory learning. As with many projects, circumstances (in particular the pandemic in this case) also contributed to how much we could achieve. Nonetheless, we look forward to probing more taste learning mechanisms in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
