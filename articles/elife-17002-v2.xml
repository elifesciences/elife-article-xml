These genes play several different roles in the animal. Some of the genes help neoblasts to make decisions about what kinds of cells they should become.

The discovery of glia in planarians means that it will be possible to use these worms to study how glia support brain regeneration and how glia themselves are replaced after injury. In the long term, this work might lead to discoveries that shed light on how tissue regeneration could be improved in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17002.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17002.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>planarian</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>CNS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newmark</surname><given-names>Phillip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts-Galbraith</surname><given-names>Rachel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Mennonite University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brubacher</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A gene expression-guided functional screen identifies factors and cell types that regulate diverse aspects of neural regeneration in planarians.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An improved understanding of brain regeneration holds the potential to stimulate new therapies geared toward the treatment of stroke, neurological disease, and brain injury. Brain regeneration, as a process, must occur through several interrelated steps: wound signaling and healing; production of new cells by proliferation, dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation; specification of cell lineages of the proper type(s) and ratio(s); organization of new cells in three-dimensional space; differentiation of precursors; reestablishment of connections required for functional restoration; and, finally, cessation of regeneration to avoid overgrowth or damage to nearby healthy tissue. Of these steps, production of new CNS cells has been a major focus. The advent of mammalian stem cell-based approaches and advances in cell reprogramming enabled the creation of new, often functional, neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elkabetz and Studer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Piña-Crespo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wernig et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, the discovery of endogenous stem cell pools in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altman and Das, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eriksson et al., 1998</xref>) raises the possibility of enhancing the brain’s ability to create new neurons from within (for a review of this progress, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gage and Temple, 2013</xref>). Despite these advances, functional repair in the human CNS remains an extremely ambitious goal and requires the development of new therapies aimed not only at generation of new cells, but also placing and integrating these cells appropriately within a broader regenerative context.</p><p>To understand how the cell biological processes of regeneration are regulated and coordinated, we look to organisms that successfully regenerate in nature. While some species, like zebrafish and axolotls have a greater regenerative capacity than do mammals, species with the ability to regenerate an entire brain de novo are rare in the animal kingdom and in the realm of established model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bely and Nyberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Egger et al., 2007</xref>). Of the small number of animals that regenerate their brains after injury, planarians have emerged as a tractable model system in which to study this remarkable process. Scientists have appreciated the extreme capacity for regeneration found in planarians for over two hundred years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elliott and Sánchez Alvarado, 2013</xref>). A nascent brain structure appears soon after amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cebrià et al., 2002b</xref>) and reproducible brain wiring is indicated by full functional recovery, with resumed movement and feeding after one week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Inoue et al., 2004</xref>). Anatomical studies have revealed details of the structure and molecular complexity of the planarian central nervous system (CNS), which consists of bi-lobed cephalic ganglia (the brain) and two ventral nerve cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agata et al., 1998</xref>). The planarian brain is composed of a diverse array of neural subtypes that produce conserved neurotransmitters and dozens of neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nishimura et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Collins et al., 2010</xref>). These cell types are regionally organized, with subtypes of cells appearing medially or in lateral structures called brain branches that project toward the margin of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">MacRae, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cebrià et al., 2002a</xref>). Planarians also regenerate missing brain tissue regardless of the amputation plane or the severity of the injury to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17002.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A transcriptional view of planarian head regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams depicting the overall organization of the planarian CNS (left) and the principal cell types known to play roles in brain regeneration (right).

The regenerative ability of planarians depends on a pool of stem cells called neoblasts, at least some of which are pluripotent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). This stem cell pool is heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moritz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>) and stem cells respond to injury by migrating, proliferating, and producing daughter cells that differentiate to replace all cell types of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Saló and Baguñà, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baguñà et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baguñà, 1976</xref>). Additionally, planarians restore their axial polarity after injury; polarity markers reappear early during the regenerative process and are responsible for resetting the body plan (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, anterior cues (including Notum and secreted Frizzled-related proteins) inhibit posterior Wnt ligands to enable head and brain regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Planarian brain regeneration requires stem cell activity and proper specification of axial polarity, but beyond these generalities, the mechanisms underlying specific regeneration of the brain remain mysterious. Several regulators of planarian brain regeneration were uncovered through candidate-gene approaches, including axon guidance cues like Slit/Robo and Netrin/DCC as well as transcriptional regulators of certain neural subtypes, including Lhx1/5–1, Coe, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cebrià and Newmark, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cebrià et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the identification of these molecules, we know little about the mechanisms that coordinate cell biological events required for regenerative success. We do not yet understand how neoblasts are directed toward particular neural fates or how cells of different neural subtypes become distributed to ensure proper ratios of diverse cell types. Though polarity cues certainly play a key role, we still lack an understanding of how cells within the organism interpret such cues. Furthermore, the signaling molecules that promote regeneration generally and instruct replacement of specific cell types are largely unknown. While muscle cells produce polarity cues during homeostasis and in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>), it is not yet clear whether they also produce molecules that promote regeneration, or whether other cells carry out or assist in this key signaling role. Finally, once nascent neural tissue is formed, we do not yet understand how it is patterned, reconnected, and restored to function—especially in the context of pre-existing tissue.</p><p>To begin answering these important questions, we examined gene expression during the early stages of head regeneration and employed a functional screen to identify key factors in an unbiased manner. We identified several genes required broadly for brain regeneration, including a novel transcriptional regulator of neural progenitors and several putative signaling molecules, some of which are produced by one or more uncharacterized, differentiated cell types in the planarian parenchyma. Furthermore, we identified factors required to promote connectivity and function in specific brain regions. Finally, by investigating genes downregulated during regeneration, we identified a marker that led us to discover a population of cells that we determined to be glia, based on their gene expression and morphology. Taken together, our work uncovered players in diverse aspects of planarian neural regeneration and neurobiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and characterization of genes upregulated during head regeneration in planarians</title><p>To devise an unbiased list of genes that could promote brain regeneration, we first identified transcripts upregulated during planarian head regrowth. We chose an approach in which we amputated planarians postpharyngeally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), reasoning that this amputation would allow us to identify global gene-expression changes, as well as changes that occur in the regenerating region itself. To identify key time points, we performed several time courses to examine morphological restoration and resumed expression of known brain markers following this particular injury. We examined regenerating animals at 12 hr or 24 hr intervals by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization (ISH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed reestablishment of anterior polarity by 12 hr, initial neural gene expression at 36 hr, primordial brain formation after 3 days (72 hr), and further maturation (with synapsin staining and broad neural gene expression) at 5 days post-amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on these time courses, we chose 12 hr, 36 hr, and 72 hr as key time points that span the early stages of brain regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To identify transcripts upregulated during head regeneration, we performed RNA sequencing on regenerating planarians at three time points (12, 36, and 72 hr) as well as whole (non-regenerating) planarians and planarians immediately after amputation (‘cut’) as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Over 900 transcripts were upregulated (≥2x, p≤0.01) at one or more time points in regenerating animals compared to cut (0 hr) controls that were initially identical to the regenerating animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, ~45% of transcripts upregulated vs. cut controls at each time point were also upregulated vs. whole animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that differentially expressed genes do not simply reflect a return to homeostatic gene expression. Our data were also subjected to weighted gene correlation network analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) so that clusters of similarly regulated genes could be identified.

Of the genes upregulated compared to cut controls, we eliminated transcripts that were very low abundance, parts of repetitive sequences, or housekeeping genes and cloned 428/933 transcripts for further analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We examined the gene expression patterns of these genes by ISH and were able to establish expression patterns for ~85% of them (362/428). We hypothesized that our dataset would be enriched in genes expressed in the CNS and, indeed, found that 47% of genes with clear expression patterns showed enrichment in the CNS (170/362, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Of the 170 genes with CNS expression, 132 were expressed broadly and 38 showed enrichment in subsets of CNS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Additionally, genes expressed in the CNS were often expressed elsewhere, for example in the parenchyma or in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Of upregulated genes with detectable expression patterns, we also found that 9% showed enriched expression in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>) and 17% were expressed in the parenchyma, some in a pattern similar to neoblast genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). Additional genes were expressed in tissue-specific patterns that included the pharynx, intestine, protonephridia, epithelium, and eyespots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–G</xref>). Some non-CNS expression patterns could still reflect neural tissue in the pharynx, body wall, or eyes, but we have not investigated neural regeneration outside the CNS at this point. However, the variety of expression patterns reflects the diverse physiological changes that occur concurrently during head regeneration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An unbiased functional screen reveals genes with roles in planarian brain regeneration</title><p>To determine whether the upregulated genes promote brain regeneration, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) experiments to knock down 326 of the upregulated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Thus, to distinguish between target genes whose knockdown specifically affected CNS regeneration and those which had indirect effects through other mechanisms, we repeated RNAi experiments and examined effects of each of the 30 genes on anterior polarity, stem cell maintenance, and regeneration of tail tissue. First, we examined the anterior marker <italic>sFRP-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>) after RNAi of each gene. RNAi knockdown of 5 genes (<italic>argininosuccinate synthase, autophagy-related 13, smarcb1, fzd-5/8–2</italic>, and <italic>hesl-3</italic>) reduced <italic>sFRP-1</italic> expression during regeneration, with reductions ranging from minor to severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-blue bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, for these five genes, the small brain RNAi phenotype could result from insufficient reestablishment of anterior identity. We also investigated whether the stem cell pool was affected after RNAi knockdown of these 30 genes using the neoblast marker <italic>smedwi-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>). We determined that knockdown of three genes caused a reduction in <italic>smedwi-1</italic> signal: <italic>snRNPC</italic> and <italic>rbp-1-like</italic>, which have not been described, and the previously identified gene <italic>soxP-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-red bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). We concluded that RNAi of these three genes led to brain regeneration phenotypes secondary to stem cell defects. Finally, to confirm that brain regeneration phenotypes did not merely result from a general impairment in blastema formation (i.e. general defects in neoblast proliferation or migration), we repeated each RNAi experiment and amputated animals anterior and posterior to the pharynx and subsequently measured blastema size after six days. RNAi of five genes (<italic>tRNA synthase, GTPbp, argininosuccinate synthase, wdr24</italic>, and <italic>smarcb1</italic>) caused smaller blastemas after regeneration and only <italic>GTPbp(RNAi)</italic> had an anterior-specific reduced blastema size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3B</xref>). Thus, these five genes likely play a role in regeneration that is not specific to the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-gray diagonal lines). RNAi of the remaining 19 genes caused no overt polarity or stem cell defects by ISH and no evidence of generally reduced regenerative activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-black bars). We thus prioritized these genes for further study, as these represent the most promising candidates for factors specifically influencing brain regeneration.</p><p>Though our current work is focused on regeneration of the planarian CNS, the functional screen we performed resulted in the identification of 26 additional genes for which RNAi caused defects during homeostasis and/or regeneration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As expected, most genes identified in this portion of the screen showed ubiquitous or parenchymal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>) with enrichment in stem cells and/or stem cell progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3C</xref>).

One of these genes (<italic>hnRNPK</italic>) is required for pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>) and here we show that it is important for head maintenance and regeneration.

Among the 30 genes identified in our functional analysis as being required for proper brain regeneration, several genes (including <italic>CRELD</italic>) encoded putative signaling molecules. Of these genes, a few are expressed in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>). One such group of genes is the <italic>LDLRR (low density lipoprotein receptor-related</italic>) family. <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> and <italic>LDLRR-2</italic> were previously identified in an analysis of wound-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> is expressed in the parenchyma, while <italic>LDLRR-2</italic> is expressed in a subset of intestinal cells and in epithelial cells, particularly in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both show redistribution of expression after injury, with punctate expression in the blastema during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also identified a gene with similarity to <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> in our functional screen, which we have named <italic>LDLRR-3</italic>; this gene is also expressed in a pattern resembling that of <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> was so named for an LDLR (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>); however, the current gene model for LDLRR-1 includes a signal peptide sequence but no transmembrane domain, suggesting that LDLRR-1 is likely to be a secreted molecule or to remain attached to the cell surface by other means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We were unable to detect known domains within the existing LDLRR-2 sequence, but LDLRR-3 has a domain architecture similar to LDLRR-1 and also lacks a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

HSPGs play diverse roles in regulation of the extracellular matrix and signaling (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lin, 2004</xref>). Thus, the planarian family of LDLRR molecules could serve to modulate signaling in a way that promotes regeneration.</p><p>We asked whether <italic>LDLRR-3</italic> is expressed in cell types already known to play key roles during regeneration. <italic>LDLRR-3</italic> is not irradiation sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>) and we confirmed that <italic>LDLRR-3</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the parenchyma are distinct from (but sometimes adjacent to) <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Furthermore, while <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> and <italic>LDLRR-3</italic> are expressed in similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), their expression is only partly overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); all <italic>LDLRR-3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells express <italic>LDLRR-1</italic>, but only half of <italic>LDLRR-1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells express <italic>LDLRR-3</italic>.

The existence of glial cells in planarians has been a matter of debate: electron microscopy analyses have been used to argue both for and against the presence of such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morita and Best, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lentz, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baguñà and Ballester, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Golubev, 1988</xref>). The identification of <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic> glia is significant, especially given (i) the downregulation of <italic>IF-1</italic> as an injury response and (ii) the tendency of glial cells in other organisms to affect neural regeneration (positively or adversely depending on the situation – for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pekny et al., 2014</xref>, and for more recent results see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al. (2016)</xref>). <italic>IF-1</italic> itself shares some similarity with intermediate filament genes expressed in neurons (vertebrate <italic>neurofilament</italic> and <italic>C. elegans intermediate filament, ifa-1</italic>) and glia (vertebrate <italic>glial fibrillary acid protein</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3G</xref>). Thus, to determine whether the <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells of the planarian nervous system share similarities with glial cells in other organisms, we sought to identify genes coexpressed with <italic>IF-1</italic>. One frequent function of glial cells is to take up excess neurotransmitters or other chemicals that can be toxic to nearby neurons. For example, astrocytes take up glutamate and convert it to glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schousboe et al., 1977</xref>). Glutamate uptake occurs through excitatory amino acid transporters and conversion of glutamate to glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Rothstein et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Norenberg and Martinez-Hernandez, 1979</xref>). We therefore investigated the expression patterns of planarian <italic>slc1a-5 (solute carrier 1a-5 / EAAT</italic>) and <italic>GS-1 (glutamine synthetase-1</italic>) and found that they were also expressed in a pattern similar to <italic>IF-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Furthermore, we detected <italic>IF-1</italic> coexpression with both <italic>slc1a-5</italic> and <italic>GS-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We also confirmed non-neural expression of <italic>slc1a-5</italic> using both <italic>PC-2</italic> and <italic>ChAT</italic> as markers of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Recently, a comprehensive characterization of solute carrier proteins in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> was completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vu et al., 2015</xref>). We assayed the expression patterns of several additional solute carrier genes and determined that <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup> </italic>cells express <italic>slc1a-3</italic> (an additional glutamate/neutral amino acid transporter), <italic>slc2a-1</italic> (a facilitative glutamate transporter), <italic>slc6a-2</italic> and <italic>slc6a-8</italic> (sodium and chloride-dependent sodium:neurotransmitter transporters), and <italic>slc7a-8</italic> (a cationic amino acid transporter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, many of the genes coexpressed with <italic>IF-1</italic> are not differentially expressed (<italic>slc1a-5</italic> and <italic>slc6a-2</italic>) or are even slightly upregulated during regeneration (<italic>slc2a-1, GS-1,</italic> and <italic>slc7a-8</italic>). Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic> glial cells in planarians are similar to glial cells (and in particular astrocytes) in other organisms, in that they express a variety of transporters of the solute carrier family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, because most markers coexpressed with <italic>IF-1</italic> are not reduced after amputation, we conclude that glial cells are not lost after injury, but instead alter their gene expression.</p><p>We also sought an unbiased way of identifying genes coexpressed with <italic>IF-1</italic>, particularly additional genes downregulated during head regeneration. Reasoning that genes that behave like <italic>IF-1</italic> during regeneration might meet both criteria, we turned to our clustering analysis, and focused on module 2, a cluster of 1520 genes (including <italic>IF-1</italic>) that are downregulated by 12 hr post-amputation and even more significantly downregulated at 36 hr and 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). As a pilot study, we cloned 48 genes from this module and examined their expression patterns. The majority of these genes showed expression patterns irrelevant to our glial studies. However, two transcripts were expressed in <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic>cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–E</xref>). <italic>jagged-like</italic> encodes a protein with weak similarity to Jagged that contains a signal peptide, two EGF domains, and a transmembrane domain. We also identified a gene that encodes a signal peptide-containing protein; we named this novel gene <italic>estrella</italic> ('star' in Catalan) based on its expression pattern and the origin of our <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> strain in Barcelona. The expression pattern of <italic>estrella</italic> highlights the extensive processes of glial cells and their wide distribution in the neuropil, the peripheral nervous system, near the brain branches, and near photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cowles et al., 2014</xref>). Together, our results indicate that <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup> </italic>glial cells respond to injury by downregulating a variety of genes (including genes that encode potential signaling molecules) over the course of several days.</p><p>Finally, we used electron microscopy to confirm the existence of glial cells in the planarian neuropil. Indeed, we detected cells in the neuropil that had numerous fine cellular processes that intermingled with axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). Planarian glial cells were also distinct from nearby neurons in that they had electron-dense cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with abundant peripheral heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Throughout the neuropil, where neuronal processes are a dominant feature, electron-dense projections were also common (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), suggesting extensive projection of glial cells throughout the neuropil of the planarian nervous system. Though we have not yet shown that the cells identified by electron microscopy are <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic>, the morphology seen by electron microscopy is consistent with the cell shapes revealed by <italic>estrella</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–G</xref>). We therefore conclude that both our gene expression data and electron microscopic analysis support the existence of glia in the planarian CNS.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-17002-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17002.023</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Electron micrographs of the glial cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref> through serial sections.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17002.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17002.023</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-17002-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17002.024</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Rotation of the reconstruction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17002.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17002.024</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-17002-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17002.025</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Close-up from serial sections showing electron-dense projections of glial cells among axons in the neuropil.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17002.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17002.025</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>After injury, organisms execute a suite of molecular and cellular responses. On one end of the regenerative spectrum, the injury response can minimize damage and cordon off injured tissue. In organisms like planarians, however, an exquisite set of events results in the precise and reproducible replacement of missing tissues and complete restoration of structure and function. While a general picture of the wound response has emerged from planarians and other model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>), we do not yet understand how this wound response can be faithfully channeled into a regenerative response. Studies of planarians and other regenerative model organisms have begun to provide an understanding of regeneration in broad strokes. In planarians, stem cell activity drives cell replacement and a reestablished coordinate system of axial polarity cues redirects the planarian body plan. Still, many basic questions remain, particularly in understanding how stem cell activity and polarity intersect with other cellular events to specifically produce missing organs like the CNS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An instruction manual for brain regeneration: novel signaling factors</title><p>To better understand regeneration, it will be important to identify the signals that initiate and direct the process. Some signals, from small molecules to proteins, have been identified in other regenerative model organisms (e.g., Wnt3 in <italic>Hydra</italic>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cysteinyl leukotriene in zebrafish, a MARCKS-like protein in axolotl, and newt anterior gradient protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chera et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kyritsis et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sugiura et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly, the signals that promote regeneration in planarians remain mysterious. Notwithstanding a host of signaling molecules known to establish polarity in the regenerating worm, only a few signaling molecules or their receptors have been determined to regulate regeneration, including opposing Follistatin and Activin signals and EGF- and FGF-receptors that regulate various aspects of homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gavino et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fraguas et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lei et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, though planarian neoblasts have been hypothesized to integrate a wide variety of signals to choose between daughter cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Reddien, 2013</xref>), whether neoblasts express the diversity of receptors required to integrate numerous signals remains unknown. Neoblasts do express FGF-receptors that are important for tissue maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), but no ligands for these receptors have been identified through homology searches. Thus, further exploring the signals required for regeneration, as well as the cellular origin(s) and receiver(s) of each signal will greatly enhance our understanding of how diverse cellular events (i.e., proliferation, migration, organization, differentiation) are triggered and coordinated during the regenerative response. One goal of our screen was to identify putative signals that influence regeneration, generally, or for the CNS in particular. To that end, we identified several putative signaling molecules encoded by <italic>CRELD, F-spondin</italic>, and <italic>LDLRR</italic> family genes that each encode a secreted or transmembrane protein that could function in a signaling capacity.</p><p><italic>CRELD</italic> genes are conserved among metazoans but are not very well characterized.

Further studies will be required to determine how <italic>CRELD</italic> exerts its function in the regenerating head and to what extent this function might be conserved.</p><p>Other signaling molecules identified in our study include homologs of matrix-associated proteins. F-spondin proteins are conserved among metazoans, localize to ECM-rich areas, and play roles in cell adhesion, including promoting axon extension from the neural floor plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klar et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Umemiya et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Woo et al., 2008</xref>).

In other organisms, HSPGs are also ECM components and modulate signaling of many ligands, including Wnt, Hedgehog, and FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tsuda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Reichsman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">The et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kiefer et al., 1990</xref>). F-spondin and the LDLRR proteins are predicted to be secreted molecules and could promote regeneration by serving as signals themselves, by binding to and changing the activity of other signaling molecules, and/or by contributing to an unknown regenerative function of the planarian ECM.</p><p>Importantly, <italic>F-spondin, LDLRR-1</italic>, and <italic>-3</italic> are each expressed in differentiated, non-muscle cells in the parenchyma, suggesting that these uncharacterized cells perform some signaling function important for proper regeneration.

Thus, further work will be required to identify and characterize these cells. Planarian stem cells are present throughout the parenchyma and are surrounded by other parenchymal cell types, one of which has been termed 'fixed parenchyma cells' in the electron microscopy literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pedersen, 1961</xref>). We have yet to determine what kind of cell-cell interactions or local signaling events in the parenchyma influence the activity of planarian stem cells, either in homeostasis or in regeneration. The parenchymal signaling cells and molecules revealed by our screen might be a valuable entry point in determining whether or how neighboring cells promote the maintenance, cycling, differentiation, or migration of planarian neoblasts.</p><p>Another area of investigation concerns whether the CNS influences regeneration by playing a signaling role, as it does in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kumar and Brockes, 2012</xref>). A recent single-cell analysis suggested that neurons do not respond to injury with gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>). However, these studies were performed on worm fragments that were missing their cephalic ganglia, and only addressed gene expression changes in the first 12 hr after amputation. We identified one gene upregulated later in regeneration, <italic>arrowhead</italic>, that is required at the midline of the cephalic ganglia for axon organization across the anterior commissure. This non-cell-autonomous role likely involves signaling from <italic>arrowhead<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons at this location to organize the projections of other cells, including the photoreceptor neurons. Our preliminary finding that some <italic>arrowhead<sup>+</sup></italic> cells express <italic>slit</italic> offers one clue about how this might occur, but a deeper investigation of Arrowhead targets will distinguish between this and other possibilities. Thus, at a minimum, some neurons of the CNS likely influence the organization of one another during regeneration. Further work will be required to identify the molecules that govern this influence and to study other contributions of the CNS to the signaling environment required for a proper regenerative response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CNS regeneration: a cellular parts list</title><p>One of the crucial events required for regeneration of nervous tissue is coordinated neurogenesis. In the planarian field, a major question is how neoblasts are directed to specific cell fates, including neurons, and how the appropriate number and mixture of cells are reestablished. In planarians, some work has been done to identify a handful of factors that regulate commitment to certain neural subtypes, including <italic>coe, lhx1/5–1</italic>, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, a new category of specialized neoblast has recently been proposed to contribute to neural fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Molinaro and Pearson, 2016</xref>). However, we lack a fundamental understanding of the basic neurogenesis program(s) in planarians. It is not yet clear whether neoblasts commit to specific neural fates in one step or through a series of binary choices. Additionally, we do not know how or whether these fate choices are reoriented in response to injury.</p><p>In our screen, we expected to identify factors that could play roles in neural cell fate decisions. We identified a transcription factor, <italic>soxB2-2</italic>, required for full expression of several neural progenitor genes. Importantly, <italic>soxB2-2(RNAi)</italic> animals display behavioral phenotypes (decreased sensitivity to vibrations) and regenerate brains smaller than those resulting from many other perturbations. These observations suggest that <italic>soxB2-2</italic> likely regulates gene expression even more broadly than we have so far observed. The homolog of <italic>soxB2-2</italic> is expressed during embryonic development of <italic>Schmidtea polychroa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Monjo and Romero, 2015</xref>).

In addition to its role in the eye, <italic>runt</italic> is important for proper expression of <italic>ap2</italic> and <italic>klf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>); <italic>ap2</italic> drives respecification of medial <italic>TrpA+</italic> neurons, and <italic>klf</italic> is important for regeneration of <italic>cintillo<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in the brain branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, <italic>runt</italic> influences neural progenitors to contribute to multiple neural types across different regions of the brain.</p><p>Neither <italic>soxB2-2</italic> nor <italic>runt</italic> appears to be required globally for neurogenesis, but each controls a distinct array of fates and is required for optimal brain regeneration, suggesting that these two genes’ products promote distinct neurogenesis pathways. Both <italic>soxB2-2</italic> and <italic>runt</italic> are upregulated during regeneration, implying that they are activated in neoblasts or early progenitors to skew the balance of specialized progeny and promote neural fates needed for rebuilding the brain. Future studies could use <italic>soxB2-2</italic> and <italic>runt</italic> as starting points for defining neurogenesis pathways; by exploring both upstream regulators and targets that control downstream progenitor and neural fates, these middle-out studies could define differentiation trajectories from neoblast to neuron.</p><p>Dozens of neural cell types in the planarian CNS can be defined by the expression patterns of neuropeptide and neurotransmitter biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nishimura et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Collins et al., 2010</xref>). Most of these neural subtypes arise during regeneration through mechanisms that have not yet been uncovered. Exceptions include the specification of serotonergic neurons by <italic>lhx1/5–1</italic> and <italic>pitx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marz et al., 2013</xref>) and the specification of <italic>dopamine ß-hydroxylase<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons by <italic>pax3/7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, RNAi knockdown of <italic>runt</italic> failed to significantly influence any of the specific markers of differentiated neurons that we tested in this analysis (e.g., <italic>ChAT</italic> to mark cholinergic neurons). Although knockdown of <italic>soxB2-2</italic> decreased several markers, only <italic>tyrosine hydroxylase (TH</italic>) dropped past the threshold of statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). That RNAi would affect presumptive neural progenitors without a detectable effect on a neural marker could simply be due to a lack of tools required to delineate the affected neural cell types, or due to the sensitivity of the assay. However, other transcription factors identified in this screen as having no brain-size phenotype (e.g., <italic>glass</italic>) could play more subtle roles in specification or function of neural subtypes. <italic>FLI-1</italic> expression in neoblasts could shift them to certain fates important for brain-branch architecture or wiring. In contrast, transcription factors like <italic>arrowhead</italic> and <italic>mblk</italic> are each expressed predominantly in differentiated cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>), and likely function later in differentiation or in mature neurons to affect maintenance, connectivity, or function. Along these lines, a homolog of <italic>mblk</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is important for neurite pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kage et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, though we anticipated that <italic>hesl-3</italic> would affect gene expression in neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>), we found that the clearest impact of <italic>hesl-3(RNAi)</italic> is on polarity genes like <italic>sFRP</italic> and <italic>foxD. hesl-3</italic> expression is highest in neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>), though expression in the CNS is also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>). However, no expression at the anterior tip is visible. One straightforward model for the function of <italic>hesl-3</italic> would be that it is required for specification of muscle cells that eventually contribute to the anterior pole. Another possibility is that <italic>hesl-3<sup>+</sup></italic> cells contribute to regeneration of the brain and that the regenerating brain is important for resetting or maintaining anterior polarity. Neural tissue is critical for regeneration in a variety of other model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kumar and Brockes, 2012</xref>), but we have not been able to determine whether it is so in planarians. Future work will be required to identify targets of <italic>hesl-3</italic> and to determine whether its roles in head patterning and brain regeneration occur through an influence on neurogenesis, polarity, or both.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The “glue” to hold it together?</title><p>Glia exist across animal phyla and play diverse, crucial roles in supporting the differentiation, survival, and function of neurons. We investigated genes downregulated during planarian regeneration and discovered a marker (<italic>Intermediate Filament-1</italic>) that is expressed in non-neural cells that have several hallmarks of glial identity. First, <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells express a range of solute carrier family genes, including genes that are important for reuptake of glutamate; this function is carried out by astrocytes in the mammalian nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schousboe et al., 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Norenberg and Martinez-Hernandez, 1979</xref>). Second, <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are present in the neuropil and have extensive cytoplasmic projections, positioning them ideally to support axonal or synaptic activity of neurons in the CNS. Third, <italic>IF-1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells respond to injury by changing their gene expression (downregulating <italic>IF-1, jagged-like</italic>, and <italic>estrella</italic>), much like astrocytes in mammals (for reviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sofroniew, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pekny and Nilsson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of glia in the planarian CNS raises many interesting possibilities for future study. Glia are an abundant, diverse, and essential population of cells in the mammalian nervous system, so functional regeneration of human neural tissue would require regeneration of glia alongside regeneration of neurons themselves. Thus, it will be informative to understand how glia repopulate the regenerating planarian CNS and in particular how glial and neural regeneration are coordinated. Additionally, activation of astrocytes in the mammalian nervous system protects tissue after injury but also contributes to glial scarring that can promote or prohibit axonal regrowth or functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pekny et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). Though it is not yet clear whether the planarian glial injury-response program is important for driving or permitting regeneration, contrasting the planarian glial response with that of glia in non-regenerating organisms might shed light on how glial activation can be harnessed for purely regeneration-promoting functions. For example, planarian <italic>IF-1</italic> is downregulated after injury, while mammalian <italic>GFAP</italic> is upregulated during astrocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Condorelli et al., 1990</xref>). Finally, RNAi of the glial genes identified in this study has so far failed to reveal phenotypes (data not shown). This is not surprising, because the downregulation of <italic>IF-1</italic> and other glial genes during regeneration suggests that gain-of-function treatments might be more likely to perturb regeneration. More nuanced assays and identification of genes required for glial specification or maintenance will be required to assess whether and how planarian glia support neuronal biology and behavior in planarians.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Planarians regenerate their central nervous system <italic>de novo</italic>, prodigiously replacing neurons and reconnecting neural networks to restore function in only a week.

Fluorescence images (immunofluorescence and FISH) were captured using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and either a 20X (Plan-Apochromat 206/0.8) or a 63X objective (Plan-Apochromat 636/1.4). Zen software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used for these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>We fixed and processed planarians for transmission electron microscopy as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brubacher et al., 2014</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Roberts-Galbraith and colleagues report on an ambitious effort to identify genes involved in planarian cephalic regeneration, particularly those associated with the nervous system of these organisms. By analyzing changes in gene expression, selecting those candidate genes with the most significant changes and then following up on these candidates by both RNAi and whole-mount visualization of gene expression, the authors have produced an extensive map of genetic activities associated with brain function and regeneration in planarians. For instance, the authors report that <italic>soxB-2a</italic> controls production of neural progenitors, that <italic>hesl-3</italic> is important for expressing patterning genes marking the far anterior region, that <italic>mblk</italic> suppresses expression of several neural transcription factors. Given the nature and design of the screen, it is not surprising that the findings reported here would encompass a very broad range of biological functions that not only expands on prior work in the field but also contributes novel and interesting findings to our understanding of neuronal regeneration. Chiefly among these, are the discovery of planarian glial-like cells, the identification of genes regulating regeneration and of specific cephalic ganglia regions likely associated with chemosensation in this animal.</p><p>Overall, this is a comprehensive screen reporting on a large number of novel molecules labeling cells (glia), cephalic regions and domains, as well as a number of intriguing phenotypes. However, the analyses of all the reported findings are uneven in depth and complexity, which is to be expected by the very nature of the approach. Because this work opens many new avenues of research, rather than recommending an even expansion of the analyses for all of the genes reported, it is our opinion that both the authors and the developmental biology and planarian communities would be best served if these findings are reported as an <italic>eLife</italic> Tools and Resources article.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a marked discordance between what is presented in the Introduction and Discussion and what is being reported in the manuscript. In fact, this work would benefit greatly if the authors were to provide a significantly more expanded background elaborating in more detail what was known in the field prior to the screen results reported here, particularly in those areas in which the authors report discoveries. As it stands, neither the Introduction nor the Discussion provide the necessary detailed information to place the discoveries reported here in their proper context. I would like to suggest that the authors rewrite the Introduction and Discussion background sections accordingly so as to shine a brighter light on the significance of their findings.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <italic>hesl-3</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: It is not clear from the 18/28 genes required for brain size but not expression of <italic>sFRP-1</italic> or <italic>smedwi-1</italic> that these specifically control brain size (subsection “An unbiased functional screen reveals genes with roles in planarian brain regeneration”, third paragraph) as only effects on anterior regeneration are described. Do these animals have reduced anterior and posterior blastema size? One would anticipate that bona fide brain regulators only minimally disrupt regeneration of other structures.</p><p>3) The use of qPCR to phenotype animals in this screen is a valuable starting point for analysis that ideally would be confirmed by staining, as decreases in animal-wide transcript abundance could be reflective of uniform or localized reduction of expression.

In particular, the function of <italic>soxB-2a</italic> in producing neural progenitors and the function of <italic>hesl-3</italic> in promoting expression in the far anterior, and the function of <italic>mblk</italic> to suppress expression of castor and <italic>lhx1/5-1</italic>.

We have attached a copy of our manuscript with tracked changes; the extensive revisions are clearly visible in this draft.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and hesl-3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: It is not clear from the 18/28 genes required for brain size but not expression of sFRP-1 or smedwi-1 that these specifically control brain size (subsection “An unbiased functional screen reveals genes with roles in planarian brain regeneration”, third paragraph) as only effects on anterior regeneration are described. Do these animals have reduced anterior and posterior blastema size? One would anticipate that bona fide brain regulators only minimally disrupt regeneration of other structures.</italic> </p><p>We repeated RNAi of the 27/30 genes<sup>*</sup> which cause small brain regeneration phenotypes (excluding the 3/30 RNAi conditions we already showed cause neoblast defects) and quantified the size of both anterior and posterior blastemas. The results of these experiments are shown in columns E-F of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. We saw significantly smaller blastemas after RNAi targeting <italic>tRNA synthetase, GTPbp, argininosuccinate synthase, wdr24</italic>, and <italic>smarcb1</italic> genes. These results are also included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (grey diagonal lines on the bars). For all but <italic>GTPbp</italic>, small blastemas were seen in both anterior and posterior directions. One gene (<italic>hesl-3</italic>) caused a slight, but significant, increase in head blastema size. Taken together, we conclude that 19/30 genes with small brain regeneration phenotypes are not required for neoblast maintenance, polarity reestablishment, or blastema formation. This suggests some level of specificity for our screen, and in particular for most of the genes on which we focused in our later analyses.</p><p><sup>*</sup>The number of genes in this category changed slightly between submissions based on repetition of some brain regeneration quantification experiments for which we initially had too few animals for results to be supported by adequate statistical power.</p><p><italic>3) The use of qPCR to phenotype animals in this screen is a valuable starting point for analysis that ideally would be confirmed by staining, as decreases in animal-wide transcript abundance could be reflective of uniform or localized reduction of expression. The main conclusions of this analysis should be verified with in situ hybridizations. In particular, the function of soxB-2a in producing neural progenitors and the function of hesl-3 in promoting expression in the far anterior, and the function of mblk to suppress expression of castor and lhx1/5-1. If this is not possible, the authors should address this matter in the text of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>qPCR is quantitative, whereas in situ hybridization (as we are currently doing these experiments) is not. Thus a 25% reduction in a given transcript might not be easily seen by ISH, especially given that signal amplification is inherent in the ISH process and several factors influence signal intensity besides transcript number.</p><p>In spite of this caveat, we have completed selected follow-up experiments for <italic>soxB2-2</italic> and <italic>hesl-3</italic> as requested by the reviewers. Although its signal is very difficult to detect (due to its low abundance: RPKM = 0.2 in whole animals), we did see <italic>hlh-1</italic> cells in <italic>control(RNAi)</italic> but not <italic>soxB2-2<sup>**</sup>(RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We attempted to examine <italic>otxA</italic> and <italic>POU2/3-2</italic> as well; these markers were not absent in the brain after <italic>soxB2-2(RNAi)</italic>, but both of these genes are expressed more broadly than <italic>hlh-1</italic>. Likely, <italic>soxB2-2</italic> is only affecting <italic>otxA</italic> and <italic>POU2/3-2</italic> expression in a subset of cells (either in the progenitor pool or in the brain), but interpretation is difficult without more markers. We have thus omitted the results of these experiments.</p><p>The results of <italic>sFRP-1</italic> and <italic>foxD</italic> ISH after <italic>hesl-3(RNAi)</italic> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>. These markers were not absent after <italic>hesl-3(RNAi)</italic>, but were decreased consistent with the 40-50% decrease seen by qPCR.</p><p><italic><sup>**</sup></italic>We have changed the name of <italic>soxB-2a</italic> to <italic>soxB2-2</italic> to be more consistent with nomenclature conventions and to align our gene with that described in <italic>S. polychroa</italic> (Monjo &amp; Romano, 2014).</p><p><italic>4) A fraction of the 134 gene qPCR data (~8 transcripts for each condition) is displayed to describe expression changes in soxB-2a, runt, hesl-3, mblk and CRELD phenotypes but not others. The remaining data should be included, in particular to support the specificity of the expression phenotypes shown.</italic> </p><p>Full raw data are now included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. The expression of most genes was not altered by each perturbation.</p><p><italic>5) The LDLRR data is intriguing but not well developed as the other findings reported here. Several outstanding questions remain regarding this interesting class of molecules. Do these genes promote regeneration from any type of injury? As injury-induced genes, do they affect expression of follistatin or other early injury-induced genes? Do LDLRR-1 and -3 function redundantly? We would suggest either elaborating to determine the function of these genes in regeneration or omitting so that such analysis can be part of its own report.</italic> </p><p>We have included additional data on <italic>LDLRR-1/3</italic> and <italic>F-spondin</italic>. For each of these genes, RNAi did not cause small blastemas (see comment above and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting that their role in regeneration is somewhat specific. We examined the effect of <italic>LDLRR-1(RNAi), LDLRR-3(RNAi)</italic>, and <italic>F-spondin(RNAi)</italic> on the expression of <italic>follistatin, jun, inhibin</italic>, and <italic>runt</italic> (injury-induced genes as per Wenemoser, et al. 2012) 6 hours after both anterior and posterior amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All gene expression appeared normal, indicating that wound response is also not generally affected by these perturbations. We knocked down <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> and <italic>-3</italic> together and did not see an enhancement of the brain regeneration phenotype; however, we have discovered that <italic>LDLRR-1</italic> and <italic>-3</italic> are in a family with several other similar genes. It is possible that there is synergism or redundancy between multiple members of this family, but it will take significantly more work to explore this possibility, so we have not included our preliminary data on this subject. We also confirmed that these genes are not downregulated after irradiation, with <italic>F-spondin</italic>and <italic>LDLRR-3</italic>cells still present at 7 d post-irradiation when the worms showed significant lysing and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result supports our conclusion that <italic>F-spondin</italic> and <italic>LDLRR-3</italic> are present in cells that are not neoblasts or their direct descendants. Finally, we completed a pilot qPCR experiment after <italic>LDLRR-3(RNAi)</italic> to determine whether we could identify pathways or cell types affected by this gene perturbation. However, we did not see any genes for which expression was dramatically altered by <italic>LDLRR-3(RNAi)</italic>, indicating that a deeper investigation would be required to form a hypothesis about what these molecules are doing.</p><p>In all, we do believe that our results indicate the existence of parenchymal cells and cues that promote CNS regeneration. Because we know so little about the cues that promote and permit regeneration in planarians and otherwise, we believe that these findings are of value and should be included in this publication. In rewriting the Introduction and Discussion, we have attempted to outline the significance of this finding to more clearly communicate its importance.</p><p><italic>6) We are particularly intrigued by the behavioral assay reported in this manuscript, as it is an important contribution to the field likely to open many new avenues for research. As such, it seems important for the authors to include data underscoring both the specificity of the RNAi phenotypes and the assay.
