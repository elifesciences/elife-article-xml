influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to medically attended infection. We ask whether these differences can be partly explained by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against new influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting). Fitting a statistical model to data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life. This effect is stronger for H1N1 compared to H3N2. Additionally, we find evidence that VE varies with both age and birth year, suggesting that VE is sensitive to early exposures. Our findings may improve estimates of age-specific risk and VE in similarly vaccinated populations and thus improve forecasting and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>original antigenic sin</kwd><kwd>imprinting</kwd><kwd>vaccine effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2AI117921</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cobey</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI145177-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arevalo</surname><given-names>Philip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHSN272201400005C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cobey</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>First influenza infections determine susceptibility to future seasonal influenza infection throughout life, and may impact vaccine effectiveness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seasonal influenza is a serious public health concern, resulting in approximately 100,000–600,000 hospitalizations and 5000–27,000 deaths per year in the United States despite extensive annual vaccination campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reed et al., 2015</xref>). The rapid evolution of the virus to escape preexisting immunity contributes to the relatively high incidence of influenza, including in previously infected older children and adults. How susceptibility arises and changes over time in the host population has been difficult to quantify.</p><p>A pathogen’s rate of antigenic evolution should affect the mean age of the hosts it infects, and differences in the rate of antigenic evolution have been proposed to explain differences in the age distributions of the two subtypes of influenza A. Compared to H3N2, H1N1 disproportionately infects children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gagnon et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khiabanian et al., 2009</xref>). It also evolves antigenically more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedford et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, compared to H3N2, H1N1 is slower to escape immunity in individuals who have experienced prior infection (namely older children and adults), making them less susceptible to reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beauté et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khiabanian et al., 2009</xref>). H3N2, in contrast, exhibits well known changes in antigenic phenotype that are expected to drive cases toward adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobey and Hensley, 2017</xref>). Under this simple model, hosts previously infected with a subtype face equal risk of reinfection (on challenge) with an antigenic variant of that subtype.</p><p>The age distributions of influenza cases in exceptional circumstances—pandemics and spillovers of avian influenza—have shown unexpected variation that suggests important effects of prior infection. Excess mortality in some adult cohorts during the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics correlates with childhood infection with other subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gagnon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Worobey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gagnon et al., 2018a</xref>). In the post-2009 pandemic period, excess mortality and hospitalization were observed among cohorts first exposed to H2N2 or H3N2 during H1N1pdm-dominated seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budd et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the subtypes circulating in childhood predict individuals’ susceptibility to severe zoonotic infections with avian H5N1 and H7N9, regardless of later exposure to other seasonal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gostic et al., 2016</xref>). These patterns suggest that early influenza infections, and not prior infection per se, strongly shape susceptibility.</p><p>Early infections might also affect the protection conferred by influenza vaccination. Foundational work on the theory of original antigenic sin demonstrated that an individual’s immune response to influenza vaccination is biased toward antigens similar to those encountered in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davenport and Hennessy, 1956</xref>). In some cases, this may result in a narrow antibody response focused on a single epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2018</xref>). This phenomenon has been suggested to explain an unexpected decrease in vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the middle-aged in the 2015–2016 influenza season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skowronski et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flannery et al., 2018</xref>). More generally, it has been hypothesized that biases in immune memory can arise from both past infections and vaccinations and lead to variation in VE that is sensitive to the precise history of exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skowronski et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>To measure the effect of early exposures on medically attended infection risk and VE, we fitted statistical models to 3493 PCR-confirmed influenza cases identified through seasonal studies of influenza VE from the 2007–2008 to 2017–2018 seasons in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA) in Marshfield, Wisconsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belongia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belongia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Treanor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohmit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McLean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaglani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flannery et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each influenza season, individuals in a defined community cohort were recruited and tested for influenza when seeking outpatient care for acute respiratory infection. Eligibility was restricted to individuals &gt;6 months of age living in MESA who received routine care from the Marshfield Clinic and who presented in an outpatient setting.</p><p>We sought to explain the variation in the age distribution of these cases by subtype and over time. Our model predicted the relative number of cases of influenza in each birth year each season as a function of the age structure of the population, age-specific differences in the risk of medically attended influenza A infection, early influenza infection, and vaccination. Despite the extensive antigenic evolution in both subtypes over the study period, we found strong evidence of protection from the subtype to which a birth cohort was likely first infected (the imprinting subtype) and variation in VE by birth cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study cohort</title><p>Cases of PCR-confirmed, medically attended influenza were identified from annual community cohorts based on residency in MESA. MESA is a contiguous geographic area surrounding Marshfield, Wisconsin, where nearly all 61,000 residents receive outpatient and inpatient care from the Marshfield Clinic Health System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kieke et al., 2015</xref>). For each influenza season from 2007 to 2008 through 2017–2018, we identified MESA residents &gt;6 months of age who received routine care from the Marshfield Clinic. These individuals were eligible for recruitment into that season’s VE study if they sought care for acute respiratory infection. Trained research coordinators recruited patients during clinical encounters in primary care departments, including urgent care, pediatrics, combined internal medicine and pediatrics, internal medicine, and family practice. Patients were enrolled on weekdays, evenings, and weekends when clinical services were provided. Research staff used an electronic appointment system to screen the chief complaints for respiratory or febrile illness. Patients were then approached in-person to assess eligibility based on specific respiratory symptoms and duration of illness. The proportion of patients with medically attended acute respiratory infection (MAARI) who were screened for enrollment varied by season and was largely determined by the volume of patients each day and staffing capacity. Only symptoms and illness duration were used to determine eligibility among those patients who were in the predefined cohort. Patients were also assessed for the presence of medical conditions that put them at high risk for complications from influenza infection, as defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). These conditions included cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, blood disorders, immunosuppressive disorders, metabolic disorders, and neurological/musculoskeletal disorders. We considered subjects vaccinated if they received that season’s influenza vaccine ≥14 days before enrollment. For the 2009–2010 season, we only considered receipt of the 2009 monovalent vaccine. The Marshfield Clinic generally does not capture MAARI in nursing facilities with dedicated medical staff, causing undersampling of the oldest age groups. We adjusted for this (Appendix 1: ‘Age-specific rates of approachment, enrollment, and nursing home residence’).</p><p>Each season, recruitment began when influenza activity was detected in the community and usually continued for 12–15 weeks. Symptom eligibility criteria varied by season but included fever/feverishness or cough during most seasons. We retroactively standardized symptom eligibility criteria to only require cough as a symptom. Individuals with illness duration &gt;7 days or presenting in an inpatient (hospital) setting were excluded. After obtaining informed consent, a mid-turbinate swab was obtained for influenza detection. RT-PCR was performed using CDC primers and probes to identify influenza cases, including type and subtype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Calculating differences in the age distribution between seasons</title><p>We defined the age distribution of each season as the number of cases of the dominant (more common) subtype in each of nine age groups (0–4 year-olds, 5–9 year-olds, 10–14 year-olds, 15–19 year-olds, 20–29 year-olds, 30–39 year-olds, 40–49 year-olds, 50–64 year-olds, and ≥65 years old). We excluded the subdominant subtype in each season due to concerns that short-term interference between the subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laurie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldstein et al., 2011</xref>) would affect the age distribution of the rarer subtype. The G-test of independence was used to measure differences in seasons’ age distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Calculating relative risk</title><p>To evaluate relative infection risk in different age groups, we measured their relative risk of infection in the first versus second half of each season. This risk is a combination of the chance of infection, conditional on infection (susceptibility), and the rate of contact with infected people. Attack rates should be higher in populations that experience more risk, and therefore these populations should be infected earlier in the epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2015</xref>). To calculate relative risk we used an approach similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2015</xref>. We defined the midpoint of each season as the week in which the cumulative number of cases of the dominant subtype among all people exceeded half the total for that season. Weeks before and after this point were assigned to the first and second half of the season, respectively. We assigned each case to one of the five age groups used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2015</xref> (0-4 year-olds, 5–17 year-olds, 18–49 year-olds, 50–64 year olds, and ≥65 years old).

Additionally, we expect that age groups may intrinsically differ in their healthcare-seeking behaviors. These factors are inseparable in our data, and all models represent their combined effects with a static age-specific parameter shared by both subtypes that describes the risk of age-specific medically attended influenza A infection (Mathematical expressions for model components: ‘Age-specific factors’). We assumed no intrinsic differences in the age-specific virulence of the two subtypes. These age-specific parameters were fitted. We also adjusted for other potential sources of age-specific bias, including age-specific differences in study approachment and enrollment rates (Appendix 1: ‘Age-specific rates of approachment, enrollment, and nursing home residence’).</p></list-item> <list-item> <p><italic>Imprinting.</italic> We tested several hypotheses of how primary exposures could affect the risk of medically attended infection with H1N1 and H3N2. In each version, we estimated fractional reductions in risk of medically attended H1N1 and H3N2 infection due to primary (i.e., imprinting) exposure to the same type:</p> <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Subtype-specific imprinting: Influenza has two main antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminadase (NA). Imprinting could in theory derive from responses to either or both antigens. Because H1N1 is the only seasonal subtype of influenza with N1, we cannot separate the effects of initial N1 exposure from initial H1 exposure. However, since N2 appears in both H3N2 and H2N2 viruses, we can estimate protection against H3N2 infection from initial N2 exposure separately from protection from initial H3 exposure (Mathematical expressions for model components: ‘HA subtype imprinting’ and ‘N2 imprinting’).</p></list-item> <list-item><p>Group-level imprinting: Influenza A viruses fall into two groups (I and II) corresponding to the two phylogenetic clades of HA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gostic et al., 2016</xref> found that primary infection by a virus belonging to one group protected against severe infection by another subtype in the same group. If group-level imprinting were influential, we would see primary infection with H2N2 conferring protection against H1N1, another group I virus, as well as H1N1 protecting against H1N1, and H3N2 against H3N2. We considered a separate class of models that assumes group-level protection instead of subtype-specific protection (Mathematical expressions for model components: ‘HA group imprinting’).</p></list-item></list> </list-item> <list-item><p><italic>Vaccination.</italic> Approximately 45% of the MESA population was vaccinated against influenza each year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; Appendix 1: ‘Vaccination coverage’). We estimated cases in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals of each birth year separately. Naively, we expect that vaccinated individuals should seek medical attention for acute respiratory infection proportionally to the fraction of their cohort vaccinated that season. However, vaccinated individuals may seek medical attention for acute respiratory infection more frequently than non-vaccinees due to correlations between the decision to vaccinate, healthcare-seeking behavior, and underlying medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jackson et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jackson et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belongia et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we generally observed higher rates of high-risk medical conditions among vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We attempted to adjust for this by calculating the fraction of vaccinated people among those who had MAARI and tested negative for influenza (i.e., the test-negative controls, ‘Mathematical expressions for model components: Vaccination’). We found that the vaccinated fraction exceeds vaccination coverage for most age groups, suggesting vaccinated individuals are overrepresented among cases for reasons unrelated to influenza (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also assumed that vaccination is not perfectly effective, and defined VE as the fractional reduction in cases expected in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals after controlling for the effects described above. We estimated subtype-specific VE under five scenarios: (i) constant across age groups and seasons; (ii) constant across age groups but season-specific; (iii) age-specific but constant across seasons; (iv) imprinting-specific; and (v) birth-cohort-specific. We assumed that vaccination affects risk only in the current season, i.e, vaccination in a prior season confers no residual protection (Mathematical expressions for model components: ‘Vaccination’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohmit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohmit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skowronski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pebody et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLean et al., 2018</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>We defined models as specific combinations of the above factors. We tested a set of 10 models by pairing each of the possible implementations of HA imprinting with each implementation of VE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Demography, age-specific effects, and N2 imprinting were included in all these models. To test whether more complex models truly improved model fit, we also tested a simple model with constant VE and no effect of imprinting.

The seven H3N2-dominated seasons display three types of age distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, clusters of lighter-colored cells in the upper left-hand quadrant), and two correspond to major antigenic clusters (2007–2008, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fonville et al., 2016</xref>; 2010–2012, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ann et al., 2012</xref>). These differences sometimes coincide with significant shifts in the age distribution between seasons. For instance, the highest fraction of H3N2 cases occurs in 20–29 year olds in the 2007–2008 season, but this age group has the lowest fraction of cases in the next H3N2-dominated season (2010–2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In H1N1, the shift from seasonal to pandemic strains is associated with large changes in the age distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, lower right-hand quadrant).</p><p>We found further evidence that age groups differed in their susceptibility across seasons by examining the relative risk of infection during the first versus second half of each epidemic period (Materials and methods: ‘Calculating relative risk’). Individuals at greater risk of infection should be infected disproportionately early rather than late in an epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed that an age group’s relative risk correlates with the fraction of cases within that age group in the same season (Pearson’s r = 0.58, 95% CI 0.38–0.73; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; Appendix 1: ‘Correlation of relative risk and fraction of cases’). This trend is evident for H1N1 (Pearson’s r = 0.73, 95% CI 0.45–0.88; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and H3N2 seasons separately (Pearson’s r = 0.52, 95% CI 0.30–0.69; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The positive correlation in all seasons is robust to undersampling of cases at the start and end of seasons (Appendix 1: ‘Sensitivity to sampling effort’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This provides supporting evidence that the different numbers of cases in each age group reflect underlying differences in infection risk.</p><p>Just as the age distribution of cases varies over time, the age groups with high relative risks of infection change over time. If people contact one another similarly from one season to the next, these shifting relative risks imply that age groups’ relative susceptibilities change over time. For instance, 5–17 year olds had the highest relative risk of early infection in the 2008–2009 season, whereas 50–64 year-olds had the highest relative risk in the 2013–2014 season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Relative risks in MESA vary more than national estimates, which show that 5–17 year-olds had the highest relative risk in all but one season from the 2009 pandemic to 2013–2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2015</xref>). These differences may partly be due to the fact that our measurements of relative risk use outpatient visits, whereas the national estimates use hospitalizations.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that the risk of influenza infection is not a simple function of age alone. Other factors, such as past influenza infections and vaccination, might explain the changing age distributions of cases in time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Imprinting probabilities of age groups change over time</title><p>We hypothesized that variation in the age distribution of cases could be explained by the aging of birth cohorts with similar early exposure histories. This would cause the early exposure history of an age group, and thus potentially its susceptibility, to change in time. To calculate the probability that people in a particular age group had their first influenza A infection with a particular subtype, we adapted the approach from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gostic et al., 2016</xref>. Briefly, we calculated the probability that an individual born in a specific year had a primary infection with H1N1, H2N2, or H3N2 using data on relative epidemic sizes and the frequencies of circulating subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods: ‘Calculating imprinting probabilities’).</p><p>As expected, age groups’ early exposures are not static and change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Older people nonetheless tend to be imprinted to H1N1 or H2N2, whereas younger people have higher probabilities of imprinting to H3N2. The effects of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic are evident in the three youngest age groups as a transient increase (from 2009 to approximately 2013) in their H1N1 imprinting probability. These imprinting probabilities are relatively well-constrained even after for accounting for uncertainty in epidemic size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; Appendix 1: ‘Sensitivity to uncertainty in ILI and the frequency of influenza A’).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Imprinting probabilities by age group across seasons.</title><p>Each panel shows the imprinting probabilities of an age group from the 2007–2008 season through the 2017–2018 season.

Because first infections are also recent infections in children, we reasoned that the observed imprinting effects might arise from confounding with recent infections in these ages. Based on an estimated 7 year half-life of homologous protection after H1N1pdm infection in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ranjeva et al., 2019</xref>) and the fact that most children experience primary influenza A infection by 5 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodewes et al., 2011</xref>), we reasoned that excluding children &lt;15 years old would diminish the impact of protection from recent infection on our results. When we excluded the youngest age groups, our estimates of H1N1 imprinting protection decreased while H3N2 imprinting protection increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, second row). However, initial infection by H1N1 was still more protective than initial infection by H3N2, both imprinting effects remained positive, and there was no significant change in the values of other estimated parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>).</p><p>The effects of recent infection should also manifest in the difference between the observed and estimated numbers of cases (i.e., the excess cases, Appendix 1: ‘Calculating excess cases’), since unlike typical transmission models, our model does not take prior-season infections into account when estimating cases for the current season. More infections in a birth cohort in one season should reduce susceptibility in that birth cohort at the start of the next season. We thus expect that excess cases in one season will be followed by missing cases in the next season dominated by that subtype (i.e., a negative correlation in excess cases). Instead, we observed that excess cases for each birth cohort are weakly positively correlated from season to season, suggesting that immunity from recent infections is not a major driver of temporal variation in the age distribution of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Since older adults have the highest probability of primary infection with H1N1, we also reasoned that older adults might disproportionately drive the strong protection from H1N1 imprinting we observe. People born before 1947 were likely exposed to H1N1 strains that are antigenically similar to the post-pandemic H1N1 strains that comprise most of our H1N1 infection data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manicassamy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Donnell et al., 2012</xref>), creating the possibility that strain-specific cross-immunity drives the pattern we attribute to subtype-specific imprinting. These people nearly all fall into the ≥65 year-old age group in the study period. The study also underenrolled medically attended infections among people in nursing facilities, which would artificially lower the case count in this age group and may affect estimates of imprinting protection. Therefore, we excluded adults ≥65 years old and refitted our models. Excluding the oldest adults does not significantly change estimated imprinting protection or other parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>).</p><p>When we exclude both the youngest and oldest age groups, initial infections by H1N1 and H3N2 have similar protective effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, bottom row).

We chose birth cohorts that corresponded to the age groups of the original model in 2017–2018 (Materials and methods: ‘Vaccination’), keeping the number of parameters the same (e.g., VE in the 20–29 age group became VE in the 1988–1997 birth year cohort). We find that age-specific VE still outperforms all other models after we exclude the oldest age group (≥65 years old). In contrast, birth-cohort-specific VE performs better when we exclude children &lt;15 years old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This is further evidence that subtype-specific imprinting cannot explain all age variation. As mentioned before, this season provided one of the first examples that original antigenic sin could affect protection: middle-aged adults had been targeting a familiar site on the pandemic strain that then mutated, rendering them susceptible. Other age groups were effectively blind to these changes, owing to their different exposure histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Linderman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dávila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petrie et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The distribution of influenza cases by birth year is consistent with subtype-level imprinting, whereby initial infection with a subtype protects against future medically attended infections by the same subtype. The stronger protective effect observed from primary H1N1 infection compared to primary H3N2 infection may be caused by stronger cross-protective responses to conserved epitopes in the more slowly evolving H1N1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedford et al., 2015</xref>). This is in line with previous work showing that protection conferred by H1N1 infection lasts longer than protection conferred by H3N2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ranjeva et al., 2019</xref>). Another recent study found stronger imprinting protection from primary H1N1 compared to primary H3N2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gostic et al., 2019</xref>). Subtype-specific protection observed in seasonal influenza is narrower than the previously reported HA-group-level imprinting protection against avian influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gostic et al., 2016</xref>), but in both cases, the protection correlates strongly with primary infection rather than any prior exposure.</p><p>Examining cases of seasonal influenza over a 20 year period in Arizona, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gostic et al., 2019</xref> find evidence of imprinting protection not only from HA but also NA, which we do not. We speculate that this discrepancy may be due to increasing vaccination coverage over time in middle-aged adults. During the period of the Arizona study (1993–1994 through 2014–2015), vaccination coverage in U.S. adults increased most rapidly in this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">NHIS, 2009</xref>), which corresponds to the H2N2-imprinted cohorts near the end of the study. Without adjustment for vaccination, the apparently increased protection in the middle aged might resemble N2 imprinting. Accounting for vaccination in the MESA population, including the relatively stable vaccination coverage in each age group over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggests imprinting protection is driven by HA.</p><p>In contrast to the clear role of the imprinting subtype in protection against medically attended infection, the model implicates the imprinting strain or other attributes of early exposure history in VE. We expect that people born around the same time were likely exposed to similar strains, not just subtypes, of influenza A early in life, and our results support the idea that biases in immune memory from these early exposures (i.e., original antigenic sin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davenport and Hennessy, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francis, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fazekas de St Groth and Webster, 1966</xref>) influence VE. Specifically, we observe that our model is consistent with previous suggestions of birth-cohort-specific VE. The model with birth-cohort-specific VE better estimates cases in vaccinated 50–64 year-olds (born 1953–1967) in the 2015–2016 season than the model with age-specific VE, as indicated by the fewer excess cases predicted in that age group and an improved fit of 1.1 log-likelihood units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; Appendix 1: ‘Calculating excess cases’). Reduced VE in this group during the 2015–2016 season has been attributed to the exacerbation of antigenic mismatch by the vaccine in adults whose antibody responses were focused on a non-protective site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skowronski et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flannery et al., 2018</xref>). The improved performance of birth-cohort-specific VE relative to age-specific VE suggests other seasons and age groups where original antigenic sin might have influenced VE, such as 20–29 year-olds in the 2007–2008 influenza season.</p><p>Although seasonal estimates of VE routinely stratify by age, shifts in VE from one season to the next might thus be easier to interpret in light of infection history (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skowronski et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flannery et al., 2018</xref>). The results suggest this effect may be subtle, i.e, influenced by strains’ specific identities rather than merely their subtype. Our model cannot distinguish between the possibility that the precise identity of the imprinting strain primarily determines later VE, or if individuals’ responses to vaccination are shaped by a particular succession of exposures, which would be common to others in the same birth cohort. Regardless, variation in VE between birth cohorts appears substantial and presents a challenge for vaccination strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erbelding et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The use of different influenza vaccines in MESA during this period is unlikely to affect the results. Most people enrolled in the study received the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). However, between 9–26% of vaccinated children &lt;18 years old received the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) between the 2008–2009 and 2015–2016 seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>). A separate study of LAIV VE in the United States found that LAIV and IIV-SD recipients who were repeat vaccinees (as most children were) had similar VE, and thus we do not expect that LAIV receipt should affect VE estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLean et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, 1–15% of adults ≥65 years old received the high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV-HD) between 2009–2010 and 2017–2018 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C</xref>). This vaccine is 20% more effective than IIV-SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the changing ratio of IIV-HD to IIV-SD recipients over time might bias results toward cohort-specific VE in models that include people ≥65 years old. However, when we fitted to cases between 15–64 years old, we found that cohort-specific VE still performed best. Thus, we conclude that changes in IIV-HD coverage do not substantially influence results.</p><p>Potential methodological biases and the vaccination history of the study population nonetheless suggest caution in interpreting VE estimates. Selection and misclassification biases can arise when using influenza test-negative controls to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewnard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>). Because we also use test-negative controls to set our null expectation for the distribution of cases among birth cohorts, our VE estimates are subject to these biases as well. Moreover, since 45% of the study population is vaccinated, and most participants are frequent vaccinees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), we are limited in our ability to generalize the VE results to populations with much lower vaccination coverage and/or a shorter history of vaccination. Frequent vaccination has been associated with reduced VE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McLean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skowronski et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the model may underestimate VE in less vaccinated populations. Underestimation of VE could also occur if unvaccinated people are protected by vaccination in the preceding season. Inference might also be distorted if vaccination has large indirect effects, which our model does not consider. Finally, our analysis is worth repeating in a larger population to reduce stochastic influences. We observed an unusually high H1N1 VE in the 1998–2002 birth cohort. Because we restricted cases in this analysis to people ≥15 years old, this VE estimate included data from only the 2013–2014 and 2015–2016 influenza seasons. No H1N1 cases among vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals were observed in this birth cohort in those seasons, which led to the high VE. This might have been due to particular epidemic dynamics in MESA.</p><p>Incorporating differences in susceptibility based on early exposures might improve methods to forecast influenza seasons. The analysis of the relative risk of infection during the first half of each season shows more variation in the susceptible age groups from season to season than previously estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worby et al., 2015</xref>). While the smaller sample sizes in MESA introduce uncertainty, the correlation between the relative risk and total fraction of cases indicates that the age groups driving epidemics indeed change from season to season. Because the contact structure of the population is probably constant over influenza seasons, variation in the driving age group may be determined by fluctuating susceptibility, which is partly determined by early infections. Therefore, incorporating information on early exposure history into epidemic models may allow for more accurate identification of at-risk populations and fine-scale epidemic timing.</p><p>While the rate of antigenic evolution affects the rate at which different populations become susceptible to infection, we propose that the heterogeneity in susceptibility observed here may also drive antigenic evolution. Heterogeneity in susceptibility implies that influenza viruses face different selective pressures in groups with different exposure histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cobey and Koelle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakajima et al., 2000</xref>). Recent research consistent with this hypothesis has shown that sera isolated from different individuals can select for distinct escape mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). More careful study of how immune memory to influenza evolves from infection and vaccination might improve understanding of influenza’s evolution.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Code and data availability</title><p>The code and data used to perform the analyses for this project are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cobeylab/FluAImprinting">https://github.com/cobeylab/FluAImprinting</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arevalo et al., 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/FluAImprinting">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/FluAImprinting</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jennifer King and Carla Rottscheit for their assistance in providing the data for this study and Rohan Dandavati for compiling historical data on subtype frequencies and ILI.

We randomly assigned ILI values from the 1997–1998 through 2017–2018 seasons to every season which did not have a measured ILI value. Similarly, we randomly assigned values of the frequency of influenza A from the 1976–1977 through 2017–2018 seasons to every season which did not have a measured value for the frequency of influenza A. We created 10000 simulated datasets using this procedure and recalculated imprinting probabilities for each dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the period of H1N1 and H3N2 co-circulation, the maximum H1N1 imprinting probability for a particular birth cohort corresponds to the minimum H3N2 imprinting probability for that cohort and vice-versa. Therefore, to generate datasets representing the upper and lower bounds of imprinting probabilities, we assigned imprinting probabilities from the simulation with either the lowest or highest H1N1 imprinting probability to each birth cohort in each season. We then fitted our models to these two datasets and evaluated model fit using cAIC.</p></sec><sec id="s18" sec-type="appendix"><title>Sensitivity to age groups</title><p>To test whether our models were sensitive to our choice of age groups, we fit revised versions of all our models with different age groups:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item> <p>0–4 years, 5–17 years, 18–49 years, 50–64 years, and ≥65 years</p> </list-item> <list-item> <p>0–4 years, 5–17 years, 18–64 years, and ≥65 years</p> </list-item></list><p>These models with alternate age groupings were fitted to case data to determine whether our findings on the strength of protection from initial H1N1 and H3N2 infection were altered compared to fits using the higher-resolution age grouping described above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table4">Appendix 2—table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s19" sec-type="appendix"><title>Sensitivity to sampling effort</title><p>Sampling effort was not even across seasons, and analysis of the number of influenza cases per sampling day suggested that a significant number of cases may have been missed at the beginning or end of a specific seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). As our analysis of relative risk indicates, different age groups are more susceptible during different points in the influenza season, and therefore missing data from the beginning or end of a season could introduce bias in the observed age distribution of cases.</p><p>To adjust for this, we simulated cases for seasons which did not have sufficient sampling of the start or end of the epidemic period. We considered a season sufficiently sampled if the sampling period spanned the start and end of the epidemic. We expect that the start and end of the epidemic have few cases per sampling day, and we therefore defined sufficiently sampled seasons as seasons where</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the number of cases per sampling day in the first week of the enrollment period is &lt; 1 and</p></list-item> <list-item><p>the number of cases per sampling day in the last week of the enrollment period is &lt; 1.</p></list-item></list><p>To extrapolate the start of a season, we linearly regressed the number of cases of the dominant subtype per sampling day for each week of the first half of the season and identified the week of the season where the number of cases per sampling day fell below 1 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf291"><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>). For each week from <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf292"><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to the first week of the enrollment period, we used the regression of cases per sampling day to calculate the number of cases we expected to see in each week. Summing these yields the total number of unsampled cases at the beginning of the season. We used a similar approach to extrapolate the number of unsampled cases at the end of a season by instead regressing cases per sampling day for each week of the latter half of the season. We did not extrapolate cases for the 2010–2011 season for this analysis since the observed number of cases per sampling day did not follow a typical epidemic curve.</p><p>We stochastically assigned a birth year and vaccination status to these cases according to a multinomial distribution. The success probabilities of this distribution were set using the age distribution of cases of the dominant subtype from the first two weeks of the enrollment period (if extrapolating the beginning of a season) or the last two weeks of the enrollment period (if extrapolating the end of a season). Specifically, we calculated the distribution of observed cases in the first or last two weeks of the enrollment period among nine age groups (Materials and Methods: ‘Age-specific factors’) with their associated vaccination status. We then assumed that cases were uniformly distributed among all birth years contained in an age group. This yielded a set of probabilities describing the probability of infection given birth year and vaccination status in a specific season.</p><p>We sampled from these multinomial distributions 1000 times to obtain augmented datasets that combined observed and extrapolated cases. For each replicate simulation, we calculated the age distribution of cases for the entire season as well as the relative risk of each age group in the first versus the latter half of the season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also fitted the best-fitting model to 100 of these datasets (excluding the 2010–2011 season) and recorded the estimated imprinting strength for both H1N1 and H3N2 for each fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s20" sec-type="appendix"><title>Calculating excess cases</title><p>We defined excess cases for a given birth cohort or age group as the number of observed cases for that birth cohort or age group minus the number of predicted cases for that age group. Predictions were obtained by multiplying the multinomial probabilities produced by the model by the total number of cases of the dominant subtype in each season. A 95% prediction interval was obtained by simulating 10000 datasets using the multinomial probabilities from a specific model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>,

multiple times. This is because changes in the virus mean that acquired immunity to a strain causing one infection will not, in general, be able to prevent subsequent infections with different strains. The first influenza infection a person experiences may have a particularly strong influence on how the immune system responds to subsequent influenza infections. In this study, the effects of these early influenza exposures (determined indirectly by birth year) are examined with a thorough and elegant analysis of high quality influenza data. The findings provide strong evidence that the first infection does indeed have an important influence, explaining variation in the age distribution of influenza cases in different influenza seasons and variation in vaccine effectiveness. The evidence that vaccine effectiveness varies with birth cohort and not just with age, in particular, has important implications for how we think about vaccine effectiveness.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Earliest infections predict the age distribution of seasonal influenza A cases&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Baguelin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents an analysis of 10 years of clinical testing of respiratory illness cases for influenza from a single population in the US. Data include PCR-confirmed influenza cases including type and sub-type, age and vaccine history. The analysis aims to quantify the effects of earliest influenza infections in childhood on subsequent risk of clinical infection with different subtypes, a question of considerable scientific interest. The analysis provides evidence that susceptibility to different subtypes is determined by the subtype of the first infection (as proxied by the birth cohort) and that vaccine responses are driven by precise infection history.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Fairly substantial re-organisation of the paper is needed in order to improve readability. In particular, although the Results and Discussion are separate sections, the Results sections tend to stray into discussion, and we advise you to change this. Furthermore, this manuscript would profit from putting the Materials and methods before the Results. Although it is normal to structure <italic>eLife</italic> articles with the Materials and methods section following the Discussion, we can accommodate different organisation if the editors feel the paper requires this for readability.</p><p>2) In some places more precise terminology is needed and the almost interchangeable use of infection and case is potentially confusing. These data are all obtained from people seeking care and the primary results are about subtype differences. At the very least, the language describing the results has to be very tightly constrained to cases with any discussion of possible implications for infections reserved for the discussion. Although there is a paucity of good data describing the rate at which H1 and H3 result in clinical cases, there is no suggestion that this is a uniform process. It likely varies from year to year and from age group to age group.</p><p>3) The formal description of the models was in some places ambiguous or confusing and this section needs careful attention.</p><p>4) We strongly suggest that the results should be about cases as a function of birth cohort (as these are the data available) and then the idea that birth cohort may be a proxy for infection history should be reserved for the discussion. Even in older people, recent infection history will vary among people the same age and will likely to be a dominant factor in both risk of infection and risk of clinical disease. Especially, given other publications from the group looking at epitope-level histories, mapping infection history so strongly onto birth cohort seems unusual.</p><p>5) The results are likely to be of wide interest because of the duration of the study and the consistency of the study design. However, the population from which they come is not representative. Levels of vaccination in the US are extremely high and, given how vaccination efficacy is measured by reduced rates of clinical disease rather than by reduced rates of infection, and these data are from clinical cases, caution is needed when generalizing these results. Even though this is mentioned in the discussion, the characteristics of the population are not given sufficient prominence in the Abstract and Discussion.</p><p>6) Please provide a visualisation of the raw data showing how many tests were done in each year, and what was their outcome, stratified by reported vaccination status. How did the control population compare?</p><p>7) Throughout the manuscript the authors dichotomise results into significant/non-significant based on whether p-values are below or above the arbitrary threshold of 0.05 (and in some cases it is only reported whether p-values are above or below, the actual values are not given). While this is common practice, it goes against mainstream statistical thinking which advises against the use of such &quot;bright lines&quot; when reporting or interpreting results (see the recent consensus statement on p-values from the American Statistical Association which &quot;is intended to steer research into a post p&lt;0.05 era.&quot; https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf). While p-values clearly have a role (though the authors should bear in mind that with enough data, an arbitrarily small difference of no clinical significance can have an arbitrarily small p-value) dichotomising results into significant /non-significant is rarely helpful. We strongly encourage the authors to consider whether this approach is justified in light of the ASA statement and to consider revising the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>8) While not an essential revision, out-of-sample validation of the models (rather than just model comparison) would greatly strengthen the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50060.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Fairly substantial re-organisation of the paper is needed in order to improve readability.

We have revised the Abstract:</p><p>“Seasonal variation in the age distribution of influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to medically attended infection. We ask whether these differences can be partly explained by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against new influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting). Fitting a statistical model to data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life. This effect is stronger for H1N1 compared to H3N2. Additionally, we find evidence that VE varies with both age and birth year, suggesting that VE is sensitive to early exposures. Our findings may improve estimates of age-specific risk and VE in similarly vaccinated populations and thus improve forecasting and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.”</p><p>We have also added the following line to the Discussion:</p><p>“Moreover, since 45% of the study population is vaccinated, and most participants are frequent vaccinees (Figure 1—figure supplement 6), we are limited in our ability to generalize the VE results to populations with much lower vaccination coverage and/or a shorter history of vaccination. Frequent vaccination has been associated with reduced VE (McLean et al., 2014; Saito et al., 2018; Skowronski et al., 2016). Therefore, the model may underestimate VE in less vaccinated populations. Underestimation of VE could also occur if unvaccinated people are protected by vaccination in the preceding season. Inference might also be distorted if vaccination has large indirect effects, which our model does not consider.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please provide a visualisation of the raw data showing how many tests were done in each year, and what was their outcome, stratified by reported vaccination status. How did the control population compare?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the data of all enrolled (i.e., tested) individuals for each season, stratified by age, vaccination status, and test outcome as Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The proportion of test-positive cases changes between age groups and seasons, consistent with susceptibility of each age group changing over time. The proportion of vaccinated cases among test-positive cases is generally smaller than the proportion of vaccinated cases among test-negative cases, consistent with the protective effect of vaccination.</p><p>We also stratified our comorbidity analysis by age, season, vaccination status, and test status (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Regardless of test outcome, vaccinated people tend to have more high-risk comorbidities than unvaccinated people. We used test-negative cases to adjust for this effect when estimating VE and have clarified this in our overview of the modeling method:</p><p>“However, vaccinated individuals may seek medical attention for acute respiratory infection more frequently than non-vaccinees due to correlations between the decision to vaccinate, healthcare-seeking behavior, and underlying medical conditions (Jackson et al., 2005a,b; Belongia et al., 2009). Indeed, we generally observe higher rates of high-risk medical conditions among vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). We attempted to adjust for this by calculating the fraction of vaccinated people among those who had MAARI and tested negative for influenza (i.e., the test-negative controls, Mathematical expressions for model components: &quot;Vaccination&quot;).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Throughout the manuscript the authors dichotomise results into significant/non-significant based on whether p-values are below or above the arbitrary threshold of 0.05 (and in some cases it is only reported whether p-values are above or below, the actual values are not given).

While p-values clearly have a role (though the authors should bear in mind that with enough data, an arbitrarily small difference of no clinical significance can have an arbitrarily small p-value) dichotomising results into significant /non-significant is rarely helpful.

For the modelling results, we report 95% confidence intervals for parameter estimates in an effort to focus on effect sizes and windows of uncertainty. Here, we believe that it is reasonable to use terms such as “not significantly different” to denote parameter estimates under different models that cannot be statistically distinguished from each other.</p><p>In other places, we have revised the text and figures to report our results more accurately:</p><p>Materials and methods text changed from “The G-test of independence was used to determine whether each pair of seasons had significantly different age distributions. We considered differences significant if the Bonferroni-corrected p-value was &lt;0.05” to “The G-test of independence was used to measure differences in seasons' age distributions.”. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we now report both p-values and the G-statistic (a measure of effect size) for all pairs of seasons.</p><p>We now report the correlation between an age group’s rank in relative risk in a season and its rank in relative size (the fraction of cases) in that season (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We also report confidence intervals for Pearson’s r instead of p-values.</p><p>We removed the dashed line that indicated the value of Spearman’s ρ corresponding to a p-value of 0.05.</p><p>We removed p-values and replaced them with 95% confidence intervals of Spearman’s ρ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) While not an essential revision, out-of-sample validation of the models (rather than just model comparison) would greatly strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis, which yielded the same results. Briefly, we excluded a single season of data, refitted all models to this subset, and evaluated how well each model predicted the birth year distribution of cases for the excluded season (subsection “Evaluation of predictive power”).</p><p>Leave-one-out cross-validation gave the same main result as our original findings based on cAIC. The model with the lowest mean-squared prediction error included age-specific medically attended infection risk, age-specific vaccine effectiveness, and HA imprinting by subtype. We have added this to the Results section:</p><p>“Our best-fitting model supports subtype-specific imprinting for H1N1 and H3N2 (Figure 5, top row; Appendix 2: Table 1). This model also provides the best predictive power compared to other models in a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis (Figure 5—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplement 2; Appendix 1: “Evaluation of predictive power”).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
