Flow cytometric measurement of puromycylated ribosome-associated nascent chains after treating cells or mice with translation initiation inhibitors reveals that ribosomes in resting lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo elongate at typical rates for mammalian cells. Intriguingly, elongation rates can be increased up to 30% by activation in vivo or fever temperature in vitro. Resting and activated lymphocytes possess abundant monosome populations, most of which actively translate in vivo, while in vitro, nearly all can be stalled prior to activation. Quantitating lymphocyte protein mass and ribosome count reveals a paradoxically high ratio of cellular protein to ribosomes insufficient to support their rapid in vivo division, suggesting that the activated lymphocyte proteome in vivo may be generated in an unusual manner. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a global understanding of protein synthesis in lymphocytes and other rapidly dividing immune cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosomes</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>OT-I</kwd><kwd>ribopuromycylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yewdell</surname><given-names>Jonathan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative protein and ribosome 'accounting' in T cells highlights a gap in our understanding of how activated T cells sufficiently replicate their proteome during rapid cell division driven by infection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Naive lymphocytes are among the smallest nucleated cells in mammals â nearly devoid of cytoplasm, with few mitochondria â and have minimal metabolic activity, consistent with doubling times on the order of hundreds to thousands of days, respectively, for B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macallan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Gent et al., 2008</xref>) and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vrisekoop et al., 2008</xref>). Within a day of activation by cognate antigen, lymphocytes begin to divide rapidly, with reported doubling times as rapid as 6 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jelley-Gibbs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 1988</xref>). Such Jekyll and Hyde behavior requires massive induction of DNA and protein synthesis to support daughter cell production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marshall and Roberts, 1963</xref>) as well as synthesizing large amounts of immune regulatory (e.g., cytokines) and effector molecules (e.g., antibody and cytokines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ripps and Hirschhorn, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gery and Waksman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mier and Gallo, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Pioneering studies of protein synthesis regulation in lymphocytes utilizing radiolabeled amino acids on mitogen-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes reported 7- to 20-fold increases in protein synthesis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirschhorn et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kay and Korner, 1966</xref>). While this is an impressive increase, it was assumed that sufficient protein was synthesized to enable the generation of daughter cells with the same protein content as their progenitor. Moreover, radiolabeling, like all methods, is imperfect, and its accuracy as a measure of protein synthesis rates depends on assumptions that are nearly impossible to definitively verify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yewdell et al., 2011</xref>). Applying new methods to old problems is a tried-and-true method for generating new insights and discoveries.</p><p>Indeed, newer methods, including ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>), tRNA arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dittmar et al., 2006</xref>), and tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">SchwanhÃ¤usser et al., 2009</xref>), are revolutionizing the field of protein synthesis. This includes extending classical methods. Puromycin (PMY) is an aminonucleoside antibiotic that mimics tyrosine-tRNA, binding the ribosome A site and causing rapid chain termination by covalently attaching to the C-terminus of the nascent chain. PMY was first applied in classical protein synthesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pestka, 1971</xref>) and remains a workhorse in understanding ribosomal catalysis of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eggers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano and Hara, 1979</xref>).</p><p>We developed the ribopuromycylation method (RPM) to better localize and quantify active protein synthesis. RPM uses a brief pulse of PMY to label elongating nascent chains frozen on ribosomes by treating cells with a translation elongation inhibitor. Ribosome-bound nascent chains are then detected using a PMY-specific monoclonal antibody in fixed and permeabilized cells via standard immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>) or flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seedhom et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use RPM, and the ribosome transit assay (RTA), an extension of RPM that measures elongation rates, in conjunction with classic techniques to quantify the number and protein synthesis activity of ribosomes in resting and activated human and mouse lymphocytes. Our findings reveal novel features of lymphocyte translation as well as a discrepancy in the protein synthesis capacity of T cells with respect to their rapid in vivo division rates, emphasizing the importance of quantitative accounting as a reality check for our limited understanding of fundamental aspects of cell biology and immunology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing protein synthesis in human lymphocytes ex vivo with flow RPM implicates widespread ribosome stalling in non-activated cells</title><p>We first used flow RPM to compare translation in non-activated vs. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin/IL-2-activated human lymphocyte subsets after 2 and 5 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

On day 2, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated a wide range of RPM staining, with nearly all divided cells at day 5 CFSE<sup>low</sup> and RPM<sup>high</sup>. Some divided cells exhibited near baseline RPM signals, however, consistent with their return to a resting state. Interestingly, although non-activated cells did not divide, ~50% demonstrated increased RPM staining.</p><p>We noted that the RPM signal in PMA/ionomycin-activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was only two- to fivefold higher than in non-activated cells. This increase is modest compared to the ~15-fold activation-induced increase in protein synthesis in original studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirschhorn et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kay and Korner, 1966</xref>). To examine this discrepancy, we first incubated cells for 15 min with initiation inhibitors (harringtonine, HAR; pactamycin, PA) or elongation inhibitors (emetine, EME; cycloheximide, CHX), followed by RPM staining. Elongation inhibitors had minor effects on RPM of activated or resting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as expected due to ribosome retention of nascent chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>). Initiation inhibitors, however, clearly discriminated between resting and activated cells. RPM signal was diminished by up to 80â90% on day 5 post-activation. Note that at the standard translation rate of 6 amino acids/s, 15 min is sufficient time to complete translation of all but the very longest transcripts.</p><p>We repeated this experiment using day 1 resting lymphocytes to directly compare flow RPM with classical metabolic radiolabeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leucine ([<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All inhibitors nearly completely blocked incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu into proteins, suggesting that there were actively translating ribosomes in resting cells and that the inhibitors were active, even though RPM labeling was only weakly impacted. We also performed a time course examining [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu incorporation compared to flow RPM signal in day 1 resting, day 1 activated, and day 5 activated human lymphocytes. Plotting the ratios between activated and non-activated cells from RPM flow vs. [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu incorporation revealed a substantial difference between the two methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we cannot attribute the persistence of flow RPM staining in translation initiation inhibitor-treated resting lymphocytes to incomplete inhibition of protein synthesis. Instead, these data are consistent with a significant fraction of âstalledâ ribosomes in cultured resting cells, that is, ribosomes with nascent chains that are not actively translating. Stalled ribosomes would be labeled with PMY, as originally described in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graber et al., 2013</xref>), but would not incorporate [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu, just as we observe with resting lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Flow RPM measures ribosome elongation rates in live cells</title><p>To extend these findings, we developed a variation of approaches that use initiation inhibitors to measure ribosome transit times, for example by conversion of polysomes to monosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conn and Qian, 2013</xref>) or ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>).

For these experiments, we used the optimized protocol for in vitro OT-I T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2017</xref>) that greatly increased the fraction of ribosomes in polysomes on day 1 post activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>T cell accounting reveals discrepancy in proteome duplication rate for activated T cells in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Measurements made to calculate in vitro and in vivo rates of T cell division.

The maximal number of translating ribosomes is limited by the less abundant subunit, which in all cases is the 60S subunit (typically 75â90% of the 40S subunit). 60S subunits increased both in absolute terms and per unit cell volume as T cells became activated, reaching a maximum of ~3.6 million copies per T cell following 2d in vitro activation from 264,000 copies in resting T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6FâG</xref>). These numbers are similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>, but should be more accurate since Wolf et al. used total cellular RNA content to estimate ribosomes.</p><p>Could there be a significant pool of non-functional ribosomes in the nucleus, where initial assembly occurs, and which occupies nearly 50% of the volume of resting T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petrzilka et al., 1978</xref>) and 34% of activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrzilka and Schroeder, 1979</xref>)?

This dropped up to threefold as T cells became activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Therefore, the division rates of in vitro activated OT-I T cells, and HeLa cells can be approximated from the number of proteins and functional ribosomes translating a full capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Paradoxical discrepancy in OT-I cell division rate and protein synthesis capacity</title><p>We extended these findings to OT-I T cells in vivo, determining first that adoptively transferred OT-I T cells divide most rapidly between days 1 and 2 of activation during acute viral infection, with an average doubling time of 6.8 hr, slowing to approximately 7.7 hr by day 2 post-infection (via CFSE labeling; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>).

Cells activated in vivo were similar in size and protein content to in vitro activated cells, but the protein-to-ribosome ratio was significantly higher than in vitro activated T cells due to the presence of 2.3 vs. 3.6 million 60S subunits in maximally in vitro activated T cells.</p><p>Remarkably, the ratio of proteins to ribosomes (1017) at this juncture dictates a minimal proteome duplication time of 22.2 hr, nearly 3Ã the measured doubling time of 7.7 hr.

To counter the essentially infinite diversity of antigens expressed by pathogens, lymphocytes evolved to generate an enormous repertoire of specific antigen receptors. Hosts hope to never need the repertoire, and until a cognate antigen appears, metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, are minimized (this might also extend the life span of naive cells since the generation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) and other damaging chemical byproducts will also be minimized). Upon activation, lymphocytes divide rapidly to achieve numbers capable of exerting effective immunity. Here, we studied aspects of protein synthesis in lymphocytes, a field fairly dormant since the pioneering studies by the Kay and Cooper laboratories in the 70s but now experiencing a renaissance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2017</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf et al., 2020</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2017</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marchingo and Cantrell, 2022</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howden et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To measure translation elongation rates in vivo and in vitro, we developed flow RTA, which is far simpler and cheaper than original (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan and Penman, 1970</xref>) and recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conn and Qian, 2013</xref>) methods and provides information at the level of individual cells simultaneously phenotyped by standard flow cytometry markers. While this work was in progress, the Pierre lab described âSunRiSEâ, a nearly identical approach, to measure elongation rates in vitro, observing similar puromycylation decay rates following HAR treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">ArgÃ¼ello et al., 2018</xref>). While our findings are similar regarding the elongation rates of fibroblasts and lymphocytes, the addition of elongation inhibitors to the protocol (CHX or EME) greatly reduces the leakiness of HAR, thereby improving the calculated elongation rate accuracy.</p><p>RTA revealed exciting facets of lymphocyte translation. We find that a significant fraction of ex vivo lymphocytes possess stalled/primed ribosomes that puromycylate nascent chains but do not transit mRNA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graber et al., 2013</xref> used the original RPM protocol to show that primary neurons possess substantial numbers of stalled ribosomes, apparently to facilitate rapid translation upon synaptic signaling. Otherwise, to our knowledge, such prolonged ribosomal stalling has not been described in mammalian cells. These experiments may also be useful in examining the phenomenon of âpoised mRNAâ, originally described in lymphocytes for cytokine mRNAs and more recently expanded on with advanced sequencing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turner, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our improved RTA protocol reveals the dramatic upregulation of protein synthesis by OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated in vivo, with a 15-fold increase in translation in day 1 activated OT-I T cells vs. resting OT-I T cells. Activated T cells divide every 6.8 hr from day 1 to 2 post-VACV-SIINFEKL infection. This is consistent with a prior OT-I study in mice infected with a different SIINFEKL-expressing VACV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, by i.v. delivery of translation inhibitors, we show that RTA can be used to measure elongation rates in vivo. Though we focus on lymphocytes, in vivo RTA can be used to study any cell type in animals that can be analyzed ex vivo by flow cytometry.</p><p>Contrary to observations in vitro, ribosomes are not stalled in naive mouse T cells in vivo, as we show via RTA analysis of non-activated T cells. Importantly, ribosome transit times were up to ~30% faster in activated cells, consistent with the idea that lymphocytes can accelerate translation to support activation and the rapid cell division that ensues. Similarly, OT-I T cells increased elongation rates in vitro when incubated at fever temperature (39.5Â°C). While such accelerated translation may decrease translational fidelity, the impact may be lessened by the terminal nature of lymphocyte division, since the vast majority of activated cells apoptose within weeks of activation.</p><p>We additionally provide initial measurements of numbers of ribosomes and their protein synthesis activity, key values in accounting for the macroeconomics of T cell protein synthesis. Of particular importance is the ratio of cellular proteins to ribosomes; in conjunction with the elongation rate, this value dictates the minimal time (i.e., no protein degradation or secretion) for duplicating the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shore and Albert, 2022</xref>). Using the mammalian cell âspeed limitâ of 6 residues per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan and Penman, 1970</xref>) mouse T cells do not appear to possess sufficient ribosomes to support a 6- to 8-hr division time. Even if ribosomes in in vivo activated T cells are translating at 7.8 residues per second, the time required to synthesize the proteome is 2.3Ã greater than the observed replication time (15.5 vs. 6.8 hr).</p><p>The discrepancy is further exacerbated when accounting for protein secretion and degradation of DRiPs (30% of nascent proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Princiotta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wheatley et al., 1980</xref>) and retirees <italic>t</italic><sub>Â½</sub> of ~32 hr over the entire proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cambridge et al., 2011</xref>) and the presence of stalled and resting ribosomes. Together, this likely doubles the time required to synthesize the proteome.</p><p>Something is obviously wrong. T cell doubling times of 6.8 hr are very likely to be accurate, as they are simple to measure and are routinely reported in mouse T cell studies. Quantitating proteins, however, is more challenging than it might seem. Where are the potential gremlins?</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Quantitating cellular protein</italic>. We initially used the various dye-binding assays for quantitating cellular protein content. While these assays vary notoriously for quantitating different proteins, they provide similar values for the cellular proteome. Moreover, they were in good agreement with a completely independent method based on Trp fluorescence, which we consider the gold standard for protein quantitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">WiÅniewski and Gaugaz, 2015</xref>). We use Wisniewski and Gaugazâs value for Trp abundance in the proteome (0.69%) and note that this value is nearly identical to values obtained using the abundance of Trp toted up from proteomic analysis of 11 different human tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geiger et al., 2012</xref>) as well as a transgenic T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>). One possible source of error is the free metabolic pool of tryptophan, but this is likely to be less than 5% of protein tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kane et al., 1999</xref>). Another is the presence of serum proteins in cellular lysates. These are unlikely, however, to significantly contribute to our values since we fail to see fetal bovine serum-derived bovine serum albumin (BSA) in sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE) of total cell lysates.</p> </list-item><list-item><p><italic>Quantitating ribosomes</italic>. We originally quantitated ribosomes using antibodies specific for ribosomal proteins in immunoblots of total cell lysates with purified ribosomes as a standard. We eventually recognized, however, that this approach is limited by heterogeneity in ribosome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Genuth and Barna, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slavov et al., 2015</xref>) , as well as the presence of free pools of any given ribosomal subunit. It dawned on us that ribosomes are, in principle, simple to quantitate based on their RNA species, which account for &gt;80% of total cellular RNA. Though we initially quantitated rRNA species on agarose gels with purified ribosomes as a standard, we believe quantitation is more accurate using a Bioanalyzer with doped-in highly purified RNA as an absolute staining standard and a control for yield loss during purification of samples.</p> </list-item><list-item><p><italic>Ribosome elongation rates</italic>. The classical value of ~6 or fewer residues per second for radiolabeling studies of cultured cells seems likely to be accurate based on ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingolia, 2014</xref>). A recent ribosome profiling study extends these findings to mice, with in vivo elongation rates of 6.8, 5.2, and 4.4 amino acids per second for liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerashchenko et al., 2021</xref>). Our in vivo RTA data demonstrate that translation elongation in in vivo activated T cells is 30% faster than in cultured cells and thus is likely to be up to ~7.8 residues/s. We further note that it is likely that puromycylation detects only a subset of nascent chains. Indeed, in dozens of studies (including our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), immunoblots of puromycylated proteins detect discreet bands in SDSâPAGE gel rather than the expected smear if all chains are randomly puromycylated at all lengths. This may be due to non-random incorporation of PMY, non-random antibody detection of puromycylated nascent chains, or a combination of both. Though it seems improbable, it is possible that this bias influences RTA inferred elongation rates.</p> </list-item> </list><p>While one or more of these values may yet be inaccurate, we note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf et al., 2020</xref> mass spectrometric-based measurements of in vitro T cell protein synthetic capacity supports and even exacerbates the paradox. We must therefore consider the possibility that that lymphocytes are in such a hurry to divide that they resort to the extraordinary measure of acquiring proteins from resting lymphocytes or other cell types.</p><p>There are reports that neurons acquire ribosomes from Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Court et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Court et al., 2011</xref>) and that cancer cells acquire mitochondria from immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saha et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, through trogocytosis, lymphocytes acquire cell surface molecules from other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>). We are, however, proposing that lymphocytes acquire a significant fraction of their proteome, perhaps via something akin to emperipolesis or entosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang and Li, 2012</xref>), where cells actively enter homotypic cells and can even divide while residing inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In any event, our findings clearly indicate how much remains to be learned about basic lymphocyte cell biology and the importance of simple accounting in squaring our models of cell biology with reality.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

OT-I TCR transgenic mice were acquired from the NIAID Intramural Research Repository. All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions (including murine norovirus, mouse parvovirus, and mouse hepatitis virus) and maintained on standard rodent chow and water supplied ad libitum. All animal studies were approved by and performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under protocol LVD-5E. For acute infections, and to generate memory T cells, CFSE-labeled Ly5.2+ (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD45.1<sup>â</sup>) OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred into Ly5.1 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>â</sup>) mice. A subset of these mice was infected with VACV-SIINFEKL for indicated times to activate OT-I T cells, with some mice left uninfected where specified. For experiments done directly on memory OT-I T cells, assays were done 8â9 weeks after infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cells</title><p>HeLa cells were obtained originally from the ATCC, were authenticated by the ATCC STR profiling service, and were routinely confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative with the ATCC Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vivo RPM, in vivo RPM-RTA, and relative protein synthesis determination</title><p>For the standard and CHX-improved in vivo RPM assays, mice were intravenously injected with 100 Î¼l of a 10 mg/ml solution of PMY in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) that was warmed to 37Â°C, or PMY, as just described, along with 0.34 mg per mouse of CHX. After indicated times, mice were sacrificed, and organs were collected into complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) on ice (Gibco RPMI supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum). For the in vivo RTA, or the CHX-improved in vivo RTA, mice were intravenously injected with 100 Î¼g of HAR simultaneously with 1 mg of PMY, or 1 mg of PMY and 0.34 mg of CHX for 5 min (for the maximum signal) or first intravenously injected with 100 Î¼g of HAR for the times indicated before being intravenously injected with 1 mg of PMY, or PMY and 0.34 mg of CHX for 5 min. To determine relative levels of active protein synthesis, two sets of mice were required. In the first set, mice were intravenously injected with 100 Î¼g of HAR for 15 min, and then intravenously injected with 1 mg of PMY and 0.34 mg of CHX for 5 min before spleens were harvested. In the second set, mice were intravenously injected simultaneously with 0.34 mg of CHX and 1 mg of PMY for 5 min before spleens were harvested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-cell preparation from organs</title><p>Isolated organs were crushed between two frosted microscope slides, and the resultant single cell suspension was filtered through a 70-Âµm mesh screen. The filtered single cell suspension was then centrifuged, resuspended in ACK lysing buffer (Lonza) to lyse red blood cells, centrifuged again, and resuspended in complete RPMI for counting on a Nexcelom Cellometer Vision using Trypan Blue (Lonza BioWhittaker) for live/dead cell discrimination and cell diameter measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>CFSE labeling</title><p>Spleens and inguinal, mediastinal, cervical, mesenteric, and popliteal lymph nodes from OT-I TCR transgenic or C57BL/6 mice were processed into a single-cell suspension, red blood cells were lysed in ACK lysing buffer, and the resultant cells filtered through a 70-ÂµM mesh screen. After two washes in PBS, cells were counted on a Nexcelom Cellometer Vision using Trypan Blue for dead cell exclusion, and cells were labeled in 5 ÂµM CFSE (Invitrogen) in PBS at 1 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells per ml for 18 min in a 37Â° water bath with mixing every 6 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS, recounted, and adoptively transferred into the indicated mice or cultured as specified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Human lymphocyte purification and culture conditions for human and mouse lymphocytes</title><p>Elutriated human lymphocytes were from healthy anonymous donors at the NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine. After collection, elutriated lymphocytes were purified on a discontinuous 35â70% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient and washed once with ACK lysing buffer (Life Technologies) to remove contaminating red blood cells. For time-course experiments, purified lymphocytes were resuspended in PBS and labeled with CFSE where indicated (as described above) to enable tracking of cell division over time. Lymphocytes were plated at 1â2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in RPMI: RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS), 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, Corning Cellgro), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), and 55 ÂµM beta-mercaptoethanol(Gibco). Depending on the experiment, media was also supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (BRB NCI Frederick, 25 U/ml), PMA (Sigma, 1 ng/ml), and ionomycin (Sigma, 100 ng/ml). For OT-I T cell cultures, PMA was added at 100 ng/ml instead, and, where noted, SIINFEKL was added as well (100 nM) for optimal activation. Lymphocytes were cultured in 6% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37Â°C and allowed to sit overnight prior to any experiments unless noted (noted as âfreshly isolatedâ). For time-course experiments, lymphocytes were cultured for up to 5 days and resuspended in fresh media every 2 days. Cell counts, diameters, and viabilities (through Trypan blue exclusion) were made on a Nexcelom Cellometer Vision cell counter. Cell volumes were calculated assuming spherical geometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vitro RPM and RPM staining</title><p>For each sample, cells were resuspended at 2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells per ml and 100 Î¼l transferred into 96-well round-bottom plates.

After a 15-min incubation at 37Â°C, 50 Î¼l of 3Ã PMY (Calbiochem) media was added (150 Î¼g/ml, for a final concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml) and the cells were incubated for an additional 5 min before shifting to ice and adding 100 Î¼l of cold PBS. Cells were then stained with ethidium monoazide (10 Î¼g/ml in PBS, Molecular Probes) for live/dead cell discrimination. After thorough washing, and a 10-min incubation with heat-inactivated sera, or 2.4G2 to block Fc receptors, cell surface antigens were labeled for 30 min at 4Â°C with the following antibodies: For human lymphocyte stains, antibodies against: CD3Îµ PerCP-eFluor 710 (clone OKT3, eBioscience), CD19 PE (clone HIB19, eBioscience), CD45 APC-eFluor 780 (clone 2D1, eBioscience), CD4 PE-CF594 (clone RPA-T4, BD) or CD4 PE-Cy7 (clone RPA-T4, eBioscience), and CD8Î± BV421 (clone RPA-T8, BD).

Next, cells were simultaneously fixed and permeabilized in fix/perm buffer (1% paraformaldehyde, 0.0075% digitonin in PBS) for 20 min at 4Â°C. Intracellular PMY was labeled with an anti-PMY antibody (clone 2A4) directly conjugated with Alex Fluor 647 (conjugated using the Life Technologies Protein Labeling Kit per the manufacturerâs instructions) for 1 hr. Cells were thoroughly washed and resuspended in buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% BSA, flow cytometry performed on a BD LSRII or BD LSRFortessa X-20, and resulting data analyzed with FlowJo software. To gate on OT-I T CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, setup was: singlets by FSCa and FSCw, lymphocytes by SSCa and FSCa, EMA<sup>â</sup> (live/dead cell marker), CD3<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>â</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>â</sup>, CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD45.1<sup>â</sup>, and Vb5<sup>+</sup>, and activation markers as indicated.

Cells were kept at 37Â°C throughout the experiment and labeling. Cells were resuspended in complete RPMI at 1 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml and 1 ml was aliquoted into fresh Eppendorf tubes. Next, cells were spun at 300 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 4 min and pre-treated with protein synthesis inhibitors (concentrations as in RPM Staining above) in complete RPMI for 15 min.

After a 5-min labeling period, protein synthesis was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 200 Î¼g/ml of CHX. For all labeling experiments, after washing cells thoroughly in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in 100 or 200 Î¼l of 2% SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.5, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 15 U/ml DnaseI (Roche), cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) in water) and boiled for 30â60 min to ensure complete lysis. Protein amounts were quantified by the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) or by tryptophan fluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">WiÅniewski and Gaugaz, 2015</xref>). To quantify the amount of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu incorporated into proteins, equal amounts of lysate (six replicates per condition) were spotted onto a 96-well DEAE filter mat (PerkinElmer) and the mat was dried at 60Â°C. The mat was then soaked in a 10% trichloroacetic (Calbiochem) solution for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice in 70% ethanol, dried at 60Â°C, placed in a MicroBeta sample bag (PerkinElmer) with ~6 ml of BetaPlate Scint (PerkinElmer), and heat sealed. Radioactivity was quantified in a 1450 MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter. To determine the total amount of amino acid incorporated into proteins, dilutions of the [<sup>3</sup>H]-Leu stock were counted and used as standards.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro RPM-RTA</title><p>RPM-RTA: For each time point, 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> lymphocytes were transferred to a fresh conical tube and resuspended in 250 Î¼l of the appropriate media.

Briefly, 5 ml of the 15% sucrose solution was carefully layered onto 5 ml of the 45% sucrose solution, and the tube was placed horizontally at 4Â°C, typically overnight or for at least 2.5 hr before the experiment. For each gradient, cells were harvested and washed in cold PBS as described above. For cell lysis, cells were first swelled by adding 950 Î¼l of a cold hypotonic buffer (20 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 40 U/ml RNaseOUT, 0.1 U/Î¼l SuperaseIn, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche)). After 10 min of cell swelling, NP-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, the resultant lysate mixed, incubated on ice for 3 min, and spun at 7000 rpm for 2 min to remove nuclei. Post-nuclear lysates were then brought to 100 mM KCl (or 300 or 500 mM NaCl where indicated), layered onto 15â45% continuous sucrose gradients, and spun for 100 min at 38,000 rpm at 4Â°C in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Ultracentrifuge). Gradients were syringe-fractionated mechanically from the bottom up and monitored for absorbance at 254 nm (Teledyne Isco) to obtain polysome profiles. When indicated, area under the curve measurements were calculated by a trapezoidal method from the resulting curves. When required by the experiment, we concentrated monosome and polysome fractions for immunoblotting. To pellet the ribosomes, we spun the pooled monosome or polysome fractions for 1 hr or O/N at 39,000 rpm at 4Â°C in the SW41Ti rotor on a 34% sucrose cushion. The resultant ribosome pellet was resuspended in 2% SDS extraction buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantitating cellular proteins</title><p>We quantitated total protein in cell lysates based on Trp fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">WiÅniewski and Gaugaz, 2015</xref>).

RNA purification was conducted as described in the manufacturerâs TRIzol protocol, with 5 Âµg of glycogen used as carrier and the isopropanol precipitation step conducted overnight at â20Â°C. The final RNA pellet was dissolved in 50 Âµl of ultra-pure water and roughly quantified to determine appropriate range for the Agilent bioanalyzer chip. Samples, including fresh spike-in mRNA alone, were loaded and run on RNA Nano Bioanalyzer chips (Agilent RNA Nano 6000), with a 70Â°C heating step and run on a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer. Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert software was used to determine total RNA concentration of each sample and percent area under curve of each peak (mRNA spike-in at ~1000 bp, 18S rRNA at ~1800 bp, 28S rRNA at ~4000 bp). The yield of the RNA prep was calculated as follows:</p><p>(mRNA spike-in standard peak from an RNA-purified sample)/average of 2â3 standard peaks from 75 ng/Âµl standard wells) = (fraction of RNA that remains after the purification process). We next converted the 18S and 28S ng/Âµl values to ânumber molecules per cellâ using the number of cells that originally went into the RNA purification, the RNA yield described above, and the following values: mouse 18S = 6.40E + 05 g/mol; mouse 28S = 1.60E + 06 g/mol; human 18S = 6.40E + 05 g/mol; human 28S = 1.70E + 06 g/mol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>To fractionate cells into nuclear and non-nuclear lysates, cells were either dissolved directly in 2% SDS extraction buffer at 95Â°C (âallâ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) or subjected to a hypotonic lysis procedure.

Orthogonal, complementary assays for translation (RPM/RTA, metabolic labeling) are combined with polyribosome profiling and quantitative, biochemical determinations of protein and ribosome content to explore this question, primarily in the OT-I T lymphocyte model system. The authors conclude that the ratio of protein levels to ribosomes/protein synthesis capacity is insufficient to support activation-coupled T cell division and cell size expansion.

In the accounting narrative that the authors highlight, a thorough accounting of the cellular process inventory that could support the cell state change should be further explored before committing to the proposal, provocative as it is, that protein acquisition provides a principal mechanism for supporting lymphocyte activation cell state change.</p><p>Appraisal and Discussion:</p><p>1. Relating to the points raised above, two recent review articles explore this topic area and highlight important areas of study in RNA biology and translational control that likely contribute to the paradox noted by the authors: Choi et al. 2022,</p><p>2. The authors cite the Wolf et al. study from the Geiger lab (doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0714-5, ref. 41) though largely to compare determined values for ribosome number. Many other elements of the Wolf paper seem quite relevant, for example, the very high abundance of glycolytic enzymes (and whose mRNAs are quite abundant as well), where (and as others have reported) there is a dramatic activation of glycolytic flux upon T cell activation that is largely independent of transcription and translation, the evidence for &quot;pre-existing, idle ribosomes&quot;, the changes in mRNA copy number and protein synthesis rate Spearman correlation that accompanies activation, and that the efficiencies of mRNA translation are heterogeneous. These data suggest that more accounting needs to be done to establish that there is a paradox.</p><p>As one example, what if glycolytic enzyme protein levels in the resting cell are in substantial excess of what's need to support glycolysis (likely true) and so translational upregulation can be directed to other mRNAs whose products are necessary for function of the activated cell? In this scenario the dilution of glycolytic enzyme concentration that would come with cell division would not necessarily have a functional consequence. And the idle ribosomes could be recruited to key subsets of mRNAs (transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally upregulated) and with that a substantial remodeling of the proteome (authors ref. 44). The study of Ricciardi et al. 2018 (The translational machinery of human CD4+ T cells is poised for activation and controls the switch from quiescence to metabolic remodeling [doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.08.009]) is consistent with this possibility. That study, and the short reviews noted above, are useful in highlighting the contributions of selective translational remodeling and the signaling pathways that contribute to the cell state change of T cell activation. From this perspective an alternative view can be posited, where the quiescent state is biologically poised to support activation, where subsets of proteins and mRNAs are present in far higher levels than that necessary to support basal function of the quiescent lymphocyte. In such a model, the early stages of lymphocyte activation and cell division are supported by this surplus inventory, with transcriptional activation, including ribosomal genes, primarily contributing at later stages of the activation process. An obvious analogy is the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo where maternal inheritance supports early-stage development and zygotic transcriptional contributions subsequently assuming primary control (e.g. DOI 10.1002/1873-3468.13183, DOI: 10.1126/science.abq4835). To pursue that biological logic would require quantifying individual mRNAs and their ribosome loading states, mRNA-specific elongation rates, existing individual protein levels, turnover rates of both mRNAs and proteins, ribosome levels, mean ribosome occupancy state, and how each of these parameters are altered in response to activation. Such accounting could go far to unveil the paradox. This is a considerable undertaking, though, and outside the scope of the current paper.</p><p>Regarding the revised manuscript:</p><p>I am largely satisfied with the authors responses to the review and have but a few remaining thoughts, some mirrored in the comments from the other reviewers and some that came to mind upon reading the revision.</p><p>1. In the Introduction, it would be (have been) helpful if in paragraph two, it was stated that the current study was designed to test that assumption made in prior reports that the fold-increase in protein synthesis in response to mitogen activation was sufficient to endow the daughter cells with &quot;the same protein content as their progenitor&quot;.</p><p>2. The primary conclusion, that &quot;...protein synthesis activity or capacity of in vivo activated T cells does not support their doubling times&quot; remains, to my eye, insufficiently supported by the data, though I agree it is a rational interpretation. My concern is that the devil is deeper in the details and without knowing the mRNA transcriptome composition pre- and post-activation, mean CDS length, 5' UTR structural features, perhaps codon optimality, etc., etc., the broader conclusion could be premature. As a first check, it would be useful to determine poly(A) mRNA and ribosome concentrations/cell, pre- and post-activation, and subsequently to compare mRNA transcriptome compositions in greater detail. Do mRNA:ribosome levels and ratios diverge as a consequence of activation? Poly(A) mRNA compositions? Does protein half-life change pre- and post-activation? mRNA half-life? My view is that additional molecular accounting is likely necessary to be confident in the primary conclusion.</p><p>3. I did not provide a clear description of the alternative interpretation I was imagining, which is that in the resting, unstimulated state, mRNA:ribosome and/or protein levels may be much higher than that necessary for lymphocyte viability. As in early development, this could be a mechanism to then provide sufficient protein synthesis capacity and/or proteins to daughter cells following activation of cell division and cell growth. In other words, it's a dynamic range question; the daughter cells exploit &quot;unused&quot; protein synthesis capacity to sustain their growth and division. Quantification and analysis of the additional variables noted in point (2) could reconcile the different interpretations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89015.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This paper takes a novel look at the protein economy of primary human and mouse T-cells - in both resting and activated state.

I have no issue with the data as presented, as I'm sure all measurements have been expertly done. I see no need for additional experimental work, although it would be helpful if the authors could comment on the possibility of measuring the rate of synthesis of a defined protein, say a histone, in cells prior to and after activation. The conclusion the authors leave us with is the idea that the rates of protein synthesis recorded here are incompatible with observed rates of T cell division in vivo. Indeed, in the final paragraph of the discussion, the authors note the mismatch between what they consider a requirement for cell division, and the observed rates of protein synthesis. They then invoke unconventional mechanisms to make up for the shortfall, without -in this reviewer's opinion- discussing in adequate detail the technical limitations of the methodology used.</p></disp-quote><p>Points #1-3 in the Discussion relate to potential pitfalls of our analyses; in point #3 we now add further limitations of RTA based on non-random detection of nascent chains due either to bias in either puromycylation or antibody detection of puromycylated nascent chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A key question is the broad interest, novelty, and extension of current knowledge, in comparison with ArgÃ¼ello's (reference 27) 'SunRise' method. It would be helpful for the authors to stake out a clear position as to the similarities and differences with reference 27: what have we learned that is new? The authors could cite reference 27 in the introduction of their manuscript, given the similarity in approach. That said, the findings reported here will generate further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We did cite this reference (27) in the section âFlow RPM measures ribosome elongation rate in live cellsâ giving credit where credit is due. We independently devised the method in 2014, and uniquely, to our knowledge, have applied it in vivo.

As an example, it would be helpful to explain to the non-expert why the distinction between monosomes, polysomes, and stalled versions of the same is important, and then explain the rationale of the actual experiment: how can these distinctions be made with confidence, and what are confounding variables?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this is addressed in the section âResting human lymphocytes have a dominant monosome populationâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The initial use of human cells, later abandoned in favor of the OT-1 in vitro and in vivo models, requires contextualization. If the goal is to address the relationship between rates of translation and cell division of antigen-activated T cells in vivo, then a lot of the work on the human model and the in vitro experiments becomes more of a distraction, unless properly contextualized. Is there any reason to assume that antigen-specific activation in vivo will impact translation differently than the use of the PMA/ionomycin/IL2 cocktail? The way the work is presented leaves me with the impression that everything that was done is included, regardless of whether it goes to the core of the question(s) of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>Donor PBMCs are clearly the more relevant model for understanding human T cell biology, which is why started our studies with this model. Had the manuscript strictly described mouse studies it is likely that we would be criticized for not studying human cells: Catch 22! However, as we state in the manuscript, the human cell model has a variety of technical downsides, including donor heterogeneity. PMA/ionomycin activation is also physiologically questionable, and while we could deliver a defined TCR to redirect their specificity, this is typically done after cells have been activated, since lentiviral delivery is poor in resting lymphocytes. A main point we try to make from this work is that cells derived from human blood donors show signs of ribosomal stalling by the time they are isolated and put into culture. This may limit the usefulness of studying them preactivation, although based on our mouse data, some level of stalled ribosomes may be a feature as well â to prime T cells to be ready for their massive expansion. The move to the OT-I system gave us complete control over the system, including in vivo delivery of translation inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if the authors made explicit some of the assumptions that underlie their quantitative comparisons. Likewise, the authors should discuss the limitations of their methods and provide alternative interpretations where possible, even if they consider them less/not plausible, with justification. As they themselves note, improvements in the RPM protocols raised the increase in translating ribosomes upon activation from 10-fold to 15-fold. Who's to say that is the best achievable result? What about the reliability/optimization of the other measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded discussion of potential pitfalls of the RPM techniques and others in the Discussion section. Regarding RPM per se, we use it as a readout of ribosome time decay, so even if further optimizations can be made, the decay rates we have made should still be accurate. In addition, for our cell accounting measurements in Figure 6, we do not use RPM data and rather calculate based on the assumption that every ribosome is used for protein synthesis at a âmaximalâ rate of mRNA transit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The composition of the set of proteins produced upon activation will differ from cell to cell (CD4, CD8, B, resting vs. dividing). Even if analyses are performed on fixed cells, the ability of the monoclonal anti-puromycin antibody to penetrate the matrix of the various fixed cell types may not be equal for all of them, depending on protein composition, susceptibility to fixation etc. Is it possible for puromycin to occupy the ribosome's A site and terminate translation without forming a covalent bond with the nascent chain? This could affect the staining with anti-puromycin antibodies and also underestimate the number of nascent chains.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the method (like every other one) is imperfect. Harringtonine run-off experiments show that RPM staining only detects nascent chains. Note that reference 47 reports that 75% of translation in activated T cells is devoted to synthesizing ~250 housekeeping proteins, which are likely to be highly similar between lymphocyte subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe that the concept of FACS-based quantitation also requires an explanation for the nonexpert. For the FACS plots shown, the differences between the highest and lowest RPM scores for cells that divided and that have a similar CFSE score is at least 10-fold. Does that mean that divided cells can differ by that margin in terms of the number of nascent chains present? If I make the assumption that cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin/IL2 respond more or less synchronously, why would there be a 10-fold difference in absolute fluorescence intensity (anti=puromycin) for randomly chosen cells with similar CFSE values? While the use of MFI values is standard practice in cytofluorimetry, the authors should devote some comments to such variation at the population level.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the referee is referring to Sup Fig. 1B. In this experiment the T cells are polyclonal and represent the full range of naÃ¯ve to potentially exhausted differentiation states. Looking at our initial in vivo RPM study (reference 22) and comparing Figure 2 (OTIâs) to Figure 3 (endogenous CD4s or CD8s), reveals more spread in the RPM values polyclonal vs. monoclonal T cells - now clarified in the third paragraph of âProtein synthesis in mouse lymphocytes and innate immune cells in vivoâ. Flow cytometry is by far the most accurate method for measuring fluorescence in individual cells. It is likely to be an accurate measure of the variation of nascent chains in cells in the same division cohort but likely represents the diversity of T cell activation profiles in blood of healthy donors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is assumed that for cells to complete division, they must have produced a full and complete copy of their proteome and only then divide. What if cells can proceed to divide even when expressing a subset of the proteome of departure (=the threshold set required for initiation of division), only to complete synthesis of the 'missing ' portion once cell division is complete? Would this obviate the requirement for an unusual mechanism of protein acquisition (trogocytosis; other)?</p></disp-quote><p>There must be a steady state level of translation and proteome replenishment, though. If a cell can divide when it affords daughter cells with 90% of its G0 proteome (as an example), that daughter cell would either (1) be 10% smaller, or (2) require extra translation to make up for the missing proteome during its own division cycle. Though T cells do typically shrink slightly after an initial activation, cell size stabilizes over time. Requiring each daughter cell to make more and more missing proteome could be plausible, considering that initial bursts of division do take longer over time, but still, even in vitro activated T cells divide rapidly for weeks without large decreases in their division rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Translation is estimated to proceed at a rate of ~6 amino acids per second, but surely there is variability in this number attributable to inaccuracies of the methods used, in addition to biological variability. Were these so-called standard values determined for a range of different tissues? It stands to reason that there might be variation depending on the availability of initiation/elongation factors, NTPs, aminoacyl tRNAs etc. What is the margin of error in calculating chain elongation rates based on the results shown here?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to all relevant studies we know of, including new in vivo estimates of elongation rates (reference 40).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A &quot;limitations of study&quot; section would be a helpful way to detail potential contributing mechanisms that were not explored in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the methodological limitations in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major:</p><p>1.

It's not clear why a degree of monosome translation is necessarily surprising (pg. 7).</p></disp-quote><p>Itâs surprising since for many decades it was believed that translation by monosomes is a tiny fraction of translation. But separately, with this particular mode of activation, activated T cells displayed a preponderance of monosomes during their burst of division. When the activation method was improved, polysomes dominated. But monosome translation clearly supported T cell division during activation without cognate peptide, which was interesting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. One concern is the dose of puromycin used. My understanding is that puromycin acts as a chain termination inhibitor - but is being used here predominantly as a label for nascent polypeptide chains. My concern, therefore, is the dose being used - here at 50ug/ml - which seems high and I would be concerned that at this dose it would act as a translational inhibitor rather than just labelling nascent chains, and is therefore resulting in a lower signal/background ration than expected. In human cell lines 0.1ug/ml is optimal and doses published (in cell lines) range between 1 and 10ug/ml so it will be interesting to understand why this high dose was used.</p><p>Do they have a dose-response curve - is this high dose necessary because these are primary Tcells. Can the authors show that 50 Âµg/mL of puromycin is optimal for studying protein translation in primary human T cells? A titration curve will help answer this question and could be included in Suppl Figure 1. This experiment is critical as the authors use a higher dose than previous studies (commonly between 1 and 10 Âµg/mL).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is referencing puromycin concentrations typically used in the selection of cells â for the RPM assay, puromycin is used at saturating doses to label the maximal number of nascent chains stalled by CHX or EME pretreatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. None of the figures show statistical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistics on relevant comparisons are now indicated on figures and in legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mention: &quot;We performed RPM on cells labelled with CFSE to track cell division by dye dilution (Supplemental Figure 1B). On day 2, activated cells exhibited multiple populations, with nearly all divided cells showing a high RPM signal.&quot;. However, on day 2 it is hard to see any dividing cells in the dot plot included in the supplemental figure. Dividing cells only appear on day 5? Their statements make the subsequent paragraphs also difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text to clarify this data â there is likely activation-induced cell death occurring which is why there are relatively few CFSE-low cells at this timepoint, and they do exhibit a fairly wide range of RPM staining. The main point is that by day 5, nearly all divided cells exhibit high RPM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;Many divided cells exhibited near baseline RPM signals, however, consistent with their return to the resting state. Interestingly, although non-activated cells did not divide, ~50% demonstrated increased RPM staining.&quot;.

The authors say &quot;Thus, we cannot attribute the persistence of flow RPM staining in translation initiation inhibitor-treated cells to incomplete inhibition of protein synthesis.' - but it's unclear what this refers to as in the previous paragraph they also say: 'Initiation inhibitors, however, clearly discriminated between day 1 resting and activated cells. RPM signal was diminished by up to 8090% on day 5 post-activation.' - this is all somewhat confusing. It would be helpful to have this clarified and in the text to make more liberal use of referring to specific figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1B shows that RPM is maintained at fairly high levels during treatment with EME or CHX (in contrast to the initiation inhibitors HAR/PA). To rule out that the drugs were simply not active, tritiated leucine labeling was conducted to confirm that incorporation of the radiolabeled amino acid dropped to near-baseline (Figure 1C). Therefore, we can conclude that the drugs are indeed working as intended, but EME/CHX does not decrease RPM signal to the same extent that they prevent leucine incorporation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Page 5 Fig 3A - I don't understand the difference between freshly isolated OT-1 cells - which don't stall and day 1 OT-1 cells which do. Why are freshly isolated cells not behaving like the naÃ¯ve cells- isn't this what they would predict? Also - I accept that there is a move from monosome to polysome population between day 1 and 2 - the effect isn't huge - it would be helpful/interesting to know what has happened by day 5 - is the effect much more significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Freshly isolated cells are harvested from animals and immediately queried, whereas day 1 cells are cultured for 24h in the absence of any activation. Presumably, the ex vivo culture without any activation causes the mouse T cell ribosomes to stall, just as we observed in cells obtained from human donors that took hours to collect and bring to the bench. The appearance of polysomes is really related to how the activation of the cells is doneâ¦ refer to Figure 5B to see how significant the polysome buildup can be!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Fig S3C - I don't understand how they reach the conclusion from this figure that: '~15-fold increase in translating ribosomes in activated OT-I T cells in vivo (Supplemental Figure 3C) as compared to the 10-fold increase we previously reported using the original protocol. It would very much help the reader if these calculations could be better explained.</p></disp-quote><p>These are simply quantifications of the RPM staining done in Supplemental Figure 3C compared to experiments done in the absence of the CHX-modified method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Page 7 - They conclude that the Tan paper has superior lymphocyte activation - but presumably this depends on the signal as to whether there is more activation and how this affects the shift from monosome to polysome -ie maybe a stronger activation signal affects the distribution more - perhaps their method is the more physiological? Is their conclusion fair - that 'These findings indicate that monosomes make a major contribution to translation in resting T cells but are likely to make a minor contribution in fully activated cells.'</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe that their published method would be more physiological with the use of the natural OT-I peptide. We conclude that although monosome translation is present (as others have published), there are relatively few monosomes in fully activated T cells. Therefore, the monosome contribution to overall translation in activated T cells appears to be minor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Contrary to observations in vitro, ribosomes are not stalled in naÃ¯ve mouse T cells in vivo, as we show via RTA analysis of non-activated T cells. - yes - this seems somewhat surprising - what is the explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We presume this is due to the stress/non-native environment that ex vivo cultured cells are subjected to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Whilst I understand the point that the authors are trying to make in Figure 1D about resting T cells having high background RPM staining due to stalled ribosomes, it is intriguing that there is almost no difference (no statistical significance provided) after 2 or 5 days of activation. Isn't this finding contrary to the one provided in Figure 1A and Suppl Figure 1B?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1A is showing the difference between no activation and activation conditions. Figure 1D is predominantly meant to show that the increase in RPM from activated cells at day 1 and day 5 are not as different as one might predict. The reason, as we describe in further experiments, is likely that cells exhibiting ribosomal stalling can incorporate puromycin, damping the âfold changeâ we calculate (unlike what we observe in metabolic labeling experiments in the same figure panel). Statistics have now been displayed on the graphs in Figure 1D for further clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. &quot;Including EME with HAR prevented decay of the RPM signal, as predicted, since EME blocks elongation while enabling (even enhancing) puromycylation21,26.&quot; I find this very confusing. I understand that emetine blocks protein elongation whilst enabling puromycilation, but why does it block the effect of the protein initiation inhibitor Harringtonin? Do they compete with each other?</p></disp-quote><p>When ribosomes are frozen with emetine, they cannot transit mRNA and âfall offâ. Therefore, the inclusion of EME in these experiments is a control to ensure that we are looking at true transit and runoff of ribosomes with harringtonine treatment (explanation in the second paragraph of âFlow RPM measures ribosome elongation rates in live cellsâ section)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Can the authors explain why the RPM signal of activated OT-I cells (PMA/Iono) increases 20fold compared to resting cells, but there is only a ~2-fold increase in signal in human cells? The authors previously mentioned: &quot;We noted that the RPM signal in activated cells was only 2- to 5fold higher than in non-activated cells. This increase is modest compared to the ~15-fold activation-induced increase in protein synthesis in original studies 10,11. To examine this discrepancy, we incubated cells for 15 min with harringtonin (HAR) or pactamycin (PA) to block translation initiation or emetine (EME) or cycloheximide (CHX) to block elongation.&quot; Would the authors have followed the same path if they had started the paper with OT-I cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Human cells are not as well activated as OT-I in our study.

It would be interesting to compare RPM in T cells activated with a more physiological stimulus, such as beads anti-CD3 anti-CD28 vs PMA/Iono.

But they are linked as volume scales by radius cubed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. The paper's main conclusion (i.e., that the ratio of proteins to ribosomes in T cells activated in-vivo does not support their doubling time) is exciting. They conclude this after measuring cell volume, protein abundance, and ribosomes per cell. As no changes in cell volume and protein abundance between T cells activated in vitro vs in vivo were observed (Figures 6B and 6C), the difference is exclusively attributable to a reduced number of ribosomes per cell in T cells activated in vivo (Figure 6F). Critically, the measurement of ribosomes per cell in T cells activated in vivo (Figure 6F, &quot;ex vivo day 2&quot;) includes only two data points. It is hard to understand how the authors calculated this figure's means and standard deviations as it is not described in the figure legend. From the dispersion observed for &quot;day 1&quot; and &quot;day 2&quot; in vitroactivated T cells, it seems that the variability of the assay to measure ribosome content could explain part of the phenotype. Additionally, there are several missing data points in Figure 6H.As this figure is just a transformation of Figures 6D and 6G, it isn't easy to understand why. Can I suggest that they include more data points for Figures 6F, G, and H in the ex vivo day 2' category as the two data points shown with little variability is out of keeping with the rest of the data, and may be skewing their data?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6F does not have the same number of data points as other panels because it required measurement of both protein content and ribosome number.
