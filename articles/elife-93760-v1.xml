Therefore, developing an antifungal vaccine is a priority. Here, we could for the first time successfully attenuate the virulence of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> by treating it with a fungistatic dosage of EDTA and demonstrate it to be a potential live whole cell vaccine by using murine models of systemic candidiasis. EDTA inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. RNA-seq analyses of EDTA-treated cells (CAET) revealed that genes mostly involved in metal homeostasis and ribosome biogenesis were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Consequently, a bulky cell wall with elevated levels of mannan and β-glucan, and reduced levels of total monosomes and polysomes were observed. CAET was eliminated faster than the untreated strain (<italic>Ca</italic>) as found by differential fungal burden in the vital organs of the mice. Higher monocytes, granulocytes, and platelet counts were detected in <italic>Ca- vs</italic> CAET-challenged mice. While hyper-inflammation and immunosuppression caused the killing of <italic>Ca</italic>-challenged mice, a critical balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines-mediated immune responses are the likely reasons for the protective immunity in CAET-infected mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Candida</kwd><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd><kwd>candidiasis</kwd><kwd>attenuation</kwd><kwd>Whole-cell vaccine</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd><kwd>EDTA</kwd><kwd>metal chelating agents</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR32817/MED/29/1495/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acharya</surname><given-names>Narottam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A detailed characterizations of EDTA-treated <italic>Candida albicans</italic> cells both in vitro and pre-clinical models led to discovery of a potential live whole-cell vaccine against fungal infections.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Candida</italic> species colonizes several anatomical niches of a host, either as a commensal or an opportunistic fungal pathogen. Infections by <italic>Candida</italic> sp. range from superficial oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) to serious invasive candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peroumal et al., 2022</xref>). In immunosuppressed conditions, these fungi can evade subsided mucosal immunity and disseminate into the bloodstream, resulting in systemic candidiasis with a mortality rate of &gt;40%. <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the frequently isolated species responsible for the majority of these infections, thus, imposing a huge threat to human health worldwide. Currently, polyenes, echinocandins, and azoles are the three major classes of antifungals available to combat fungal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). These drugs are characterized by a narrow spectrum of activity to target limited fungal species and often exhibit cytotoxicity to cause side effects. Over 1.5 million yearly global burdens of lethal infections suggest that the treatment of fungal diseases by using available antifungal drugs seems to be partially helping, and additionally, the emergence of drug-resistant isolates clearly emphasize the urgent need of better diagnostics, safe and broad-spectrum novel antifungal drugs, and effective immunotherapeutics and prophylactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rudkin et al., 2018</xref>). Since no approved vaccine is available for human use, designing and developing vaccines against fungal pathogens is a priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>). NDV-3A and PEV7 are two recombinant vaccines that seem to be protecting recurrent VVC during initial human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Bernardis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edwards et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, various studies on host-fungal interactions have helped to identify multiple experimental vaccine candidates and those were shown to be safe and effective in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>). Most of these are suggested to generate neutralizing antibodies and are expected to be effective against <italic>Candida</italic> infections. The interaction between the host immunity and fungal pathogens is very complex and varies depending upon the nature and site of infections, and there are at least three layers of immune responses operating simultaneously against the invaders: innate, adaptive, and trained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romani, 2004</xref>). Also, as <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a multimorphic fungus, designing and developing a whole-cell vaccine approach seems to be arguably ideal.</p><p>Whole-cell vaccines can be either live or killed, and both kinds of vaccines are effectively in use against viral and bacterial infections. Heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains were found to be partially protecting against experimental vaginal candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cárdenas-Freytag et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Some of the genetically engineered <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains (tet-NRG1, PCA-2, CM1613, etc.) were reported to be attenuated and protective against disseminated candidiasis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saville et al., 2009</xref>). However, clinical trials for these strains are yet to be commenced. Since <italic>C. albicans</italic> co-evolves with the host and lives mostly as a beneficial gut pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peroumal et al., 2022</xref>), the host must be employing certain mechanisms to block its transition to a pathogenic trait which can be explored to develop attenuated strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> naturally rather than using a recombinant DNA technology approach. ‘Nutritional immunity’ is one such frontline defense mechanism that limits fungal growth and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hood and Skaar, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Metals play a pivotal role in host-pathogen interaction. Metals like iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium, copper, etc. being a cofactor of various metabolic and non-metabolic enzymes are essential for both host and pathogens. Therefore, excessive or limited availability of metals is deleterious to cells. Several studies suggest that the virulence and pathogenesis of fungi require a threshold level of these metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crawford and Wilson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerwien et al., 2018</xref>). To starve pathogens of essential metals, the host organism employs nutritional immunity strategies to reduce the availability of metals, thereby the virulence and disease progression of a pathogen is suppressed drastically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Citiulo et al., 2012</xref>). Our recent report found that a unknown soluble factor released from <italic>E. coli</italic> during co-culturing inhibited the growth, biofilm formation, and morphological transition from yeast to hyphae of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2023</xref>). In an animal model, the culture supernatant of <italic>E. coli</italic> attenuated the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> significantly. Chemical complementation analyses revealed that the exogenous addition of divalent metals rescued the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> which was inhibited by <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2023</xref>). Based on the concept of nutritional immunity and these reports, we argued that the metal chelators like EDTA, DTPA, etc. could mimic <italic>E. coli</italic> in vitro to regulate the virulence and pathogenesis of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Live whole-cell vaccine strains are generated mainly by genetic manipulation, here, we developed and characterized for the first time a chemical reagent-based attenuated strain of <italic>C. albicans</italic> which is safe and effectively protects systemic candidiasis in a pre-clinical model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metal chelators inhibit the growth and biofilm of <italic>C. albicans</italic></title><p>To begin with, the effect of a range of concentrations of EDTA (0.9–500 μM) on the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> was determined by measuring the optical density (OD<sub>600nm</sub>) of the culture in the presence of the reagent. Although we observed a significant growth retardation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> at 125 μM EDTA, upon addition of 250 μM EDTA, the growth was inhibited completely and remained saturated beyond this concentration. This result was also validated on solid YPD media where no colony formed at the highest dilution of the spot when the <italic>C. albicans</italic> was treated with 250 μM EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A—C</xref>). Henceforth, 250 μM EDTA was used for subsequent analyses. To determine the effect of EDTA on the survivability of fungal cells, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.5 or 10<sup>7</sup> cells per mL) in YPD media were grown for 12 hr without and with 250 μM of the metal chelator. At various time intervals, an equal number of cells were harvested and stained with SYTOX Green and propidium iodide (PI), and analyzed by flow cytometry and microscopy, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A—D</xref>). Both analyses suggested that 250 μM EDTA had minimal effect on the survivability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells during this period of growth as an equal percentage of dead cells were detected in untreated as well as treated conditions. Thus, the inhibitory effect of 250 μM EDTA on the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells is not due to the accumulation of dead cells but rather due to the slowing down of the cell division process. To further characterize the effect of EDTA, we checked various morphological forms of <italic>C. albicans</italic> upon exposure to 250 μM EDTA and 10% serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A—C</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> exists predominantly in the round form under normal physiological conditions; however, in the presence of inducers like serum, it transits into its reversible forms such as pseudohyphal and hyphal forms. Our results revealed that the 250 μM EDTA treatment did not alter the morphology of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells and it minimally affected the morphological switch induced by serum. Even the germ tube length induced by serum was barely affected by the addition of EDTA at this concentration.</p><p>Since EDTA inhibited the <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth, to identify the metals that could effectually rescue <italic>C. albicans</italic> survival, we supplemented various divalent metal salts to the EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Both the growth curve and CFU analyses revealed that the antagonizing effect of 250 μM EDTA on <italic>C. albicans</italic> was abolished by supplementing with metals like MgSO<sub>4</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Since the number of colonies remained the same for 8–24 hr of treatment with EDTA, it again suggested that EDTA most likely is a fungistatic inhibitor whose effect can be reversed by divalent metal complementation. To further strengthen the result, MgSO<sub>4</sub> was supplemented to the EDTA treated culture at 6 hr post-treatment rather than at 0 hr and growth was allowed. Interestingly, the suppressed growth of EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells was rescued significantly and the effect 250 μM EDTA was minimized even in this context (dark blue line). Interestingly, the exogenous addition of these metals (8 μM) alone to the YPD media had no or minimal effect on the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of metal chelators on the growth and biofilm of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells were cultured in YPD media at 30 °C for 24 hr without (cyan blue) and with the indicated concentration of EDTA (purple), MgSO<sub>4</sub> (Green), ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (Grey), FeCl<sub>2</sub> (Brown), and MnCl<sub>2</sub> (Black), EDTA+MgSO<sub>4</sub> (Lime green), EDTA+MgSO<sub>4</sub>@6 hr (dark blue), EDTA+ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (Maroon), EDTA+FeCl<sub>2</sub> (Orange), and EDTA+MnCl<sub>2</sub> (Pink).

Consistent with the growth curve result, EDTA inhibited the biofilm of <italic>C. albicans</italic> but was rescued by the addition of divalent metals. To substantiate the inhibitory role of EDTA, the effect of four more metal chelators Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>=,<italic>N</italic>=-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (TPEN), Aprotinin, and Ciclopirox ethanolamine (CE) on <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth was determined. DTPA is an aminopolycarboxylic acid consisting of a diethylenetriamine backbone with five carboxymethyl groups, and has a high affinity for di- and tri-metal cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Polvi et al., 2016</xref>). TPEN is an intracellular membrane-permeable ion chelator of transition metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2007</xref>). CE acts by binding to and chelating trivalent cations mainly iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niewerth et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike these chelators, BPTI or aprotinin is an antimicrobial peptide that lowers the cellular levels of magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleackley et al., 2014</xref>). Growth curve, CFU analysis, and biofilm formation assays revealed that all of these metal chelators inhibited the growth phenotypes of <italic>C. albicans</italic> with varied efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). While the effects of DTPA and aprotinin were very similar to EDTA; TPEN and CE inhibited both growth and biofilm of <italic>C. albicans</italic> drastically even at a lower concentration (100 μM) and accordingly, hardly any colony formed on solid YPD plates, and poor biofilm was observed. These results suggested that essential metals like magnesium, manganese, iron, and zinc are required for the growth and biofilm development of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> and sequestration of these by a range of metal chelators affects the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Global transcriptomic changes of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in response to EDTA treatment</title><p>Next, we investigated any changes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> gene expression due to EDTA treatment using high-throughput RNA sequencing. To achieve our goal, total RNA isolated from <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells grown for 6 hrs without or with 250 μM EDTA treatment was subjected to RNA sequencing using an Illumina NovaSeq platform, and a summary of reads obtained from each sample and their mapping to the reference genome is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Principal-component analysis (PCA) was conducted to provide a pictorial representation of the transcriptomic similarities among various triplicates and it revealed that the EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> samples clustered separately from the untreated ones, indicating a high level of correlation among samples with distinct transcriptome profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The total differentially expressed genes in untreated and EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (here onwards it will be named as <italic>Ca</italic> and CAET, respectively) were 5915, of these, 3093 and 2822 genes were up and downregulated, respectively. So, our RNA sequencing data indicated that EDTA has a profound effect on <italic>C. albicans</italic> gene expression resulting in alterations in the transcriptome. In order to find genes that were significantly dysregulated, two cut-offs: (1) false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off ≤0.05 and (2) log2 fold change (FC) cut-off ≥1 were applied; and a total of 799 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 411 were upregulated and 388 were downregulated in CAET. The volcano plot depicted two pools of genes that are significantly up- (red dots) and down – (blue dots) regulated in CAET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to create a heat map by taking top 25 up- and 25 down-regulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The heat map suggested a minimal variation in cluster linkage among similar samples and thus, the dysregulated DEGs upon treatment with EDTA relative to the untreated controls were consistently observed. We re-verified the RNA seq results by carrying out real-time and semi-quantitative PCR analyses of representative genes. Upregulation of <italic>ZRT1, CHT4</italic>, and <italic>PGA13</italic>, and downregulation of <italic>ACO2, PLB1</italic>, and <italic>THI13</italic> genes were observed in CAET in comparison to <italic>Ca</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomics analyses <italic>C</italic>.<italic>albicans</italic> cells upon EDTA treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A Volcano plot depicting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CAET cells.

analyses of all 411 upregulated genes revealed a total of 37 GO terms 28 biological processes (BP), 5 molecular functions (MF), and 4 cellular components (CC) that were enriched upon EDTA treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The highly significant upregulated biological processes GO terms were oxidation-reduction (GO:0055114), inter-species interaction (GO:0044419), pathogenesis (GO:0009405), and transition metal transporters and utilization (GO:0006812, GO:0048878, GO:0019725, GO:0098771, etc.). Similarly, GO terms of molecular function (GO:0098771, GO:0016616, etc.) genes encode for enzymes required for oxidation-reduction reactions, and GO terms of cellular component (GO:0071944, GO:0005886, etc.) mostly indicate upregulated genes belong to the cell wall and its periphery. To find out the gene networks that were affected upon EDTA treatment, STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) analysis was carried out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A</xref>). High confidence (0.7 confidence level) analysis revealed upregulation of network proteins mostly involved in metal ion transport and 18 strong nodes were detected among 15 out of 31 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Another gene network of 33 genes that caught our attention involved in pathogenesis and 9 DEGs of this network are directly or indirectly shown to be involved in fungal pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Altogether, our analysis suggested that the upregulation of cell wall and plasma membrane-associated genes whose products mostly play a role in metal transport and utilization and in pathogenesis (or survival in the host) occurred in response to EDTA. This could indicate a compensatory mechanism being utilized by <italic>C. albicans</italic> in an attempt to overcome essential metal scarcity due to EDTA treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Treatment with EDTA results mostly in downregulation of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis and One-carbon metabolism in <italic>C. albicans</italic></title><p>Similar to upregulated genes analyses, the top 100 downregulated genes those expression reduced to 3–100 folds in response to EDTA treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and 25 uncharacterized genes with unknown functions emerged.

processes, 12 molecular functions, and 23 cellular components) enriched upon EDTA treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The highly significant downregulated biological processes GO terms are cellular and metabolic processes mostly involved in protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, and amino acid biosynthesis (GO:0009987, GO:0008152, GO:0006518, GO:0006412 etc.). Similarly, GO terms of molecular function (GO:1901363, GO:0003735, GO:0003676, etc.) genes encode for heterocyclic compounds binding, ribosome structural components, and RNA binding proteins; and GO terms of cellular component (GO:0110165, GO:0005737, GO:0005739, etc.) mostly indicate downregulated genes belong to cytoplasmic and mitochondrial components. To find out the gene networks that were inhibited upon EDTA treatment, STRING analysis was carried out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3B</xref>). High confidence (0.7 confidence level) analysis revealed the downregulation of network proteins mostly involved in cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and one-carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C iii</xref>). The cytoplasmic gene network involved in protein translation showed strong nodes between 74 genes, out of which 30, 31, and 13 DEGs belonged to 40 S, 60 S, and other related functions of translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C i and ii</xref>). Similarly, a network of 56 genes involved in the mitochondrial ribosome and translation components was observed to be suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Interestingly, ribosome structure and stability require a high concentration of divalent metals. Another network of 34 down-regulated genes involved in one-carbon metabolism was detected (<italic>LYS2, GCV2, ARG5, ARO8, CHA1, ARO3, ASN1, LEU42, LYS9, HIS4, AAT22, ILV6, TRP5, GDH3, PUT1, ILV5, GCV1, ARG1, ARO2, ARO4, MET6, SAH1, ARG4, MIS11, LYS22, SER2, DFR1, LYS4, LYS12, LEU4, ECM42, ILV3, PUT2,</italic> and <italic>GCV3</italic>) and most of these enzymes also require divalent metals as cofactor for their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ducker and Rabinowitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C iii</xref>). One-carbon (1 C) metabolism is critical to support cellular processes like purines and thymidine biosynthesis, amino acid homeostasis (glycine, serine, and methionine), etc. Since the functions of ribosomes and 1 C metabolic enzymes require various essential metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akanuma, 2021</xref>), due to scarcity of those upon EDTA treatment, cells might have evolved a strategy to lower the ribosomal activity and metabolism by reducing ribosome and polysome composition both in cytosol and mitochondria and down-regulating essential metabolic enzymes, respectively. This might have caused a delay in cell division process while the cells maintain to survive in response to EDTA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>EDTA alters the cell wall structure and composition</title><p>Since the cell wall and cell membrane components were upregulated and cytosolic biological processes were suppressed upon EDTA treatment, we examined any effect of EDTA on the ultrastructure of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells by transmission electron microscopy. While the untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells were oval-shaped, the EDTA-treated cells were mostly round-shaped with thicker cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The thickness of the cell wall of EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells was estimated to be 435.023±22.3 nm (~400–600 nm) which is ~fourfolds more than that of untreated (113±31 nm, range of ~70–140 nm). To rationalize the elevated thickness of the cell wall in CAET, the composition of the fungal cell wall was verified. The cell wall of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is composed of an inner layer of chitin, a middle layer of β-glucans, and an outermost layer of mannan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kapteyn et al., 2000</xref>). These cell wall components were estimated by staining the cells with Calcofluor white (CFW), aniline blue, and Concanavalin A tetramethylrhodamine dyes, respectively, and analyzed further by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Our FACS analyses suggested that these components were increased by ~0.5–2.5 folds when the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells were exposed to EDTA, amongst mannan was the most deposited. The perfectly round shape structure of EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells could be due to increased chitin and glucan content as they provide rigidity to the fungal cell wall and could help cells to withstand the metal scarcity associated stress.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ffect of EDTA on the cell wall and polysome of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A) S</bold>howing TEM images of ultrathin sections of untreated (<italic>Ca</italic>) and EDTA-treated (CAET) <italic>C. albicans</italic> at different resolution.

On the other hand, ribosomes are equally important to maintain the cellular homeostasis of metal ions. Since we found a reduction in the RNA content of ribosomal and protein metabolism components upon treatment with EDTA, we intended to estimate the total ribosomes of <italic>C. albicans</italic> without and with 250 μM EDTA treatment. An equal amount of exponentially grown cells of two different concentrations were processed to isolate ribosomes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and analyzed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pospisek and Valasek, 2013</xref>).

The immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils engulf <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells and produce reactive chemicals to eliminate the pathogen. As a counteractive measure, the fungal cells produce several enzymes and toxins to kill the host’s cells and evade the immune system. Since the cell wall is the first interacting interface between the fungal and host cells, the altered cell wall composition could alter the recognition and phagocytosis of fungal cells by macrophages. To examine and compare fungal uptake and clearance by macrophages, we co-cultured differentially stained murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells stained with deep red) and untreated or EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (stained CFSE) in a 1:1 ratio and cells were taken out at different time points (1–3 hr) for flow cytometry analysis. A gating strategy to separate unstained and deep red stained cells during fluorescence acquisition in a flow cytometer and their analyses are depicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A i and ii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Our FACS analysis of co-cultured cells revealed that within 1–3 hr of co-culturing, about ~78–90% of the macrophages were double-positive suggesting efficient uptake of fungal cells by the macrophages, which is equivalent to earlier reported phagocytosis efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumari et al., 2023</xref>). However, a comparatively lower percentage of RAW cells was found to be interacting with CAET than untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (~60% to 90%). At an initial time point of incubation (1 hr), macrophages engulfed untreated and treated fungal cells with equal efficiency (~90%); however, phagocytosis reduced significantly at 3 hr in the case of CAET than <italic>Ca</italic> (~78 to 61%). To further validate it, internalized fungal cells were retrieved from the macrophages, and their survival was estimated by counting colony forming units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B i and ii</xref> ). The CFU analysis revealed more killing of CAET cells than <italic>Ca</italic> by macrophages upon longer co-incubation. This result indicated a faster clearance of metals-deprived condition grown <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells by macrophages. Similarly, PI staining of the co-cultured cells further confirmed more killing of macrophages when they interacted with unexposed than EDTA-exposed fungal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C i and ii</xref>). These results implemented that <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with thickened cell walls due to EDTA exposure get recognized and eliminated faster by immune cells than the naive wild type <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells in vitro.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>C</italic>.<italic>albicans</italic>-Macrophage interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deep red-stained RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells were co-cultured with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<italic>Ca</italic> and CAET) in 1:1 ratio.

Since we observed a differential virulence of fungal cells when they were co-cultured with immune cells, we determined the disease-causing ability of these fungal cells in vivo. BALB/c mice (n=6) were injected with 5x10<sup>5</sup> fungal cells per mouse via the lateral tail vein and monitored their survival for a month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Mice who suffered due to severe candidiasis were euthanized based on the humane endpoints. While the mice challenged with untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> succumbed to infection within 8 days post-inoculation, the mice group injected with CAET survived similarly to the saline control group and did not show any sign of infections. This result suggested that upon EDTA treatment, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell loses its virulence attributes and become non-pathogenic. Therefore, we argued whether animals immunized with CAET can protect against the pathogenic challenge of raw <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells. To validate, two groups of BALB/c mice (n=6) were immunized intravenously either by saline or by 5x10<sup>5</sup> CAET fungal cells per mouse and after 30 days, they were re-challenged with the same inoculum size of virulent form of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells per mouse and their survivability was monitored. Interestingly, while the saline control sham immunized mice succumbed to fungal infections within 9 days, the CAET immunized mice were protected to the lethal re-challenge and survived till their natural death (orange <italic>vs</italic> brown lines). To re-validate it, the animal-challenged experiment was repeated twice on different occasions and the results were very consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further confirmed the suffering of mice due to pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> challenge by histopathology of PAS-stained kidney sections and CFU analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). The CFU analysis of the vital organs such as the kidney, liver, and spleen of killed mice groups (<italic>Ca</italic> and 1°Saline-2°<italic>Ca</italic>) confirmed the presence of heavy <italic>C. albicans</italic> load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Our virulence-challenged analyses demonstrated that EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> by altering its cell wall structure and gene expression reduces virulence potential drastically, and such strains might generate enough immune responses to protect pathogenic WT re-challenge. More importantly, although the effect of EDTA on <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth was reversible by the addition of metals in vitro, that was not the case in animals as the CAET cells were attenuated and were efficiently cleared by the host immune mechanisms as also depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Systemic candidiasis development and progression in <italic>C. albicans</italic> challenged mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice (n=6/category) were injected intravenously with 5x10<sup>5</sup> <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (<italic>Ca</italic>: cyan blue and CAET: purple) and saline as control (grey) and their survivability was monitored for 30 days.

Systemic circulation of fungal cells leads to colonization in various organs; therefore, sepsis and septic shock due to bloodstream fungal infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spellberg et al., 2005</xref>). Since the EDTA-treated fungal cells were nonpathogenic, it was intriguing to determine their growth and inflammation status in the host upon systemic inoculation to animals. Three groups of BALB/c mice were intravenously injected either with saline or 5x10<sup>5</sup> of untreated or EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells per mouse. Similarly, two more vaccinated groups of mice (sham and CAET immunization) were generated and after 30 days, they were re-challenged with either saline or by WT <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Mice (n=5) were euthanized at various time points and various tissues were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The proliferation status of fungal cells was determined by counting the fungal load in various organs by CFU analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A heavy fungal load in most of the tissues except the lungs of the 3d and 7th day post-infected mice by untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> was detected (cyan). As expected, the organs of the saline groups did not possess any fungal cells. While we could not detect the presence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells in the brain, liver, lungs, and spleen of animals infected with CAET in any post-days of infection, fungal cells were recovered from the kidney only in the 3rd and 7th days of post-challenge. On the 7th day, the fungal load in the kidney was ~35–40 folds less in CAET-challenged mice (~10<sup>4</sup> cells, purple bar) than in <italic>Ca</italic> challenged mice group (~3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, cyan bar). Thus, the high fungal load on the 7th day post infection by untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells could be the major reason for the tissue damage to cause death in animals by 9–10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As we detected a gradual increase in fungal load from the 3rd to 7th days but no or undetectable level of fungal cells after 7 days of infection in mice challenged with CAET cells, it suggested that these cells replicate but get eliminated faster from the system leading to the survival of animals. Thus, CAET cells are live and divide in the host initially but as they cannot evade the immune system, they were gradually eliminated. More importantly, the kidney tissues of vaccinated re-challenged mice group (1° CAET 2° <italic>Ca</italic>) also possessed minimal fungal burden (3x10<sup>3</sup> cells) only at 7th day post infection and no detectable fungal cells beyond this time point. This result suggested a faster clearance of WT cells leading to mice survival and most likely due to a robust protective immune response generated upon CAET vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). PAS staining of kidneys further confirmed high fungal load in untreated than EDTA treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells in the 3rd and 7th day of post-infection. No fungal cells were detected in any of the mice groups challenged with CAET beyond 10 days of post-infection irrespective of WT re-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative and qualitative aberrations of immune cells like neutrophils and monocytes are found to be linked to systemic candidiasis and indicate the inflammation status of the host. To get an overview of systemic levels of various immune cells upon <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, the blood of different groups of mice was analyzed to determine any alterations in blood cell profile using a blood counter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A noticeable increase of about two- to fivefolds in peripheral WBC, monocytes, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and platelet levels but reduced RBC were observed in <italic>Ca</italic> infected mice in comparison to those in saline group mice in both 3rd and 7th days of post-infection. Interestingly, CAET infected mice showed mild alteration only in WBC and platelet counts in comparison to the control group. This result again confirms attenuated virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> upon EDTA treatment. The levels of lymphocytes, and other RBC-associated parameters (MCH, MCHC, and MCV) did not alter significantly and remained the same in all three groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells induce balanced levels of cytokines and chemokine production</title><p>Involvement of the pattern recognition receptor (PRRs) of macrophages, dendritic cells, etc. in recognizing fungal pathogens induces multiple cytokines and chemokines, which in turn activate a cascade of host immune responses. T-cells are also the major producers and effectors of these messengers. The levels of these messengers are differed in different sites of infections and responses to the virulence status of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCallum et al., 2009a</xref>). For our analysis, we estimated circulating serum cytokine and chemokine levels in virulent and avirulent fungal-challenged mice and compared them with the saline group in a time-dependent manner by using a multiplex array system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Despite differential rates of fungal replication in vivo, on the 3rd day of infection, all the tested cytokines and chemokines were induced in the fungal infected mice serum irrespective of the virulence status, although with very high level in untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> inoculated mice than CAET group in comparison to that in the control suggesting a prompt triggering of early inflammatory response. While we observed a gradual decline of these towards the basal levels exclusively in mice infected with CAET from 3 to 30 days post-challenge, a significant rise on the 7th day of <italic>Ca</italic>-challenged mice was evident. This upsurge might have created enough immunosuppressive as well as hyper-inflammatory environments allowing fungal propagation and systemic fungal infection leading to host tissue damage and mortality by the 9th day. Especially, Th-1 cytokines like IL-1β, IL-10, GM-CSF, Th-2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, and IL-17 from Th-17 type were highly induced on the 7th day of mice group infected with virulent form of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 will cause immunosuppression, while the pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-12, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α might lead to hyper inflammation in untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> challenged mice. The levels of chemokines like RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1 (α and β), KC, and EOTAXIN were also found to be high in the serum of fungal-infected mice, and similar observations were also found in the kidney and spleen tissues of infected murine in an earlier reported study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCallum et al., 2009a</xref>). Taken all together our data suggest that while a critical balance of the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines mediated immune responses is maintained for a long duration in mice challenged with CAET to induce antifungal protective immunity, both of these cytokines remained high in the pathogenic-challenged mice group leading to immunosuppression and death. Altogether this study found that CAET cells are live but non-pathogenic and boost immune responses to protect against lethal fungal challenges in a pre-clinical model; thus, CAET could be explored further as a potential whole-cell vaccine candidate.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cytokine and chemokine estimation in infected mice.</title><p>The mice (n=3/category) were inoculated with <italic>Ca</italic> or CAET or saline and sacrificed on various days as indicated and cytokine and chemokine levels in the blood serum were quantified by using Bio-plex Pro cytokine multiplex kit.

The limited antifungal effect of EDTA on fungal colonization and growth by chelating calcium ions from the medium has been shown in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gil et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pugh and Cawson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sen et al., 2000</xref>).

All these reports including ours establish the importance of metals in <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis.

Major changes in the expression of key genes and pathways associated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> were metal transport and homeostasis, pathogenesis processes, ribosome biogenesis, and one-carbon metabolic enzymes among others. While the cell wall and membrane-associated components were upregulated, cytosolic components were downregulated upon EDTA exposure. To our surprise, only the iron (<italic>CFL5, CFL2, CSA2, CSA1, HAP3, FRE9, ARH2, FTR1, FTR2, FET3, SIT1,</italic> and <italic>FTH1,</italic>) and zinc (<italic>ZRT1, ZRT2, CSR1, PRA1</italic>) transporters were upregulated upon EDTA treatment, whether these genes are also involved in the transportation of other metals like magnesium, manganese, etc. require further investigation. As reported earlier <italic>ALR1, MRS2, LPE10,</italic> and <italic>MNR2</italic> are required for magnesium transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hans et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hunsaker and Franz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Niewerth et al., 2003</xref>); however, the expression of these genes remains unaltered in our analysis. Most of these upregulated genes involved in metal homeostasis are also found to be associated with fungal virulence. For example, <italic>PRA1</italic> and <italic>ZRT1</italic> collaborate to sequester zinc and mediate endothelial damage of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Citiulo et al., 2012</xref>). Further study suggested that Pra1 blocks fungal immune recognition and inhibits recruitment, adhesion, and effector functions of both the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zipfel et al., 2011</xref>). A phosphate transporter <italic>PHO87</italic> was also highly upregulated upon EDTA exposure suggesting phosphate starvation, and the role of phosphate metabolism in virulence was shown in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacCallum et al., 2009b</xref>). The outer layer of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall is enriched in highly glycosylated proteins like the GlycosylPhosphatidylInositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (GpiPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richard and Plaine, 2007</xref>) and this study revealed upregulation of many such proteins (<italic>PGA7, PGA13, PGA17, PGA19,</italic> and <italic>PGA31</italic>). Some of these GpiPs are involved in cell wall synthesis, morphogenesis, and adhesion. Accordingly, these genes might have contributed to the increased thickness of the cell wall upon EDTA treatment by enhancing mannan, β-glucan, and chitin depositions. Consistent with this, an earlier report showed that deletion of <italic>PGA13</italic> caused increased sensitivity to Congo red, Calcofluor white, and zymolyase; delayed filamentation, increased adherence, and reduced virulence in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelis et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly<italic>,</italic> the <italic>pga7</italic>ΔΔ mutant also exhibited reduced virulence in the murine model of systemic candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuznets et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>pga31</italic>ΔΔ mutant shows modifications in the cell wall composition and caspofungin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plaine et al., 2008</xref>). EDTA treatment also enhanced the expression of a small network of well-characterized genes associated with filamentation and pathogenesis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<italic>BRG1, TEC1, UME6, HWP1, HGC1, SAP5,</italic> and <italic>SAP6</italic>). Secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps) are encoded by a multigene family of at least nine members (<italic>SAP1</italic> to <italic>SAP9</italic>) and Sap4, Sap5, and Sap6 isoenzymes are important for the normal progression of systemic infection by <italic>C. albicans</italic> in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanglard et al., 1997</xref>). Hwp1 is a hyphal-specific cell wall protein and its role in virulence is debatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniels et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsuchimori et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>UME6</italic> is a transcriptional regulator that is induced in response to environmental cues and the <italic>ume6ΔΔ</italic> mutant exhibits a defect in hyphal extension and is attenuated for virulence in animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>HGC1</italic> is a hypha-specific G1 cyclin-related protein involved in hyphal transition and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>). Transcription factors like Bcr1, Brg1, Rob1, Hgc1, and Tec1 were shown to be involved in biofilm formation as loss of any one of these regulators significantly compromised biofilm formation both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Contrary to all these reports, despite the upregulation of these virulence genes, our study showed EDTA inhibiting biofilm formation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in vitro and virulence in cellular and animal models. Among the down-regulated genes, genes of the ribosome biogenesis and one carbon metabolic process stood out. Altogether, our transcriptomics analysis suggested that due to the scarcity of essential metals upon EDTA treatment, <italic>C. albicans</italic> induced its metal uptake ability by expressing various transporters and increased the efficiency of the cell wall and membrane components, at the same time; it reduced the cytosolic activity to a bare minimum by down regulating ribosomal and 1 C metabolic genes to withstand metal deficiency and that likely induced a dormant-like state in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>Although some of the virulence genes were upregulated upon EDTA treatment and their specific deletions are known to cause attenuated virulence in animal models, CAET cells were eliminated faster by macrophages and became avirulent in mice. It emphasizes that the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is very complex and multifactorial, and requires a network protein to manifest candidiasis development. In this study, downregulation of ribosome biogenesis and metabolic enzyme synthesis seem to be the predominant factor in suppressing the virulence of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> whereas the overexpression of cell-wall-associated virulence genes might have played a role in enhancing recognition by the immune cells and host immune responses. Unlike untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> which multiplies in the host rapidly and the count reaches the maximum (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> CFU/kidney) at day-7 in most of the essential organs causing tissue damage and death on the 9th –10th day, the CAET cells multiplied very slowly in infected organs (&lt;10<sup>4</sup> CFU/kidney at 7th day) and were eventually cleared from the system by the 10th day. Host defense against systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infection depends mostly on the efficacy of phagocytosis of fungal cells by innate immune cells. This study showed an increased number of monocytes, granulocytes, and platelets in the circulation of mice infected with <italic>Ca</italic> than in CAET. This also suggests differential virulence properties of these two fungal strains. The fungal cell wall is the first point of contact with the innate immune system and plays an important role in recognition by neutrophils and macrophages. β-glucan of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall is recognized by dectin-1 /Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) receptor as the major PAMPs that trigger both host protective immunity and pathogenic inflammatory responses. The mannose receptor (MR) and TLR4 recognize N-linked and O-linked mannans, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netea et al., 2015</xref>). The thick cell wall of CAET contained a higher proportion of all the components, and these constituents probably played a key role in efficient phagocytosis and clearance by the macrophages than the untreated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells.</p><p>Cytokines and chemokines play important roles in regulating inflammation and immune activation due to the presence of a pathogen. To analyse differential cytokines-mediated immune responses in infected mice, 16 cytokines and 6 chemokines from the serum were estimated. Induction of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines by the pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> as early as 3–7 days post-infection might have caused immune suppression, hyper inflammation, and tissue damage promoting excessive fungal growth, sepsis, and death of the mice within 10 days. However, in CAET-infected mice, a critical balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines was developed. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels gradually decreased from the 3rd day to 30th day, but a critical level above basal was still maintained to provide protective immunity, thus by immunization with CAET, animals were protected from the lethal challenge of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>Differential levels of cytokine induction in untreated <italic>Vs</italic> EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected mice again suggested possible involvement of T-cells as they are the major producers and effectors of these messengers. The protective immunity against fungal pathogens is mostly dependent on the balanced activation of ‘protective’ Th-1 and ‘non-protective’ Th-2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netea et al., 2015</xref>). Fungal infections inducing the Th-1 cytokines (e.g. IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2) in the serum of infected individuals have been reported and these are involved in macrophage activation, nitric oxide production, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes proliferation to enhance phagocytosis and fungal clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netea et al., 2015</xref>). IFNγ is central to anti-fungal resistance against systemic candidiasis as the IFNγ knockout mice are highly susceptible to disseminated <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balish et al., 1998</xref>). IL-12 acts on NK and T cells to produce IFN-γ which in turn stimulates monocytes and macrophages to produce IL-12. Deficiency of IL-12 or IL-12R genes leads to enhanced fungal infections. The Th-2/Th-17 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL6, IL9, IL-13, and IL17 levels also increased in the serum of fungal-challenged mice. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are responsible for the production of non-opsonizing antibodies, allergic reactions, and the suppression of inflammatory reactions caused by Th1 cytokines. Exogenous supplementation of recombinant IL-4 to mice increases susceptibility to invasive fungal infections, again suggesting the deleterious effects of Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cenci et al., 1999</xref>). IL-6-deficient mice are more susceptible to invasive candidiasis than wild type mice, which suggests that IL-6 release is fundamental during fungal infection and the severity of sepsis. Th17-response results in the production of IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 cytokines. IL-17 upregulates several chemokines and matrix metalloproteases through the NF-KB and MAPK signalling pathways, leading to the recruitment of neutrophils into the sites of inflammation during fungal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haraguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romani, 2004</xref>). Not surprisingly, IL-17R null mice are highly susceptible to systemic candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). Other cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and GM-CSF are also involved in neutrophil recruitment during candidiasis. From the cytokine profiling, it is evident that while an optimal balance between Th-1 and Th-2/Th-17 responses seems to be maintained in CAET-challenged mice, an increased levels of these was observed in <italic>Ca</italic>-challenged mice. Chemokines are also critical for immune cell trafficking during pathogen attack and are released at an early stage of fungal infection. They bind to their respective receptors to trigger interleukins production to promote fungal clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Traynor and Huffnagle, 2001</xref>). This study reports higher levels of CC-type chemokines (MCP-1, KC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, and EOTAXIN) in infected mice and follow similar trends as cytokine in <italic>Ca vs</italic> CAET challenged groups. Platelets are known to produce some of these immune mediators like RANTES and PF4 with antimicrobial activity against <italic>Candida</italic> species, and platelet-rich plasma inhibits the growth of <italic>Candida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drago et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Apart from innate and adaptive immunity, trained immunity also seems to be critical to providing immunological memory that is dependent on epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Netea et al., 2015</xref>). It has been suggested that the trained immunity is induced through the binding of dectin-1 to the β-glucans of <italic>C. albicans</italic> followed by activation of the non-canonical RAF1-cAMP signaling pathway causing epigenetic imprinting through histone methylation and acetylation, thereby, it boosts pro-inflammatory cytokines production in trained monocytes and macrophages. As the EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells have a high level of β-glucans and upon its immunization, the animals were protected to the lethal re-challenge of WT strain, the role of trained immunity cannot be ruled out. A detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying protective immune responses in CAET challenged mice require further investigation and are awaited. Nevertheless, based on the presented results, CAET has the potential to be developed as a live whole-cell vaccine against fungal infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal ethical clearance</title><p>Mice and protocols involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India, with a Permit Number ILS/IAEC-133-AH/AUG-18.

The total RNA was isolated by using MagSure All-RNA Isolation Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance ratios of 260/280 and 260/230 were estimated using NanoDrop2000 to assess the concentration of RNA samples. Samples were also examined in 1% agarose gel run at 70 V. The RNA was stored at –80 °C. Before RNA sequencing, QC was performed to check the quantity and integrity of RNA samples by using NanoDrop One and Qubit. The integrity of the RNA was checked by running on an Agilent Tapestation 4200 RNA HS Screentape to determine the RNA Integrity Number (RIN). For library preparation, RNA with &gt;8 RIN values was processed. About 1 μg of RNA samples was depleted of Yeast rRNA using QIAseqFastSelect−rRNA yeast kit (Cat. no. 334215), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The NEBNext<sup>(R)</sup> Ultra II Directional RNA Library prep kit from Illumina (Cat. no. E7760L), was used to construct double-stranded cDNA libraries from the rRNA-depleted RNA.

In order to filter and remove rRNA reads, <italic>SortMeRNAv4.3.6</italic> was used. Further quality trimming was performed to remove adaptors and low-quality ambiguous bases. Mapping of trimmed reads performed using <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314 reference genome (assembly ASM18296v3) downloaded from NCBI database. The uniquely mapped reads were selected as default followed by transcripts per million (TPM) as raw expression value. Gene expression (GE) track was used for profiling the differential gene expression, subsequently normalizing the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) using the edgeR method. In order to find the significant genes, two cut-off parameters; false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off ≤0.05 and log2 fold change (FC) cut-off ≥1 were applied to produce a differential gene expression (DEG) profile. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed within R to project the high dimensional dataset onto a 2D or 3D plain based on the principal component specifying larger-sized variabilities. Data was represented and visualized through a heat map using the normalized log CPM values. The volcano plot was used to feature the gene of interest at the upper left- and right-hand corners, where log2 fold changes were plotted on the x-axis, and the -log10 p-values plotted on the y-axis. Pathway enrichment analysis was created based on gene ontology (GO), where GO terms were over-represented in a set of differentially expressed genes using ignore features with mean RPKM = 5, minimum absolute fold change = 1.5, and FDR <italic>P</italic>-value ≤0.05. KOBAS (KEGG Orthology Based Annotation System), a web server for gene/protein functional annotation (Annotation module) and functional set enrichment (Enrichment module) was used for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene interaction networks and protein-protein associations have been created using the STRING app. STRING software version 11.5 was used to undertake active parameters like text-mining, experiments, databases, co-expression, neighborhood, gene fusion, and co-occurrence for upregulated DEGs, while for downregulated DEGs, only the experimental parameter was considered.

They then explore the use of EDTA-treated yeast as a whole-cell vaccine in a mouse model of systemic infection. In general, the results of the paper are unsurprising. Treating yeast cells with EDTA affects their growth and the addition of metals rescues the phenotype. Because of the significant growth defects of the cells, they don't infect mice and you see reduced virulence. Injection with these cells effectively immunises the mice, in the same way that heatkilled yeast cells would. The data is fairly sound and mostly well-presented, and the paper is easy to follow. However, I feel the data is an incremental advance at best, and the immune analysis in the paper is very basic and descriptive.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Detailed analysis of EDTA-treated yeast cells</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Basic immune data with little advance in knowledge.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>No comparison between their whole-cell vaccine and others tried in the field.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The data is largely unsurprising and not novel.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you so much for appreciating our effort to generate a whole cell anti-fungal vaccine by treating <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with EDTA. Also, we appreciate your comment that the manuscript is sound and well-presented. However, we are afraid that the respected reviewer assumed the CAET cells as dead cells while they only divide relatively slower than the untreated cells. In the revised manuscript, we have presented additional evidence to show that CAET are live cells (Supp. Figs 2) and based on the new data, we expect a positive change in the reviewer’s opinion.

This is the only non-genetically modified antifungal vaccine candidate therefore a comparison with a dead strain at present is unwarranted. We have now added supporting data to confirm that, the survivability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells was unaffected at 6 hr of EDTA treatment (CAET, Supp. Fig. S2). (2) Since the current study focused on the identification and a detailed characterization of a non-genetically modified live attenuated strain and its safety and efficacy as a potential vaccine candidate in the preclinical model, we have excluded the possible immune mechanisms involving CAET. However, in a separate study, we are currently investigating both cellular and molecular mechanisms that provide protective immunity in CAET-vaccinated mice. (3) The results of Figs 5 and 6 were misinterpreted by the respected reviewer, please see the explanation below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Some specific comments/suggestions for the authors:(1) What was the viability of the yeast after EDTA treatment? Is the delayed growth response because many cells died and it takes a while for remaining viable cells to catch up? This is important to know because it may mean the dose given to mice is substantially different and that should be accounted for. Some PI staining of the cells after treatment would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: The growth curve assays (Fig. 1A and 1E) were initiated with O.D.600nm=0.5 of each cultures (~ 107 cells/mL) and the analyses suggested that the EDTA-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells grew slower than the untreated cells. Fig. 1B and 1F further demonstrated that EDTA has minimal effect on the survival of the strain up to 8 hrs post-exposure. The proportion of the number of cells increased without and with metal chelators almost remained the same for this duration (0 – 8 hrs). Therefore, for subsequent analyses, 6 hr treatment was selected and such treated cells were considered as CAET, which were actively dividing live cells, albeit slower than untreated cells. As suggested and to strengthen our finding, a time dependent SYTOX Green and Propidium iodide staining of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells without and with EDTA treatment was carried out and analysed by flow cytometry and microscopy, respectively. Both analyses revealed that the percentage of dead cells up to 12 hrs of without and with EDTA treatment remained the same. The new data has now been added in the revised version of the manuscript as Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93760-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In line with the above, what was the viability of the CAET cells after 3h in media? In the macrophage in vitro experiments, how do you know the reduced viability of the CAET cells is macrophage-specific? Did you run a control of CAET cells in media on their own to determine how CFU changed in macrophage-free conditions? Is the proliferation rates of untreated and CAET cells different? That would affect CFSE labelling and results. These experiments would work better with a GFP-expressing <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain, which is widely available. In the images in Figure 4c, it looks like there are more hyphae in CAET than untreated - was hyphal induction checked/measured? That's important to know because more hyphae usually means more clumping and this can affect CFU counts (giving the impression of less CFU when actually there is more). Because of all the issues above, I'm not fully convinced by the uptake/killing data.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: As explained in response 1, we used actively dividing WT and CAET cells, and equal number of these cells were CFSE labelled. As can be seen in Fig.4A, the rate of phagocytosis was the same in 1 hr of pre-culture, but in the subsequent time points the double-positive cells were reduced in the case of CAET cells and that is due to fungal killing by macrophages. Fungal cells were released from the macrophages by warm water treatment and CFU was determined. Fig. 4B suggested that at 1hr of co-culture, the CFU of both fungal cells (WT and CAET) were the same and the fungal clearance was observed at later time points. Thus, the reduced viability of CAET cells was macrophagespecific. EDTA has minimal effect on hyphal transition without and with the presence of serum and the new data has now been provided in the revised version (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93760-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Pooled data should be shown for all animal experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the suggestion, wherever it was meaningful pooled data for the animal experiments have now been provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Immune cell counts/analysis in the kidney and bone marrow would be hugely helpful and more relevant to understanding immune responses following immunisation/infection. I think a more interesting analysis for the authors to consider would be to immunise with heat-killed yeast vs EDTAtreated yeast and see if there is a qualitative difference or better protection, i.e. is the EDTA-treated whole-cell vaccine superior to the heat-killed version? That is a better question to address. As it stands, the data in the paper is not surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: The studies on cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying protective immunity in CAETvaccinated mice are under progress in a separate study. This study mostly focused on the identification and detailed characterization of a non-genetically modified live-attenuated strain and its safety and efficacy as a potential vaccine candidate in a preclinical model. We are afraid that a comparison of a live cell (CAET) with a dead cell (heat-killed) will dilute the content of the manuscript and will not be meaningful. It is well accepted that the heat-killed <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain only provides partial short-lived protection to re-challenge (Refs-PMIDs: 12146759, and 9916097), thus, it does not warrant any comparison with CAET.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, this is a highly interesting study. I have the following specific comments for clarification.</p><p>(1) In the introduction, the authors mentioned other anti-candida vaccines that are mostly effective against Candida infection by inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, in their CAET vaccine candidate, they only checked the cellular immunity in blood and found a balanced immune response (both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses are induced). How about the antibody production in these mice? It is a bit surprising that both untreated Candida infection and CAET Candida infection produced similar immune activation based on Figure 6, yet the CAET immunization provides protection. Some innate cell recruitment is higher in untreated Ca infection than the CAET infected mice (Figure 5F). The overall results on immune response characterization did not seem to explain why the CAET infection led to host protection while untreated Ca infection cannot. Characterizing infected tissue immune cell differentiation and cytokine production may offer some additional insights.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We agree with you that in this manuscript we have not provided any mechanistic study on the protective immunity in CAET-vaccinated mice. This will be demonstrated in a subsequent study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 5, some critical data seem to be missing in panels B and C. The CFU and histopathological images for CAET-treated mice challenged by Ca should also be shown there for comparison. Although they did show some data in Figure 5E and Figure S4, it is necessary to have that data in 5B and 5C from the same experiment. Figure S4 is a very busy figure and the images are quite small. It may be necessary to use arrows to point out what information authors want to emphasize.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Fig 5 B and 5C showed the data for mice that succumbed to infection. Since the other mice (saline control groups, CAET infected, CAET vaccinated, and re-challenged groups) survived, they were not sacrificed; therefore, the CFU data was not collected. In addition, we wanted to see the longevity of these survived mice and after 1 year of observations, they were handed over to the animal house for clearance as per the institutional guidelines. However, Figure 5E and Figure S4 (now Fig. S6) included all the mice groups as they were sacrificed at various time points irrespective of humane end points. As suggested FigS6 has now been modified and fungal cells were denoted by yellow arrows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) EDTA-treated yeast cells showed poor growth but also had thicker cell walls with high chitin, glucan, and mannan levels. What leads to its clearance in vivo remains unclear, as usually, cells with thick cell wall structures and low metabolism are more resistant to stress, e.g., dormant cells. Macrophages were shown to contribute to CAET killing in a phagocytosis assay (Figure 4). Checking cytokines produced by macrophages during co-incubation may offer some insights. In all, additional discussion on what caused in vivo clearance would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Mechanistic study on the protective immune responses of CAET will be demonstrated in a separate study. As suggested, the discussion section now contains additional information emphasising the in vivo clearance of CAET cells in the 3rd paragraph of discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Long paragraphs in the discussion section could be divided into a bigger number of shorter paragraphs.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the suggestion, it has now been modified in the revised version (7 short paragraphs). To make it more comprehensive, some of the content has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It is unclear how many cells were treated with 250 micromolar of EDTA for 6 hours before preparing the inoculum. It seems that only the OD was measured before adding EDTA. This is not a very rigorous and reproducible method.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: In this manuscript, we have repeatedly used the same protocol to generate CAET cells for various analyses. The O.D.600nm = 0.5 culture is equivalent to 107 <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells per mL and this information has now been added in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Upon treatment with 250 micromolar of EDTA, cells were harvested and counted to prepare the inoculum (5x10e5) for injecting it in mice. However, it appears that CFU of the inoculum was not done. Based on data shown in Fig. 1B, 250 micromolar of EDTA does inhibit Candida cell replication. Thus, the authors may have counted dead cells and, thus, injected dead cells together with live cells for the CAET inoculum. Thus, mice receiving this inoculum may have been infected (and vaccinated) with a lower number of live Candida cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Please see a similar response to reviewer #1. EDTA has minimal effect on the survival of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells at 6 hr (also see supp. Fig. S2). We have already mentioned the CFU analysis of untreated and CAET cells in the methodology section related to inoculum preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is unclear if 6 hours of treatment with 250 micromolar of EDTA is enough to induce a block of Candida cell replication. In Figure 1B, the authors treated for 24h. The authors are encouraged to wash the cells after 6 hours of treatment and see if their cell division will recover upon removal of EDTA.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the suggestion. At 6 hr treatment, survivability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells was unaffected upon EDTA exposure. PI and SYTOX GREEN staining confirmed it (Supp. Fig. 2). Additionally, as suggested a rescue experiment was carried out by exogenous addition of divalent metals after 6 hr EDTA treatment and growth/CFU analyses were followed thereafter. A modified Fig. 1 A and B with new data has been provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The data shown in Figure 5A is extremely exciting. However, the number of mice in each group (n=6) is too low. Normally, 10 mice per group are used for virulence studies unless the authors provide a power analysis that 6 mice per group will be sufficient. Also, CFU data were only provided for Ca and saline-Ca groups (Fig. 5B) and not for the other groups. CFU data should be provided for all mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for the suggestion and a statistical analysis of Fig. 5A was provided in the revised version. The rationale behind not including all mice groups in Fig. 5B is already explained in a response to reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is unclear how the authors differentiate between CFU arising from CAET or from WT Candida.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Since the Fig 5 E demonstrated that no CAET cells were detected in the kidney beyond 10 days of inoculation, in the re-challenged mice group (1CAET 2 Ca), the fungal cells those detected in the 3rd and 7th days were from the later inoculated cells (brown colour).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 5E: it is unclear if a 1 saline-2 saline (Figure legend) or if 1 saline-2 Ca (text) group was included. If the latter, where are the CFU? It is impossible that 1 saline-2 Ca mice have no CFU.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you so much for pointing this out. The legend has now been modified that include 1saline-2saline and 1CAET-2Ca.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It seems that CFU is significantly present in the kidney in the 1 CAET - 2 Ca group at day 7 but not at day 3. How is this possible? This is an extremely invasive model of infection, and the authors are challenging intravenously 500,000 live Candida cells. If by the 3rd day, the authors detect no CFU, then how is it possible that CFUs are arising on day 7?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We do detect fungal cells on 3rd day in 1CAET 2 WT mice group (~2000 cells), albeit much lower than in 7 days (~11200 cells). A Log10 scale graph has now been provided for better representation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Most importantly, if the authors are not detecting CFU at day 3, then earlier time points (e.g. day 2, day 1, or even 12 hours post-challenge) must be analyzed. The authors should show that CFU from the organs is decreasing in a time-dependent manner. Also, all CFU should be shown as Log10.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: please see the previous response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Fig. 6: because it is unclear if the mice were challenged with the same inoculum of live Candida cells (untreated and treated with EDTA), the different cytokine profiles between the two groups could be simply due to the different inoculum sizes and not to the effect of EDTA on Ca.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: please see the previous response as given also for Reviewer 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
