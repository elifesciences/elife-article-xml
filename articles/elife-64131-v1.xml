for maintaining genome stability. Although Rad51 is the key protein that drives HR, multiple auxiliary factors interact with Rad51 to potentiate its activity. Here, we present an interdisciplinary characterization of the interactions between Rad51 and these factors. Through structural analysis, we identified an evolutionarily conserved acidic patch of Rad51. The neutralization of this patch completely abolished recombinational DNA repair due to defects in the recruitment of Rad51 to DNA damage sites. This acidic patch was found to be important for the interaction with Rad55-Rad57 and essential for the interaction with Rad52. Furthermore, biochemical reconstitutions demonstrated that neutralization of this acidic patch also impaired the interaction with Rad54, indicating that a single motif is important for the interaction with multiple auxiliary factors. We propose that this patch is a fundamental motif that facilitates interactions with auxiliary factors and is therefore essential for recombinational DNA repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA molecule contains the chemical instructions necessary for life. Its physical integrity is therefore vital, yet it is also under constant threat from external and internal factors. As a result, organisms have evolved an arsenal of mechanisms to repair damaged DNA. For instance, when the two complementary strands that form the DNA molecule are broken at the same location, the cell triggers a mechanism known as homologous recombination.</p><p>A protein known as Rad51 orchestrates this process, helped by an array of other proteins that include Rad55-Rad57, Rad52, and Rad54. These physically bind to Rad51 and activate it in different ways. However, exactly how these interactions take place remained unclear.</p><p>To find out more, Afshar et al. examined models of the structure of Rad51, revealing that three of the protein’s building blocks create a prominent, negatively charged patch that could be important for DNA repair. Yeast cells were then genetically manipulated to produce a modified version of Rad51 in which the three building blocks were neutralised. These organisms were unable to repair their DNA. Further biochemical tests showed that the modified protein could no longer attach well to Rad55-Rad57 or Rad54, and could not stick to Rad52 at all. In fact, without its negatively charged patch, Rad51 could not find the ends of broken DNA strands, a process which is normally aided by Rad55-Rad57 and Rad52. Taken together, these results suggest that the helper proteins all interact with Rad51 in the same place, even though they play different roles.</p><p>Faulty DNA repair processes have been linked to devastating consequences such as cell death or cancer. Understanding the details of DNA repair in yeast can serve as a template for research in more complex organisms, opening the possibility of applications for human health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>genome stability</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>Rad51</kwd><kwd>RecA</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H059749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H03985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H02371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsubouchi</surname><given-names>Hideo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K15061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Argunhan</surname><given-names>Bilge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K15713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Argunhan</surname><given-names>Bilge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17J04051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Afshar</surname><given-names>Negar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although Rad51 is the central protein involved in recombinational DNA repair, multiple auxiliary factors potentiate its activity by binding to a single, evolutionarily conserved motif.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation and genotoxic chemicals can cause DNA damage. However, endogenous processes such as DNA replication and cellular metabolism can also damage DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambert and Carr, 2013</xref>). A particularly severe form of DNA damage is a DNA double-strand break (DSB), in which a single normal chromosome is separated into two pathological chromosomes. Homologous recombination (HR) is a major mechanism responsible for accurately repairing DSBs. HR is also critically important for DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait Saada et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, defects in HR lead to genome instability, which drives human diseases such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prakash et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>During HR, the DNA ends that are exposed at a DSB are resected to form 3’ overhangs, which are immediately coated by the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). The RecA-family recombinase Rad51 then displaces RPA to form a helical nucleoprotein filament known as the presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). This filament can locate a segment of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with substantial sequence similarity (i.e.,homology) to the ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greene, 2016</xref>). Upon identifying a homologous region, the Rad51 filament invades the intact dsDNA, displacing the non-complementary strand and forming base pairs with the complementary strand. Within the context of this displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, the 3’-end of the invading strand can be extended by utilizing the complementary strand as a template for DNA synthesis, allowing for the recovery of lost genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McVey et al., 2016</xref>). The D-loop can also be expanded by Rad51-driven DNA strand exchange, which increases the extent of base pairing between the two DNA molecules. Consequently, D-loops can be processed to form Holliday junctions, which may be resolved as either crossover or non-crossover products, or they may be disassembled prior to Holliday junction formation, resulting exclusively in non-crossover outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>).</p><p>As the entity capable of identifying homology and driving DNA strand exchange, Rad51 is integral to DNA repair by HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shinohara et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muris et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sung, 1994</xref>). However, Rad51 does not function alone in vivo. Several other proteins that are required for HR have been identified in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> including Rad52, Rad54, the Rad51 paralogs Rad55-Rad57, Swi5-Sfr1, and the lesser studied Shu complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ostermann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khasanov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsutsui et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khasanov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martín et al., 2006</xref>). These factors are mostly conserved in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> despite the large evolutionary distance separating the two yeasts, although it should be noted that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homolog of Swi5-Sfr1 (Mei5-Sae3) is only involved in meiotic HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Argunhan et al., 2017a</xref>). This suggests that the requirement for a diverse array of auxiliary factors to promote recombinational DNA repair has been conserved throughout evolution, highlighting its importance. However, our understanding of how auxiliary factors promote Rad51 activity remains incomplete, although they seem to perform largely non-overlapping roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zelensky et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Sfr1 was first identified in <italic>S. pombe</italic> as an interactor of Rad51 that forms a complex with Swi5 specifically involved in promoting Rad51-dependent DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>). The Swi5-Sfr1 heterodimer stimulates DNA strand exchange by potentiating Rad51’s ATPase activity and stabilizing Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haruta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to being widely conserved among eukaryotes, the mechanisms through which Swi5-Sfr1 promotes HR appear to be highly similar in yeasts and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Su et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Argunhan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). The Rad51 paralogs Rad55-Rad57 are another group of evolutionarily conserved auxiliary factors. Rad55 and Rad57 were identified in <italic>S. pombe</italic> based on sequence homology and genetic screening, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khasanov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsutsui et al., 2000</xref>). Relatively little is known about the molecular function of Rad55-Rad57 due to the biochemical intractability of the complex, although much like Swi5-Sfr1, it is thought to be an obligate heterodimer. The biochemical analysis that has been performed with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins suggests that Rad55-Rad57 promotes Rad51 filament formation on RPA-coated ssDNA and protects the Rad51 filament from disruption by the Srs2 anti-recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sung, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). This is consistent with cytological observations in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> indicating that the number of DNA damage-induced Rad51 foci, which represent Rad51 filaments at sites of ongoing DNA repair, are reduced in the absence of Rad55/Rad57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasior et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gasior et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akamatsu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Among recombination auxiliary factors, the absence of Rad52 results in the most severe phenotype, with deletion mutants displaying DNA damage sensitivity exceeding the <italic>rad51∆</italic> single mutant; this has been attributed to the absolute dependency of Rad51 on Rad52, as well as Rad51-independent functions of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doe et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>rad54∆</italic> mutant also shows severe DNA damage sensitivity that is indistinguishable from <italic>rad51∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muris et al., 1997</xref>), highlighting the absolute requirement for Rad54 in Rad51-dependent DNA repair. By contrast, the <italic>rad57Δ</italic> and <italic>sfr1Δ</italic> mutants show only moderate sensitivity to DNA damage, while the <italic>rad57Δ sfr1Δ</italic> double mutant is as sensitive as the <italic>rad51Δ</italic> single mutant. Based on this additivity, it was proposed that Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 comprise independent sub-pathways of HR that function in parallel to promote Rad51-dependent DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akamatsu et al., 2007</xref>), although recent evidence has evoked a re-examination of this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Argunhan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To learn more about the relationship between Rad51 and its auxiliary factors, we sought to identify regions of Rad51 that are important for interactions with auxiliary factors. This led to the identification of an evolutionarily conserved acidic patch comprised of three residues: E205, E206, and D209. Mutation of all three residues to Ala completely ablates Rad51-dependent DNA repair, as does a single charge-reversal mutation, indicating that the negative character of this patch is critical for DNA repair. Mechanistically, these defects in DNA repair stem from abrogation of the interaction with both Rad55-Rad57 and Rad52, leading to impaired recruitment of Rad51 to sites of DNA damage. Remarkably, biochemical reconstitutions indicate that neutralization of the acidic patch also impairs the interaction with Rad54, demonstrating that a single motif of Rad51 is important for its interaction with Rad55-Rad57, Rad52, and Rad54. We propose that this acidic patch of Rad51 comprises a fundamental motif that is essential for interactions with auxiliary factors and therefore recombinational DNA repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>E205, E206, and D209 comprise a protruding acidic patch (PAP) on the exterior of the Rad51 presynaptic filament</title><p>Several motifs important for the enzymatic activity of Rad51 are located in the highly conserved ATPase core domain, which is characterized by a β-sheet consisting of mixed parallel and antiparallel β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Story et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellegrini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conway et al., 2004</xref>).

There is a similar reduction in recombinational DNA repair in the <italic>sfr1∆/swi5∆</italic> background, where the remaining Rad51-mediated HR is dependent on Rad55-Rad57. However, the <italic>rad57∆ sfr1∆</italic> double mutant displays a complete loss of Rad51-mediated DNA repair, phenocopying <italic>rad51∆</italic>. Thus, employing the <italic>rad57∆</italic> and <italic>sfr1∆</italic> backgrounds allows for the evaluation of DNA repair promoted by Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>). The <italic>rad51-E206A rad57∆</italic> strain was no more sensitive to UV than <italic>rad57∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that Rad51-E206A is as proficient as wild-type Rad51 in Swi5-Sfr1–dependent DNA repair. By contrast, <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> was as sensitive as <italic>rad51∆</italic> in the absence of Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the recombinational DNA repair promoted solely by Rad55-Rad57 is ablated by the Rad51-E206A mutation. The generality of these findings was confirmed by performing spot tests with several different genotoxins that induce replication fork stalling and a variety of lesions in DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>The DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>sfr1∆ rad51-E206A</italic> is comparable in severity to <italic>rad51∆</italic>, which itself shows similar sensitivity to <italic>rad57∆ sfr1∆</italic> and <italic>rad54∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muris et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2003</xref>). The <italic>rad52∆</italic> mutant is even more sensitive to DNA damage, although this added sensitivity stems from Rad51-independent roles of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doe et al., 2004</xref>); a mutation that abolishes the interaction between Rad51 and Rad52 would be expected to phenocopy <italic>rad51∆</italic>, not <italic>rad52∆</italic>. Thus, it is possible that the DNA damage sensitivity associated with <italic>rad51-E206A</italic>, which manifests in the <italic>sfr1∆</italic> background, reflects a defect in the interaction of Rad51 with Rad52 or Rad54, rather than with Rad55-Rad57. We sought to distinguish between these possibilities genetically. Rqh1 is a RecQ-family helicase (homologous to Sgs1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the BLM and WRN helicases in humans) that functions in S phase to prevent the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates that arise during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stewart et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>rqh1∆</italic> cells are sensitive to the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). It was previously shown that <italic>rad57∆</italic> and <italic>sfr1∆</italic> robustly suppress the HU sensitivity of <italic>rqh1∆</italic> whereas <italic>rad52∆</italic> and <italic>rad54∆</italic> do not, presumably because the former mutations reduce HR while the latter mutations eliminate it completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hope et al., 2005</xref>). If Rad51-E206A is defective in the interaction with Rad55-Rad57 rather than Rad52/Rad54, then the <italic>rqh1∆ rad51-E206A</italic> strain should phenocopy <italic>rqh1∆ rad57∆</italic> rather than <italic>rqh1∆ rad52∆/rad54∆</italic>. Consistently, <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> suppressed the HU sensitivity of <italic>rqh1∆</italic> to almost the same degree as <italic>rad57∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, the suppression conferred by <italic>sfr1∆</italic>, which is dependent on Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hope et al., 2005</xref>), was ablated by <italic>rad51-E206A</italic>. By contrast, the suppression imparted by <italic>rad57∆</italic> was epistatic to <italic>rad51-E206A</italic>, suggesting that they involve the same mechanism. At 5 mM HU, <italic>rad57∆ sfr1∆</italic> could partially suppress <italic>rqh1∆</italic> sensitivity, whereas <italic>rad51∆</italic> and <italic>rad54∆</italic> could not. Importantly, the <italic>sfr1∆ rad51-E206A</italic> strain was still similar to <italic>rad57∆ sfr1∆</italic>, strongly suggesting that the defect associated with <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> is related to Rad55-Rad57.</p><p>Immunoblotting experiments revealed that the level of Rad51-E206A was comparable to wild-type Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that the DNA repair defect of <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> is not caused by reduced protein stability. Previous yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis suggested that Rad51 physically interacts with Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hays et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Symington, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, a feasible explanation for the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> is that the E206A mutation disrupts the physical interaction between Rad51 and Rad55-Rad57. To test this, a sequence encoding 12 copies of the V5 epitope was fused to <italic>rad55<sup>+</sup></italic> at its native locus, yielding the <italic>rad55-12xV5</italic> strain. This strain was as resistant to DNA damage as the untagged wild type (<italic>rad55<sup>+</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that the tag does not interfere with the function of Rad55-Rad57 in DNA repair. In vivo co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed in both <italic>sfr1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>sfr1∆</italic> backgrounds. While robust signal was observed for wild-type Rad51, substantially less Rad51-E206A was seen to co-IP with Rad55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that the E206A mutation impairs Rad51–Rad55-Rad57 complex formation. The presence of Sfr1 did not have an effect on complex formation, irrespective of the E206A mutation. These results suggest that the DNA repair defect associated with <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> is related to impaired Rad51–Rad55-Rad57 complex formation and that the suppression of this DNA damage sensitivity by Swi5-Sfr1 is not through enhancing physical binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rad51-E206A retains normal recombinase activity and can be stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1</title><p>Although E206 does not belong to a canonical motif involved in ATP hydrolysis or DNA binding, it remained formally possible that the E206A mutation impaired the enzymatic activity of Rad51.

Following strand transfer over the length of the dsDNA substrate, JMs are converted into nicked-circular dsDNA molecules (NCs), which are the products in this assay.

This allowed us to evaluate whether the E206A mutation impaired the intrinsic strand exchange activity of Rad51.

However, because the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>rad51-EED</italic> is similar to that of <italic>rad51∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which clearly exceeds that of <italic>rad57∆</italic>, it seemed likely that the function of the PAP is not restricted to Rad55-Rad57–dependent DNA repair. To directly test if the PAP is involved in Rad55-Rad57–independent DNA repair, PAP mutants were introduced into the <italic>rad57∆</italic> background. The <italic>rad51-E205A</italic> mutant was as resistant to DNA damage as <italic>rad51<sup>+</sup></italic> in the absence of Rad57, suggesting that Rad55-Rad57–independent DNA repair mechanisms are not impaired in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). By contrast, <italic>rad51-EE</italic> showed a modest increase in sensitivity compared to <italic>rad51<sup>+</sup>. rad51-D209A</italic> was even more sensitive than <italic>rad51-EE</italic>, although this sensitivity was still not as severe as <italic>rad51-EED</italic> and <italic>rad51∆</italic>. Consistently, <italic>rad51-EED</italic> and <italic>rad51∆</italic> were the only strains among this set that showed a clear slow-growth phenotype (note the small colony size on the ‘No treatment’ plate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The fact that the D209A and EE mutations further sensitized <italic>rad57∆</italic> cells to DNA damage, combined with the severe sensitivity of <italic>rad51-EED</italic>, suggests that Rad55-Rad57–independent DNA repair is also impaired in these mutants. These results imply that the PAP is also relevant to the function of auxiliary factors other than Rad55-Rad57 (explored below).</p><p>If the negativity of the PAP is important for Rad51-dependent DNA repair, we reasoned that a charge-reversal mutation would be more disruptive than the Asp/Glu-to-Ala mutations employed thus far. The E205A and E206A mutations did not sensitize cells to DNA damage in the presence of both Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, because E206 shows a higher degree of conservation than E205, it was mutated to Lys, yielding the <italic>rad51-E206K</italic> strain. In stark contrast to the <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> strain, <italic>rad51-E206K</italic> showed a clear slow-growth phenotype and was as sensitive to DNA damage as <italic>rad51∆</italic> in the presence of both Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), just like <italic>rad51-EED</italic>.

These results indicate that PAP mutations do not impair the potentiation of Rad51 by Swi5-Sfr1, leading us to conclude that the severe DNA damage sensitivity of the <italic>rad51-EED</italic> strain is unlikely to be due to a defect in the interaction with Swi5-Sfr1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The PAP is important for the interaction of Rad51 with both Rad52 and Rad54</title><p>While a defect in the interaction with Rad54 could explain the severity of DNA damage sensitivity observed for <italic>rad51-EED</italic>, this is unlikely to be the cause of the sensitivity as <italic>rad54∆</italic> is not defective in the recruitment of Rad51 to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the remaining possibility that could account for the phenotypes of <italic>rad51-EED</italic> is that the EED mutation impairs the interaction of Rad51 with Rad52. To examine whether Rad51-Rad52 complex formation was affected by PAP mutations, in vivo co-IP experiments were performed.

Biochemical reconstitutions suggested that Rad51-EED is not intrinsically defective and retains a functional interaction with Swi5-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Remarkably, the EED mutation was found to abrogate the interaction of Rad51 with Rad52 and impair the interaction with Rad54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results indicate that the PAP, a novel motif of Rad51, is critically important for the interaction with Rad55-Rad57, Rad52, and Rad54. We propose that the PAP is a fundamental motif commonly utilized by recombination auxiliary factors to potentiate Rad51.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The PAP of Rad51 is an evolutionarily conserved motif that is integral to recombinational DNA repair</title><p>E205, E206, and D209 were found to form the PAP on the exterior of the Rad51-ssDNA filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Individual mutations within the PAP impaired DNA repair to differing extents. D209A had the highest penetrance, whereas E206A, and to a much lesser extent E205A, conferred sensitivity only in the <italic>sfr1∆</italic> background, where DNA repair is strictly dependent on Rad55-Rad57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These genetic data are consistent with the notion that the PAP is more relevant to the function of Rad55-Rad57 than Swi5-Sfr1. When both Glu residues were mutated to Ala (<italic>rad51-EE</italic>), moderate DNA damage sensitivity was observed even in the presence of both Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1; this synergism implies that the functions of E205 and E206 are related, and that the ability of Sfr1 to suppress the DNA damage sensitivity conferred by E206A is partially dependent on E205. Moreover, mutating all three residues to Ala (<italic>rad51-EED)</italic> completely abolished Rad51-dependent DNA repair. The additive effect of combining mutations suggests that the overall negativity of the PAP is important for its function. This is bolstered by the finding that the replacement of E206 with a positively charged Lys residue is highly disruptive, phenocopying the neutralization of all three residues via Ala mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, while all three residues are relevant to PAP function, there appears to be a hierarchy: D209A is more important than E206, which itself is more important than E205. This suggests that the closer a residue is to the C-terminal end of the α-helix (top of the helix in our structural models), the more important it is for PAP function (discussed below).</p><p>Negatively charged regions were seen in the equivalent α-helices of both <italic>Sc</italic>Rad51 and <italic>Hs</italic>Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), indicating structural conservation of the PAP. Furthermore, sequence alignments suggest that the PAP is widely conserved among eukaryotes, with residues E206 and D209 each showing conservation in seven-out-of-eight eukaryotic Rad51 orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, examination of a structural model revealed conservation of the PAP in Dmc1, the meiosis-specific RecA-family recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The archaeal RadA polymer also exhibited substantial structural conservation of the PAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). By contrast, this region showed poor sequence conservation in bacterial RecA, and although a short α-helix at the equivalent position appeared to exist in the RecA monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>), a loop was seen instead in the RecA-ssDNA filament structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, despite this region being negatively charged, this was partially due to the close proximity of residues E32 and D33 from the adjacent RecA monomer. We interpret these analyses to mean that the PAP is conserved in eukaryotic Rad51/Dmc1 and archaeal RadA, but not in bacterial RecA. While the mediator and ssDNA annealing activities of Rad52 are provided by RecFOR in bacteria, only eukaryotes and archaea also possess recombinase paralogs and Rad54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zelensky et al., 2014</xref>). We postulate that the PAP may have evolved in organisms where the RecA-family recombinase is potentiated by multiple distinct auxiliary factors. Consistently, it is notable that Dmc1 is subjected to extensive regulation by auxiliary factors: Swi5-Sfr1, Hop2-Mnd1, and Rdh54 simulate Dmc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haruta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsubouchi et al., 2020</xref>); and Rad52 has been proposed to inhibit Dmc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murayama et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The PAP plays a central role in the interaction of Rad51 with recombination auxiliary factors</title><p>The PAP-containing α-helix precedes a β-strand that is critically important for Rad51 polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellegrini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conway et al., 2004</xref>). This β-strand is involved in facilitating interactions with the FxxA consensus sequence within the inter-domain linker of the adjacent monomer (corresponding to <sup>108</sup>FTTA<sup>111</sup> in <italic>Sp</italic>Rad51). The Phe residue of the adjacent monomer inserts into a hydrophobic pocket above the β-strand, which stabilizes inter-subunit contacts. Because some auxiliary factors that contain the FxxA motif employ Rad51 mimicry to interact with Rad51, FxxA has been proposed to function as a Rad51 interaction motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellegrini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2003</xref>). Neither Swi5 nor Sfr1 contain the FxxA consensus sequence and we recently identified two non-FxxA sites within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal half of Sfr1 that are responsible for the binding of Swi5-Sfr1 to Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Argunhan et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, both Rad57 (<sup>145</sup>FELA<sup>148</sup>) and Rad52 (<sup>17</sup>FNTA<sup>20</sup> and <sup>338</sup>FISA<sup>341</sup>) contain the FxxA consensus sequence, as does Rad54 (<sup>804</sup>FIRA<sup>807</sup>). Rad55 does not contain an FxxA motif, and notably, Y2H analysis suggested that Rad51 interacts with Rad57 but not Rad55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsutsui et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, Y2H analysis mapped the minimal <italic>Sp</italic>Rad51-interacting domain of Rad52 to a C-terminal fragment (310-469) containing the <sup>338</sup>FISA<sup>341</sup> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2002</xref>), and mutation of the corresponding Phe residue to Ala in <italic>Sc</italic>Rad52 (F349A) completely abrogated its binding to Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that Rad52 employs the FxxA motif to bind Rad51.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that neutralization of the PAP impairs the interaction with Rad55-Rad57, Rad52, and Rad54, while the interaction with Swi5-Sfr1 is mostly unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that the PAP has some role in facilitating the interaction with Swi5-Sfr1, but a simple inference that can be drawn from these results is that the PAP is particularly important for auxiliary factors that employ Rad51 mimicry to modulate Rad51. The close proximity of the PAP to the Phe residue within the FxxA motif of the adjacent monomer—C<sub>α</sub>-C<sub>α</sub> distances for PAP residues and <italic>Sp</italic>Rad51-F108 are predicted to be 13.0 Å (D209), 17.3 Å (E206), and 17.5 Å (E205)—means it would be well-placed to influence interactions with auxiliary factors that employ Rad51 mimicry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We speculate that this may be the mechanism through which the PAP exerts its effects on Rad51 potentiation. Since the negative charge of the PAP is important for recombinational DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), it is likely that the PAP participates in electrostatic interactions that are important for the modulation of Rad51 by these auxiliary factors, which may utilize the PAP as a landing pad to facilitate FxxA insertion. We anticipate that a basic patch may exist that is close in three-dimensional space to the FxxA motif of each auxiliary factor, and this basic patch may be critically important for interacting with the PAP and facilitating the binding to Rad51. Interestingly, Y2H analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2002</xref> isolated several other mutations in <italic>Sp</italic>Rad51 (G177S, C179F, G282D, and L274P) that disrupt the interaction with Rad52, and these residues are also in reasonably close proximity to F108 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Notably, the G177S and C179F mutations also impaired the interaction with Rad54. Moreover, the C179F mutation even abrogated the interaction with Rad57 and the self-association of Rad51. Given the close proximity of G177 and C179 to the PAP (C<sub>α</sub>-C<sub>α</sub>9–12 Å), it is possible that mutation of these residues affects PAP function and/or F108 insertion. These Y2H results are consistent with our proposal that multiple auxiliary factors interact with Rad51 via a mechanism involving the PAP.</p><p>PAP mutations impaired complex formation with Rad55-Rad57 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>), but even in <italic>rad51-EED</italic>, complex formation was not completely abolished. By contrast, while formation of the Rad51-Rad52 complex was mostly unaffected by mutation of only the Glu residues within the PAP, the D209A mutation led to a marked reduction in complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the PAP as a whole is important, the EED mutation completely abrogated Rad51-Rad52 complex formation. Co-IP experiments with purified proteins directly demonstrated that the interaction of Rad51 with both Rad52 and Rad54 is facilitated by the PAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Performing such experiments with Rad55-Rad57 awaits the purification of this biochemically intractable complex.</p><p>If multiple auxiliary factors utilize the same motif to potentiate Rad51, they would be expected to compete for Rad51 binding. However, because auxiliary factors perform non-overlapping roles in HR, the requirement for binding Rad51 is likely to be temporally distinct, with Rad52 being the most upstream binding partner, followed by Rad55-Rad57, then Rad54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sugawara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament contains as many PAP motifs as there are monomers in the filament, providing ample opportunities for auxiliary factors to bind Rad51 in a non-competitive manner. Notably, the PAP is important for interactions with auxiliary factors involved in both the early (Rad52 and Rad55-Rad57) and late (Rad54) stages of DNA strand exchange, indicating that the PAP is integral to the role of Rad51 in HR. Further research is needed to examine the temporospatial coordination of Rad51 binding, especially in light of the finding that some auxiliary factors such as Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1 interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Argunhan et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>rad51-E206A</italic> uncovers insights into the interplay between Rad55-Rad57 and Swi5-Sfr1</title><p>Substantial genetic analysis suggests that the defects of <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> stem specifically from an impairment in the interaction with Rad55-Rad57.

Interestingly, the <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> mutant was proficient for DNA repair in the presence of Sfr1, but completely defective in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). This suppression did not occur through enhancing Rad51–Rad55-Rad57 complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that Swi5-Sfr1 can functionally compensate for defects in the physical association of Rad51 with Rad55-Rad57. Swi5-Sfr1 may function in a contingency capacity for Rad55-Rad57 such that a moderate reduction in Rad51–Rad55-Rad57 complex formation does not affect DNA repair as long as Swi5-Sfr1 is present.

The lysate was recovered, and the glass beads were washed with 200 µL of KA50 buffer and combined with the lysate. The lysate was then treated with 250 units of TurboNuclease (Accelagen) for 30 min at 4°C with mixing. The lysate was then sequentially cleared (20,000 g, 10 min, 2°C; then 20,000 g, 5 min, 2°C), a sample was taken for immunoblotting (input) and mixed with an equal volume of 2x SDS loading buffer (120 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% BPB, 200 mM DTT), and the remaining soluble cell extract was divided into three equal aliquots in protein Lo-Bind tubes (Eppendorf). Anti-V5 (mouse; MCA1360 Bio-Rad), anti-Rad51 (rabbit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haruta et al., 2006</xref>), or ChromPure Human IgG (mock antibody; 009-000-003 Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) antibodies were premixed with Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with each aliquot of soluble cell extract with gentle mixing (3 hr, 4°C). Aqueous fractions were separated using a magnetic stand and the beads were briefly washed with buffer KA50 (300 µL, x3). The beads were then resuspended in 75 µL of 1x SDS loading buffer and proteins were eluted using a thermomixer (IP; 65°C 10 min 1300 RPM). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes and detected with the following antibodies: anti-V5, mouse (1:10,000; Bio-Rad); anti-Rad51, rat (1:10,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Argunhan et al., 2020</xref>); anti-Rad52, rabbit (1:5,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2008</xref>); and anti-Tubulin, mouse (1:10,000, T5168 Sigma-Aldrich). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare (mouse, 1:5000, NA931; rabbit, 1:5,000, NA934) or Jackson Immunoresearch Labs (rat, 1:10,000, 712-035-153). FIJI software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) was used for quantification of in vivo IPs. Briefly, background subtraction was performed by the rolling ball method and the signal for IP’d and co-IP’d protein was quantified. The co-IP’d signal was then divided by the IP’d signal and expressed relative to wild type. Graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism (version 8).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Protein purification</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) RIPL strain was used for purification of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rad51, RPA, Swi5-Sfr1, and Rad52.

The study succeeds of identifying Rad51 interaction sites with these factors, where earlier studies in budding yeast failed. The combined genetic, biochemical, and cytological analysis of the mutants is both insightful and compelling. The authors can exclude a potential artifact that the interaction mutants affect protein structure/function in a more trivial manner. The insights will have significant impact on the thinking how the Rad51-ssDNA filament coordinates the interactions with its key interaction partners, Rad52, Rad54, and Rad55-Rad57. The manuscript stands on its own without further experimentation. Acceptance depends on the points listed below, which ask for clarifications and explanations. The authors may want to consider two points (#1, 2) about experimental controls that can be easily addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Potential experimental addition: Figure 7A: Please show the immunoblot comparing wild type with <italic>rad52Δ</italic> to prove that the labeled band is indeed Rad52 protein.</p><p>2) Potential experimental addition: Figure 7C: Is the result of the reduced <italic>rad51-EED:Rad54</italic> reproducible and significant? Quantitation of several independent experiments would be better here.</p><p>3) Are the molecular &quot;models&quot; (e.g., Figure 1) based on physical determination (X-ray crystallography or cryoEM, for example), or are they computational models based on other known structures? This should be clarified.</p><p>4) The use of <italic>rqh1Δ</italic> in Figure 2D should be explained. Is it more sensitive to HU than wt, and if so, why? Why does <italic>rad51Δ</italic> weakly, and <italic>rad51-E206A</italic> or <italic>sfr1Δ</italic> strongly, suppress that sensitivity? While this assay shows the deduced interactions of Rad51-E206A with Rad57 and Sfr1, knowing the basis of this assay would help.</p><p>5) It's unclear what part of Rad55-57 etc. binds to the PAP. Is there a &quot;basic patch&quot; on it? Is the FxxA motif thought to bind the PAP? If so, how? (I'd expect FxxA to bind a hydrophobic patch.) Similarly for Rad52 and Rad54.</p><p>6) Further explanation of the strand exchange assays (Figures 3, 6, and 7) would help. What is limiting in these assays (e.g., subsection “Rad51-E206A retains normal recombinase activity and can be stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1”)? Why do the results for Rad51-E206A in Figure 3E differ from those in Figure 3F? Why is the concentration of Rad51 (etc.) different in panels E and F of Figure 3?</p><p>7) Is the anti-Rad51 antibody (subsection “The PAP is crucial for the recruitment of Rad51 to DNA damage sites”) mono- or polyclonal? Does it bind the mutant Rad51-EED protein? Without knowing it binds the mutant, interpreting the data is hard.</p><p>8) In the subsection “Rad51-EED retains intrinsic recombinase activity and can be stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1”, does Rad51-E206K interfere with Swi5-Sfr1 binding or action? Perhaps PAP is important for that interaction, and this stronger mutation might block it.</p><p>9) In the subsection “The PAP plays a central role in the interaction of Rad51 with recombination auxiliary factors”, it says PAP is close to the Phe of FxxA, but later says 13 – 18 Angstroms. This does not seem &quot;close,&quot; because it is about 1/3 of the distance across a Rad51 molecule. Is there evidence that amino acids interact over such a distance?</p><p>10) Which nuclease was used in the experiments in Figures 2, 4, and 7?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64131.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Potential experimental addition: Figure 7A: Please show the immunoblot comparing wild type with rad52Δ to prove that the labeled band is indeed Rad52 protein.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment has now been included as Figure 7—figure supplement 1A. The band that migrates slightly faster than the 60 kDa size marker is the only band that is not observed in the <italic>rad52∆</italic> strain. The positions of relevant size markers have also been indicated in Figure 7A to allow a more meaningful comparison with this control experiment. A brief description of this has been added to the legend for Figure 7. Please note that the intensities of the nonspecific bands relative to Rad52 are slightly different in Figure 7A and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A. This is because the former is a sample of soluble protein extract whereas the latter is the whole-cell extract prepared by TCA precipitation. We have also seen that the relative intensities of these bands can vary depending on the extent of blocking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Potential experimental addition: Figure 7C: Is the result of the reduced rad51-EED:Rad54 reproducible and significant? Quantitation of several independent experiments would be better here.</p></disp-quote><p>The Rad54-Rad51 co-IP experiment has now been performed in triplicate and quantified. As shown in Figure 7C, the reduced interaction observed for Rad51-EED is reproducible and statistically significant. By contrast, the interaction of Rad51-E206A with Rad54 is comparable to wild type. The description of these results has been updated (subsection “The PAP is important for the interaction of Rad51 with both Rad52 and Rad54”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Are the molecular &quot;models&quot; (e.g., Figure 1) based on physical determination (X-ray crystallography or cryoEM, for example), or are they computational models based on other known structures?

This has now been clearly stated in the text (subsection “E205, E206, and D209 comprise a protruding acidic patch (PAP) on the exterior of the Rad51 presynaptic filament”). In addition, all figures containing molecular models now have a small annotation specifying whether the model is a homology model, derived from cryo-EM, or derived from X-ray crystallography. Further details are also available in the Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of rqh1Δ in Figure 2D should be explained. Is it more sensitive to HU than wt, and if so, why? Why does rad51Δ weakly, and rad51-E206A or sfr1Δ strongly, suppress that sensitivity? While this assay shows the deduced interactions of Rad51-E206A with Rad57 and Sfr1, knowing the basis of this assay would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this oversight to our attention. We have now included a more detailed explanation of the basis behind the <italic>rqh1∆</italic> experiment, including two additional references (subsection “Rad51-E206A is specifically defective in the interaction with Rad55-Rad57”). Briefly, toxic HR intermediates can accumulate in the absence of Rqh1. Mutations that impair HR suppress the production of these intermediates to differing extents. Those that mildly impair HR (i.e., <italic>rad57∆, sfr1∆, rad51-E206A</italic>) strongly suppress the sensitivity to HU by reducing the formation of these toxic intermediates. While mutations that severely impair HR (i.e., <italic>rad51∆, rad52∆, rad54∆, rad57∆ sfr1∆</italic>) also reduce the formation of these toxic intermediates, they also abolish (or nearly abolish) HR itself, leading to HU sensitivity and reduced suppression of <italic>rqh1∆</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It's unclear what part of Rad55-57 etc. binds to the PAP. Is there a &quot;basic patch&quot; on it? Is the FxxA motif thought to bind the PAP? If so, how? (I'd expect FxxA to bind a hydrophobic patch.) Similarly for Rad52 and Rad54.</p></disp-quote><p>Evidently, the explanation of our model was inadequate. We apologise for the confusion this may have caused. We completely agree that the FxxA motif of each auxiliary factor would be expected to interact with a hydrophobic region. In fact, we expect that FxxA would insert into the same hydrophobic pocket employed by Rad51 itself. We did not mean to suggest that the PAP of Rad51 would bind to the FxxA motif of each auxiliary factor. Rather, we propose that a basic patch close to the FxxA motif of each auxiliary factor would bind to the PAP through electrostatic interactions, which would then facilitate the insertion of the FxxA motif of an auxiliary factor into the hydrophobic pocket of Rad51. This is also related to point (9). We employed the Rad51 filament model—in which the FxxA motif of one Rad51 monomer inserts into the hydrophobic pocket of the adjacent monomer—as a proxy for how we envision an auxiliary factor might bind to Rad51 via Rad51 mimicry (Figure 7E). When we stated that the PAP is in close proximity to the FxxA motif (13-18 Å), we did not mean that the PAP could directly interact with FxxA over such distances. Instead, we infer that the PAP is well-placed to bind positively charged regions that are close in 3D space to the FxxA motif of auxiliary factors. We speculate that the PAP functions as a landing pad, which perhaps facilitates the orientation of auxiliary factors or functions as a scaffold to promote FxxA insertion. We have now revised the relevant section of the Discussion and hope this has improved clarity.</p><p>Related to this, we also included a reference to a highly complementary paper with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins showing that mutation of the Phe residue in the FxxA motif of Rad52 disrupts the interaction with Rad51 (Kagawa et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Further explanation of the strand exchange assays (Figures 3, 6, and 7) would help. What is limiting in these assays (e.g., subsection “Rad51-E206A retains normal recombinase activity and can be stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1”)? Why do the results for Rad51-E206A in Figure 3E differ from those in Figure 3F? Why is the concentration of Rad51 (etc.) different in panels E and F of Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>For each assay, we have now clearly stated that the conditions may differ between figures and have included an explanation of why we employed each condition (Results). Unlike <italic>Sc</italic>Rad51, <italic>Sp</italic>Rad51 does not efficiently promote JM/NC formation in the three-strand exchange assay even when the order-of-addition is favourable, making it difficult to compare the intrinsic strand exchange activity of wild-type Rad51 with mutants. We were able to partially overcome this problem by increasing the concentration of substrate (3x ssDNA, 3x Rad51, 2x dsDNA, x is relative to our standard reaction condition [Haruta et al., 2006; Kurokawa et al., 2008]; Figure 3E). We were later able to circumvent this problem entirely by utilizing a shorter dsDNA substrate (Figure 6B). In order to more clearly examine the effect of Swi5-Sfr1 (Figures 3F, 6D), we revert to the standard reaction condition in which Rad51 alone is unable to form JM/NC, as this provides a cleaner comparison between ± Swi5-Sfr1. For Rad54, we again employ a condition where wild-type Rad51 alone does not show any activity (Figure 7D). However, in this case, we modify the concentrations of substrate slightly since we have to employ the short dsDNA substrate (the full-length substrate yields high-molecular weight species that likely arise from a single ssDNA molecule engaging multiple dsDNA molecules, as previously reported with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rad54 [Petukhova et al., 1998; Solinger et al., 2001]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is the anti-Rad51 antibody (subsection “The PAP is crucial for the recruitment of Rad51 to DNA damage sites”) mono- or polyclonal? Does it bind the mutant Rad51-EED protein? Without knowing it binds the mutant, interpreting the data is hard.</p></disp-quote><p>The anti-Rad51 antibody is polyclonal, thus it is highly unlikely that three amino acid substitutions would significantly impact its affinity for Rad51. Consistent with this notion, we did not see a difference in the ability of the antibody to recognize purified Rad51-EED in immunoblotting experiments (e.g., Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the subsection “Rad51-EED retains intrinsic recombinase activity and can be stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1”, does Rad51-E206K interfere with Swi5-Sfr1 binding or action? Perhaps PAP is important for that interaction, and this stronger mutation might block it.</p></disp-quote><p>We purified Rad51-E206K and examined the physical interaction with purified Swi5-Sfr1. Similar to Rad51-EED, we saw a reproducible reduction in the co-IP of Rad51-E206K with Swi5-Sfr1, but this reduction was relatively subtle (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). A description of this result has been included in the revised manuscript (subsection “Rad51-EED retains intrinsic recombinase activity and can be stimulated by Swi5-Sfr1”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the subsection “The PAP plays a central role in the interaction of Rad51 with recombination auxiliary factors”, it says PAP is close to the Phe of FxxA, but later says 13 – 18 Angstroms. This does not seem &quot;close,&quot; because it is about 1/3 of the distance across a Rad51 molecule. Is there evidence that amino acids interact over such a distance?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point (5) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Which nuclease was used in the experiments in Figures 2, 4, and 7?</p></disp-quote><p>The commercial name of the nuclease is described in the Materials and methods (TurboNuclease from Accelagen). This is a benzonase-like endonuclease that non-specifically targets both ssDNA and dsDNA. The manufacturer does not call it benzonase, probably for proprietary reasons, although it is essentially marketed as a cheaper alternative to benzonase. We have added the “benzonase-like” descriptor to each figure legend containing in vivo IP results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
