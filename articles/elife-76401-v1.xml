Over the past decades, microbiome has gained explosive interest across disciplines from both academia and industry. To date, most efforts have focused on species cataloging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliverio et al., 2018</xref>), composition-phenotype association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhernakova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>) and microbiome-environment correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahram et al., 2018</xref>). These efforts yielded invaluable insights into ecosystem structure and function, reinforcing the need for microbiome research. Moving forward, an overarching goal is to dissect microbiome causation and mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischbach, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, required to be uncovered are the causes of specific microbiome traits and underlying mechanisms that drive the emergence of these traits. Tackling this challenge is important, because it will help to understand community structure and dynamics, predict the impacts of microbiome on habitats and design interventions for modulating ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skelly et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To achieve the goal, one promising path is to dissect the metabolic underpinnings of members constituting a microbiome. Metabolism is a defining cellular process through which microbes acquire nutrient and energy; thus, its characteristics determine the growth of individual species. Through metabolism, cells also produce substances that are beneficial or deleterious to the growth of other species. Additionally, metabolism is often accompanied with the production of biomolecules that are bioactive to habitats (e.g. human, soil, and plant). These molecules directly affect habitats, for instance, short-chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiome shape the immune function and brain behavior of human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalile et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, they may remodel the physiochemical properties of the habitats, through which microbiome realizes indirect functional modulation. For example, extracellular polysaccharides secreted by probiotic bacteria trigger biofilm formation in the gastrointestinal tract, which promotes the hostâ resistance to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lebeer et al., 2011</xref>). Thereby, targeting microbial metabolic underpinnings offers a systematic route to decode microbiome composition and function.</p><p>The pursuit of this path is, however, hindered by the intrinsic, remarkable complexity of native ecologies. For instance, the human gut microbiome consists of over 1000 species and 100 trillion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qin et al., 2010</xref>) a teaspoon of healthy soil contains over 10,000 taxa members totaling up to 1 billion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). To circumvent the challenge, researchers have recently turned to microbiome cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shade and Handelsman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Risely, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hernandez-Agreda et al., 2017</xref>), simplified communities that are abstracted from native ecosystems but retaining their key structural and functional characteristics. Supporting the notion, studies have revealed a core gut microbiome across human population regardless of body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, across soda lakes separated in distance, there is a collection of common microbes with similar structural patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zorz et al., 2019</xref>). These simplified systems are approximations of native communities, providing a powerful alternative to study complex ecosystems.</p><p>Here, we hypothesize to interrogate metabolic underpinnings of minimal cores as a causal and mechanistic strategy to elucidate microbiome structure and function. To test the hypothesis, we adopted the kombucha tea (KT) microbiome as our model ecosystem. Commonly called a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeasts (SCOBY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soares et al., 2021</xref>), the microbiome drives the fermentation of KT, a slightly sweet, acidic beverage with multiple health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jayabalan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Villarreal-Soto et al., 2018</xref>). During the fermentation, the microbiome also produces floating pellicles at the air-liquid interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laavanya et al., 2021</xref>). Compared to microbial ecologies in the soil and the human body, the KT microbiome is relatively simple in composition, easy to cultivate and amendable for quantification. Additionally, it involves species that are well characterized and feasible for perturbations. In fact, food microbiomes including those in kefir grain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blasche et al., 2021</xref>), cheese rind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosetta and Wolfe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pierce et al., 2021</xref>), wine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melkonian et al., 2019</xref>), and kimchi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2019</xref>) have been lately exploited as tractable platforms for studying community diversity, succession, and niche partition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolfe and Dutton, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our specific research started by characterizing the composition and metabolite patterns of the microbiome from commercially available KT drinks. We then used isolates to assemble 25 two-species consortia from which a minimal core was identified. Temporal fermentation showed that the core was convergent in its population composition, coordinated on temporal patterns of metabolites and capable of pellicle formation. Through comprehensive culturing of individual species under defined substrates, we obtained a casual and mechanistic understanding for the observed structural and functional traits of the core. We further showed that the knowledge from the core was translatable to account for the properties of communities with increased complexity and altered conditions. Together, our work illustrates the pattern and process underlying the composition and function of the KT microbiome, providing a promising conceptual framework for mechanistic investigation of microbiome behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the native KT microbiome</title><p>We set out to identify key structural and functional traits of the KT microbiome by performing fermentations with commercially available SCOBYs and black tea substrate supplemented with 50 g/L of sucrose (Materials and methods).

The bacteria and fungi also exhibited different context dependences: the composition of the former could vary significantly between the broth and pellicle of a single KT sample, such as samples A and C (AB (sample Aâs broth) vs. AP (sample Aâs pellicle), CB vs. CP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); by contrast, the composition of the latter remained consistent across broth and pellicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, for bacteria, <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> was the overall most predominant genus across samples and other genera were prevalent only in selected cases. For example, <italic>Acetobacter</italic> was prevalent in BB and BP, <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> was dominant in AB and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was predominant in CB. For fungi, <italic>Brettanomyces</italic> was predominant in all samples but, in samples B and C, <italic>Pichia</italic> and <italic>Zygosaccharomyces</italic> were also widespread. Thus, bacteria and fungi both served as constituting members of the microbiome, with <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> and <italic>Brettanomyces</italic> being the dominant bacterial and fungal genus accordingly. This compositional pattern was consistent with previous reports although <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was typically low in abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Villarreal-Soto et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, we quantified the biochemical characteristics of KT broths, including pH, sugars, acids, and tea-derived substances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The final pH values of samples A, B, D were around 3.6 while the pH of sample C was 2.8, all of which were in the reported range of a matured KT safe for human consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardoso et al., 2020</xref>). The sucrose concentration dropped from 50 g/L to 30â40 g/L except for sample C whose sucrose was depleted. There were also trace amounts of glucose and fructose except for sample C containing a high level of the sugars. Acetate, gluconate, and glucuronate were also detected, among which acetate had the highest concentration. Again, sample C was the outlier with a much higher level of acids. Since the concentration of gluconate was relatively low in our experiment and varied greatly across previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jayabalan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coton et al., 2017</xref>), we would not consider it as a characteristic metabolite. The fermentation also resulted in the accumulation of ethanol (~0.5 g/L for samples A, B, and D and 4.4 g/L for sample C). Two tea-derived compounds, polyphenol and flavonoid, were abundant (~30 g/L and ~50 g/L respectively). To reveal how these metabolites correlate with microbial composition, we performed redundancy analysis over the four samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, because bacterial and fungal species were calculated separately during the amplicon sequencing, we separated the analysis of microbe-metabolite correlation for bacteria and fungi accordingly. Nevertheless, the results showed that acetate, ethanol, glucose, and fructose are co-localized with each other but oppositely located compared to sucrose, polyphenol, and flavonoid are close to each other but remote from all other metabolites, and these metabolites have different KT microbiome samples close by, suggesting there are intrinsic correlations among metabolites and between metabolites and microbes.</p><p>From the above results, we drew three traits as the defining characteristics of the KT microbiome: first, it involves both bacteria and yeasts; second, it consumes sucrose with the synthesis of acetate, ethanol and a low level of glucose and fructose as the primary extracellular metabolites; third, it results in pellicle formation. These traits serve as the criteria for the identification of a proper microbiome core.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selection of a minimal core for the KT microbiome</title><p>To develop a correct core that recapitulates the native microbiome, we isolated a series of strains from the KT samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>).

Guided by the criterium that the KT microbiome contains both bacteria and fungi, we performed combinatorial mixing of the selected isolates, resulting in 25 two-species minimal core candidates with each involving one bacterial and one fungal species. To determine whether these candidates resemble the native, we conducted KT fermentation with these candidates and their corresponding 10 monocultures and, subsequently, quantified their microbial composition, extracellular metabolites and pellicle formation (Materials and methods).</p><p>From colony forming units (CFU) counting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>), we found the bacterial and fungal species coexisted in all co-cultures as in the native KT microbiome. Additionally, in most cases, bacteria and yeasts had comparable relative abundances (&lt;10 folds of difference) except for the combinations B<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>3</sub> and B<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>3</sub> whereby the bacteria were 100 times less than the yeast, suggesting these two combinations might not be the best candidates. For monocultures, the bacteria showed highly variable CFU while the yeasts yielded comparable CFU, indicating that bacteria varied greatly in sucrose utilization while yeasts were all stably capable.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Population and metabolic quantification of two-species core candidates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Colony forming units (CFU) counting of 25 two-species core candidates and 10 monoculture controls upon fermentation.

The convergence of composition in both broth and pellicle suggested that there were underlying forces that drove and stabilized community population dynamics.</p><p>Additionally, we quantified the temporal biochemical characteristics of the KT broth. Strikingly, although initial population ratios were varied across four orders of magnitude, each of the variables including pH, sugars, acids and tea-derived chemicals converged onto its own consensus pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâL</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3âsource data 2</xref>), akin to the convergence of composition in broth and pellicle. Specifically, regardless of the initial population composition, the pH dropped from 5.0 to 3.5 through fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which was associated with continuous sucrose reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Throughout the process, glucose remained at a low level (~0.1 g/L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) while fructose was relatively higher with a pulse-like profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

As the starting carbon source, sucrose alone was not degradable by B<sub>2</sub> as shown in panel 1 (abbreviated as P1) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> but consumable by Y<sub>1</sub> with the production of a trace amount of glucose and fructose, ethanol accumulation, pH reduction and biomass growth (P16). Sucrose also showed weak hydrolysis in the presence of ethanol or acetate, which increased microbial survival (P6,7). Glucose and fructose were produced from sucrose hydrolysis primarily by Y<sub>1</sub> (16) and minorly by ethanol and acetate (P6,7). Glucose was efficiently utilized by B<sub>2</sub> for growth (P2) and by Y<sub>1</sub> with biomass and ethanol accumulation (P17). Fructose was consumable for Y<sub>1</sub> (P18), not B<sub>2</sub> (P3), with ethanol and biomass production. Fructose was also slowly converted to glucose in the presence of ethanol, which was mediated by B<sub>2</sub> probably and supported B<sub>2</sub> growth (P11). Ethanol was produced solely by Y<sub>1</sub> during the metabolism of sucrose, glucose and fructose (P16,17,18), not by B<sub>2</sub>. Although ethanol alone was unusable by B<sub>2</sub> (P4), it was consumed with glucose (P9), resulting in acetate production and pellicle formation without obvious growth benefits compared to glucose alone. It thus implied that ethanol was used an energy source for pellicle formation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Molina-RamÃ­rez et al., 2018</xref>). Ethanol was also utilized by Y<sub>1</sub> in a weak fashion to result in biomass and acetate production (P19). Acetate was produced primarily by B<sub>2</sub> in the presence of multiple substrates (P6,9,13â15), particularly when glucose and ethanol were co-present (P9,13,14). In addition to B<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub> yielded a small amount of acetate with the consumption of sucrose, glucose, fructose or ethanol (P16-19). Acetate was additionally shown to minorly promote its own production by B<sub>2</sub> (P10 vs. P2) and ethanol production by Y<sub>1</sub> (P29,30 vs. P24,26).</p><p>Using the fermentation assays, we also inferred cellular tolerance to environmental stress. Comparison of the B<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> growth dynamics in single substrates showed that the yeast was more resistant than the bacterium to chemicals including ethanol and acetate (P4,5,19,20), which is another key factor that shapes community composition and metabolism. Additionally, the assays provided insight into pellicle formation. B<sub>2</sub> monoculture was capable of pellicle production (P9,10,13,14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), whereas Y<sub>1</sub> was deficient under all conditions (P16-30). Moreover, comparison of the pellicle-forming conditions (P9,10,13,14) with single substrate conditions (P1-5) showed that efficient biofilm development required not only glucose but also ethanol or acetate as a co-substrate. Notably, although pellicle formation could occur in the presence of glucose as a sole carbon and energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masaoka et al., 1993</xref>) for certain species, at least for those we investigated, it required two substrates to produce pellicle.</p><p>The above findings were synthesized and subsequently integrated with reported metabolic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeRisi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Divol, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) into a system-level diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which involves major metabolic flows within each species, interspecies fluxes mediated by the environment, and regulatory effects from metabolites to fluxes. To illustrate its implications, we attempted to account for the observed compositional characteristics of the core. As the diagram showed, Y<sub>1</sub> breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose for its own growth, which also benefits B<sub>2</sub> by sharing glucose. Additionally, Y<sub>1</sub> secretes ethanol that is utilized by B<sub>2</sub> when glucose is present. Thus, the core possesses a commensal relationship whereby Y<sub>1</sub> provides two modes of benefits to B<sub>2</sub>. By design, such an interaction confers the stability and convergence of the ecosystem composition, thus providing a mechanistic driver for the population convergence in broth and pellicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) and echoing with previous work demonstrating that inter-population cooperation leads to stable composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Momeni et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Summary of metabolic processes underlying the core.</title><p>Black arrows refer to metabolic fluxes while brown arrows correspond to positive or negative regulatory interactions.

These findings explained the temporal growth difference that B<sub>2</sub> declined first before recovery while Y<sub>1</sub> monotonically grew since the beginning of fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>).</p><p>Toward metabolic characteristics, the population of each species is a key determinant because total extracellular metabolites are determined by the productivity of individual cells multiplied by cell populations. Thus, for the same set of microbial species, the commensal interaction-which caused the convergence of population composition-also drove the convergence of temporal profiles of substrates, pH and metabolites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-L</xref>. Additionally, although glucose and fructose were hydrolyzed simultaneously from sucrose, the former was consumed by both B<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> while the latter was useable exclusively for Y<sub>1</sub>, which resulted in a constant low level of glucose but a relatively higher level of fructose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). Moreover, utilizations of glucose and fructose were accompanied with the release of ethanol and the both sugars were derived from sucrose hydrolysis; thus, ethanol increase was anti-correlated with sucrose decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, I</xref>). Acetate was mainly produced by B<sub>2</sub> in the presence of glucose and ethanol, both of which were converted directly or indirectly from sucrose; therefore, acetate accumulation was positively associated with sucrose consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, J</xref>).</p><p>For pellicle formation, the diagram showed that B<sub>2</sub> was solely responsible for pellicle formation. Meanwhile, it was Y<sub>1</sub> that provided glucose and ethanol needed by B<sub>2</sub>. Such a cooperative relationship accounted for the findings that B<sub>2</sub> or Y<sub>1</sub> alone was deficient in pellicle formation, and it needed the co-culture instead.</p><p>Relating to the bacterium-yeast symbiosis, some previous studies reported that the microbial social interactions are commensal while others concluded to be mutual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laavanya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">May et al., 2019</xref>). To resolve this debate, we conducted experiments to examine possible benefits from B<sub>2</sub> to Y<sub>1</sub>. As certain yeasts were suggested to secret more invertase when co-cultured with cheaters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celiker and Gore, 2012</xref>), we measured the invertase activity of Y<sub>1</sub> in monoculture and in co-culture with B<sub>2</sub> but did not find significant difference between the two conditions (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We also compared the growth and metabolites of Y<sub>1</sub> in the B<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>1</sub> co-culture and in monoculture with different initial ratios; however, the results showed that B<sub>2</sub> did not affect either growth or metabolites except the increase of acetate which was produced by B<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We additionally varied the B<sub>2</sub> level while fixing Y<sub>1</sub>âs initial amount and altered Y<sub>1</sub> while maintaining the initial B<sub>2</sub>. In both settings, Y<sub>1</sub> growth was not affected by B<sub>2</sub>, and all metabolic variables, except acetate, exhibited the same patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>).

Although species composition was not directly analyzed, the similarity in patterns suggested that the core served as a good approximation of the ten-species consortium and that the knowledge from the simple core provided predictive insights into the functions of communities with an increased degree of complexity.</p><p>Meanwhile, in detail, the two ecosystems showed differences in specific profiles. In the ten-species community, the composition converged from days 0 to 6 but diverged at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), different from the continuous convergence of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Compared to the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the ten-species community also yielded different metabolic patterns: its pH dropped faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), sucrose was consumed quicker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), fructose was more sensitive to initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), ethanol accumulated faster and nonlinearly with rapid production from days 0 to 6 followed by slower increase or cease from days 6 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and acetate increased faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>We speculated that these differences arose from the variability of the metabolic capacities of members constituting the communities. To test the speculation, we repeated the fermentation with five two-species co-cultures involving B<sub>2</sub> and different yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6FâJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E-H</xref>). The results confirmed that the yeasts were highly variable in sucrose consumption with Y<sub>5</sub> being the strongest and Y<sub>3</sub> the weakest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Additionally, owing to the coordinated metabolism revealed via the core, rapid sucrose consumption by B<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>5</sub> was associated with a relatively high B<sub>2</sub> abundance, a large pulse of glucose and fructose, rapid ethanol and acetate production and quick pH drop; by contrast, weak sucrose consumption by B<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>3</sub> were accompanied with a low B<sub>2</sub> abundance, an undetectable level of glucose and fructose, abolished ethanol and acetate production, and slow pH reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6GâJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F-H</xref>). We also performed fermentation using the co-cultures of Y<sub>1</sub> with different bacterial species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6KâO</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1I-L</xref>). The five ecosystems showed a comparable sucrose consumption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>), suggesting that sucrose degradation was dictated primarily by yeast species although certain bacterial species (e.g. B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, and B<sub>5</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) could contribute. Meanwhile, the fermentations yielded varied ethanol and acetate patterns which were anti-correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N and O</xref>), suggesting that the ethanol-to-acetate conversion of the bacterial species were variable with B<sub>1</sub> being the strongest and B<sub>2</sub> the weakest.</p><p>From the above experiments, a mechanistic origin underlying the compositional and metabolic differences of the two- and ten-species communities emerged as following. Compared to the two-species core, the 10-species community had a higher overall sucrose consumption rate and a higher ethanol-to-acetate conversion rate which were averaged from the rates of the involved yeasts and bacteria. As a result, the ten-species community consumed sucrose faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which subsequently led to a higher level of fructose, ethanol and acetate as well as a faster pH reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B, D</xref>). Meanwhile, rapid sucrose degradation resulted in sucrose depletion in the middle of fermentation when the fermentation started with a high relative yeast abundance (e.g. 1:1, 1:10, 1:100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which forced the yeast to metabolize fructose and ethanol instead of producing them. Under these scenarios, ethanol had a nonlinear pattern with rapid accumulation in the first few days and a slow increase or cease from days 6 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Meanwhile, as the commensal bacteria-yeast interaction relied primarily on the yeast to breakdown sucrose to provide glucose and ethanol for the bacteria, sucrose depletion also altered the strength of the symbiosis, which consequently shaped the dynamics of population convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) because community dynamics was driven by the symbiosis.</p><p>Based on the finding that sucrose depletion shifted compositional and metabolic patterns, we hypothesized that, for the 10-species community, increasing sucrose availability could prevent sucrose depletion and hence drive its patterns closer to those of the core. We tested the hypothesis by performing the fermentation with 100 g/L sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6PâT</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1M-P</xref>). Indeed, the results showed that the microbial composition continued to converge throughout the course of fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>) instead of first convergence then divergence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. Meanwhile, the continuous sucrose reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R</xref>) was accompanied with a faster and approximately linear ethanol increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S</xref>), a lower rate of acetate accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>), and a higher level of glucose and fructose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1O, P</xref>) compared to the 50 g/L sucrose case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Notably, here the glucose and fructose patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1O, P</xref>) were still different from those of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>) because the ten-species community was much more efficient than the core for sucrose hydrolysis.</p><p>We further reasoned that the dependence of ecosystem characteristics on sucrose availability was not unique to the ten-species community and shall also apply to the two-species core. To test the reasoning, we performed the fermentation with the core using 5 g/L of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, the composition converged in the first 3 days but diverged afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) and ethanol started with linear increase initially but declined after day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2H</xref>), similar to the case of the ten-species community with 50 g/L sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, D</xref>). Conversely, when we increased the initial sucrose concentration to 100 g/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>), the compositional convergence of the core was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and the ethanol profile became continuous accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3H</xref>).</p><p>The results from the core and the 10-species community both informed that an increase in sucrose consumption results in a reduction or depletion in sucrose, an augmentation in the production of glucose, fructose, ethanol and acetate along with a reduction in environmental pH. Interestingly, such a relationship also explained the seemingly abnormal metabolite patterns of sample C, the outlier of the four native KT microbiome samples, that we observed at the beginning of our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In that regard, our findings provided the mechanistic basis to understand the variations of metabolite patterns among the original microbiome samples.</p><p>Together, our experiments demonstrated that the knowledge from the minimal core offered predictive bulky insights into the traits of communities with varied system complexity and fermentation conditions. Meanwhile, the diversity in metabolic capacities, which was caused by the increase in species richness, accounted for the differences between the patterns of complex and minimal communities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With rapid advances in species cataloging and correlation analysis, one remaining grand challenge in microbiome research is to uncover causal claims that dictate microbial composition and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischbach, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taroncher-Oldenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lv et al., 2021</xref>). In this work, we present the identification, characterization, and utilization of a minimal core for elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving the KT microbiome. We showed that metabolic underpinnings specified the structural and metabolic characteristics of the core and also provided insights into the behaviors of communities with increased complexity and altered conditions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> summarizes the overall concept and steps of our complexity-reduction approach to dissect microbiome. Lying at the heart of our study is the reduction in system complexity, which involves three key steps: identification of a core simplified from a native microbiome but capable of resembling the native, characterization of metabolic underpinnings of the core, and extrapolation of the knowledge from the core to communities with altered complexity and conditions. Such a strategy is conceptually analogous to the motif-based study of complex networks whereby core functional motifs, such as feedback loops and feed-forward regulation, are repeatedly identified as building blocks of networks and utilized to understand complex system behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon, 2007</xref>). Although this study focused exclusively on the KT microbiome, the strategy demonstrated here is not limited to the specific ecosystem. Given its systematic nature, we expect that it may be extendable to other microbial communities. In that regard, our strategy provides a promising solution to address system complexity, a major hurdle for mechanistic investigation of microbiome.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of the overall concept and steps of our complexity-reduction approach for microbiome dissection.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76401-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Notably, although minimal cores serve as attractive alternatives to complex ecosystems, they are not intended to substitute native microbiomes. With the increase of complexity, certain compositional and metabolic traits identified in a core may be altered in its native counterpart. Conversely, novel properties may emerge when species richness increases. Thus, minimal cores provide a point of entry to unlock the mechanistic behaviors of a community, which shall be followed by the analysis of the full system for systematic understanding. Meanwhile, defining a proper core is critical for successful implementation of our framework. In this study, we successfully identified and utilized a two-species consortium as the core for systematic analysis of the KT microbiome. However, such a strategy may become less straightforward for many native microbiomes, such as those in the soil and in the human gut, due to their remarkable degree of complexity and their close association with the corresponding hosts (e.g., plant and human). Additionally, the KT microbiome studied here was driven primarily by pairwise interactions, another factor that made it possible to use the two-species ecosystem as an approximate of the entire community. For those involving higher order interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billick and Case, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grilli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), microbial social interactions are much more complicated, and it needs significantly more efforts to screen and determine valid cores. In these cases, whether and to what extent a relatively simple core can be defined will depend on the specific starting microbiome, as well as the target functions of interest. In addition, a single microbiome in principle can possess multiple cores depending on different selection criteria, such as abundance, temporal pattern and function. Future efforts in these aspects are needed to fully realize the power of this community analysis strategy.</p><p>A major goal of the food industry is to improve food quality and flavor through the optimization of starter culture and fermentation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vinicius De Melo Pereira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). The synthetic core developed here successfully drove the KT fermentation, thereby serving as an effective, functional culture starter. Compared to the native microbiome, this well-defined, synthetic system offers a controllable platform to modulate the starter composition and metabolite secretion during fermentation. Therefore, the work also gives a potential solution to systematically tailor fermented foods with desired traits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fecal/soil Microbe Miniprep kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZYMO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat No./ID:D6010</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gluconic acid Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Megazyme, Ireland</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat No./ID:K-GATE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B-f</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR Primer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Forward primer used for amplifying bacterial DNA for Sanger sequencing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B-r</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR Primer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reverse primer used for amplifying bacterial DNA for Sanger sequencing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NL-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coton et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR Primer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Forward primer used for amplifying yeast DNA for Sanger sequencing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NL-4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coton et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR Primer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reverse primer used for amplifying yeast DNA for Sanger sequencing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Canoco</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Microcomputer Power, Ithaca, NY</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 5.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SIMCA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Umetricus, Sweden</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 14.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Kombucha tea fermentation</title><p>Black tea (Harney &amp; Sons Fine Teas, Millerton, NY) was purchased as the tea substrate for the fermentation.

Bacteria species included <italic>Komagataeibacter rhaeticus</italic> (B<sub>1</sub>), <italic>Komagataeibacter intermedius</italic> (B<sub>2</sub>), <italic>Gluconacetobacter europaeus</italic> (B<sub>3</sub>), <italic>Gluconobacter oxydans</italic> (B<sub>4</sub>) and <italic>Acetobacter senegalensis</italic> (B<sub>5</sub>). Yeasts included <italic>Brettanomyces bruxellensis</italic> (Y<sub>1</sub>), <italic>Zygosaccharomyces bailii</italic> (Y<sub>2</sub>), <italic>Candida sake</italic> (Y<sub>3</sub>), <italic>Lachancea fermentati</italic> (Y<sub>4</sub>) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Y<sub>5</sub>). For each pairwise co-culture, the total inoculation was as a final amount at 2*10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL and the inoculation amounts of bacteria and yeast were equal. Monoculture of each species was used as control group and the inoculation was also as a final amount at 2*10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. The cultures were then incubated at 30 Â°C, and microbial populations and biochemical parameters were measured after 10 days fermentation. To count bacteria and yeasts, 1000 Âµg/mL of natamycin or 100 mg/L chloramphenicol of was added respectively.</p><p>The B<sub>2</sub>-Y<sub>1</sub> consortium was fermented in tea liquid supplemented with 5, 50, 100 g/L sucrose individually. To characterize the consortium, B<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> were inoculated at different initial ratios from 100:1 to 10:1, 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100. The growth rates of B<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> and the B<sub>2</sub>/Y<sub>1</sub> ratio were calculated. Meanwhile, to determine the effect of Y<sub>1</sub> on B<sub>2</sub>, we performed the Y<sub>1</sub> monoculture experiment using the same inoculation amount as the B<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>1</sub> co-culture. Moreover, we fixed the inoculation of B<sub>2</sub> or Y<sub>1</sub> (1*10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) but varied the amount of the other species from 0 to 1*10<sup>4</sup>, 1*10<sup>5</sup>, 1*10<sup>6</sup>, 1*10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL. Additionally, to determine if different species differ in growth and metabolic ability, Y<sub>1</sub> was co-cultured with different bacterial species (B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>4</sub>, and B<sub>5</sub>) and B<sub>2</sub> was co-cultured with different fungal species (Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>4</sub> or Y<sub>5</sub>) in tea substrate supplemented with 50 g/L sucrose. The population dynamics and biochemical parameters were measured at 0, 3, 6, 10 days or 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10 days. To count microbes in pellicles, the pellicles were first digested by shaking for 16 hr at 4 Â°C in 15 ml of PBS buffer with 2% cellulase (Sigma Aldrich, C2730).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Monoculture fermentation with different carbon sources</title><p>To uncover the metabolic underpinnings that drive microbial population dynamics and metabolite synthesis, we conducted a series of monoculture growth experiments for B<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> using different carbon sources. Specifically, we used 10 g/L sucrose, 10 g/L fructose, 10 g/L glucose, 50 mg/L ethanol, and 2 g/L acetate for fermentation. The initial inoculation of B<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>1</sub> was 2*10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL.

In initial inoculations, all bacterial species were equally abundant, and all yeast species were also equal; however, the total bacteria-to-yeasts ratio was varied from 100:1, 10:1,1:1, 1:10, to 1:100 while fixing the total amount of inoculation (2*10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL). Two different sucrose levels, 50 and 100 g/L, were added to tea liquid for fermentation. The population dynamics and biochemical parameters were measured at 0, 3, 6, 10 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the experiments were performed for three times. Redundancy analysis between microbial community and metabolites was performed with Canoco 5.0 software (Microcomputer Power, Ithaca, NY). The hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis on different consortia were performed with the SIMCA-14.1 software (Umetricus, Sweden). For hierarchical cluster analysis, the distances between observations were calculated using Wardâs method based on the concentrations of different metabolites. Heatmaps of the chemical properties of the 25 two-species fermentations and 10 single-species fermentations were produced using the heatmap package with Z-score normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quan et al., 2019</xref>) in R.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-76401-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Amplicon sequencing data are deposited at the NCBI and available under a Bioproject ID PRJNA764354.

microbial ecology and interactions. Using the Kombucha tea (KT) microbiome as a case study, Huang et al., provide a framework for simplifying complex communities into core communities that capture aspects of complex communities. Authors demonstrated that core communities can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of how microbes interact, especially when member species are individually culturable. The work presents a fresh, novel approach for the coarse-grained analysis of complex microbiomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76401.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Shou</surname><given-names>Wenying</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Shou</surname><given-names>Wenying</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.12.475982">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.475982v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Wenying Shou as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Your revised submission must address these two points resulting from the consultative review process. For specific guidance on both points, please see the individual reviews. Other points brought up by the reviewers do not have to be addressed in your point-by-point response.</p><p>(1) Clearer, more informative figures and better explanations of figures.</p><p>(2) Discuss limitations of the approach (e.g. in vitro fermentation communities are easier as the host is not a factor; the original community is already quite simple compared to other types of communities).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several comments:</p><p>1) How can fructose be slowly converted to glucose in the presence of ethanol? I presume that this is mediated by B2?</p><p>2) Figures can be made more clear:</p><p>Figure 2b: the absolute concentrations need to be indicated to interpret the graph. Not clear what +3 and -3 mean.</p><p>Figure 3a and b: please plot dynamics (absolute abundance) in semilog plots. Rates can then be easily estimated from slopes.</p><p>Figure 4 is complex, and hard to read. Use contrasting colors, and colormatch with labels S/G/F/E/A.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is well written and I enjoyed reading it. I strongly support its publications â I feel the paper is essentially acceptable for publication already.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1d: I could not find at what stage of fermentation these measurements were done (probably day 14?).</p><p>Figure 1e: these results are not discussed in the text. The choice to separate bacteria and fungi does not seem intuitive to me because both organism classes will jointly determine the concentration of metabolites. Would not separating them in the analysis potentially reduce the percent variance explained?</p><p>Figure 1: Since authors only present endpoint measurements (the time of which was not very clear from the text) for the biochemical and microbiological composition of KT, what are their thoughts on the dynamics of these parameters? Could the differences between samples be explained just by differences in the speed of broth colonization/fermentation or what are the reasons to expect stabilized readout at the time of measurement?</p><p>The authors mention that similar ratios of B and Y CFUs in co-cultures represent the ratio in original KT. However, I could not find CFU data for total B and Y CFUs in the KT.</p><p>line 163: It is a very interesting result that B2 and B4 bacteria grew in combination with fungi but not on their own. The authors explain this in: 'bacteria varied greatly in sucrose utilization'. However, is it possible that yeast provides bacteria with other growth-limiting resources, not necessarily digesting sucrose to monosugars? On a more philosophical note, how does the choice between yeast-dependent and yeast-independent bacteria play into what is a representative microbial core?</p><p>Figure 3d: it is a little bit confusing to observe pellicle composition data for days 1-5 before any pellicle is formed. Perhaps adding a comment in the legend or revising the graph could be considered?</p><p>Do I understand correctly that ratios AND abundance of Y1 and B2 in pellicle remain relatively stable following its formation on day 6? I conclude this from supplementary figures 1d,e and methods indicating that pellicles were dissolved in equal volumes. If correct, this implies that pellicle dry weight increase is due to extracellular matrix formation and not growing microbial biomass. I feel that talking about ratios only leaves out this important finding about KT growth dynamics.</p><p>Figure 3k,l: What does mg/GAE and mg/QE stand for?</p><p>Line 354: For the 10 species experiments, I am left with the question of how many of them prevailed by the end of the fermentation? If one of the yeast (or bacteria) outcompetes the other four species, it may not be possible to appropriately conclude similarities between core and a more complex community.</p><p>Line 377: 'or crease' typo</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76401.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Your revised submission must address these two points resulting from the consultative review process.

Following the suggestion, we have examined all figures and captions, and revised some of them to provide better illustrations and explanations. For Figure 1D, we specified in the caption the time (day 14) at which measurements were conducted. For Figure 1E, we provided an explanation of separate analysis for bacteria and fungi in the main text. For Figure 2B, we supplemented the source data for the absolute concentrations of the metabolites. For Figure 3A-B, we replaced growth rates with the absolute species abundances in semilog plots. For Figure 3D, we used dashed lines to indicate microbial population ratios before observing the pellicle formation. For Figure 3K, we introduced detailed definitions about the units mg/GAE and mg/QE in the corresponding caption. For Figure 4, we changed the colors of the lines to provide better contrasts. Additionally, we added a schematic diagram (Figure 7) to summarize the overall concept and procedure of our complexity-reduction approach for microbiome dissection. Together, we believe that these revisions greatly improve the clarity of the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Discuss limitations of the approach (e.g. in vitro fermentation communities are easier as the host is not a factor; the original community is already quite simple compared to other types of communities).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly constructive comment. We have now included a discussion about the</p><p>limitations and future efforts of our approach in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>âIn this study, we successfully identified and utilized a two-species consortium as the core for systematic analysis of the KT microbiome. However, such a strategy may become less straightforward for many native microbiomes, such as those in the soil and in the human gut, due to their remarkable degree of complexity and their close association with the corresponding hosts (e.g., plant and human). Additionally, the KT microbiome studied here was driven primarily by pairwise interactions, another factor that made it possible to use the two-species ecosystem as an approximate of the entire community. For those involving higher-order interactions, microbial social interactions are much more complicated, and it needs significantly more efforts to screen and determine valid cores. In these cases, whether and to what extent a relatively simple core can be defined will depend on the specific starting microbiome, as well as the target functions of interest. In addition, a single microbiome in principle can possess multiple cores depending on different selection criteria, such as abundance, temporal pattern and function. Future efforts in these aspects are needed to fully realize the power of this community analysis strategy.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
