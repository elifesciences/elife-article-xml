cancer cell growth and metabolism. Akt appears to be autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and kinase domain, which is relieved by C-tail phosphorylation, but the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we use a combination of protein semisynthesis, NMR, and enzymological analysis to characterize structural features of the PH domain in its autoinhibited and activated states. We find that Akt autoinhibition depends on the length/flexibility of the PH-kinase linker. We identify a role for a dynamic short segment in the PH domain that appears to regulate autoinhibition and PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop. We determine that Akt allosteric inhibitor MK2206 drives distinct PH domain structural changes compared to baseline autoinhibited Akt. These results highlight how the conformational plasticity of Akt governs the delicate control of its catalytic properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>PH domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA74305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Claudia Adams Barr Program in Innovative Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arthanari</surname><given-names>Haribabu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schroedinger Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boeszoermenyi</surname><given-names>Andras</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19POST34380800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boeszoermenyi</surname><given-names>Andras</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EB002026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arthanari</surname><given-names>Haribabu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004093</institution-id><institution>Kwanjeong Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pre-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>Hwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NMR and biochemical analysis reveal new insights into how the critical protein kinase Akt is regulated by phosphorylation and is inhibited by an experimental therapeutic.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Akt1 (termed Akt in the present work) is a Ser/Thr kinase that is a critical node in cell signaling and connects growth factor receptor activation to cell growth and metabolic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manning and Toker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liao and Hung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fruman et al., 2017</xref>). The Akt subfamily of kinases includes closely related paralogs Akt1-3 and are members of the larger AGC kinase family, comprised of about 60 members of the kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leroux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). Akt is a 480 amino acid protein that contains an N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain followed by a catalytic (kinase) domain and culminates in a regulatory C-terminal disordered tail (C-tail) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our current understanding of Akt activation is that, in response to growth factor stimulation, phosphatidyl inositol diphosphate (PIP2) is converted to PIP3 by PI3-kinase and PIP3 recruits Akt to the plasma membrane via its PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manning and Toker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haeusler et al., 2018</xref>). Upon recruitment, Akt is phosphorylated by both mTORC2 kinase at Ser473 and PDK1 kinase at Thr308 and this dual phosphorylation leads to activation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarbassov, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, Akt can also be phosphorylated at Ser473 by DNA-PK upon activation of DNA damage response in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozulic et al., 2008</xref>). In an alternative pathway of Akt activation, Akt may be phosphorylated on Ser477 and Thr479 by Cdk2/cyclinA instead of Ser473 and this may happen in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Excluding Thr308, the three other phosphorylations (Ser473, Ser477 and Thr479) are located in the disordered C-terminal tail.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Akt domain architecture, two distinct activation mechanisms mediated by C-tail phosphorylations, and the current model for drug-induced autoinhibited form.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Akt domains with phosphorylation sites of interest highlighted as red balls.

Without C-tail phosphorylations, Akt remains in an inactive autoinhibited state where the PH and kinase domains interact intramolecularly. The mTORC2-mediated Ser473 phosphorylation activates Akt by inducing an interaction between the C-tail and the PH-kinase domain linker, dislodging the PH domain from the kinase domain. Alternatively, the dual Cdk2/cyclinA-mediated pSer477/pThr479 is presumed to activate Akt by interaction with the activation loop and PH domain. Note that, although C-terminal phosphorylation is shown preceding activation loop Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1, it is uncertain in normal cell signaling whether C-terminal phosphorylation or Thr308 phosphorylation comes first in Akt activation or if it is in random order.

An autoinhibitory mechanism involving an intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal PH domain and C-terminal kinase domain is generally accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellacosa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calleja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cole et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The structural basis for this autoinhibitory conformation has been proposed based on high resolution X-ray crystal structures of near full-length Akt in complex with small molecule catalytic inhibitors such as compound VIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lapierre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A mechanistically related allosteric inhibitor of compound VIII, MK2206, has been widely used in cancer therapeutic clinical trials aimed to block Akt action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sangai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yap et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nitulescu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While phosphorylation at Thr308 is important for kinase activity in the context of the isolated Akt kinase domain, C-terminal phosphorylation shows significant impact only in the context of full-length Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cole et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2002b</xref>). Recent structural studies suggest that phosphorylation at Ser473 concurrently interacts with a PH-kinase domain linker basic patch, especially the sidechain of Arg144, and the kinase N-lobe via Gln218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A model based on these structural interactions postulates that these interactions with phosphorylated Ser473 (pSer473) help to displace the PH domain from the kinase domain thereby stimulating catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of Ser477/Thr479 is suggested to relieve autoinhibition of Akt in a distinct fashion, potentially by interaction with the activation loop and/or the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>However, the roles and conformational status of the PH domain in the active and inactive states of Akt have been controversial. It has been suggested that PIP3 activates Akt not simply by membrane recruitment but by dislodging the PH domain from the kinase domain independent of promoting Akt phosphorylation by upstream kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lučić et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to these studies, this allosteric mechanism of Akt activation by PIP3 was not confirmed by our group where neither soluble nor vesicle-embedded PIP3 stimulated Akt kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the binding affinities of soluble PIP3 with pSer473 Akt vs. non-phospho C-tail Akt were essentially identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). In comparison, soluble PIP3 binding to pSer477/pThr479 was attenuated by about fourfold compared to pSer473 and non-C-terminally phosphorylated Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, crystal structures of near full-length Akt in complex with compound VIII and related allosteric inhibitors reveal that the PIP3 binding pocket on the PH domain is occluded by its interactions with the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>X-ray crystal structures of near full-length Akt in the absence of allosteric inhibitors, as well as of active Akt including the PH domain have not yet been reported. Thus, our understanding of the structure and conformation of the PH domain in the context of the full-length Akt protein is incomplete. In this study, we have used a combination of enzymatic analysis of linker-altered Akts and solution NMR analysis of segmentally isotopically labeled semisynthetic Akt forms to characterize the structural features of the PH domain within the full-length protein in differentially phosphorylated states. These structural measurements combined with biochemical data highlight regions in the PH domain that appear to show distinct changes in the context of C-terminal phosphorylation and allosteric drug inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Role of linker length and flexibility in autoinhibition and activation of Akt</title><p>Intramolecular interactions between the Akt PH and kinase domains are presumed to enforce autoinhibition of Akt's enzymatic activity. Interaction of pSer473 with the linker basic patch, particularly Arg144, appears to help relieve such autoinhibition. We have attempted to determine the role of linker length and flexibility that may contribute to how the pSer473-Arg144 interaction influences the relief of autoinhibition. A prior cellular study meant to investigate this possibility by inserting a flexible hexa-Gly segment in the middle of the PH-kinase linker showed reduced Akt signaling in response to growth factors. The results of these experiments were complicated to interpret, however, because hexa-Gly insertion led to reduced pSer473 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the role of linker flexibility in more depth, we prepared the semisynthetic wt and hexa-Gly insertion Akt forms containing C-terminal phosphorylation using expressed protein ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muir et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this procedure, aa1-459 of wt Akt and the hexa-Gly insertion segments fused to an intein were expressed in insect cells along with PDK1 and phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid to ensure complete Thr308 phosphorylation. The C-terminal thioester fragments were ligated to N-Cys C-tail peptides (aa460-480) containing pSer473, pSer477/pThr479, or no C-tail phosphorylation and the semisynthetic proteins further purified to greater than 80%. Near stoichiometric Thr308 phosphorylation of these Akt forms was confirmed by western blot. It should be noted that Thr450 phosphorylation which is necessary for Akt stability occurs in insect cells concurrently with Akt production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We then analyzed the catalytic properties of the wild type (wt) and hexaGly mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It should be noted that the apparent wt catalytic efficiencies (k<sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values) were relatively similar to those reported previously for wt Akt in various states of phosphorylation generated in this fashion (within ~3-fold, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>]). Some variation in kinase activities between different preparations can be explained by possible post-translational modification differences in the recombinant protein portion of the semisynthetic Akts which may occur in insect cells. To minimize the effects of catalytic differences among insect cell preparations, where possible we compared Akt forms with distinct C-terminal phosphorylation status prepared from the same batch of recombinant Akt thioester. Moreover, the small contamination (~10%) of slightly truncated Akt in these preps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) is not expected to alter significantly the k<sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values measured (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The PH-kinase domain linker length/flexibility affects Akt activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration for radiometric kinase assay using a biotinylated GSK3 peptide as Akt substrate and steady-state kinetic plots for v/[E] versus [ATP] with 20 µM GSK3 peptide for semisynthetic pThr308 Akt proteins WT (blue) versus the linker 6xGly insertion (red) with non-p C-tail (left), pSer473 (middle) and dual-pSer477/pThr479 (right), n = 2.

In contrast, the non-phosphorylated C-tail hexaGly Akt was ~8 fold more active compared with the corresponding wt Akt. These results support a role for linker length or flexibility as a contributing factor to activation of Akt orchestrated by pSer473-basic linker patch interaction. This also indicates that autoinhibition is alleviated in the non-C-tail phosphorylated state if this linker is too flexible.</p><p>In contrast to the results with pSer473, the activity of the dual C-terminal phosphorylated (pSer477/pThr479) Akt showed only a minor difference (&lt;2 fold) when comparing the hexaGly linker insertion vs. wt Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

While the N-terminus (aa 1–41, β-strands 1 to 3) seems to show relatively minor differences in response to variations in the C-tail phospho-states, the region encompassing β-strands 4 and 5 (aa 72–90) show comparatively larger perturbations depending on which C-tail phospho-states are present. The effects of CSP and line broadening can be induced by a direct interaction or an allosteric change, both of which result in changes in the electronic environment of the observed proton. To distinguish between direct and indirect binding interactions between the kinase and PH domains among the different Akt forms, we employed cross saturation transfer (CST) NMR measurements, which exclusively provides information on the direct interaction interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wüthrich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2000</xref>). Perdeuterated, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled, PH domain was expressed and covalently linked to the protonated kinase domain (and the various phospho-variants) as discussed above. In a CST experiment, we selectively magnetize the protonated protein in the aliphatic region, in this case the kinase domain, and monitor the transfer of magnetization to the perdeuterated partner, the PH domain. Since CST experiments are performed in 70% <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O (30% H<sub>2</sub>O) solvent to minimize non-specific effects due to spin diffusion, the inherent sensitivity of the experiment, which is concentration limited, is further reduced. Hence, we considered the CST effect in a contiguous stretch of amino acids as a true positive. Upon saturation of the kinase domain, peak intensities of select resonances in the PH domain were effectively reduced by as much as 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), underscoring the direct intramolecular interaction between the PH and kinase domains among the various Akt phospho-forms. The results from CST the experiments along with those derived from the CSP analysis are discussed below.</p><p>Aligning with the CSP data, no striking differences, in a contiguous stretch of amino acids were observed in the regions encompassing β-strands 1–3 and 4–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that the modes of activation of Akt may depend on subtle changes in the binding interface rather than on major differences in binding affinity. However, a small but distinct difference in the CST was observed for β-strands 4–7 across the three tested forms of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Specifically, the CST for β-strands 4–7 of pSer473 is lower than that of the non-phosphorylated and pSer477/pThr479 forms. This difference could be the result of a marginally weaker interaction of β-strands 4–7 of the PH domain with the kinase domain in the pSer473 form. This is consistent with the biochemical data.</p><p>Focusing on the strong CST effects, the C-terminal alpha-helix (aa 100–109) of the PH domain showed a significant CSP between the pSer473 and pSer477/pThr479 forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). There were no significant changes in the chemical shifts of the C-terminal alpha-helix PH domain between the non-p-C and pSer473. On the contrary, the spectrum of pS477/pThr479 shows marked CSPs compared to the non-p-C form on the residues corresponding to the C-terminal helix. Thus, we surmise that this PH domain C-terminal alpha-helix plays a specific role in the mode of activation of Akt by the dual pSer477/pThr479 modifications. Notably, results from the CST experiments reinforced this possibility since the peaks of residues corresponding to the C-terminal helix exhibit marked reduction in intensity (near-complete disappearance) in the pSer477/pThr479 form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, residues Gln43 and Asp44 of the PH domain which are in an extended loop between β-strands 3 and 4 show either relatively large CSPs or marked peak broadening beyond detection in the phospho-C-tail forms relative to the non-phospho-C-tail form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Similarly, the CST behavior for Gln43 and Asp44 was closely linked the phospho-state of the C-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) with an apparent loosening of the interaction for pSer473 but an apparent tightening for pSer477/pThr479. We therefore posit that this region plays a role in governing Akt regulation and investigated this possibility below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Role of a short hinge, aa 44–46, in Akt regulation</title><p>Prior X-ray crystal structures of the Akt PH domain have shown that aa 44–46 (DVD) located between β-strands 3 and 4 undergo a helix to loop transition between the inositol tetraphosphate-bound PH domain and the apo form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milburn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meuillet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>). Given the fact that peaks assigned to Gln43 and Asp44 show either the highest CSP or extensive peak broadening as a function of C-tail phosphorylation status described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we hypothesized that this conformational change contributes to Akt regulation in the intact protein. To test the hypothesis that this short hinge affects the capacity of Akt to bind PIP3, we recombinantly expressed a triple mutant – D44G/V45P/D46G – of the isolated PH domain aimed at disrupting the potential of this segment to form a stable helix with Gly and Pro residues that favor a random coil secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pace and Scholtz, 1998</xref>). We then measured the affinity of wt and triple mutant PH domains to bind PIP3, using a fluorescence anisotropy assay; however, we did not detect any significant difference in the binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the effect of the short hinge further, we produced wt and triple mutant semisynthetic Akt variants using a standard expressed protein ligation strategy in which recombinant aa 1–459 thioester was generated in <italic>Sf</italic>9 insect cells along with co-overexpression with PDK1 to afford Thr308 phosphorylation. Using western blotting, we noted that the degree of phosphorylation at Thr308 was reduced compared to wt Akt prepared under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We thus treated partially Thr308 phosphorylated triple mutant (D44G/V45P/D46G) Akt1 aa 1–459 with PDK1 in an in vitro kinase reaction which appeared to complete the phosphorylation of Thr308 to a level matching that of wt Akt1 obtained simply from PDK1 co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

In these inhibitor-bound structures, the PIP3-binding pocket of the PH domain is obstructed which would be expected to reduce PIP3-binding affinity. Our recent work has revealed that PIP3-binding affinity is similar for the pSer473 and non-C-tail phosphorylated Akt forms. In this light, it has been difficult to reconcile the structural studies. To investigate this further, we measured PIP3 affinity to Akt in the context of either MK2206 or compound VIII allosteric Akt inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Based on the <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC analysis, there were marked chemical shift changes throughout the PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,D</xref>). The amplitudes of these chemical shift perturbations were generally much larger than those observed when comparing different C-terminal phospho-forms of Akt. Notably, some of the most significant chemical shift perturbations were detected in the PIP3-binding interface (e.g. aa Trp11, Leu12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We also performed a CST experiment in the same manner as described above, in the presence of MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,E and F</xref>) and observed two principal effects mediated by the compound. The short hinge of aa 44–46 seems to separate further from the kinase domain and/or C-terminal tail while the C-terminal alpha-helix, in contrast, appears to interact more tightly with the kinase domain or C-tail. These inhibitor-induced changes likely result from a combination of altered structural and dynamic features relative to the baseline autoinhibited form of Akt. These could include a reorientation of the PH domain with respect to the kinase domain or C-tail (placing the C-terminal helix closer) as well as conformational and dynamic rearrangements within the PH domain itself. In a complementary approach, we performed a fluorescence trans binding assay of split Akt (separate PH and kinase domains) that MK2206 can enhance the binding affinity between the two domains in an intermolecular fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

We note that prior studies have indicated that Asp473 is a poor mimic of pSer473 in kinase activity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting that Asp473 may not relieve autoinhibition efficiently. Here, we look directly at the Akt PH domain in the context of full-length protein by solution NMR using a segmental labeling approach. These experiments show that specific regions in the PH domain show chemical shift perturbations in the presence of C-terminal phosphorylation that can stimulate Akt activity. Moreover, there are distinct changes in Akt that is phosphorylated on Ser473 versus Ser477/Thr479, consistent with differential interactions of the phospho-sites and the kinase domain and linker dependence on the phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>These studies highlight the value of segmental labeling using semisynthesis to make larger proteins dependent on insect cell expression amenable to NMR. The simplified spectra of the ~120 aa PH domain, prepared in <italic>E. coli</italic>, embedded in the 480 aa Akt protein, mostly produced in <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells, was straightforward to assign by correlation with the isolated PH domain. We suggest that such segmental labeling strategies be considered for solution phase structural studies of big proteins requiring eukaryotic expression that are now commonly considered out of reach by NMR.</p><p>We focused on one short segment in the PH domain based on the NMR studies which is the short hinge consisting of the three amino acid motif aa 44–46, DVD, henceforth referred to as the DVD motif. This hinge region was sharply affected by C-terminal phosphorylation. Prior crystal structures of the isolated PH domain have shown that this DVD motif transitions between alpha-helix and loop depending on whether the domains were complexed with the PIP3 mimic, IP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milburn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meuillet, 2011</xref>). By mutating DVD to GPG to destabilize possible helix formation, we showed that C-terminal phosphorylation of Ser473 was poorly able to stimulate Akt kinase activity. This suggests that the normal dynamics (loop to helix transition) of this DVD motif is necessary for allowing the PH domain to dislodge from the kinase domain in response to pSer473. In contrast, activation of Akt by pSer477/pThr479 was insensitive to this mutation, despite changes in chemical shift in the hinge region (aa 43–44). These findings can be interpreted as consistent with a distinct mode of activation by these non-classical phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The GPG mutation in the isolated PH domain did not influence its ability to bind PIP3 indicating that the dynamics of this DVD segment is not intimately connected to the thermodynamics of PIP3 binding. Interestingly, our results show that the DVD motif can also impact PDK1's ability to phosphorylate Thr308 in Akt's activation loop. We surmise that the helical state of aa 44–46 in Akt may facilitate a catalytically competent interaction between PDK1 and Akt.</p><p>Our results also show how flexibility/length in the linker between the kinase domain and PH domain can modulate the ability of C-terminal phosphorylation to activate Akt. Insertion of a hexaGly linker led to reduced activation in the case of pSer473, but only minimally in the case of pSer477/pThr479. The results with the pSer473 form of Akt suggests that engagement of Arg144 by pSer473 may tug on the linker to weaken the PH domain-kinase domain interaction and that this effect is attenuated by increasing linker flexibility which could reduce linker tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). Prior cellular studies revealed that growth factor induced pSer473 phosphorylation is decreased in the hexaGly mutant, presumably because the C-tail phosphorylation is not as shielded from cellular phosphatases when the linker is less rigid. Notably, the baseline activity of non-C-tail-phosphorylated Akt is elevated in the hexaGly insertion mutant relative to the wt Akt enzyme. This can be understood to result from a floppier linker, enlarging the volume sampled by the PH domain, lowering its effective concentration relative to the kinase domain.</p><p>Our NMR analysis helps explain the paradox that crystal structures of allosteric inhibitors in complex with Akt show that the PH domain PIP3 pocket is obstructed but the non-phospho-C-tail form of Akt binds PIP3 potently. Indeed, we confirm here that in the presence of allosteric inhibitor, PIP3 affinity of Akt is markedly reduced. These results indicate that the conformation of the baseline non-phosphorylated-C-tail form of Akt is not identical to the allosteric-bound conformation. NMR data show dramatic chemical shift changes in the PH domain between the non-phosphorylated-C-tail and the inhibitor-bound form of Akt that likely reflect these differences. It is possible that the non-phosphorylated-C-tail Akt state is comprised of an ensemble of conformations, and one of the minor populations binds to allosteric inhibitors via conformational selection. Although NMR dynamics experiments, due to their very long measurement times are not feasible with our current experimental system, future alternative approaches may allow this to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td>Akt1</td><td>Addgene and <break/>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh238">10.1093/nar/gkh238</ext-link></td><td>Addgene # 9021</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rosetta 2(DE3) pLysS</td><td valign="top">Novagen</td><td valign="top">Cat.

The unlabeled insect cells expressing Akt (aa122-459-<italic>Mxe</italic>Intein-CBD) were suspended in lysis buffer and lysed in a 40 ml Dounce homogenizer on ice, and the mixture was clarified as described above for the PH domain. The insect cell expressed protein was also passed through fibrous cellulose to remove chitinase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolduc et al., 2013</xref>).

The obtained N-Tags-TEV-S122C-Akt kinase domain thioester was phosphorylated at Thr308 in vitro using recombinant GST-PDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>), and then ligated with the synthetic N-Cys containing C-terminal Akt peptides (aa 460–480) containing variable phosphorylations in the first ligation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 100 mM MESNA, 10 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF) for 5 hr at room temperature and then maintained overnight at 4°C. The ligation product N-Tags-TEV-S122C-Akt aa 122–480 fragment was purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with the second ligation buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM MESNA, 0.5 mM IP6 (phytic acid sodium salt, Sigma), 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM PMSF). The purified fractions (&gt;90%) were combined, concentrated and mixed with triply labeled Akt PH domain thioester at the concentration of 5 mg/mL, 300 µg of TEV protease was added to initialize the second EPL at 4 °C for 65 hr.

The semisynthetic Akt proteins were purified by SEC with the Akt purification and storage buffer. The small contamination (~10%) of slightly truncated Akt proteins in these likely results from incomplete ligation or slight proteolytic cleavage of the ca. 40 aa N-terminal tag. As the C-terminal tail is critical in supporting Akt catalytic activity and the absence or presence of the N-terminal tag does not appear to affect catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2018</xref>), we do not think this contamination will have a big impact on the measured catalytic efficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>NMR experiments</title><p>All NMR experiments were conducted on a Bruker spectrometer operating at 750 MHz, equipped with a TCI cryoprobe and z-shielded gradients.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Structural Determinants of PH Domain-Mediated Regulation of Akt Revealed by Segmental Labeling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated favorably by three peer reviewers, and John Kuriyan has overseen the evaluation as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin N. Dalby (Reviewer #1); Neel Shah (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The manuscript by Cole, Arthanari, and co-workers aims to enhance our understanding of activation and autoinhibition of the protein kinase Akt1 (AKT). The authors use a combination of protein semisynthesis, enzymological assays, and NMR spectroscopy to identify structural changes that distinguish variously autoinhibited and activated states of AKT.</p><p>Three particularly notable conclusions stand out from this work. First, the authors lay out an elegant route to making segmentally-isotopically labeled and site-specifically phosphorylated samples of a multi-domain protein that has mostly eluded NMR studies, thus far. Second, the NMR experiments with different phospho-forms of AKT, which could only have been obtained through their synthetic methods, substantiate the hypothesis that distinct phosphorylation events activate AKT via different mechanisms. Finally, their NMR data show that the auto-inhibited state of AKT observed in crystal structures is almost certainly a drug-induced conformation, and is unlikely to be the predominant structure in solution in the absence of an allosteric inhibitor. The study provides good evidence that the conformational dynamics of the linker (or &quot;tension&quot;, but note that reviewers object to this word) between the PH domain of AKT and the kinase domain plays a role in mediating the activation of AKT by phosphorylation of Ser473. Moreover, it suggests this is not the case for the phosphorylation of Ser477/Thr479. The authors identify a small region within the PH domain that adopts a helical state and mediates the phosphorylation of Thr308 by PDK1 in intact cells.</p><p>The work presented here provides new methods to study kinase structure/function, and the results are likely to guide future biological investigations, and drug discovery efforts focused on AKT.</p><p>The review process did perceive weaknesses in the manuscript. Some aspects of the work may be considered incremental, as it focuses on linker length (which was partly examined in previous work from this group) and a single loop region in the PH domain. Given the tools at this group's disposal, it seems the data in this paper are underutilized, and in some cases, the experimental design seems ill-conceived (see comment #5 below). There is a concern that, as presented, the authors provide interesting observations, but the data are not interpreted in a manner that yields a definitive advance in our mechanistic understanding of AKT regulation.</p><p>Despite these weaknesses, the reviewers agreed that the impressive demonstration of segmental labeling to probe the effects of phosphorylation and to investigate PH domain conformation are important advances. The finding that the drug-induced conformation of Akt may not represent the physiological conformation is also important. The paper should become acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once it is revised to take into account the comments below. Note that under the present circumstances we are only asking for textual revisions, but if additional data that support the claims are available, they could be included.</p><p>Comments to address:</p><p>1) Work by Lucic et al. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1716109115 contains important contributions to understanding AKT regulation and yet is not described or referenced in the submitted manuscript. Please include it in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that the putative regulatory interaction between pSer473 and R144 &quot;exerts tension on the PH-kinase domain linker, thereby pulling on the PH domain and severing its contacts…&quot; The use of the word &quot;tension&quot; throughout is misleading as the authors have not measured force in any of their experiments. Instead, it seems more appropriate to think about the pSer473/R144 interaction as promoting a shift in the conformational ensemble of the full-length protein that leads to destabilization of the PH/kinase interface.</p><p>3) The authors claim the results of increasing linker length (addition of the hexaGly insert) &quot;support a role for linker tension,&quot; but really linker length has been probed. A simple explanation may be that the increased linker length and flexibility in the region adjacent to R144 might create an increased entropic cost in forming the pSer473/R144 contact. There seems to be an assumption in these experiments that the pSer473/R144 interaction is unchanged upon the insertion of hexaGly.</p><p>4) The NMR data, as presented in Figure 4 are difficult to see. Perhaps the spectra could be expanded to show key spectral changes. More importantly, the NMR changes are never mapped on the PH domain structure. Figure 4F simply shows regions of secondary structure, but the data itself (Figure 4D and E) could be significantly more informative if mapped onto the PH domain structure. This is true for all of the HSQC data throughout the paper.</p><p>5) What are the phosphorylation states at T308 for all of the protein samples generated via semisynthesis? It appears that Thr308 is phosphorylated in the protein samples prepared for the NMR work. This is puzzling as the authors are probing the transition from autoinhibited to activated AKT via C-tail phosphorylation. So it seems that as long as the activation loop is phosphorylated they won't capture the fully autoinhibited form. Moreover, the scheme in Figure 1B indicates that C-tail phosphorylation occurs before activation loop phosphorylation providing another reason to study C-tail phosphorylation effects in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. Please clarify and comment on this issue. Can the authors provide MS data confirming the identities (and purity) of all semisynthetic products generated in this study? If additional data supporting the analysis are available, it might be worth including in the manuscript.</p><p>6) The structural distinction between the natural auto-inhibited state and the drug-induced state is interesting but poorly defined here. A potentially important finding is that the AKT crystal structures containing small molecules that “staple” the PH domain to the kinase domain may not be revealing the native autoinhibitory interface. The NMR mapping in this paper could provide insight into the PH/kinase interface in the absence of drug, but the authors stop short of using their data in this way. Is there some reason that the data have not been pushed to provide a more definitive understanding of the PH-kinase interaction? It would be illustrative and helpful to see the residues with significant chemical shift perturbations in Figure 6 highlighted on the structure of the drug-bound autoinhibited state. A discussion of how the extended interface upon drug binding differs from the native autoinhibited state is warranted. What can be inferred from the cross saturation transfer experiments? Was such an experiment done in the presence of the allosteric inhibitor? This experiment isn't necessary, but a general discussion of structural models that can be inferred from the data in this manuscript would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>7) Cross-saturation transfer NMR data are also underutilized. Examining the quantitative differences between non-p-C and pS475 should provide more precise insight into how serine phosphorylation might be affecting the conformational preference of the PH domain. It's difficult to see from Figure 4—figure supplement 3 how the cross-saturation transfer effect is stronger for non-phosphorylated versus tail-phosphorylated samples, as stated in the text. Could this be quantified in some way – perhaps showing the mean peak intensity ratios for each sample or a distribution of these ratios across all samples?</p><p>8) The heavy focus on the loop following b3 (residues Gln43 and Asp44) seems driven (according to the text) by more dramatic chemical shift perturbation and more extensive line broadening in the phosphorylated forms compared to non-p-C. This seems a stretch as there are certainly other regions that show equally or nearly the same extent of spectral change (it's possible that the HSQC data itself makes the differences more evident, but expanded spectral data showing individual HSQC peaks are not provided).</p><p>9) The remainder of the paper focuses on a mutation of the native DVD sequence (residues 44-46) to GPG in an effort to &quot;favor a random coil secondary structure in this region.&quot; The authors do not characterize this mutant to determine whether the mutation successfully shifted secondary structure preference of the PH domain but instead put the mutation directly into their full-length semi-synthetic AKT. Despite the lack of characterization of the mutant, this is the one place in this paper where the authors see a dramatic result; Figure 5A shows that the mutation of the DVD motif causes a large decrease in the steady-state kinetics of AKT in its pSer473 form compared to wild type. The other phosphorylated form of AKT (pSer477/pThr497) is unaffected by the mutation in the PH domain. Clearly understanding the mechanistic basis for this difference would be an advance in this field but the manuscript as presented does not sufficiently explain the observations.</p><p>10) In the Discussion, the authors interpret the failure of pSer473 to stimulate AKT activity as being due to changes in the &quot;normal dynamics&quot; of the DVD motif. Dynamics can be directly measured by NMR to support this conclusion, but this is surprisingly not included in the manuscript. The observation that activation loop phosphorylation (at Thr308) is also diminished upon mutation of the DVD motif to GPG might suggest that the mutation in the PH domain enhances the autoinhibitory contact between PH and kinase domains and/or alters the accessibility of the activation loop to PDK-1. Unfortunately, as presented, the manuscript provides little to advance our understanding of the precise role of this region of the PH domain in AKT regulation.</p><p>11) In the final part of this work the authors explore the effects of drug binding on PIP3 binding as well as PH domain NMR chemical shifts. The data are not interpreted in a satisfactory manner; the authors state that &quot;Notably, some of the most significant chemical shift perturbations were detected in the PIP3-binding interface…&quot; but there are significant changes elsewhere in the PH domain as well. There is also no attempt to take into account the likely significant spectral changes that will arise from the drug itself.</p><p>12) Finally, the last sentence of the paper suggests conformational heterogeneity might be present in the non-phosphorylated C-tail form of AKT. This is very logical and raises the question of whether the authors see any evidence for the existence of multiple states in solution for any of the segmentally labeled forms they have studied in this submitted paper or the previous 2018 publication?</p><p>13) Some of the kinetic parameters for the WT semi-synthetic AKT proteins shown in Figure 2 seem to differ a little from the parameters reported earlier in Chu et al., 2018. For example, the kcat/Km for A2 (full-length AKT phosphorylated on T308) in Figure 2 of Chu et al. is 28-fold smaller than the value reported in the current manuscript. In the present manuscript, the concentration range of ATP used is 0-2000 µM, whereas the Km values reported for A2, A1, and A6 (Figure 2 of Chu et al.) are 200, 5100, and 3700 µM, respectively. Perhaps the authors could clarify the apparent discrepancy.</p><p>14) Perhaps mention that the reported kcat/Km's are apparent values as the second substrate (the peptide in this case) is not present at a saturating concentration.</p><p>15) It would be helpful in Figure 1 if the various states were labeled as &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive.&quot; In Figure 1B, the ribbon diagram of the PH-kinase unit is drawn upside. In this and other figures (e.g., 4F), it would be helpful if structural components and parts were clearly labeled on the figures.</p><p>16) Can the authors comment on the purity of the samples used in Figure 2? Based on the figure supplement SDS-PAGE analysis, there appears to be a ~10-20% impurity. Can this be identified by MS analysis of the full-length protein to confirm that it isn't a species that will interfere with the analysis of enzyme kinetics?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59151.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work presented here provides new methods to study kinase structure/function, and the results are likely to guide future biological investigations, and drug discovery efforts focused on AKT.</p><p>The review process did perceive weaknesses in the manuscript.

We readily concede that our studies have not fully illuminated the complete set of conformational changes and altered intramolecular interactions in the various Akt states. A fundamental limitation of our work is the absence of NMR analysis of the kinase domain and C-terminus which are not isotopically labelled. This partly stems from requirement that the kinase domain should be expressed in insect cells to obtain a functional and well-behaved protein. For NMR studies of the kinase domain demands deuteration, which is challenging in eukaryotic expression systems. Another challenge that we faced in this investigation is the complexity and size of the Akt forms as well as their limited stabilities and solubilities for NMR analysis. Despite these impediments, we believe that we have gained important new information about how Akt is regulated by its PH domain in various phosphorylation states and in the presence of allosteric inhibitor. In addition, we posit that these studies will propel additional efforts by our lab and others in future studies to generate an even deeper understanding of this fascinating enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to address:</p><p>1) Work by Lucic et al. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1716109115 contains important contributions to understanding AKT regulation and yet is not described or referenced in the submitted manuscript.

While this work was related to the Ebner et al., 2017 paper, we agree that it is important to cite this study and briefly discuss it. We have now done so in the Introduction and the Discussion of the revised manuscript, noting its use of HD exchange analysis, but pointing out its reliance on the phosphomimic S473D rather than pSer473 that we believe limits its impact on mechanistic interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors suggest that the putative regulatory interaction between pSer473 and R144 &quot;exerts tension on the PH-kinase domain linker, thereby pulling on the PH domain and severing its contacts…&quot; The use of the word &quot;tension&quot; throughout is misleading as the authors have not measured force in any of their experiments.

To remedy this, we have created two new figures in the revised manuscript. Figure 4 shows an enlarged overlay of the HSQCs that we believe are easier to evaluate. Furthermore, Figure 4C shows a few selected peaks in a “zoomed in” manner. Figure 5 now includes representations of the most significant chemical shift perturbations highlighted on the structure of the MK2206-inhibited Akt relative to the signals of the pSer473 and pSer477/pThr479 Akts (Figure 5D and E). Likewise, Figure 8 now focuses on the NMR data for the effect of MK2206 and includes expanded peaks (Figure 8B) and a representation of the chemical shift perturbations projected on the three-dimensional structure (Figure 8G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What are the phosphorylation states at T308 for all of the protein samples generated via semisynthesis? It appears that Thr308 is phosphorylated in the protein samples prepared for the NMR work. This is puzzling as the authors are probing the transition from autoinhibited to activated AKT via C-tail phosphorylation. So it seems that as long as the activation loop is phosphorylated they won't capture the fully autoinhibited form. Moreover, the scheme in Figure 1B indicates that C-tail phosphorylation occurs before activation loop phosphorylation providing another reason to study C-tail phosphorylation effects in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. Please clarify and comment on this issue. Can the authors provide MS data confirming the identities (and purity) of all semisynthetic products generated in this study? If additional data supporting the analysis are available, it might be worth including in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the production of purified Akts analyzed by NMR or enzymatically, the Thr308 has been phosphorylated at near stoichiometric levels by PDK1 either by co-expression or in vitro kinase treatment in all cases but one. This exception was for the study of the DVD to GPG triple mutant that was prepared specifically for kinetic analysis of PDK1 treatment of the full-length semisynthetic Akt in the DVD/GPG context. We performed this experiment since the HCT116 transfection experiments with DVD/GPG Akt unexpectedly revealed diminished Thr308 phosphorylation in response to growth factor. We have clarified this status in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In all of the other Akts including the DVD/GPG Akt that was prepared for determining the kcat/Km values of its own kinase activity, Thr308 was phosphorylated in this study. The reason that we elected to do this is based on previous work from our team (Chu et al., 2018) which showed that, in the absence of the PH domain, C-terminal phosphorylation is inconsequential for achieving full kinase activity. In contrast, Thr308 phosphorylation still matters with kinase domain only. In this prior work, both Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation in the context of full-length Akt provide about equally important and synergistic impacts on Akt activity. If either one is missing, the kinase activity is similar to having no phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473, although Thr308 phosphorylation confers a lower Km of peptide substrate whereas Ser473 phosphorylation does not.</p><p>With respect to the cartoon in Figure 1B showing C-terminal phosphorylation preceding Thr308 phosphorylation, this is by no means established and different labs have concluded an ordered or random process about whether Thr308 or pSer473 comes first. We have added a disclaimer to the figure legend to clarify this point.</p><p>It is an interesting question raised by the reviewers regarding how Thr308 phosphorylation would impact the conformation of Akt and agree that this could also be investigated by NMR. Based on our previous measurements that a non-phosphorylated Thr308 form of Akt bound PIP3 about 2.5-fold more tightly compared with pThr308 Akt, there are likely at least subtle differences in the PH domain of the autoinhibited states +/-pThr308. We hope to analyze this issue further using NMR in future studies. We note, though, that the enhanced of affinity of Akt for PIP3 with non-phosphorylated Thr308 Akt is the opposite of what is observed with Akt in complex with allosteric inhibitor and this underscores the distinct Akt conformations that occur with MK2206 vs. MK2206-free Akt.</p><p>Regarding protein purity, we have relied on coomassie-stained SDSPAGE rather than mass spectrometry since the early stages of this project. In some unpublished mass spec analysis from our lab on Akt from several years ago when we first started working with the enzyme, we saw evidence for multiple PTMs including additional phosphorylations in the insect expressed component of the semisynthetic protein that was produced. We do not know the stoichiometries of these additional phosphorylations and have not mapped the sites. We do not have a simple way to remove the extra phosphorylations since treatment with alkaline phosphatase would hydrolyze the critical pThr450 that stabilizes Akt. So we have lived with this PTM heterogeneity, and we concede that this can complicate the interpretation of the structural and enzymatic studies. In the revised manuscript, we now allude to this limitation in the Results section, but also point out that within a set of experiments to assess different C-tail modification effects, we use the same batches of recombinant core kinase or PH-kinase to ensure apples to apples comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The structural distinction between the natural auto-inhibited state and the drug-induced state is interesting but poorly defined here. A potentially important finding is that the AKT crystal structures containing small molecules that “staple” the PH domain to the kinase domain may not be revealing the native autoinhibitory interface.

This experiment isn't necessary, but a general discussion of structural models that can be inferred from the data in this manuscript would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, Figure 8 now focuses on the NMR data for the effect of MK2206 and includes expanded peaks (Figure 8B) and a representation of the chemical shift perturbations in the context of the Akt structure (Figure 8G). We also performed CST experiment for the non-phosphorylated full-length Akt in the presence of MK2206 (Figure 8B, expanded peaks from CST spectra). One of the challenges we faced with the CST experiments is the sensitivity of the measurement. In addition to concentration limited, the CST experiments were conducted in 70% D<sub>2</sub>O to minimize, water mediated spin diffusion, which further reduced the intensity of the weaker peaks. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we mitigated this problem by considering CST data from groups of neighboring amino acids and we present the CST data in a corroborating manner (Figure 8E and F, CST data as bar plot and statistical bar and whisker plot, respectively).</p><p>Interestingly, none of the most affected residues in this context directly contact MK2206 in the crystal structure (this may be partly due to lack of assignment for some residues). From the chemical shift perturbation and CST data, we can infer two main phenomena: (i) the short hinge associated with aa 44-46 is “released” (CSPs are smaller and CST weaker in the presence of MK2206) and (ii) the C-terminal helix is interacts more tightly with the kinase domain and/or C-terminal tail. Additional experiments would be needed to characterize these findings in greater detail, but we speculate that the results suggest one or a mix of two possibilities when MK2206 binds to autoinhibited Akt: i) a reorientation of the PH domain with respect to the kinase domain or C-tail; ii) conformational/dynamic rearrangements within the PH domain itself.</p><p>We now include the following lines in the revised manuscript based on the CST data:</p><p>“We also performed a CST experiment in the same manner as described above, in the presence of MK2206 (Figure 8B,E and F) and observed two principal effects mediated by the compound. The short hinge of aa 44-46 seems to separate further from the kinase domain and/or C-terminal tail while the C-terminal α-helix, in contrast, appears to interact more tightly with the kinase domain or C-tail.”</p><p>We modified the manuscript to clarify the possible interpretation of NMR data:</p><p>“These inhibitor-induced changes likely result from a combination of altered structural and dynamic features relative to the baseline autoinhibited form of Akt. These could include a reorientation of the PH domain with respect to the kinase domain or C-tail (placing the C-terminal helix closer) as well as conformational and dynamic rearrangements within the PH domain itself.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Cross-saturation transfer NMR data are also underutilized. Examining the quantitative differences between non-p-C and pS475 should provide more precise insight into how serine phosphorylation might be affecting the conformational preference of the PH domain. It's difficult to see from Figure 4—figure supplement 3 how the cross-saturation transfer effect is stronger for non-phosphorylated versus tail-phosphorylated samples, as stated in the text. Could this be quantified in some way – perhaps showing the mean peak intensity ratios for each sample or a distribution of these ratios across all samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment. Although we think that interpreting the average of the CST effect over the entire PH domain might not be so edifying, we agree that the CST data can be presented in a more quantitative way (and we have explained the challenges in interpreting the CST data above). We have added a section in Figure 5 of the revised manuscript in which the CST effects over the four parts of the PH domain that we defined are presented for each phospho-state (Figure 5G). Statistical analysis of these PH domain parts revealed that the only significant differences are found for the short hinge (in which pSer473 makes it looser while pSer477/pThr479 makes it tighter) and for the C-terminal helix which shows a tighter interaction only in the pSer477/pThr479 case. We have highlighted these correlations in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The heavy focus on the loop following b3 (residues Gln43 and Asp44) seems driven (according to the text) by more dramatic chemical shift perturbation and more extensive line broadening in the phosphorylated forms compared to non-p-C. This seems a stretch as there are certainly other regions that show equally or nearly the same extent of spectral change (it's possible that the HSQC data itself makes the differences more evident, but expanded spectral data showing individual HSQC peaks are not provided).</p></disp-quote><p>We modified Figure 4 accordingly to add a few selected peaks, including Gln43 and Asp44, in an expanded spectrum (Figure 4C).</p><p>We included the following lines in the manuscript based on the CST data:</p><p>“Similarly, the CST behavior for Gln43 and Asp44 was closely linked on the phospho-state of the C-tail (Figure 5G and Figure 5—figure supplement 3) with an apparent loosening of the interaction for pSer473 but an apparent tightening for pSer477/pThr479.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The remainder of the paper focuses on a mutation of the native DVD sequence (residues 44-46) to GPG in an effort to &quot;favor a random coil secondary structure in this region.&quot; The authors do not characterize this mutant to determine whether the mutation successfully shifted secondary structure preference of the PH domain but instead put the mutation directly into their full-length semi-synthetic AKT. Despite the lack of characterization of the mutant, this is the one place in this paper where the authors see a dramatic result; Figure 5A shows that the mutation of the DVD motif causes a large decrease in the steady-state kinetics of AKT in its pSer473 form compared to wild type. The other phosphorylated form of AKT (pSer477/pThr497) is unaffected by the mutation in the PH domain. Clearly understanding the mechanistic basis for this difference would be an advance in this field but the manuscript as presented does not sufficiently explain the observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a detailed understanding of the DVD hinge in Akt regulation is incomplete. We think that the CST effects that the reviewers encouraged us to more quantitatively analyze, nicely correlate with the divergent catalytic impacts of DVD mutation between the two C-tail phospho-states. We believe that this unexpected structure-activity relationship in this part of the PH domain between the pSer473 and pSer477/pThr479 forms adds to our overall understanding of how Akt regulation is achieved by distinct patterns of C-tail phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In the Discussion, the authors interpret the failure of pSer473 to stimulate AKT activity as being due to changes in the &quot;normal dynamics&quot; of the DVD motif. Dynamics can be directly measured by NMR to support this conclusion, but this is surprisingly not included in the manuscript. The observation that activation loop phosphorylation (at Thr308) is also diminished upon mutation of the DVD motif to GPG might suggest that the mutation in the PH domain enhances the autoinhibitory contact between PH and kinase domains and/or alters the accessibility of the activation loop to PDK-1. Unfortunately, as presented, the manuscript provides little to advance our understanding of the precise role of this region of the PH domain in AKT regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that NMR dynamics experiments would be the best way to validate this hypothesis. However, typically a set of relaxation, CEST or relaxation-dispersion spectra takes about 40-60 times longer than a single 2D (due to their pseudo-3D nature and the longer recycling delays they require). In our case we are limited by concentration and sample stability. In our case a single 2D <sup>15</sup>N-TROSY-HSQC took about 50 hrs and at the end of the experiment, we saw heavy precipitation, which makes such dynamics experiments infeasible. In the revised manuscript, we modified the text to make clear that our hypothesis about the dynamics is inferred from the previously published crystal structures rather than from NMR data:</p><p>“This suggests that the normal dynamics (loop to helix transition) of this DVD motif is necessary for allowing the PH domain to dislodge from the kinase domain in response to pSer473.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In the final part of this work the authors explore the effects of drug binding on PIP3 binding as well as PH domain NMR chemical shifts. The data are not interpreted in a satisfactory manner; the authors state that &quot;Notably, some of the most significant chemical shift perturbations were detected in the PIP3-binding interface…&quot; but there are significant changes elsewhere in the PH domain as well. There is also no attempt to take into account the likely significant spectral changes that will arise from the drug itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We now recognize this shortcoming. As discussed above, we have discussed the MK2206 NMR changes in greater detail in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Finally, the last sentence of the paper suggests conformational heterogeneity might be present in the non-phosphorylated C-tail form of AKT. This is very logical and raises the question of whether the authors see any evidence for the existence of multiple states in solution for any of the segmentally labeled forms they have studied in this submitted paper or the previous 2018 publication?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not detect any proof of conformational heterogeneity in our spectra (e.g. peak doubling in the HSQCs). However, this can be due to a number of limitations including insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (due to low stability and long measurement times required) and incompatible time regimes (fast to intermediate exchange). We would have loved to perform relaxation dispersion or CEST experiments, which can shed light on the presence of minor states. As explained above, NMR dynamic experiments that theoretically are able to characterize such phenomenon are inaccessible in this experimental system. Therefore, we cannot address such heterogeneity by NMR at this stage. We have added the following sentence to the revised manuscript:</p><p>&quot;Although NMR dynamics experiments due to their very long time scales are not feasible with our current experimental system, future alternative approaches may allow this to be investigated.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Some of the kinetic parameters for the WT semi-synthetic AKT proteins shown in Figure 2 seem to differ a little from the parameters reported earlier in Chu et al., 2018. For example, the kcat/Km for A2 (full-length AKT phosphorylated on T308) in Figure 2 of Chu et al. is 28-fold smaller than the value reported in the current manuscript. In the present manuscript, the concentration range of ATP used is 0-2000 µM, whereas the Km values reported for A2, A1, and A6 (Figure 2 of Chu et al.) are 200, 5100, and 3700 µM, respectively. Perhaps the authors could clarify the apparent discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that the catalytic parameters of the wt phospho- and non-phospho-Akt enzymes analyzed here do not precisely match the data in Chu et al., 2018, they are within 3-fold for each state (and 2.8-fold but not 28-fold different for A2). We speculate that this may be due to some heterogeneity of PTMs in the recombinant portion of the enzymes made in insect cells and have added this potential explanation to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Perhaps mention that the reported kcat/Km's are apparent values as the second substrate (the peptide in this case) is not present at a saturating concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the qualifier &quot;apparent&quot; as suggested by the reviewers. However, we previously showed that the Km of the GSK3 peptide for all forms of Akt analyzed that contain pThr308 are ca. 3 μm meaning that we are likely working with saturating peptide substrate concentration in the cases analyzed here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) It would be helpful in Figure 1 if the various states were labeled as &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive.&quot; In Figure 1B, the ribbon diagram of the PH-kinase unit is drawn upside. In this and other figures (e.g., 4F), it would be helpful if structural components and parts were clearly labeled on the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we modified all of the figures displaying the Akt structure to show the canonical kinase domain structure with the N-lobe on top (e.g. Figure 1B, Figure 5D,E,F, Figure 8G). We also labeled the different domains of Akt as well as the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 in Figure 5F (previous Figure 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Can the authors comment on the purity of the samples used in Figure 2? Based on the figure supplement SDS-PAGE analysis, there appears to be a ~10-20% impurity. Can this be identified by MS analysis of the full-length protein to confirm that it isn't a species that will interfere with the analysis of enzyme kinetics?</p></disp-quote><p>The semisynthetic protein samples displayed in the SDSPAGE Figure 2—figure supplement 1 show about a 10% impurity. This impurity likely results from incomplete ligation of the C-tail peptide and/or trace proteolysis at the N- or C-terminus. Since prior work from our lab and others indicate that C-tail deletion of Akt is severely catalytically impaired. Moreover, these Akt forms have a 40 aa epitope tag at the N-terminus and we have shown previously (Chu et al., 2018) that the this tag (and its removal) has little or no effect on catalytic activity. Thus, we do not believe this impurity band should impact the interpretation of mutations/phosphorylation and their influence on kcat/Km values of the Akt forms in this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
