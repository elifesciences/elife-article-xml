In mouse, the gland undergoes active maturation immediately after birth. Here, we in detail portrayed the stem cell compartment of neonatal pituitary. Single-cell RNA-sequencing pictured an active gland, revealing proliferative stem as well as hormonal (progenitor) cell populations. The stem cell pool displayed a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype, characteristic of development-involved tissue stem cells. Organoid culturing recapitulated the stem cells’ phenotype, interestingly also reproducing their paracrine activity. The pituitary stem cell-activating interleukin-6 advanced organoid growth, although the neonatal stem cell compartment was not visibly affected in <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, likely due to cytokine family redundancy. Further transcriptomic analysis exposed a pronounced WNT pathway in the neonatal gland, shown to be involved in stem cell activation and to overlap with the (fetal) human pituitary transcriptome. Following local damage, the neonatal gland efficiently regenerates, despite absence of additional stem cell proliferation, or upregulated IL-6 or WNT expression, all in line with the already high stem cell activation status, thereby exposing striking differences with adult pituitary. Together, our study decodes the stem cell compartment of neonatal pituitary, exposing an activated state in the maturing gland. Understanding stem cell activation is key to potential pituitary regenerative prospects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The pituitary gland is a pea-sized structure found just below the brain that produces hormones controlling everything from growth and stress to reproduction and immunity. To perform its role, the pituitary gland needs specialised hormone-producing cells, but it also contains stem cells. These stem cells can divide to produce more cells like themselves, or differentiate into cells of different types, including hormone-producing cells.</p><p>In mice, the stem cells of the pituitary gland appear to be activated in the first few weeks after birth, and later become ‘quiescent’ (or lazy) in the adult pituitary gland. However, it remains unclear how the activated state found in the maturing gland is established and regulated.</p><p>To answer this question, Laporte et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing, a technique that allows researchers to profile which genes are active in individual cells, which can provide vital information about the state and activity of a tissue. The researchers compared the cells of the maturing pituitary gland of newborn mice to the cells in the established gland of adult mice. This analysis revealed that the maturing pituitary gland is a dynamic tissue, with populations of cells that are actively dividing (including the stem cells), which the mature pituitary gland lacks. Additionally, Laporte et al. established the molecular basis for the activated state of the stem cells in the maturing pituitary gland, which relies on the activation of a cell signalling pathway called WNT.</p><p>To confirm these findings, Laporte et al. used an organoid system that allowed them to recapitulate the stem cell compartment of the maturing pituitary gland in a dish. When Laporte et al. blocked WNT signalling in these organoids, the organoids failed to form or divide. Furthermore, blocking the pathway directly in newborn mice reduced the number of dividing stem cells in the pituitary gland. Both findings support the notion that WNT signalling is required to establish the activated state of the maturing pituitary gland in newborn mice.</p><p>Laporte et al. also wanted to know whether the newborn pituitary gland responded to injury differently than the adult gland. It had already been established that the adult pituitary stem cells become activated upon injury, and that the gland has some regenerative capacity. However, when Laporte et al. injured the newborn pituitary gland, the gland was able to fully regenerate, despite the stem cells not becoming more activated. This is likely because these cells are already activated (or ‘primed’), and do not require further activation to divide and repair the gland with the help of other proliferating cells.</p><p>With these results, Laporte et al. shed light on the activated state of the stem cells in the pituitary gland of newborn mice. This provides insight into the role of these stem cells, as well as unveiling possible routes towards regenerating pituitary tissue. This could eventually prove useful in medicine, in cases when the pituitary gland is damaged or removed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pituitary</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>WNT signaling</kwd><kwd>organoids</kwd><kwd>tissue maturation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11A3320N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1141717N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vennekens</surname><given-names>Annelies</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S14218N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nys</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11W9215N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vankelecom</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The neonatally maturing pituitary harbors an activated stem cell compartment and shows prominent regenerative capacity, as revealed by single-cell transcriptomic profiling and in vitro (organoid) and in vivo (mouse) exploration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As central hub of the endocrine system, the pituitary plays a quintessential role in governing the endocrine glands throughout the body, thereby regulating key physiological processes including growth, metabolism, fertility, stress, and immunity. To execute this primordial function, the pituitary has to properly develop into a compound gland of multiple endocrine cells, encompassing somatotropes (producing growth hormone [GH]), corticotropes (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]), lactotropes (prolactin [PRL]), gonadotropes (luteinizing hormone [LH] and/or follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]), and thyrotropes (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melmed, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Willems and Vankelecom, 2014</xref>). In the mouse, the pituitary undergoes an intense growth and maturation process during the first postnatal weeks, with number and size of hormone-producing cells substantively expanding following proliferation of committed (progenitor) and endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbajo-Pérez and Watanabe, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laporte et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sasaki, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taniguchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Simultaneously, the local stem cell (SOX2<sup>+</sup>) compartment shows signs of activation including elevated abundance and expression of stemness pathways when compared to the adult pituitary stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gremeaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laporte et al., 2021</xref>). The stem cells can give rise to new endocrine cells, a property which has been found most prominent (although not extensive) during this neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andoniadou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, stem cells in the mature, adult pituitary are quiescent and do not highly contribute to new endocrine cells during the (slow) homeostatic turnover of the gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andoniadou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laporte et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vankelecom and Chen, 2014</xref>). However, the adult stem cells become activated following local injury in the gland, showing a proliferative reaction and signs of differentiation toward the ablated cells, coinciding with substantial regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). We recently identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) to be upregulated in the adult pituitary (in particular its stem cells) upon this local damage which activated the stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is not clear what molecular mechanisms underlie the activation status of the stem cells in the neonatal gland.</p><p>Here, we set out to decode the stem cells’ phenotype during the neonatal pituitary maturation stage starting from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) interrogations, which uncovered an activation-designating hybrid epithelial–mesenchymal and WNT profile. We applied organoid and mouse models which supported and expanded the bioinformatic findings. Moreover, we found that the neonatal pituitary displayed high regeneration efficiency, more pronounced than in older mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willems et al., 2016</xref>), which is in line with its activated (stem cell) nature. Further decoding the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell activation may open the door toward regenerative approaches for repairing harmed pituitary tissue, having serious endocrine consequences. In this prospect, our single-cell transcriptome database of neonatal (as well as adult) pituitary provides a highly valuable resource.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptomics pictures prominent developmental activity in the neonatal maturing pituitary</title><p>To obtain a granular view on the cell type and activity landscape in the neonatal maturing pituitary, we performed scRNA-seq analysis of the major endocrine anterior pituitary (AP) from neonatal mouse (postnatal day 7, PD7), and contrasted the data with adult AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). After quality control and exclusion of doublets and dead and low-quality cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>), the neonatal AP cell transcriptomic data were integrated with our recent scRNA-seq dataset of adult AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>) followed by filtering-out of ambient RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unsupervised clustering and annotation using established lineage markers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>) revealed all main endocrine cell types, as well as distinct clusters of pericytes and of stem, mesenchymal, immune, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of note, the neonatal data also revealed a small contaminating cluster with posterior lobe (PL) signature (i.e., <italic>Nkx2-1</italic>, <italic>Rax</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2018</xref>] and pituicyte markers <italic>Scn7a</italic>, <italic>Cldn10</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>]), in addition expressing the stem cell markers <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the latter in accordance with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2018</xref>). In general, sizable overlap between neonatal and adult cell clusters was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; visualization using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection [UMAP]). In particular, two stem cell subclusters (SC1 and SC2) were discerned in the neonatal AP as before also identified in the adult gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). These subclusters exhibit a diverging transcriptomic fingerprint, with SC1 displaying more prominent expression of keratins <italic>Krt8</italic> and <italic>Krt18</italic>, and SC2 of <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), similar to the adult gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). Notwithstanding considerable overlap, clear differences emerged between neonatal and adult pituitary. First, the stem cell populations (both SC1 and SC2) are larger in neonatal than adult AP (three- to fourfold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), corroborated in situ by immunofluorescence analysis of the SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, higher proliferative activity was observed in this SOX2<sup>+</sup> cell compartment (as assessed by Ki67 immunoanalysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as also found before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gremeaux et al., 2012</xref>). In accordance, the scRNA-seq interrogation exposed a clear proliferative stem cell cluster (Prolif SC; as identified by coexpression of proliferation genes <italic>Mki67</italic>, <italic>Pcna</italic>, <italic>Top2a</italic>, <italic>Mcm6</italic>, with stem cell markers <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Krt8</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>) in the neonatal AP, not discerned in the adult gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In further support of an endocrine progenitor phenotype (as opposed to a stem cell state), DEG analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in hormone production (e.g., <italic>Chga</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic>, <italic>Cga</italic>, and <italic>Insm1</italic>) and enrichment of GO terms related to endocrine differentiation and secretion when compared to the stem cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s2sdata3">Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, scRNA-seq interrogation captured and embodied the prominent developmental activity that is taking place in the maturing neonatal gland, epitomized in the stem cell as well as endocrine lineage phenotypes. While the hormonal cell types (particularly somatotropes and lactotropes) rise in abundance toward adulthood, stem cells as well as supportive mesenchymal cells (MC) are more numerous in the neonatal gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that the latter populations play an active role in the critical development and growth of the gland at this acute period after birth, which becomes less prominent at mature age.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neonatal pituitary stem cells display a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype</title><p>Using the scRNA-seq dataset, we assessed the epithelial character of the stem cell clusters. Surprisingly, the stem cell compartment of the neonatal AP displays a highly mixed epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype, manifestly expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal markers, which is clearly faded in the adult gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In accordance, cells that coexpress the epithelial markers cytokeratin 8 and 18 (CK8/18) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) were found in the marginal zone (MZ) SOX2<sup>+</sup> stem cell niche of the neonatal pituitary, and were visibly less prominent in the adult gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, coexpression of SOX2 with VIM was more pronounced in the neonatal gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Indeed, normalized to the absolute number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells seeded per well, the proportion of organoid-initiating SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells is ~10-fold higher in neonatal than adult AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, organoid formation efficiency reflects the higher intrinsic activation (or ‘primed’) status of neonatal pituitary stem cells per se.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video1" xlink:href="elife-75742-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse video of neonatal anterior pituitary (AP) organoid formation.</title><p>Video reconstruction of live time-lapse brightfield images captured by IncuCyte S3 (following the timepoints shown in the timetable on the video) of organoid culture after neonatal AP cell seeding (P0).

Interestingly, when co-cultured, neonatal (PD7) AP organoids (as developed from WT mice) elevate the outgrowth of organoids from adult AP (as established from ubiquitously tdTomato(tdT)-expressing <italic>ROSA26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), coinciding with increased proliferation of the adult AP organoid-constituting stem cells, showing a Ki67<sup>+</sup> index reaching the one of neonatal AP-derived organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, organoids from neonatal AP reflect the stem cell compartment of the gland at this developmental stage regarding its activated and signaling center phenotype.</p><p>One factor that may be responsible for activating the stem cells in the neonatal pituitary is IL-6 which we recently uncovered as pituitary stem cell-activating factor in adult mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, gene expression of <italic>Il6</italic> is low in neonatal AP when compared to adult gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, gene-regulatory network (regulon) activity of the IL-6 signal-mediating JAK/STAT member <italic>Stat3</italic> is low as compared to adult gland (analysis using ‘single-cell regulatory network inference’ (SCENIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notwithstanding, IL-6 is still produced, and beneficial, for AP organoid development. Indeed, a significantly smaller number of organoids grew from <italic>Il6</italic> knockout (<italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) versus WT neonatal AP, which was (partially) rescued by adding exogenous IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, although IL-6 addition did not significantly increase the number of organoids formed from WT (<italic>Il6<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) neonatal AP (most likely because the stem cell activation status is already high) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), it strongly enhanced the passageability of the organoid cultures, from 4 to 5 passages without IL-6 to at least 15 passages (6 months of expansive culture) with the cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), as also observed before for adult AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). Addition of IL-6 is considered to compensate for the decline in endogenous levels that is observed at passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Of note, the organoids robustly retained their stemness phenotype during the long-term expansion, showing consistent stem cell marker expression (and hormone absence) between early (P2) and late (P8–11) passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Intriguingly, the in vivo lack of IL-6 does not visibly affect the SOX2<sup>+</sup> stem cell compartment and its proliferative phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Also, expression of other stem cell markers and of lineage progenitor and endocrine cell markers is not changed in the <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> neonatal AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). One possible explanation is that IL-6’s function is in vivo taken over by other cytokines when IL-6 is absent from conception. Expression of the IL-6 family members <italic>Il11</italic> and leukemia-inhibitory factor (<italic>Lif</italic>), and of the related cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (<italic>Tnf</italic>), was found slightly enhanced in the neonatal <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These cytokines, as well as the related IL-1β, did not significantly increase the number of organoids formed, but enhanced organoid expandability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>), all similar to IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). The effects of TNFα and IL-1β seem to be mediated by IL-6 since these cytokines did not rescue its absence in organoid culturing from <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>), and increased the expression of IL-6 (as measured in WT AP organoids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F</xref>). In contrast, the IL-6 family members LIF and IL-11, known to act through the same gp130/JAK–STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose-John, 2018</xref>), could substitute for IL-6 since increasing the number of developing organoids from <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> AP as well as their expansion (passaging), while not affecting <italic>Il6</italic> expression in WT AP organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). An important underlying role of JAK–STAT signaling in organoid development as well as expansion is supported by the strong reduction of both processes when adding the STAT3 inhibitor STATTIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Taken together, the adult pituitary stem cell activator IL-6, although not highly expressed in neonatal AP stem cells, still advances organoid culturing from neonatal AP but appears not absolutely required for in situ stem cell maintenance and proliferative behavior in the neonatal gland, potentially due to redundancy of other IL-6 family cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The neonatal pituitary stem cell compartment presents a pronounced WNT pathway</title><p>To continue the search for molecular mechanisms underlying the activated stem cell phenotype in the neonatal pituitary, we in further detail compared the neonatal and adult AP scRNA-seq datasets.

Besides, high regulon activity is also present in the MC and EC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Clearly, regulon activity of these WNT transcription factors is higher in neonatal than adult gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, violin plots). Furthermore, looking at upstream WNT pathway components, we found that ligands and receptors are overall higher expressed at neonatal age as analyzed in the whole AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We observed that the stem cell WNT pathway components remained expressed in the organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Addition of the WNT inhibitor XAV-939 (XAV; stabilizing the WNT-inhibitory protein AXIN2) at seeding (passage 0 [P0]) completely abolished organoid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Exogenous administration of WNT ligands (WNT5A and WNT3A) to these cultures did not have an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), thereby validating the complete blockage of the intracellular (canonical) WNT-signaling path by the supplemented XAV. Addition of IWP2 (which blocks endogenous WNT ligand palmitoylation, as needed for secretion from the cell) to the seeded AP cells significantly reduced the number of organoids formed, which was substantially rescued by adding exogenous WNT5A and WNT3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Of note, both WNT inhibitors decreased the proliferative activity in the organoids (added to formed organoids at d7 of P0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Together, these findings show that neonatal AP organoid growth, which reflects stem cell biology/activation, is dependent on (endogenous) WNT activity. Notably, RSPO1, which is typically used in organoid culturing (as we also did here and before, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>), is only slightly expressed in the neonatal pituitary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>) whereas <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression is prominent (especially in the MC cluster; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This naturally abundant RSPO ligand was found capable to replace RSPO1 for efficient organoid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Together, our findings advance the concept that the WNT pathway is an activator of pituitary stem cells. In support, addition of WNT5A or WNT3A to cultures from adult AP in which the stem cells are basically not activated (quiescent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>) and the WNT pathway is much less prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), increased stem cell proliferation in the organoids resulting in larger organoid structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Moreover, adding the WNT-signaling inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) (which binds to the WNT co-receptors LRP5/6 thereby blocking WNT ligand action) to the co-culture of neonatal (WT) and adult (tdT<sup>+</sup>) AP organoids resulted in decreased proliferative activity in the adult organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>), strongly supporting that the proliferation-activating effect of the neonatal organoid (stem) cells on the adult organoid (stem) cells, when cultured together (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), is mediated, at least partly, by paracrine WNT activity.</p><p>To in vivo validate our organoid-based finding that the WNT pathway plays a role in stem cell activation in the neonatal pituitary, we treated neonatal (WT) pups with the WNT pathway (porcupine) inhibitor LGK-974 (LGK; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). WNT target gene (<italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Lgr5</italic>) expression in the AP diminished following LGK administration, thereby verifying its activity and efficacy at the level of the pituitary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

First, we found that the mouse neonatal and fetal human pituitary showed significant overlap and high concordance in clustering outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Of note, in utero development of humans is more extended than of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2013</xref>), and the neonatal mouse stage thus rather corresponds to (late) embryonic stage in humans.

First, in strong contrast to our recent findings in adult pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Il6</italic> expression, being very low in neonatal pituitary (see above), was not upregulated in the stem cell and MC clusters following damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), in line with a lack of extra stem cell activation (while IL-6 activates the stem cells in adult pituitary following damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>]), together indicating that there is a striking difference in adult and neonatal pituitary (stem cell) reaction to damage. Moreover, also in line with the absence of additional stem cell activation, the WNT pathway appeared not to become extra fired, neither immediately upon damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), nor at later timepoints during the regenerative period (i.e., one (PD14) and two (PD21) weeks after damage infliction), as assessed by <italic>Lgr5</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Finally, there is also an increase in SOX2<sup>+</sup>GH<sup>+</sup> cells in damaged versus control gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting rising stem cell differentiation. DEG and GO analysis of all SC clusters together revealed enriched NOTCH signaling terms in control versus damaged pituitary, or in others words, that NOTCH signaling is downregulated in the stem cells following the inflicted injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s2sdata2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2—source data 2</xref>), which may be in line with the knowledge that NOTCH inhibition is needed for proper endocrine cell differentiation from stem/progenitor cells as observed during pituitary embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, restoration of the GH<sup>+</sup> cell population in the neonatal pituitary may encompass several mechanisms including proliferative activation of the PIT1<sup>+</sup> (progenitor) and derived (or existing) GH<sup>+</sup> cell populations, and GH/somatotrope differentiation of SOX2<sup>+</sup> stem cells, together embodying the active nature of the neonatal gland.</p><p>In conclusion, these data show that the dynamic neonatal gland more efficiently regenerates after injury than the adult gland, but that the already highly activated stem cell population does not show extra visible activation. Further insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of neonatal AP regeneration will derive from still more extended scRNA-seq and functional explorations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our study, we in detail portray the activated nature of the neonatally maturing pituitary, in particular of its stem cells, using single-cell transcriptome profiling and functional in vitro (organoid) and in vivo (mouse) exploration. The stem cell compartment, shown to be expanded and proliferatively activated in the neonatal gland, presents a pronounced WNT profile. Inhibiting WNT-signaling abrogated organoid formation and decreased proliferative activity of the neonatal pituitary stem cell compartment in vivo, thereby indicating the importance of the WNT pathway in the activated stem cell phenotype. This WNT signaling may act between the stem cells and supportive mesenchymal cells as projected by CellPhoneDB. Furthermore, the stem cells display a prominent hybrid E/M phenotype in the neonatal gland. A hybrid E/M character has recently also been found in the active stem/progenitor population of the fetal human pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). More in general, a hybrid E/M nature is present in stem/progenitor cells of developing organs (such as lung, intestine, and liver), and underlies their active contribution to the tissues’ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, the hybrid E/M phenotype of the neonatal pituitary stem cells likely embodies their active participation in the intense maturation process of the neonatal gland, as proposed during embryogenesis in human pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Along this line, we provide further indications that our findings in mouse are translatable to humans. Integrating our neonatal mouse AP scRNA-seq dataset with the recently published scRNA-seq data of fetal human pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) revealed considerable overlap, including an analogous WNT landscape. A pronounced WNT profile has recently also been reported in the early-postnatal (2-week-old) mouse pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, this study showed a paracrine-regulatory role of these stem cells, stimulating neighboring committed progenitor cells (as well as stem cells) to proliferate and expand. We also show this paracrine-stimulatory nature of neonatal (1-week-old) pituitary stem cells, inducing proliferative activation of (adult) AP stem cell organoids. Moreover, organoid culturing recapitulated the activated stem cell phenotype of the neonatal AP showing higher outgrowth efficiency. Together, these findings again indicate the faithful reproduction of pituitary stem cell biology and activation by our organoid model.</p><p>We recently found that IL-6 is promptly upregulated in the adult pituitary, in particular in its stem cells, following transgenically inflicted damage, associated with proliferative stem cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Il6</italic> expression did not rise following damage in the neonatal gland. Together, these findings suggest that the pituitary reacts to damage differently according to developmental age. Along the same line, the dynamic neonatal pituitary more efficiently (faster and more extensively) regenerates than the adult pituitary following the local injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), likely due to the presence of activated (‘primed’) stem, committed progenitor and just differentiated endocrine cells that all appear to contribute by increased proliferation or differentiation (as supported by transcriptomic and in situ immunostaining analyses). Of note, the somewhat lower somatotrope ablation grade in neonatal pituitary may also partly contribute to the higher regeneration level. Interestingly, efficient regenerative capacity is also present in other mouse organs at neonatal age (such as heart and cochlea), while seriously declining or disappearing in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lam and Sadek, 2018</xref>). Detailed unraveling of neonatal-pituitary regenerative mechanisms further needs profound studies, which may find ground in our existing and to be extended single-cell transcriptomic analyses.</p><p><italic>IL-6</italic> expression in the neonatal gland is low (much lower than in adult pituitary), and its absence does not visibly affect the neonatally activated stem cell compartment. Either, IL-6 is not needed in the neonatal gland to induce or sustain the activated stem cell phenotype, or its lack has been taken over by cytokine family members such as LIF or IL-11. We provide support for the latter, and also propose that the JAK/STAT pathway may be the common denominator that lies at the basis of stem cell activation in the neonatal gland, hence also critical for organoid outgrowth (as we show with STATTIC and suggest with the <italic>Il6<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse) and organoid expandability (as induced by the JAK/STAT-signaling factors IL-6, LIF, and IL-11). Adding IL-6 significantly prolonged the passageability of the organoids (as also found before for adult AP-derived organoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>]), thereby compensating for its declining expression at culturing which may be due the stem cells’ removal from the activating (micro-)environment and disappearance of stimulatory factors (such as IL-1β and TNFα which indeed stimulate IL-6 expression). Further research is now needed to unravel these hypotheses.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides deeper insight into the activated phenotype of the neonatal pituitary stem cell compartment. Together with the scRNA-seq datasets and organoid models developed from adult and aging pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vennekens et al., 2021</xref>), we provide an arsenal of tools to compose a comprehensive view on pituitary stem cell biology, activation and role across key time points of life.

Raw expression data were normalized by dividing feature counts of each cell by the total counts for that same cell and multiplying by 10,000 followed by log1p transformation. Next, co-expression modules were generated using GRNboost2 algorithm (v.0.1.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moerman et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequently, gene regulatory networks were inferred using pySCENIC (with default parameters and mm10__refseqr80__10 kb_up_and_down_tss.mc9nr and mm10__refseqr80__500 bp_up_and_100 bp_down_tss.mc9nr motif collections) resulting in the matrix of AUCell values that represent the activity of each regulon in each cell. The AUCell matrix was imported into Seurat for further downstream analysis, after which it was integrated using the default integration method, as described above. To generate regulon-based UMAP plots, the integrated AUCell matrix was scaled, centered, and subjected to PCA analysis and the top 20 PCs were selected for UMAP representation.</p><p>For integration of our dataset with the recently published human fetal pituitary scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), the standard Seurat v3 workflow was used as described above. Following integration, expression levels were scaled, centered, and subjected to PCA. The top 30 PCs were selected and employed for UMAP dimensionality reduction.</p><p>Interactions between pairwise cell clusters were inferred by CellPhoneDB v.2.1.5, which includes a public repository of curated ligands, receptors, and their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>). We ran the CellPhoneDB framework using a statistical method and detected ligand–receptor pairs that were expressed in more than 20% of cells.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Nancy Carrasco as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gwen Childs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Want pathway involvement with regard to data presented in Figure 2 must be tested.</p><p>2) Demonstration of other pituitary defects in IL6 null mice need to be reported.</p><p>3) New folliculo-stellate markers have been characterised in the mouse and should be tested to clarify the identity of MC cluster. what are the MC cells in both the murine and human datasets?</p><p>4) Data on the mechanisms of regeneration following toxin ablation of GH cells needs to be defined.</p><p>5) The language of terms used in the Text as pointed out by Rev 2 must be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The results presented in this manuscript are interesting, however further investigation would greatly improve their significance. Furthermore, I have some precise questions about some of the data.</p><p>What is the sex of the animal used in this study? If both sexes were used, was any potential sex difference examined? If only one sex was used, were the main conclusions tested on the other sex?</p><p>Co-cultures of young organoids with older ones increase proliferative abilities of the latter (Figure 2). The authors suggest that Wnt signalling may be involved but this could be tested using conditioned medium, and potentially manipulating Wnt pathway.</p><p>Removal of growth factors in the organoid medium does not affect growth of adult organoids but improve number of neonatal ones. Are these factors superfluous for adult organoids? The data clearly shows that they actively inhibit neonatal cells. I think the significance of these observations should be further explored and discussed. Is there any evidence that these pathways are active, or regulators expressed in the young but not the old stem cells?</p><p>Supplementation of Il6 null organoids with LIF or IL-11 appears to rescue organoid formation. Do they also improve self-renewal (passage number)? Is there a dual role of the JAK-STAT pathway on organoid formation efficiency and self-renewal/passageability? I found the interpretation of these data (line 233-245) difficult to follow. A clear distinction between organoid formation efficiency and passage number could be made to clarify the conclusions of the authors.</p><p>I understand that pituitary stem cell proliferation is normal in IL6 null glands. Did the authors examine for the presence of further pituitary defects?</p><p>The authors identify the MC cluster as folliculo-stellate cells. These were previously shown to express <italic>SOX2</italic>. Here this is clearly not the case (Figure 1B). In addition, in their human single-cell study (Zhang et al., 2020), the authors state that folliculo-stellate cells are not present. Therefore, the identity of the MC cluster in the re-analysis of their dataset (Figure 3G), that I could not find in the original study, is unclear to me. I would have expected the cluster identification to be conserved, so more detail is needed here such as the method used for the identification of the different clusters. New folliculo-stellate markers have been characterised in the mouse and should be tested here to clarify this issue: what are the MC cells in both the murine and human datasets? This deserves further investigation because of the potential Wnt-mediated crosstalk with stem cells suggested, but not substantiated, in the present study.</p><p>Following DT mediated GH-cell ablation, regeneration is observed. Because this system is Cre-mediated, it is difficult to perform lineage tracing and identify the cells generating the new somatotrophs. However, mechanisms leading to this regeneration are not further investigated. A potential role for Wnt signalling, in the context of earlier results, could have been examined?</p><p>Davis et al., 2016 should be replaced by Perez-Millan et al., (line 153).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. My concerns focus mainly on the grammar and context. The science is outstanding. The availability of data is outstanding.</p><p>2. Line 40 and Title. I am not certain the word vividly is used in the right context. The English meaning of vividly is brightly or intensely, clear, distinct, powerful, detailed, strongly, perceptibly, sharply, graphically. None of those synonyms would be appropriate as a way to describe neonatal development. Graphically is the only synonym that might be appropriate and indeed might be more appropriate than vividly. I am looking for another meaning that might fit with a bioinformatics type analysis and don't find one. There is no question that this is neonatal development, so why add an adverb that means &quot;brightly, intensely, powerful, strongly, distinctly, sharply, perceptibly….etc. If you mean graphically, then that should be used, but even that doesn't describe &quot;maturation&quot;.</p><p>3. Lines 83-100 and Figure 1. It appears that the posterior lobe was removed before cell dispersion. If so, that would have removed the intermediate lobe. However, melanotropes are still present from both groups, so it is not surprising that the PL cells are still there as well. Was the PL removed?</p><p>4. Line 131. The use of the word vivid is correct in this line as it points to powerful, distinct, detailed, etc. based on the findings.</p><p>5. Line 143. It is unclear what is meant by &quot;In line&quot;</p><p>6. Figure 1, bottom. Which is the neonatal pituitary and which is the adult pituitary in these immunolabeled fields.</p><p>7. Line 327. The English use of the word vivid is not appropriate in this context. What is meant by &quot;vivid neonatal&quot; pituitary. Of course one can see it clearly and it is developing, however vivid or even graphic is inappropriate here. It is simply a developing pituitary. Vivid only refers to the fact that you can perceive or see it intensely. Just discuss it as &quot;developing&quot; neonatal pituitary. Your analysis was robust and intense and comprehensive, however that describes the analysis, not the &quot;maturation&quot;.</p><p>8. Line 372. The concept &quot;vividly maturing&quot; is not comprehensible in English. One would never use a synonym of vividly, like &quot;brightly maturing, or distinctly maturing, or intensely maturing&quot;. The antonym for vivid would mean &quot;unable to be seen or indistinct&quot;. Clearly you can see maturation with a number of approaches, however just describing it by the fact that it can be seen &quot;brightly&quot; or distinctly&quot; is not descriptive. Unless there is a bioinformatics use of the word vividly of which I am unaware, another word should be chosen wherever it is used. One could use the word &quot;actively maturing&quot;, however because only one age was chosen, the dynamics of maturation must be assumed based on PN7. I suggest that the term vividly be omitted as it is not a descriptive adverb.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75742.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Want pathway involvement with regard to data presented in Figure 2 must be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this interesting request, and investigate whether WNT ligands, secreted by neonatal pituitary organoids mediate, at least partly, the increased proliferative growth of adult pituitary organoids when cultured together in a Matrigel droplet, we tested the following approaches.</p><p>First, as suggested by Reviewer 1, we collected conditioned medium (CM) from neonatal pituitary organoids and assessed whether expression of WNT target genes is increased in adult (fully-grown) pituitary organoids when exposed to this CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A, B</xref>). The outcome of this approach was not conclusive: although <italic>Lgr5</italic> expression appeared to be upregulated, the other universal WNT target gene <italic>Axin2</italic> was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Other target genes (such as <italic>Lgr6</italic>) were more variable. Although the Reviewer’s suggestion looked straightforward, a literature search did actually not reveal studies with such CM approach to show WNT ligand secretion and activity. Indeed, it is known that WNT ligands are secreted by cells in only minute quantities (Mikels et al., 2006); and are very short-range signals, not traveling far in tissue (Routledge et al., 2019), moreover being hydrophobic and getting associated with the ECM (Mikels et al., 2006). Hence, secreted WNT ligands, while able to affect neighboring cells in the close environment (as in the co-culture situation of neonatal + adult organoids), are expected not to be capable of leaving the Matrigel droplet at reasonable levels, moreover being highly diluted in the medium if a small minority of ligands would eventually be able to enter the CM.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the organoid CM experiment.

Adding this inhibitor to neonatal (WT) + adult (tdT<sup>+</sup>) AP organoid co-cultures resulted in decreased proliferative activity (% Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells) in the adult organoids These new findings strongly support that the rise in proliferation in adult pituitary organoids, when cultured together with neonatal pituitary organoids, is mediated, at least partly, by WNT (paracrine) activity. We now included these new data in the Results section (lines 317-322), and added them to Figure 3 —figure supplement 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Demonstration of other pituitary defects in IL6 null mice need to be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>In answer to this understandable question of Reviewer 1, we would like to clarify that the full examination and phenotyping of IL6 null pituitary (at multiple ages in both homeostatic and perturbed conditions) will be part of a comprehensive, forthcoming publication that we are preparing. In short, in neonatal IL6 null pituitary, no major phenotype regarding stem, progenitor and endocrine cells is observed in homeostatic conditions. To already touch upon this in the current study (without including and revealing all detailed analyses meant to be incorporated in the new paper), we provide extra gene expression data of stem, progenitor and endocrine cell markers in the neonatal IL6 KO <italic>versus</italic> WT pituitary, showing no differences (see lines 235-237 and new Figure 2 —figure supplement 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) New folliculo-stellate markers have been characterised in the mouse and should be tested to clarify the identity of MC cluster. what are the MC cells in both the murine and human datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>The historically designated folliculo-stellate (FS) cells have eventually been found to represent a heterogeneous cell population in the pituitary, encompassing, among others, paracrine-regulatory, mesenchymal supportive as well as stem cells. Indeed, mapping the newly proposed FS cell markers (as reported by (Ho et al., 2020) and by (Fletcher et al., 2021) (rat pituitary) on our dataset revealed enriched expression in the mesenchymal cell (MC) and stem cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response images 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">3</xref>) and in pericytes (markers from (Ho et al., 2020); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), cells being a general part of the mesenchymal component of tissues. Thus, it is clear (thereby supporting many previous observations) that FS cells do not form a delineated separate cell cluster but that this ‘flag covers multiple cargos’, being distributed over the stem cell and MC clusters. Comparable findings are observed in the human fetal pituitary dataset (Zhang et al., 2020) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response images 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">3</xref>).

In our current study, we found that several of these growth factors are not needed (rather impedimental) for neonatal pituitary organoid growth. To address the suggestion of the reviewer, we analyzed whether corresponding factors/regulators are indeed higher expressed in neonatal than adult stem cells (which thus may explain why they are not needed for neonatal organoid growth). Indeed, among others, <italic>Fgf10</italic> and <italic>Igf1,</italic> together with their receptors <italic>Fgfr2</italic> and <italic>Igf1r</italic>, as well as noggin (<italic>Nog</italic>), are found higher expressed in the neonatal than adult stem cells, as extracted from the scRNA-seq data. Moreover, these expression differences remain present when the stem cells are grown as organoids.

We also specified this better in the text (lines 250-252).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I understand that pituitary stem cell proliferation is normal in IL6 null glands. Did the authors examine for the presence of further pituitary defects?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see answer above (point 2 of Essential revisions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors identify the MC cluster as folliculo-stellate cells. These were previously shown to express SOX2. Here this is clearly not the case (Figure 1B). In addition, in their human single-cell study (Zhang et al., 2020), the authors state that folliculo-stellate cells are not present. Therefore, the identity of the MC cluster in the re-analysis of their dataset (Figure 3G), that I could not find in the original study, is unclear to me. I would have expected the cluster identification to be conserved, so more detail is needed here such as the method used for the identification of the different clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>For the definition/description of folliculo-stellate (FS) cells and their relation to MC (and other cell types including stem cells), please see already our answer above (point 3 of Essential revisions). In particular, FS cells represent a heterogeneous cell population encompassing, among others, supportive cells (MC) and stem cells. In other words, the MC population is a part of the heterogeneous FS cell population, as also the stem cell population is. Hence, <italic>SOX2</italic>, indeed previously reported to be expressed by the (heterogeneous) FS cell population, is expressed in its stem cell part, whereas the MC part expresses mesenchymal (but not stem cell) markers. In our manuscript, we do not ‘identify the MC cluster as FS cells’, but mention that the MC cluster is a part of the formerly designated FS population (lines 280-283). Of note, the term FS cells is used in literature in ambiguous ways: (Ho et al., 2020) designate an FS cell cluster not containing stem cells (thus, no co-expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and ‘FS cell’ markers), whereas (Fletcher et al., 2021) report clear co-expression, all together pointing to a certain level of ambiguity in the definition and marker profile of FS cells (or, ‘what’s in a name?’). By the way, also (Zhang et al., 2020) report the FS cell marker <italic>S100B</italic> in some of the stem cells, not different from the S100B-negative stem cells regarding DEGs.</p><p>Regarding the MC cluster in the human scRNA-seq dataset of (Zhang et al., 2020), in supplementary figure 1D of the publication which shows the entire UMAP of all &gt;4,000 sequenced cells, the MC cluster is indicated. However, in the main text, the authors state that ‘nine clusters of anterior pituitary endocrine cells including the stem cells (Stem), cycling cells (CC), corticotropes, progenitors of the PIT-1 lineage (Pro.PIT1), somatotropes, lactotropes, thyrotropes, precursors of gonadotropes (Pre.Gonado) and gonadotropes, comprising 2,388 cells<italic>’</italic> were used for further analysis, causing the fact that the MC cluster is not visible in the main figures (as the reviewer noticed). However, here in our present analyses, we used and analyzed the entire dataset of (Zhang et al., 2020), therefore also revealing the MC cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>New folliculo-stellate markers have been characterised in the mouse and should be tested here to clarify this issue: what are the MC cells in both the murine and human datasets? This deserves further investigation because of the potential Wnt-mediated crosstalk with stem cells suggested, but not substantiated, in the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see answer above (point 3 of Essential revisions). The potential crosstalk, as inferred from CellPhoneDB analysis (Figure 3D), will in follow-up studies indeed be comprehensively examined, thereby needing extensive genetic mouse and (composite) organoid models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following DT mediated GH-cell ablation, regeneration is observed.

I am not certain the word vividly is used in the right context. The English meaning of vividly is brightly or intensely, clear, distinct, powerful, detailed, strongly, perceptibly, sharply, graphically. None of those synonyms would be appropriate as a way to describe neonatal development. Graphically is the only synonym that might be appropriate and indeed might be more appropriate than vividly. I am looking for another meaning that might fit with a bioinformatics type analysis and don't find one. There is no question that this is neonatal development, so why add an adverb that means &quot;brightly, intensely, powerful, strongly, distinctly, sharply, perceptibly….etc. If you mean graphically, then that should be used, but even that doesn't describe &quot;maturation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the word ‘vivid/vividly’ to indicate the actively (‘powerfully’, ‘intensely’) maturing state of the pituitary at this neonatal age.

The English use of the word vivid is not appropriate in this context. What is meant by &quot;vivid neonatal&quot; pituitary.

Clearly you can see maturation with a number of approaches, however just describing it by the fact that it can be seen &quot;brightly&quot; or distinctly&quot; is not descriptive. Unless there is a bioinformatics use of the word vividly of which I am unaware, another word should be chosen wherever it is used. One could use the word &quot;actively maturing&quot;, however because only one age was chosen, the dynamics of maturation must be assumed based on PN7.
