However, the fitness effect of gene expression in mediating stress response and adaptation remains largely unexplored. Here, we use an integrative field dataset obtained from 780 plants of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic> (rice) grown in a field experiment under normal or moderate salt stress conditions to examine selection and evolution of gene expression variation under salinity stress conditions. We find that salinity stress induces increased selective pressure on gene expression. Further, we show that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs rather than <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs are primarily associated with rice’s gene expression under salinity stress, potentially via a few master-regulators. Importantly, and contrary to the expectations, we find that <italic>cis-trans</italic> reinforcement is more common than <italic>cis-trans</italic> compensation which may be reflective of rice diversification subsequent to domestication. We further identify genetic fixation as the likely mechanism underlying this compensation/reinforcement. Additionally, we show that <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are under balancing and purifying selection, respectively, giving us insights into the evolutionary dynamics of gene expression variation. By examining genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic variation across a rice population, we gain insights into the molecular and genetic landscape underlying adaptive salinity stress responses, which is relevant for other crops and other stresses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants face numerous stresses that reduce their growth and fitness, and they have a variety of adaptations to help them deal with environmental challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mareri et al., 2022</xref>). For crop plants, stresses such as drought, heat, and salinity can greatly limit productivity and agricultural sustainability worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fahad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kopecká et al., 2023</xref>); indeed, as a direct result of various abiotic stresses, an estimated ~50–70% of crop yields are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francini and Sebastiani, 2019</xref>). While there is a wealth of information on the physiological responses of plants, including crops, to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>), we are still developing an understanding of the underlying genetic responses to stress and the complex interactions between stresses and environmental cues, networks of gene expression regulation, physiological responses and ultimately plant fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cramer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Much of the research on the genetic basis of stress responses in crops has focused on identifying individual genes associated with specific responses and/or tolerance traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar and Wigge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Laohavisit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Stress responses, however, are complex traits that can be influenced by multiple genetic pathways with numerous interconnected genes. Expression levels of genes are controlled by regulatory elements and are often environmentally induced, suggesting a critical role of regulatory divergence in adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Clercq et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wilkins et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, changes in gene expression can lead to changes in the transcript network correlational structure, reshaping regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lea et al., 2019</xref>) and influencing the way in which gene expression variation can influence adaptation to stressful environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Signor and Nuzhdin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wagner and Lynch, 2008</xref>). As such, there is an increasing need to understand how evolutionary dynamics of gene expression and transcript abundance relate to the genetic underpinnings of stress responses and adaptation in crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ruffley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>One of the most important stresses for many plants is salinity. Soil salinity causes osmotic imbalance between the plant and the soil, which impedes the uptake of water and other key nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hakim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Munns, 2002</xref>), possibly leading to acute ion toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). While some plants are considered halophytic and can thrive in saline environments, other plants are highly sensitive to salts and experience negative effects of salinity even at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carillo et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (Asian rice) is one such salt-sensitive crop, facing significant yield loss due to soil salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hussain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Melino and Tester, 2023</xref>). Rice responds to salinity stress by adjusting physiological and biochemical processes involved in osmotic and ion homeostasis, nutritional balances and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Qin and Huang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Although studies have identified multiple genes associated with these processes (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ponce et al., 2021</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), we still lack a systems-level understanding of how gene expression variation mediates responses to salinity stress and evolves at the molecular level.</p><p>Here, we use an integrative system genomics approach to comprehensively dissect the genome-wide molecular and phenotypic response to salinity stress in rice. This study builds on prior work by our group that examined selection on gene expression in rice in response to normal and dry conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Groen et al., 2021</xref>). Using genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic datasets obtained from 130 diverse accessions of rice subjected to moderate levels of salinity stress, we (i) explore the selection on gene expression variation under salinity stress, (ii) dissect the genetic architecture of gene expression variation under saline conditions, and (iii) identify genes, molecular pathways, and salt stress response traits as well as associated trade-offs in the saline environment. We demonstrate that salinity stress induces increased selective pressure on gene expression, and we identify variation in biological processes and physiological traits that is beneficial and detrimental to plants in a saline environment, providing novel insights into the molecular landscape underlying an adaptive response to excess salt. We integrate these datasets with genomic sequence information to elucidate the genetic architecture and regulatory networks governing rice’s response to salinity stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Variation in transcript abundance</title><p>To understand the microevolutionary dynamics of gene expression variation under salinity stress, we first investigated variation in transcript abundance in 130 accessions of <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic>.

Leaf blades were sampled 38 days after sowing (DAS), corresponding to 7 days of plants being exposed to stress in the saline field. Population variance in gene expression of 18,141 widely expressed transcripts was partitioned into genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype ×environment (G×E) effects using a two-way mixed analyses of variance (ANOVA) with environment as a fixed effect and genotype and genotype ×environment as random effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). At a conservative false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.001, all but 3 transcripts displayed a significant genotype effect, indicating that expression levels of most transcripts are heritable.

The significant G×E indicates genetic variation for plasticity, indicating that this plasticity can evolve. Although we see a widespread heritable plastic response in gene expression, we found no evidence of genotype-dependent plasticity in fitness (G×E for fitness p=0.49; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), indicating that the G×E of transcripts does not translate to the complex trait of fitness. This could be due to a combination of factors, like gene interactions (pleiotropy and epistasis) leading to little to no effect on fitness, or environment specific genotype-dependent gene regulation (environment specific eQTLs). Furthermore, only a relatively small number of transcripts (254) showed significant variation due to E, indicating genotype-independent plasticity in gene expression for only a small fraction of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selection on gene expression</title><p>To identify transcripts associated with high fitness in normal and saline environments, we measured the strength of selection on gene transcript levels.

From hereon, we use positive and negative directional selection to represent the case where higher fitness is associated with increase and decrease in trait value, respectively. Stabilizing and disruptive selection similarly represent the situations where higher fitness is associated with average vs extreme value of the trait, respectively. In contrast, we limit the use of positive and purifying selection to their molecular evolution definition, that is to represent the case where increase in fitness is associated with derived and ancestral allele, respectively.

Since the detection of CN relies on p-value being significant in only one environment, compared to the detection of AP which relies on p-value being significant in both environments, this introduces a bias towards the detection of CN. To account for this inherent bias, we used a more stringent p-value cutoff to define CN (a transcript with p&lt;0.025 in one environment and p&gt;0.05 in the other environment) in comparison to AP (a transcript with p&lt;0.05 in both environments and opposite directionality of <italic>S</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Siddiqui et al., 2021</xref>).

This finding contrasts with prior work in rice under dry and wet conditions that found a lack of constraint in response to selection for most traits except seed size because direct and indirect responses to selection were largely similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calic et al., 2022</xref>), indicating that different types of stress may either constrain or facilitate the response to selection.</p><p>We found PCs enriched for metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and secondary metabolites to be under selection in the normal environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

These regions can occur either due to low amounts of recombination (high linkage disequilibrium- LD) or because they contain master-regulators that pleiotropically control expression of multiple functionally-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hammond et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kliebenstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">West et al., 2007</xref>). To account for LD and identify regions likely to contain master-regulators, we chose to focus on the subset of genes regulated by the lead-SNPs (SNP with the most significant association) in a given 100 kb region. Through this approach, we identified 11 <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL hotspots (number of unique genes &gt;30) in saline conditions, but none in normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). These results indicate that natural variation in gene regulation under stress conditions may be dependent on a few master-regulators, as has been shown for drought stress in rice and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kuroha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, one of the hotspots, Chr7: 25.9–26.0 Mb, influenced the expression of a disproportionately high number of genes (191 genes) and contains the gene <italic>OsFLP</italic>, a R2R3 myb-like transcription factor that regulates stomatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>OsFLP</italic> has recently been associated with salt tolerance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Qu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown previously that when a gene is regulated via both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> factors, their effects tend to drive target gene expression in opposite directions, canceling the combined effect on expression. This is commonly referred to as <italic>cis-trans</italic> compensation, which is thought to arise due to stabilizing selection that maintains similar gene expression over evolutionary timescales in the face of new mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goncalves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Landry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lovell et al., 2018</xref>). Contrary to this expectation, we found that more than half genes appear to have a reinforcing (<italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> effect in the same direction) rather than a compensatory pattern (two-tailed proportion z-test p=1.65 x 10<sup>–11</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>).

This pattern held for normal conditions as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). Since these reinforcing genes have <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> variants acting in the same direction, it indicates that the expression of these genes are expected to either increase or decrease over evolutionary timescales, indicating the presence of directional selection.</p><p>We hypothesized that this excess of reinforcing rather than compensatory effects could be driven by the extensive diversity among rice landraces that arose from crop diversification following domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Meyer and Purugganan, 2013</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we examined whether genes under <italic>cis-trans</italic> reinforcement showed evidence of higher inter-varietal variation in gene expression (population-wide variance between mean accession expression levels) as compared to genes under <italic>cis-trans</italic> compensation. Supporting our hypothesis, we found significantly higher inter-varietal expression variation for genes under <italic>cis-trans</italic> reinforcement in saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test=0.002; mean-inter-varietal expression variation compensating = 1.12, reinforcing = 1.27) and in normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>) conditions. Furthermore, it has been suggested that <italic>cis-trans</italic> compensation/reinforcement can arise due to the genetic fixation of compensating/reinforcing <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants, potentially due to epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McManus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Signor and Nuzhdin, 2018</xref>), which could lead to elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants acting on a gene. This was indeed the case: estimated LD between all pairs of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants for the identified compensating and reinforcing genes was significantly higher as compared to the background LD (mean r<sup>2</sup> compensating: 0.33, reinforcing: 0.36, background = 0.056; two-tailed permutation test p=0.0019).</p><p>To examine the pattern of past selection acting on <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs (before, during and after rice domestication, including the crop diversification phase) we plotted the folded site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of the minor allele frequencies and inferred the relative strength of historic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joly-Lopez et al., 2020</xref>) We found that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs for both environments had been under strong purifying selection, with the SFS being significantly left-shifted compared to background SNPs (two-tailed t-test p&lt;10<sup>–16</sup>; mean MAF background = 0.20, <italic>trans</italic> normal = 0.0936, <italic>trans</italic> saline = 0.0910). Not surprisingly, given their highly pleiotropic nature, this effect was more pronounced for <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs regulating multiple genes (two-tailed t-test p&lt;10<sup>–16</sup>; normal mean MAF in unique <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs=0.099, multiple <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL=0.073; saline mean MAF in unique <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs=0.097, multiple <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL=0.071).

In this study, we used a systems genomics approach to examine genome-wide transcript levels in rice in both normal and moderately saline field conditions to examine the evolutionary response and genetic architecture of gene expression under salinity stress. We found selection on expression of a set of genes, and for some genes, selection on expression differed among environments, indicating that salinity can select for changes in gene expression. We saw that the genetic regulatory pathways can be modified by salinity, as indicated by decoherence, which provides a potential genetic mechanism underlying salinity tolerance. We found limited evidence for trade-offs given a lack of antagonistic pleiotropy in the fitness effects of expression compared across environments, and we also found that there did not appear to be strong cis-trans compensation in gene regulation. These results provide us with insights into the fitness consequences and genetic architecture of gene expression under salt stress in rice, as we discuss below.</p><p>One of the primary goals of this study was to characterize selection on gene expression and how this selection varies between saline and normal conditions. Before discussing our results, it is important to note that our conclusions are influenced by the way in which selection differentials are standardized. Selection differentials are estimated through regression coefficients in the relationship between trait values and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lande, 1979</xref>). Because traits are often measured on different scales, selection differentials are usually standardized to allow for meaningful comparisons and interpretation. The most common method of standardization is variance standardization, in which traits are standardized to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lande and Arnold, 1983</xref>). With this approach, the selection differential, multiplied by the heritability, gives the expected response to selection in standard deviation units. So while this is a valid approach, there is concern that when variance-standardized selection differentials are interpreted as reflecting the ‘strength’ of selection based on their magnitude, they can be misleading because trait variance can vary among traits and environments, such that the trait variance and the magnitude of selection are conflated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hereford et al., 2004</xref>). Instead, the use of mean-standardized selection estimates have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hereford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Matsumura et al., 2012</xref>). However, it has not been widely recognized that mean-standardized selection estimates can also be biased if mean trait values vary consistently across conditions, such that magnitude of selection is conflated with trait means. We show here that this was indeed the case: the mean gene expression values differed consistently between saline and normal conditions, leading to biases when comparing the strength of selection across treatments when mean-standardized selection differentials were used. Specifically, using mean-standardized selection coefficients, we found selection on gene expression to be stronger under normal conditions, whereas unstandardized and variance-standardized selection coefficients indicated stronger selection under saline conditions. This result indicates that it is important for researchers to carefully consider the advantages and potential drawbacks of both variance-standardized and mean-standardized, as well as unstandardized, selection differentials in making decisions about which to use in any particular system and depending of the goals of the study, but also to consider these ideas in interpreting selection differentials as reflecting the strength of selection.</p><p>Because we found that both variance-standardized and mean-standardized selection gradients were biased, as explained above, we draw our conclusions about patterns of selection using unstandardized selection gradients. We believe this approach to be appropriate given that gene expression values are measured on the same scale and normalized for every transcript, and our goal is to identify transcripts under selection and compare selection across treatments. Using unstandardized selection coefficients, our study shows that most genes appear to have nearly neutral levels (|<italic>S</italic>|&lt;0.1) of selection on transcript levels in both normal and saline environments. This is consistent with previous studies conducted in various plant and non-plant species, which have shown that most traits (including transcript abundance) are under very weak selection, and only a few traits experience strong selection at microevolutionary timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoekstra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kingsolver et al., 2001</xref>). There does seem to be a tendency, however, towards stronger positive over negative directional selection on gene expression, meaning that higher expression of a majority of genes is generally associated with higher fitness. Looking at quadratic selection, we found evidence for both stabilizing and disruptive selection on gene expression. Our results are consistent with the expectation of stabilizing selection being more common than disruptive selection in normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kingsolver et al., 2001</xref>), and reinforce the idea that disruptive selection is more widespread under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2021</xref>), potentially reflecting the prevalence of frequency- and density-dependent competition for resources under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kingsolver and Pfennig, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Comparing the distribution of selection coefficients, we further found that selection was stronger in moderate stress saline field conditions compared to normal wet paddy field conditions, indicating that salinity stress induced increased selective pressure on gene expression at microevolutionary timescales. Although exposure to salinity stress increased the strength of selection on gene expression, this increase was relatively low compared to what has been reported for drought stress in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal and Whitlock, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kondrashov and Houle, 1994</xref>). This could potentially be attributed to the levels of stress experienced by the plants – the drought stress treatment was more severe in terms of fitness after stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal and Whitlock, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kondrashov and Houle, 1994</xref>) in comparison to the moderate salinity stress in this study – but further work is needed to examine whether there is indeed a relationship between stress intensity and selection strength. While this work provides insight into the direction of selection and the predicted degree of evolutionary change under the specific conditions of this study, more work would need to be done over multiple generations and under additional conditions to make more realistic predictions of microevolutionary change in the field.</p><p>Our work contributes to an ongoing debate regarding whether the intensity of selection on gene expression increases under stress. We found in this study of rice and salinity, and in a prior study on drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>), that directional selection was greater under stress compared to normal conditions. This finding is consistent with prior studies on other systems like fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jasnos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kondrashov and Houle, 1994</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jasnos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kondrashov and Houle, 1994</xref>), but contrasts with a recent study in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reporting no change in selection due to increasing levels of nutritional stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbuthnott and Whitlock, 2018</xref>). Although we found selection to be stronger under saline conditions using total filled grain number as a measure of fecundity, a caveat to selection estimates is that they are sensitive to the proxy of fitness. Our results also support prior findings in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groen et al., 2020</xref>) and in <italic>Boechera stricta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>) that conditional neutrality may be much more common than antagonistic pleiotropy, although the lack of antagonistic pleiotropy could be due to lack of trade-offs in the years evaluated or to low power to detect small-effects trade-offs. Further, both conditional neutrality and antagonistic pleiotropy have been shown to underlie local adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wadgymar et al., 2017</xref>), following which our findings indicate that it may be feasible to breed salinity tolerant rice varieties without a yield penalty under non-saline conditions, though further work is needed to verify this.</p><p>We examined the genetic architecture of gene expression variation as well, and found that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs rather than <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs are primarily associated with rice gene expression under salinity stress, potentially via a few master-regulators. <italic>Trans</italic>-eQTLs may be important in environment-dependent gene expression changes, while <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs may be more robust to environmental changes as has been observed in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smith and Kruglyak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Snoek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sterken et al., 2023</xref>). This can be attributed to <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs’ larger mutational target along with a larger effect of drift than of positive selection in fixing them. These results further corroborates with other studies that have found a more dominant effect of <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs on within-species variation than between-species variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emerson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wittkopp et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We found that <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs show different patterns of selection, with <italic>cis-</italic>eQTLs showing evidence for balancing selection and <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs showing purifying selection. We see this pattern for rice, a largely selfing species, in contrast to outcrossing species where both <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-eQTLs</italic> have been found to be under purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Josephs et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies will be needed to investigate whether the mating system has an influence on the pattern of natural selection acting on variants regulating gene expression. Finally, and contrary to expectations, we show that under saline conditions, <italic>cis-trans</italic> reinforcement is more prevalent than <italic>cis-trans</italic> compensation. This result may be driven by rice domestication and subsequent population diversification. Additionally, we find significantly elevated levels of LD among the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants for compensating and reinforcing genes, indicating the role of genetic fixation as an underlying mechanism for <italic>cis-trans</italic> compensation/reinforcement.</p><p>Systems genomic approaches provide insights into large-scale patterns across genome-wide data over multiple scales. This approach can also identify possible genes or genetic pathways that may prove critical in various processes. Our analysis, for example, shows that many of the potential antagonistically pleiotropic genes are involved in photosynthesis and metabolic processes. Importantly, we found that the circadian rhythm pathway was under positive directional selection (selection for increased expression) in saline conditions and that the genes involved in circadian rhythm showed significant decoherence between the two environments. These findings make sense in light of the fact that circadian rhythm has been shown to regulate salt tolerance and flowering time in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wei et al., 2021</xref>), so responses to salt stress may alter the expression patterns of genes in the circadian rhythm network, leading to decoherence. In further support of this idea of a link between salt tolerance and circadian rhythm, our selection analyses on physiological traits shows that salt stress leads to selection for earlier flowering. Additionally, our decoherence analyses identified transcripts in important pathways related to plant responses and potentially tolerance to excess salts, including the carbon metabolic pathways (glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle), and accumulation of secondary metabolites and sugar moieties with osmoprotectant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacoby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krishnamurthy and Bhagwat, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Petrusa and Winicov, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yang and Guo, 2018</xref>). But as is with such analyses, detection of population-level correlations are temporally biased and may fail to detect the transient environmentally responsive links resulting in false negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai and Des Marais, 2023</xref>) and leading to the failure to detect temporally key processes.</p><p>Other genes that are beneficial only in the saline environment include a cyclophilin-encoding transcript (<italic>OsCYP2</italic>), which has been shown to confer salt tolerance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ruan et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, we also identified eQTL variants regulating expression of two photosynthesis related antagonistically pleiotropic transcripts (<italic>PSAN</italic> and <italic>CRR7</italic>) in the normal environment. Finally, our <italic>trans</italic>-eQTL analysis identified a hotspot on chromosome 7 that contains <italic>OsFLP</italic>, a R2R3 myb-like transcription factor that regulates stomatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and appears to be involved in salt tolerance in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Qu et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these loci are possible new targets for functional and translational studies of salinity stress in rice. Coupled with the insights gained by a systems genomic approach in inferring large scale patterns from genome-wide information, this integration of data across multiple scales across a rice population has allowed us to provide an integrated examination of the molecular and genetic landscape underlying adaptive plant salinity stress responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p>Domesticated rice is primarily classified into two distinct genetic subgroups, <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>japonica</italic>.

They present a convincing case to demonstrate that environment stress can induce selective pressure on gene expression, which is in agreement with their earlier study (Groen et al, 2020). The data seems to be a good fit for their study and overall the analytic approach is robust.</p><p>(1) The work started by investigating the effect of genotype and their interaction at each transcript level using 3'-end-biased mRNA sequencing, and detect a wide-spread GXE effect. Later, using the total filled grain number as a proxy of fitness, they estimated the strength of selection on each transcript and reported stronger selective pressure in saline environment. However, this current framework rely on precise estimation of fitness and, therefore can be sensitive to the choice of fitness proxy.</p><p>(2) Furthermore, the authors decomposed the genetic architecture of expression variation into cis- and trans-eQTL in each environment separately and reported more unique environment specific trans-eQTLs than cis-. The relative contribution of cis- and trans-eQTL depends on both the abundance and effect size. I wonder why the latter was not reported while comparing these two different genetic architectures. If the authors were to compare the variation explained by these two categories of eQTL instead of their frequency, would the inference that trans-eQTLs are primarily associated with expression variation still hold?</p><p>(3) Next, the authors investigated the relationship between cis- and trans-eQTLs at transcript level and revealed an excess of reinforcement over compensation pattern. Here, I struggle to understand the motivation for testing the relationship by comparing the effect of cis-QTL with the mean effect of all trans-eQTLs of a given transcript. My concern is that taking the mean can diminish the effect of small trans-eQTLs potentially biasing the relationship towards the large-effect eQTLs.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>After the revision, the article has improved substantially. The authors have addressed most of my concerns and suggestions, except for testing the eQTL reinforcement/compensation relationship in the context of genetic architecture. I understand the motivation for testing this relationship at the gene level to determine whether it arises from directional or stabilizing selection, rather than examining it in a cis-trans pairwise fashion. However, I find the definition of this relationship unclear. The authors state in line 824 that &quot;Genes were defined as compensating and reinforcing if they had at least 60% of individuals with opposite and same cis-trans allelic configuration, respectively.&quot; In contrast, if I understood correctly, the response to reviewers describes the relationship as reinforcing if the cis-eQTL effect is in the same direction as the mean effect of all the detected trans-eQTLs. I would request that the authors clarify their method of defining this relationship. Also, one should be aware of the fact that this relationship can evolve neutrally. Since there was no formal test performed to say it is otherwise, the authors might need to interpret the relationship carefully.</p><p>While the authors explain the possible factors that could lead to the trend of observing widespread genotype-dependent plastic responsse without significant genotype-dependent plasticity for fitness (L142), it is also important to consider the time axis. While filled grain serves as a proxy for fitness over time, gene expression profiles provide only a snapshot at a given time point. Therefore, temporal GxE dynamics may also play a role here.</p><p>Also, I am a little surprised by not mentioning anything about the code availability in this manuscript. I would request the authors to incorporate that in the revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99352.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this work, the authors conducted a large-scale field trial of 130 indica accessions in normal vs. moderate salt stress conditions. The experiment consists of 3 replicates for each accession in each treatment, making it 780 plants in total. Leaf transcriptome, plant traits, and final yield were collected. Starting from a quantitative genetics framework, the authors first dissected the heritability and selection forces acting on gene expression. After summarizing the selection force acting on gene expression (or plant traits) in each environment, the authors described the difference in gene expression correlation between environments. The final part consists of eQTL investigation and categorizing cis- and trans-effects acting on gene expression.</p><p>Building on the group's previous study and using a similar methodology (Groen et al. 2020, 2021), the unique aspect of this study is in incorporating large-scale empirical field works and combining gene expression data with plant traits. Unlike many systems biology studies, this study strongly emphasizes the quantitative genetics perspective and investigates the empirical fitness effects of gene expression data. The large amounts of RNAseq data (one sample for each plant individual) also allow heritability calculation. This study also utilizes the population genetics perspective to test for traces of selection around eQTL. As there are too many genes to fit in multiple regression (for selection analysis) and to construct the G-matrix (for breeder's equation), grouping genes into PCs is a very good idea.</p><p>In the previous review, three major points were mentioned. The manuscript was modified, and here I briefly summarize them as a reference for future works:</p><p>(1) The separate sections (selection analysis, transcript correlation structure change, and eQTL) could use better integration.</p><p>(2) It would be worth considering joint analyses integrating the two environments together.</p><p>(3) Whether gene expression PCs or unique expression modules should be used in selection analyses.</p><p>Regarding whether to use PCs or WGCNA eigengenes to summarize gene expression for selection analyses, the authors reported that only a few WGCNA eigengenes were under selection, citing this observation as the rationale for choosing PC over eigengenes. However, as the relative false positive-negative rates of these choices likely require another dedicated study to explore, at this stage, it might be premature to state which method is better based on which gives more positive results. On one hand, one could easily imagine that plants screwed up by salinity have erratic genomewide expression and become extreme data points on the PCs, making the PCs a good proxy to correlate with fitness. On the other, it remains to be discussed whether this genomewide screwed-up-ness is what we want to measure in this study or whether we should focus on more dedicated gene modules instead. I suggest the authors acknowledge both possibilities. In this revision, I do not see relevant WGCNA results (as mentioned in the previous response letter) reported.</p><p>Figure 4: The observation that chlorophyll a content is under negative selection under BOTH conditions is a bit counterintuitive. The manuscript only mentioned &quot;consistent with the general trend for reduced photosynthesis under salinity stress&quot; (line 329) but did not mention why this increased fitness, even in normal conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99352.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #4 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript examines how patterns of selection on gene expression differ between a normal field environment and a field environment with elevated salinity based upon transcript abundances obtained from leaves of a diverse panel of rice germplasm. In addition, the manuscript also maps expression QTL (eQTL) that explains variation in each environment. One highlight from the mapping is that a small group of trans-mapping regulators explains some gene expression variation for large sets of transcripts in each environment.</p><p>The overall scope of the datasets is impressive, combining large field studies that capture information about fecundity, gene expression, and trait variation at multiple sites. The finding related to patterns indicating increased LD among eQTLs that have cis-trans compensatory or reinforcing effects in interesting in the context of other recent work finding patterns of epistatic selection. The authors have made some changes that address previous comments. However, some analyses in the manuscript remain less compelling or do not make the most from the value of collected data. Although the authors have made several improvements to the precision with which field-specific terminology is applied and to the language chosen when interpreting analytical findings, additional changes to improve these aspects of the manuscript remain necessary.</p><p>Selection of gene expression: One strength of the dataset is that gene expression and fecundity were measured for the same genotypes in multiple environments. However, the selection analyses are largely conducted within environments. Addition of phenotypic selection analyses that jointly analyze gene expression across environments and or selection on reaction norms would be worthwhile.</p><p>Gene expression trade-offs: The terminology and possibly methods involved in the section on gene expression trade-offs need amendment. I specifically recommend discontinuing reference to the analysis presented as an analysis of antagonistic pleiotropy (rather than more general as trade-offs) because pleiotropy is defined as a property of a genotype, not a phenotype. Gene expression levels are a molecular phenotype, influenced by both genotype and the environment. By conducting analyses of selection within environments as reported, the analysis does not account for the fact that the distribution of phenotypic values, the fitness surface, or both may differ across environments. Thus, this presents a very different situation than asking whether the genotypic effect of a QTL on fitness differs across environments, which is the context in which the contrasting terms antagonistic pleiotropy and conditional neutrality have been traditionally applied. The results reported do not persuasively support the assertion made in the response to reviewers that the terminology is reasonable due to strong coupling between genotype and phenotype. A more interesting analysis would be to examine whether the covariance of phenotype with fitness has truly changed between environments or whether the phenotypic distribution has just shifted to a different area of a static fitness surface.</p><p>Biological processes under selection / Decoherence: In the initial review, it was noted that PCA is likely not the most ideal way to cluster genes to generate consolidated metrics for a selection gradient analysis. Because individual genes will contribute to multiple PCs, the current fractional majority-rule method applied to determine whether a PC is under direct or indirect selection for increased or decreased expression comes across as arbitrary and with the potential for double-counting genes. A gene co-expression network analysis could be more appropriate, as genes only belong to one module and one can examine how selection is acting on the eigengene of a co-expression module. Building gene co-expression modules would also provide a complementary and more concrete framework for evaluating whether salinity stress induces &quot;decoherence&quot; and which functional groups of genes are most impacted. Although results of co-expression network analyses are now briefly discussed in the response to reviewers, the findings and their relationship to the PCA/&quot;decoherence&quot; analyses are not reported in the manuscript.</p><p>Selection of traits: Having paired organismal and molecular trait data is a strength of the manuscript, but the organismal trait data are underutilized. The manuscript as written only makes weak indirect inferences based on GO categories or assumed gene functions to connect selection at the organismal and molecular levels. After prompted by the initial reviews to test for correspondence between SNPs that explain organismal and gene expression trait variation or co-variance of co-expression module variation and trait variation, the response to reviewers indicates finding negative results. These findings should be included in the manuscript text and discussed.</p><p>Genetic architecture of gene expression variation: More descriptive statistics of the eQTL analysis have been included, although additional information about the variation in these measures within environments would be useful. The motivation for featuring patterns of cis-trans compensation specifically for the results obtained under high salinity conditions remains unclear to me. If the lines sampled have predominantly evolved under low salinity conditions, and the hypothesis being evaluated relates to historical experience of stabilizing selection, then evaluating the eQTL patterns under normal conditions provides the more relevant test of the hypothesis.</p><p>Lines 280-282: The revised sentence continues to read as an overstatement and merits additional revision with citations.</p><p>Lines 379-381: Following revision, it still remains unclear how the interpretation follows from the above analysis; the inference as written goes significantly beyond what may be specifically inferable from the result.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99352.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #5 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The researchers examined selection across multiple levels, including gene expression, biological processes, and regulatory mechanisms, with a particular focus on comparing selection between different environmental conditions. They further explored potential evolutionary mechanisms. This is made possible with a comprehensive dataset comprising gene expression data from 130 accessions with three replicates collected in two environments in the field, genomic data from 125 genotypes, and associated physiological traits. The findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of stress adaptation, and the identified possible genes and pathways for further investigation.</p><p>The researchers began by focusing on the selection of gene expression across two environments, comparing the number of genes under selection and the effect sizes, as well as examining how selection in each environment acts on the same individual genes. They then expanded their analysis to consider selection in biological processes, investigating the relationships between selection acting on individual genes within processes and selection acting among different processes.</p><p>Additionally, they explored selection at the organismal level by examining traits.</p><p>The study further transitioned from analyzing individual gene expression to investigating gene-gene interactions. They briefly examined correlation variation among gene pairs between the two conditions, identifying pairs with rewired interactions that suggest potential selection on gene regulation or the effect of rewiring on tolerance. The researchers then delved into the genetic architecture underlying these patterns by mapping eQTLs. Their comparison of cis- and trans-eQTLs revealed that trans-eQTLs were more variable across conditions. Notably, they identified hotspots representing master regulators that possibly underlie the greater variability of trans-eQTLs across environments. They further discovered that trans-eQTLs are generally under purifying selection (particularly in salt conditions), while cis-eQTLs are under balancing selection, exhibiting higher nucleotide diversity. As for how cis- and trans-eQTL effects combine at the level of individual genes, more are found to be reinforced and the hypothesis of genetic fixation on cis- and trans-eQTL effects combination is further tested.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A key strength of this study is its comprehensive approach, extending beyond the analysis of gene expression to include gene-gene interactions, genetic architectures, and selections of genetic regulation factors. The exploration of gene expression selection through its connection with fitness, as introduced in the researchers' previous work, provides valuable insights into the role of gene expression in adaptation. The study investigates selection across multiple levels of biological responses, including individual gene expression, genes associated with biological processes, gene-gene interactions, and the underlying genetic architecture. The experimental design enables a direct comparison of selection between control and salinity conditions, which sheds light on the effects of stress on selection and the dynamics of adaptation to stress. Additionally, the manuscript is well-written, with a clear connection to current literature. The discussion effectively integrates findings with broader implications, making it a satisfying read.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The lack of formal testing for environment-specific selections (e.g., selection of gene expression specifically in salinity stress, PCs, or traits) is a major limitation, as previous reviewers have flagged. Explicit tests of eQTLs variation between conditions are introduced, so similar formal tests should also be introduced in selection sections. For example, a formal test of selections of gene expression might be helpful to solve variance/mean- standardization concerns between two environments.</p><p>Additionally, some aspects of the analysis appear somewhat arbitrary and could benefit from further sensitivity testing. Line 203: The concern about bias in detecting more CN than AP, as mentioned by the authors and previously flagged by reviewers, does not seem fully resolved with the current methods given the arbitrary cut-off. Incorporating additional tests suggesting the conclusion is insensitive to the cutoff would be very helpful. Similar is the classification of genes into compensatory and reinforcing categories based on 60% of individuals as a cutoff.</p><p>While this study focuses on gene regulation, its connection with the selection of gene expression and biological pathways is not well integrated. In particular, the discovery of eQTLs is not explicitly linked to gene expression selection or biological pathways, leaving this relationship underexplored. Suggestive comments: Currently the summarization of selection is based on eQTLs. It would be interesting to also summarize the selection patterns identified from previous sections based on genes being cis/trans-regulated. Moreover, it might be interesting to see if there is more loss or gain of eQTLs under salt stress and their functions. The current results mentioned variations of eQTLs but not clear if they are loss or gain. E.g., one way is to identify genes related to cis and trans-eQTLs and see their correlation changes with genes being regulated using CILP (also as a way to informatively narrow down gene pairs for CILP).</p><p>Similarly, the section on selection at the organismal trait level appears disconnected from the rest of the analysis (e.g., if it is not tested to be related to other features, mentioning why it might not be related would be helpful). Admittedly, the discussion of how biological processes discovered at different levels integrate together is helpful.</p><p>Other comments: given there is no comparison between loss of coherence (correlations) and gain of coherence under salinity stress to show the dominant role of decoherence, maybe need to also discuss the genes and processes related to the gain of coherence? This is because the understanding of activation (gain of coherence) of some regulations/processes under stress conditions could also be interesting. It is not clear if decoherence (e.g., lines 293-296) refers to significant correlation changes or just loss of the correlation in salinity stress.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms of how organisms respond to environmental stresses is a key goal of biological research. Assessment of transcriptional responses to stress can provide some insights into those underlying mechanisms. The researchers quantified traits, fitness, and gene expression (transcriptional) response to salinity stress (control vs stress treatments) for 130 accessions of rice (three replicates for each accession), which were grown in the field in the Philippines. This experimental design allowed for many different types of downstream analyses to better understand the biology of the system. These analyses included estimating the strength of selection imposed on transcription in each environment, evaluating possible trade-offs in gene expression, testing whether salinity induces transcriptional decoherence, and conducting various eQTL-type analyses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study provides an extensive analysis of gene expression responses to stress in rice and offers some insights into underlying mechanisms of salinity responses in this important crop system. The fact that the study was conducted under field conditions is a major plus, as the gene expression responses to soil salinity are more realistic than if the study was conducted in a greenhouse or growth chamber. The preprint is generally well-written and the methods and results are mostly well-described.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study makes good use of analyzing the dataset, it is not clear how the current work advances our understanding of gene regulatory evolution or plant responses to soil salinity generally. Overall, the results are consistent with other prior studies of gene expression and studies of selection across environmental conditions. Some of the framing of the paper suggests that there is more novelty to this study than there is in reality. That said, the results will certainly be useful for those working in rice and should be interesting to scientists interested in how gene expression responses to stress occur under field conditions. I detail other concerns I had about the preprint below:</p><p>The abstract on lines 33-35 illustrates some of my concerns about the overstatement of the novelty of the current study. For example, is it really true that the role of gene expression in mediating stress response and adaptation is largely unexplored? There have been numerous studies that have evaluated gene expression responses to stresses in a wide range of organisms. Perhaps, I am missing something critically different about this study. If so, I would recommend that the authors reword this sentence to clarify what gap is being filled by this study. Further, is it really the case that none of them have evaluated how the correlational structure of gene expression changes in response to stresses in plants, as implied in lines 263-265? Don't the various modules and PC analyses of gene expression get at this question?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-worded these sentences, and highlighted the novelty of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were some places in the methods of the preprint that required more information to properly evaluate. For example, more information should be provided on lines 664-668 about how G, E, and GxE effects were established, especially since this is so central to this study. What programs/software (R? SAS? Other?) were used for these analyses? If R, how were the ANOVAs/models fit? What type of ANOVA was used? How exactly was significance determined for each term? Which effects were considered fixed and which were random? If the goal was to fit mixed models, why not use an approach like voom-limma (Law et al. 2014 Genome Biology)? More details should also be added to lines 688-709 about these analyses, including what software/programs were used for these analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more details in the methods. Also, although we could in priciple use voom-limma to fit our mixed model, to be able to partition variance into G, E and G×E, we need to use the function fitExtractVarPartModel (from package VariancePartition) which requires all categorical variables to be modeled as random effects. Therefore, we couldn’t model environment as a fixed effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One thing that I found a bit confusing throughout was the intermixing of different terms and types of selection. In particular, there seemed to be some inconsistencies with the usage of quantitative genetics terms for selection (e.g. directional, stabilizing) vs molecular evolution terms for selection (e.g. positive, purifying). I would encourage the authors to think carefully about what they mean by each of these terms and make sure that those definitions are consistently applied here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have defined the selection terms used in the study and used these terms consistently throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to clarify the reasons for the inherent bias in the detection of conditional neutrality (CN) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP; Lines 187-196). It is also not clear to me what the authors did to deal with the bias in terms of adjusting P-value thresholds for CN and AP the way it is currently written. Further, I found the discussion of antagonistic pleiotropy and conditional neutrality to be a bit confusing for a couple of reasons, especially around lines 489-491. First of all, does it really make sense to contrast gene expression versus local adaptation, when lots of local adaptation likely involves changes in gene expression? Second, the implication that antagonistic pleiotropy is more common for local adaptation than the results found in this study seems questionable. Conditional neutrality appears to be more common for local adaptation as well: see Table 2 of Wadgymar et al. 2017 Methods in Ecology and Evolution. That all said, it is always difficult to conclude that there are no trade-offs (antagonistic pleiotropy) for a particular locus, as the detecting trade-offs may only manifest in some years and not others and can require large sample sizes if they are subtle in effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now explained the cause of the inherent bias in the detection of CN, and also elaborated on how we deal with this bias. Also, we have edited our discussion and added relevant citations to indicate both conditional neutrality and antagonistic pleiotropy can lead to local adaptations and added the caveat regarding detecting antagonistic pleiotropy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors investigate the gene expression variation in a rice diversity panel under normal and saline growth conditions to gain insight into the underlying molecular adaptive response to salinity. They present a convincing case to demonstrate that environmental stress can induce selective pressure on gene expression, which is in agreement to their earlier study (Groen et al, 2020). The data seems to be a good fit for their study and overall the analytic approach is robust.</p><p>(1) The work started by investigating the effect of genotype and their interaction at each transcript level using 3'-end-biased mRNA sequencing, and detecting a wide-spread GXE effect. Later, using the total filled grain number as a proxy of fitness, they estimated the strength of selection on each transcript and reported stronger selective pressure in a saline environment. However, this current framework relies on precise estimation of fitness and, therefore can be sensitive to the choice of fitness proxy.</p></disp-quote><p>We now acknowledge this caveat in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Furthermore, the authors decomposed the genetic architecture of expression variation into cis- and trans-eQTL in each environment separately and reported more unique environment-specific trans-eQTLs than cis-. The relative contribution of cis- and trans-eQTL depends on both the abundance and effect size. I wonder why the latter was not reported while comparing these two different genetic architectures. If the authors were to compare the variation explained by these two categories of eQTL instead of their frequency, would the inference that trans-eQTLs are primarily associated with expression variation still hold?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now also reported the effect sizes for both cis- and trans-eQTLs in the two environments and showed that the trans-eQTLs have higher effect sizes as compared to cis-eQTLs, indicating that they are able to explain higher proportion of variation in transcript abundances in the two environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Next, the authors investigated the relationship between cis- and trans-eQTLs at the transcript level and revealed an excess of reinforcement over the compensation pattern. Here, I struggle to understand the motivation for testing the relationship by comparing the effect of cis-QTL with the mean effect of all trans-eQTLs of a given transcript. My concern is that taking the mean can diminish the effect of small trans-eQTLs potentially biasing the relationship towards the large-effect eQTLs.</p></disp-quote><p>We wanted to estimate compensating vs reinforcing effects, which essentially entails identifying genes that have opposing directionality of cis and trans-effects. To get the total trans-effect we decided to take the mean effect of trans-eQTLs. This mean was only used to identify the compensating/reinforcing genes and although the mean effects diminishes the effect of small trans-eQTLs, this mean was not used in downstream analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this work, the authors conducted a large-scale field trial of 130 indica accessions in normal vs. moderate salt stress conditions. The experiment consists of 3 replicates for each accession in each treatment, making it 780 plants in total. Leaf transcriptome, plant traits, and final yield were collected. Starting from a quantitative genetics framework, the authors first dissected the heritability and selection forces acting on gene expression. After summarizing the selection force acting on gene expression (or plant traits) in each environment, the authors described the difference in gene expression correlation between environments. The final part consists of eQTL investigation and categorizing cis- and trans-effects acting on gene expression.</p><p>Building on the group's previous study and using a similar methodology (Groen et al. 2020, 2021), the unique aspect of this study is in incorporating large-scale empirical field works and combining gene expression data with plant traits. Unlike many systems biology studies, this study strongly emphasizes the quantitative genetics perspective and investigates the empirical fitness effects of gene expression data. The large amounts of RNAseq data (one sample for each plant individual) also allow heritability calculation. This study also utilizes the population genetics perspective to test for traces of selection around eQTL. As there are too many genes to fit in multiple regression (for selection analysis) and to construct the G-matrix (for breeder's equation), grouping genes into PCs is a very good idea.</p><p>Building on large amounts of data, this study conducted many analyses and described some patterns, but a central message or hypothesis would still be necessary. Currently, the selection analysis, transcript correlation structure change, and eQTL parts seem to be independent. The manuscript currently looks like a combination of several parallel works, and this is reflected in the Results, where each part has its own short introduction (e.g., 185-187, 261-266, 349-353). It would be great to discuss how these patterns observed could be translated to larger biological insights. On a related note, since this and the previous studies (focusing on dry-wet environments) use a similar methodology, one would also wonder what the conclusions from these studies would be. How do they agree or disagree with each other?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the manuscript currently presents some analyses in a somewhat independent manner. Although it would be ideal to have a central hypothesis/message, our study is meant to broadly outline the various responses and fitness effects of salinity stress in rice. Throughout the manuscript, we have also included comparisons between our findings and that of our previous studies on drought stress to highlight any consistent themes or novel insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many analyses were done separately for each environment, and results from these two environments are listed together for comparison. Especially for the eQTL part, no specific comparison was discussed between the two environments. It would be interesting to consider whether one could fit the data in more coherent models specifically modeling the X-by-environment effects, where X might be transcripts, PCs, traits, transcript-transcript correlation, or eQTLs.</p></disp-quote><p>We do plan to consider fitting models that explicitly incorporate X-by-environment interactions to provide a more detailed understanding of the genetics of plasticity between the two environments, but it is beyond the scope of this paper. This will be explored in a separate report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As stated, grouping genes into PCs is a good idea, but although in theory, the PCs are orthogonal, each gene still has some loadings on each PC (ie. each PC is not controlled by a completely different set of genes). Another possibility is to use any gene grouping method, such as WGCNA, to group genes into modules and use the PC1 of each module. There, each module would consist of completely different sets of genes, and one would be more likely to separate the biological functions of each module. I wonder whether the authors could discuss the pros and cons of these methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that individual genes can contribute to multiple PCs, and this is precisely why we choose PCA clustering over WGCNA where one gene can belong to only one module. Our aim was to recognize all biological processes that could be under selection in either environment, and since one gene can be involved in various different processes, we wanted to identify the contribution of these genes to different processes which can be done effectively by a PCA analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript examines how patterns of selection on gene expression differ between a normal field environment and a field environment with elevated salinity based on transcript abundances obtained from leaves of a diverse panel of rice germplasm. In addition, the manuscript also maps expression QTL (eQTL) that explains variation in each environment. One highlight from the mapping is that a small group of trans-mapping regulators explains some gene expression variation for large sets of transcripts in each environment. The overall scope of the datasets is impressive, combining large field studies that capture information about fecundity, gene expression, and trait variation at multiple sites. The finding related to patterns indicating increased LD among eQTLs that have cis-trans compensatory or reinforcing effects is interesting in the context of other recent work finding patterns of epistatic selection. However, other analyses in the manuscript are less compelling or do not make the most of the value of collected data. Revisions are also warranted to improve the precision with which field-specific terminology is applied and the language chosen when interpreting analytical findings.</p><p>Selection of gene expression:</p><p>One strength of the dataset is that gene expression and fecundity were measured for the same genotypes in multiple environments. However, the selection analyses are largely conducted within environments. The addition of phenotypic selection analyses that jointly analyze gene expression across environments and or selection on reaction norms would be worthwhile.</p></disp-quote><p>We do plan to consider fitting models that explicitly incorporate G×E interactions to provide a more detailed understanding of the genetics of plasticity between the two environments, but it is beyond the scope of this paper. This will be explored in a separate report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gene expression trade-offs:</p><p>The terminology and possibly methods involved in the section on gene expression trade-offs need amendment. I specifically recommend discontinuing reference to the analysis presented as an analysis of antagonistic pleiotropy (rather than more general trade-offs) because pleiotropy is defined as a property of a genotype, not a phenotype. Gene expression levels are a molecular phenotype, influenced by both genotype and the environment. By conducting analyses of selection within environments as reported, the analysis does not account for the fact that the distribution of phenotypic values, the fitness surface, or both may differ across environments. Thus, this presents a very different situation than asking whether the genotypic effect of a QTL on fitness differs across environments, which is the context in which the contrasting terms antagonistic pleiotropy and conditional neutrality have been traditionally applied. A more interesting analysis would be to examine whether the covariance of phenotype with fitness has truly changed between environments or whether the phenotypic distribution has just shifted to a different area of a static fitness surface.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that pleiotropy is a property of a genotype, and not phenotype, but since our phenotype (gene expression) is strongly coupled with the genotype, we choose to call trade-offs as antagonistic pleiotropy. That being said, we did test whether the covariance of gene expression with phenotype significantly varies between environments, and found that to indeed be the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Biological processes under selection / Decoherence: PCs are likely not the most ideal way to cluster genes to generate consolidated metrics for a selection gradient analysis. Because individual genes will contribute to multiple PCs, the current fractional majority-rule method applied to determine whether a PC is under direct or indirect selection for increased or decreased expression comes across as arbitrary and with the potential for double-counting genes. A gene co-expression network analysis could be more appropriate, as genes only belong to one module and one can examine how selection is acting on the eigengene of a co-expression module. Building gene co-expression modules would also provide a complementary and more concrete framework for evaluating whether salinity stress induces &quot;decoherence&quot; and which functional groups of genes are most impacted.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that individual genes can contribute to multiple PCs, and this is precisely why we choose PCA clustering over WGCNA where one gene can belong to only one module. Our aim was to recognize all biological processes that could be under selection in either environment, and since one gene can be involved in various different processes, we wanted to identify the contribution of these genes to different processes which can be done effectively by a PCA analyses. But again as pointed out by the reviewer, our PCs did contain contribution (even negligible) of each gene, so to identify the ‘primary’ biological processes represented by the PCs, we chose the majority rule. As for testing decoherence, we agree that a co-expression module analyses would have provided additional support to the specific test performed in our manuscript, but since it would just be additional support, we choose to not add it in the manuscript.</p><p>But based on the recommendation of the reviewer(s), we did perform a WGCNA analyses and found a total of 14 and 13 modules in normal and saline conditions, of which 0 and 2 modules (with no significant GO enrichment) were under directional selection. This supports our reasoning of potentially missing on identification of processes under selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Selection of traits:</p><p>Having paired organismal and molecular trait data is a strength of the manuscript, but the organismal trait data are underutilized. The manuscript as written only makes weak indirect inferences based on GO categories or assumed gene functions to connect selection at the organismal and molecular levels. Stronger connections could be made for instance by showing a selection of co-expression module eigengene values that are also correlated with traits that show similar patterns of selection, or by demonstrating that GWAS hits for trait variation co-localize to cis-mapping eQTL.</p></disp-quote><p>We did perform a GWAS for all the traits collected in both normal and saline environment, and only found significant hits for fecundity (in both normal and saline environment) and chlorophyll_a content (in the saline environment). But these regions did not overlap with any candidate genes or cis-mapping eQTL. Hence we choose to mention it in the manuscript. Additionally, using the WGCNA modules, we found that the only two module under selection in the saline environment were not significantly correlated with any of the traits measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Genetic architecture of gene expression variation:</p><p>The descriptive statistics of the eQTL analysis summarize counts of eQTLs observed in each environment, but these numbers are not broken down to the molecular trait level (e.g., what are the median and range of cis- and trans-eQTLs per gene). In addition, genetic architecture is a combination of the numbers and relative effect sizes of the QTLs. It would be useful to provide information about the relative distributions of phenotypic variance explained by the cis- vs. trans- eQTLs and whether those distributions vary by environment. The motivation for examining patterns of cis-trans compensation specifically for the results obtained under high salinity conditions is unclear to me. If the lines sampled have predominantly evolved under low salinity conditions and the hypothesis being evaluated relates to historical experience of stabilizing selection, then my intuition is that evaluating the eQTL patterns under normal conditions provides the more relevant test of the hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the median number of eQTLs per gene in each environment. Additionally, we recognize that genetic architecture is a combination id numbers and effect size, and we have added information regarding the effect sizes of eQTLs by type and by environment as recommend by another reviewer. We did explore the distributions of phenotypic variance explained by the cis- vs. trans- eQTLs as recommended here, and found that trans-eQTLs explain more phenotypic variance than cis-eQTLs in both environments and that the distribution of either type of eQTL does not vary by environment. We are choosing to not add this in the main text due to space limitations. Lastly, we examined the patterns of cis-trans compensation/reinforcement under both normal and salinity conditions and have compared and contrasted the results from both in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Lines 126: I would recommend citing those who originally developed the 3' end targeted RNA sequencing methods (e.g. Meyer et al 2011 Molecular Ecology).</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited the recommended paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 128-130: It would be useful to include a description here of what models were fit to the data to partition out G, E, and GxE effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to space limitations, we have in brief added a sentence to this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 139: I would suggest changing &quot;found little&quot; to &quot;no&quot; since the test was not significant.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence has been modified to say no evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 313: I think you mean directional selection instead of positive selection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the text</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 362-363: Would the authors also expect an enrichment of reinforcing genes for most scenarios where that has been divergent selection, such as local adaptation among populations?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our hypothesis, we would indeed expect an enrichment of reinforcing genes for scenarios of local adaptation where different alleles are maintained in different populations due to local adaptation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figures 1d-e are not mentioned in the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>The figures have been referenced in appropriate places.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 41-45: Terms such as reinforcement and compensation need to be explained in this specific context.

Given that we don't know the ancestral state here, maybe the authors could explain whether this definition is necessary.

Because traits are usually measured in different scales, it is recommended to standardize trait values using variance or mean before estimating selection coefficients. Multiplying this variance (or mean) standardized selection differential with heritability gives the expected response to selection in standard deviation (or mean) units. But if the trait variance (or mean) varies between traits or environments, it leads to a conflation between the standardized selection differential and trait variance (or mean), which can be misleading. So to avoid this, and given that our traits (transcript abundance in this case) were all measured on the same scale, we chose to not standardize our trait values and estimated raw selection differentials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 c-e: Please explain how the horizontal axis values were obtained.
