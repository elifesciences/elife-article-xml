disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we show co-storage of human Prolactin (PRL), which is associated with lactation in mammals, and neuropeptide galanin (GAL) as functional amyloids in secretory granules (SGs) of the female rat. Using a wide variety of biophysical studies, we show that irrespective of the difference in sequence and structure, both hormones facilitate their synergic aggregation to amyloid fibrils. Although each hormone possesses homotypic seeding ability, a unidirectional cross-seeding of GAL aggregation by PRL seeds and the inability of cross seeding by mixed fibrils suggest tight regulation of functional amyloid formation by these hormones for their efficient storage in SGs. Further, the faster release of functional hormones from mixed fibrils compared to the corresponding individual amyloid, suggests a novel mechanism of heterologous amyloid formation in functional amyloids of SGs in the pituitary.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The formation of plaques of proteins called ‘amyloids’ in the brain is one of the hallmark characteristics of both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, but amyloids can form in many tissues and organs, often disrupting normal activity. A lot of the research into amyloids has focused on their role in disease, but it turns out that amyloids can also appear in healthy tissues. For example, some protein hormones form amyloids that act as storage depots, helping cells to release the hormone when it is needed.</p><p>Normally, amyloids are made mostly of a single type of protein or protein fragment associated with a particular disease like Alzheimer's. Often, this type of amyloid promotes plaque formation in other proteins, which aggravates other diseases (for example, the amyloids that form in Alzheimer’s can lead to Parkinson’s disease or type II diabetes getting worse).The plaques start growing from small amyloid fragments called seeds. In mixed amyloids – amyloids made of two types of proteins – seeds made of one protein can trigger the formation of amyloids of the other protein. This raises the question, is this true for hormones? The body often releases more than one hormone at a time from the same tissue; for example, the pituitary gland releases prolactin and galanin simultaneously. However, these hormones have completely different structures, so whether they can form a mixed amyloid is unclear.</p><p>To answer this question, Chatterjee et al. first determined that, within the pituitary gland of female rats, prolactin and galanin could be found together in the same cells, forming mixed amyloids. To understand out how this happens, Chatterjee et al. tried seeding new amyloids using either prolactin or galanin. This revealed that only prolactin seeds were able to trigger the formation of galanin amyloids. Chatterjee et al. also found that the mixed amyloids could release the hormones faster than amyloids made from either protein alone. Together, these results suggest that the collaboration between these two proteins may help maintain hormone balance in the body.</p><p>Problems with hormone storage and release lead to various human diseases, including prolactinoma. Understanding amyloid storage depots could reveal new ways to control hormone levels. Further research could also help to explain more about well-studied diseases linked to amyloids, like Alzheimer's.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prolactin</kwd><kwd>galanin</kwd><kwd>secretory granule</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>seeding</kwd><kwd>cross-seeding</kwd><kwd>co-aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR9797/NNT/28/774/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maji</surname><given-names>Samir K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/HRD/35/01/03/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maji</surname><given-names>Samir K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2019/001133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maji</surname><given-names>Samir K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD/0119-DBTFL49-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Shinjinee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Co-aggregation, amyloid formation, and unidirectional cross-seeding of prolactin and galanin for their efficient storage in secretory granules of pituitary and subsequent functional hormone release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein/peptide misfolding, aggregation, and amyloid formation is associated with various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wszolek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Katzman and Saitoh, 1991</xref>). However, several studies have suggested that amyloid formation is also associated with the native biological function of the host organism. The protein fibrils formed to aid in the functionality of the host organisms are called functional amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbot, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Destoumieux-Garzón et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maddelein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ritter et al., 2005</xref>). For example, Pmel-17 amyloid fibrils template melanin polymerization inside melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fowler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huff et al., 2003</xref>); Curli fibrils of <italic>E. coli</italic> support the organism to adhere to a surface and also help their colonization process inside biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnhart and Chapman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>). In this line, another very interesting aspect is the formation of functional amyloid by protein/peptide hormones (such as prolactin [PRL] and galanin [GAL]) during their storage inside the secretory granules (SGs) of pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacob et al., 2016</xref>). The amyloid formation, in this case, not only enriches the protein concentration to serve as a protease-resistant protein/peptide storage depot but is also able to release the functional monomeric proteins upon dilution and pH changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacob et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacob et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maji and Riek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anoop et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Protein/peptide aggregation and amyloid formation generally follow nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Srivastava et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eden et al., 2015</xref>), where protein/peptide slowly associates to form aggregation competent nuclei (in the lag phase of aggregation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arosio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mehra et al., 2018</xref>). Once formed, the aggregation competent nuclei further recruit the monomeric counterpart for their growth into mature amyloid fibrils (elongation phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arosio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mehra et al., 2018</xref>). The progression of aggregation eventually reaches a steady-state equilibrium between the fibrils and monomeric protein (stationary phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Srivastava et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2010</xref>). Recent evidences however suggest that fragmentation/elongation and secondary nucleation may contribute to a significant decrease in the lag time of aggregation, similar to an external addition of preformed nuclei in amyloid growth reaction (seeding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daskalov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Törnquist et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buell, 2019</xref>). Although homotypic aggregation and seeding is the most favored mechanism of protein aggregation and amyloid formation, synergistic aggregation (co-aggregation) by two different proteins/peptides and heterologous seeding are also suggested to be involved in many neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Köppen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nisbet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">St-Amour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Spires-Jones et al., 2017</xref>). This is one of the possible mechanisms by which one disease aggravates the other disease such as Alzheimer’s disease together with either Type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bharadwaj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biessels et al., 2005</xref> or Parkinson’s disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giasson et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>PRL and GAL secretion is synergistic and promoted by common secretagogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koshiyama et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murakami et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wynick et al., 1998</xref>). PRL/GAL co-storage has been also reported in the anterior pituitary of female rats or estrogen-treated male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyde et al., 1991</xref>). Here, we investigate the synergistic aggregation and amyloid formation by these hormones for their secretory storage and release from SGs. Indeed, both of these hormones are co-stored in the female rat pituitary and possess amyloid-like characteristics. In this study, we show that both hormones not only engage in homotypic amyloid aggregation in the presence of specific glycosaminoglycans as helper molecules but also synergistically aggregate (in absence of glycosaminoglycans) to form heterotypic amyloid containing PRL and GAL as suggested by double immunoelectron microscopy. Intriguingly, cross-seeding with PRL fibril seeds resulted in fibrillation of GAL. However, GAL fibrils could not seed PRL monomers for fibrillation. This suggests a tightly controlled regulation of hormone amyloids for their homotopic and heterotypic storage. Furthermore, our in vitro release assay showed faster release of functional monomers by heterotypic, hybrid amyloid (PRL-GAL) compared to its homotypic counterparts. This supports the storage and release are highly controlled and conserved in pituitary tissue for the optimum function to be served.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PRL and GAL are co-stored as amyloids in SGs of the anterior pituitary of female rats</title><p>Previously, it was shown that PRL and GAL co-store in the anterior pituitary of female rats or estrogen-treated male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyde et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koshiyama et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koshiyama et al., 1990b</xref>). PRL is a 23 kDa protein and consists of four-helix bundles comprising residues 14–42 (helix 1), 78–104 (helix 2), 110–138 (helix 3), and 160–194 (helix 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Teilum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keeler et al., 2003</xref>). The helix bundles are spaced with three loop regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). On the other hand, GAL is a small unstructured neuropeptide, which is 30 residues in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans and Shine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bersani et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). PRL showed amyloid-prone sequences predicted by TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004</xref>); GAL, however, did not contain any amyloid-prone sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>). Since previously it was established that protein/peptide hormones (including PRL and GAL) can be stored as amyloids inside the SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>), we tested whether PRL and GAL are colocalized in the cells of the anterior pituitary in the amyloid state or not. To examine this possibility, the immunofluorescence study of female rat pituitary was performed using anti-GAL and anti-PRL antibodies (see Materials and methods). Our results showed that PRL and GAL were substantially co-localized in the pituitary tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) indicating their co-storage inside the SGs. Further, to test whether both PRL and GAL remain in the amyloid state, we performed immunostaining of the pituitary tissue sections with amyloid-specific antibody OC along with Thioflavin-S (ThioS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bussière et al., 2004</xref>). Double immunofluorescence of PRL and GAL along with amyloid specific OC antibody showed strong colocalization suggesting both the hormones are in the amyloid state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which was also observed in ThioS staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to the female rats, when a similar study of double immunofluorescence was performed in the male rat pituitary tissues, we did not observe any co-localization of PRL and GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is consistent with the earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyde et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Steel et al., 1989</xref>).

To do this, we mixed the 1:1 molar ratio of both the hormones, incubated at 37 °C, and probed the amyloid formation by Thioflavin T (ThT) binding and CD spectroscopy for 15 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a control, both hormones were incubated alone. Since PRL and GAL are known to form amyloid in presence of specific glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and Heparin (Hep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>), we also incubated both the hormones in presence of their respective glycosaminoglycans as positive controls. As expected, both PRL and GAL showed fibril formation in the presence of CSA and Hep, respectively. No ThT binding was observed by either PRL or GAL in absence of glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, the mixture of both the hormones showed high ThT binding during time indicating amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Notably, PRL is known to form amyloid without structural conversion to β-sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>). On the other hand, GAL-Hep showed random coil to β-sheet conversion during amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lag times of aggregation for PRL-CSA, PRL-GAL, and GAL-Hep were calculated as ~9.2 days, ~ 8.8 days, and ~7 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Fibril diameters were measured from a particular sample (n = 200 randomized points) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>) and the normalized frequency distribution was plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>).

The diameter of GAL-Hep fibrils was highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>) having a median value of ~12.3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>) and an average of ~12 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). Intriguingly, the PRL-GAL fibrils showed an intermediate diameter (median ~10 nm, average ~9.8 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>). This data suggest that PRL-GAL fibrils might be a new type of hybrid fibrils, which is neither similar to GAL nor PRL fibrils. We further analyzed the diameter from the same fibril bundle along its length. Consistent with our random point analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>), we found that the diameter of a single PRL-CSA fibril was indeed the lowest (average ~7 nm) followed by PRL-GAL (average ~10 nm) and GAL-Hep (average ~12 nm) fibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data indicate that PRL-GAL fibrils possess unique morphology, which could be due to the incorporation of both PRL as well as GAL molecules into the same fibril (co-fibril).</p><p>To further analyze whether both PRL and GAL are part of the same insoluble fibril fraction, we isolated the fibrils using centrifugation and performed SDS-PAGE. The presence of two bands corresponding to PRL and GAL indicated that both PRL and GAL formed fibrils when co-incubated together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Further, we performed immuno-electron microscopy (Immuno EM) with the PRL-GAL fibrils in the presence of secondary antibodies against PRL and GAL attached with 5 nm and 10 nm gold nanoparticles, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Co-localization of both 5 and 10 nm nanoparticles within the same fibril bundle confirmed that both PRL and GAL were part of the same fibril bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). However, due to extensive bundling of fibrils, it remains to be seen whether PRL and GAL are incorporated in the same filament or not.</p><p>Since 400 µM (each) PRL-GAL could undergo aggregation even in the absence of any helper molecules, we wanted to understand the optimum concentration and stoichiometry for PRL-GAL co-aggregation. To do this, we chose increasing concentration of PRL and GAL in an orthogonal (X-Y axis) manner (from 100 to 600 µM, each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). All combinations of this concentration regime of hormone mixture were incubated for 15 days. We observed that amyloid fibril formation only occurred (within a feasible experimental timeframe [15 days]) as determined by ThT binding and electron microscope study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) when the concentration of each hormone PRL and/or GAL was kept ≥400 µM. The equal molar ratio of PRL: GAL and above 400 µM concentration of each hormone showed fibril formation. However, if any of the components (PRL or GAL) was taken below 400 µM, we could not observe fibril formation. Therefore, the area of the fibril space would be at a 1:1 ratio with little deviation on either side provided that the minimum concentration of each of PRL and GAL is 400 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cross-seeding of PRL and GAL</title><p>Amyloid aggregation is a nucleation-dependent polymerization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Srivastava et al., 2019</xref>).

We hypothesized two possibilities of secondary nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Linse, 2017</xref>)—the heterotypic monomers can be recruited at the ends of the seeds and facilitate the growth of amyloid fibril (elongation) or the seed surface will help in the nucleation of the heterotypic monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Linse, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Our data showed that GAL aggregation was accelerated with PRL seeds in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>). Surprisingly, we observed no ThT fluorescence for all seed concentrations even after 10 days of incubation when GAL seeds were incubated with PRL monomers, indicating that GAL fibrils are incapable of inducing amyloid fibril formation of PRL monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). This was also evident with CD spectroscopic measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, no aggregation was observed when PRL/GAL monomer was incubated in presence of different percentages of PRL-GAL mixed fibril seeds (1%, 2%, and 5%) as confirmed by CD spectroscopy, ThT fluorescence, and TEM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). This suggests that seeding (both homo and hetero) event is very specific for the life cycle of PRL/GAL amyloid formation in SGs. Important to note that these homotypic and heterotypic seeding studies were done in the absence of any helper glycosaminoglycans molecules. When lag times were compared, the heterotypic seeding rate was significantly higher than homotypic seeding for GAL aggregation suggesting surface-mediated secondary nucleation might be triggering GAL aggregation in the presence of PRL seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koloteva-Levine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p>To further understand whether PRL seeds engage the GAL monomer for secondary nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buell, 2019</xref>) where elongation and/or surface-mediated aggregation could happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Linse, 2017</xref>), fibril diameters of GAL (formed by PRL cross-seeding) were analyzed from the TEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). If only the elongation mechanism is occurring, GAL will form PRL-like fibrils. If PRL seeds engage GAL monomer for surface-mediated secondary nucleation, GAL will essentially form GAL-like fibrils. Intriguingly, analysis of frequency distribution of the GAL fibril diameters indicated that the distribution of diameter of PRL seeded GAL fibrils was very similar to that of GAL-Hep fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, <italic>left panel</italic>). The median and mean fibril diameter analysis also suggests that GAL fibril formed in presence of PRL seed (median and mean diameter 12.35 nm) is very similar compared to GAL fibrils formed in presence of GAL seed (median and mean diameter 12 nm) as well as GAL fibrils formed in presence of heparin (median and mean diameter 11.20 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This means that the incorporation of GAL monomers does not happen to the PRL fibril end (elongation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Katzman and Saitoh, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ritter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sarell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>), rather, GAL monomers use PRL seeds as surface and form amyloid fibrils via secondary (or surface-mediated) nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Törnquist et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ivanova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koloteva-Levine et al., 2020</xref>) mechanism. This was further confirmed with the FTIR study, which suggested that GAL fibrils formed in presence of GAL seeds and GAL fibrils formed in the presence of PRL seeds possessed similar FTIR spectral signature, which was substantially different from the PRL-CSA fibril spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We also performed the global fitting analysis of the PRL-GAL cross-seeding kinetics data at different PRL seed concentrations (1%, 2%, and 5%) using Amylofit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meisl et al., 2016</xref>) (version 2.0), which has been extensively used to identify the underlying mechanism behind the kinetics of amyloid aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kumari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreasen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rasmussen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frankel et al., 2019</xref>). We observed the data poorly fit with the ‘nucleation-elongation model’, which exclusively considers primary nucleation and elongation steps. However, the kinetics data of GAL aggregation in presence of various PRL seeds (1%, 2%, and 5%) could be satisfactorily fit with the secondary nucleation model, which considers surface catalyzed secondary nucleation, along with classical elongation. Further, the mean residual error (M.R.E.) in fitting in the elongation mechanism was observed to be higher compared to the fitting using the model with surface catalyzed secondary nucleation. The fitting data, therefore, is in line with our hypothesis of surface-mediated amyloid assembly playing a dominant role in the aggregation mechanism of GAL in the presence of PRL seed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Specific interactions of PRL and GAL leading to amyloid aggregation</title><p>Next, we wanted to further investigate if interactions leading to co-aggregation and amyloid formation of PRL and GAL are specific to themselves. To do this, we co-incubated PRL with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) as this hormone is of similar length to GAL and does not form amyloid by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ranganathan et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, GAL was also incubated with growth hormone (GH), a hormone structurally and functionally related to PRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nilsson et al., 2001</xref>; ). ThT aggregation kinetics and CD spectroscopy were performed at the beginning of the aggregation (day 0) and after 15 days of incubation for both PRL-ACTH and GAL-GH. Our data showed negligible ThT fluorescence for both PRL-ACTH and GAL-GH even after 15 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) suggesting no co-aggregation. This observation was consistent with no structural conversion observed in CD and TEM, where the PRL-ACTH and GH-GAL mixtures were devoid of any fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, our observations suggest that interaction and co-aggregation/amyloid formation by PRL and GAL are specific and are mutually beneficial for the storage of these hormones in SGs. This specific co-aggregation of PRL and GAL could be due to their favorable interaction when the monomeric hormone is mixed together. This is further evident from the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) study, where GAL monomers were immobilized on a CM-5 chip and a range of concentrations of PRL monomeric protein was passed over it. We observed a significant increase in the response unit (RU) indicating binding of PRL to GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The relative dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) was calculated to be 4.1 × 10<sup>–7</sup> M, which indicates the binding of PRL with GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In comparison, we observed no significant binding when ACTH was passed through immobilized PRL or when GH was passed through immobilized GAL, which could be due to low but non-specific transient interactions between GH-GAL and PRL-ACTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This suggests that PRL monomers can readily bind GAL monomers, possibly contributing to their initial interaction that eventually drives the synergistic aggregation and amyloid formation. To further experimentally verify the specificity of PRL-GAL interaction, which is responsible for their co-aggregation and co-storage, we chose another combination of hormones (GH and ACTH), which generally expressed in anterior pituitary for their possible co-localization in the SGs of the female rat. Using the double immunofluorescence study, we found that GH and ACTH do not co-localize with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The data suggest that specific interaction between two hormones might dictate their co-aggregation and co-storage irrespective of several hormones, which are present inside the anterior pituitary of the female rat.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Specific interaction drives co-aggregation of PRL and GAL.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparative ThT fluorescence showing amyloid formation by different pairs of hormones at days 0 and 15.

GAL was docked at two different regions of PRL that showed high TANGO score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). Thus, two sets of PRL-GAL complexes were generated (<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>) <bold><italic>Set 1:</italic></bold> GAL was docked near residues 18–28 of PRL and <bold><italic>(b) Set 2:</italic></bold> GAL was docked near residues 80–88 of PRL.

Both these complexes were then subjected to independent 250 ns long MD simulations to examine their stability. Since the choice of force fields may play an important role in the MD simulation results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cino et al., 2012</xref>), we performed MD simulations with two different force fields – GROMOS 53a6 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oostenbrink et al., 2004</xref>) and Amber ff99SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). As controls, we have also simulated individual PRL and GAL proteins. We observed that the PRL and GAL alone did not show any noticeable structural changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) during simulation time.</p><p>On the contrary, the PRL-GAL complexes exhibited significant conformational changes upon binding to each other, in both complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–g</xref>). The respective structures of complex 1 and complex 2 at the end of the MD simulation using GROMOS force field showed the structural transition from unstructured region to β-strand in both PRL and GAL with the emergence of a parallel or anti-parallel β-sheet at the protein-protein interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). The interaction of GAL in complex 1 induced the formation of an antiparallel β-sheet at the PRL-GAL interface (residues 6–8 of PRL, residues 24–26 in GAL) and also an intra-molecular parallel β-sheet in PRL itself (PRL residues 149–151 and 58–60) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In complex 2, GAL induced the formation of parallel β-sheet at PRL-GAL interface (residues 145–147 of PRL, residues 4–6 of GAL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). From the MD simulations using the Amber force field, however, the complex 1 did not show any notable structural changes, except that the terminal loops in PRL wrap around the existing secondary structures for higher stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the PRL-GAL interactions in complex 2 resemble very well with the results from the GROMOS force field exhibiting a parallel β-sheet constituted by the β-strand from PRL and GAL proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). These results corroborate very well with our experimental data that suggested the formation of amyloids when PRL and GAL were co-aggregated. The residues involved in the formation of this β-sheet in complex 2 were PRL residues 147–149 and GAL residues 2–4 in the Amber ff99SB force field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Thus, irrespective of the force field used, our MD simulation results convincingly show that the co-aggregation of PRL and GAL induce the formation of β-sheet at the protein interface.</p><p>To validate our MD simulation results, further we have performed mutagenesis studies by mutating or deleting certain PRL/GAL residues in silico. We have examined four different cases where GAL residues 2–5 (WTLN) (case 1); PRL residues 146–149 (IYPV) (case 2) are mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). These amino acids were observed to involve in the inter-protein β-sheet formation.</p><p>In the other two cases, we introduced a point mutation in PRL as Y147P, since proline is known as β-sheet breaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soto et al., 1998</xref>) (case 3), and in case 4 we deleted first two N-terminal residues (GW) of GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). We did not simulate the PRL deletion system, as deletion at the middle of the PRL helical structure (PRL residues 146–149) would bring in conformational changes in the PRL secondary structure itself, and correlating that with our interest of PRL-GAL β-sheet formation will be difficult.</p><p>We further simulate the systems for 400 ns (150 ns for two residues deletion in GAL) after introducing these changes. Interestingly, in all the cases (Case 1 to Case 4), we observed loss of interactions (H-bonds) at the PRL-GAL interface, which eventually led to the loss of β-sheet structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). It is worth mentioning here that a single mutation in PRL (Y147P; Case 3) was sufficient to disrupt the secondary structure formation, suggesting its key role in inducing the formation of β-sheet during co-aggregation of PRL and GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Thus, the MD simulation results convincingly show that mutation or deletion at the PRL-GAL interface could result in the loss of β-sheet formation, which eventually affects the PRL-GAL co-aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Release of functional PRL and GAL from PRL-GAL amyloids</title><p>Protein/peptide misfolding and aggregation lead to irreversible amyloid formation, which is stable and does not readily disassemble to monomer. However, many studies recently showed the release of monomers and oligomers from disease-associated amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bemporad and Chiti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cascella et al., 2021</xref>).

To address whether any functional advantage of co-aggregation over homotypic aggregation by PRL and GAL, we determined the relative monomer release capability of PRL/GAL monomer, and PRL-GAL co-amyloids; along with preformed fibrils of PRL (in the presence of CSA) and GAL (in the presence of Hep) using dialysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maji et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacob et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anoop et al., 2014</xref>). The concentration of released monomers (if any) in the dialysate was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy at different time points. Intriguingly, we found that PRL-CSA, GAL-Hep, and PRL-GAL amyloids could indeed release monomers with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

Despite their association with diseases, amyloids are also known to be involved in the native functions of host organisms including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fowler et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the synergistic amyloid formation through co-aggregation and cross seeding by heterologous proteins/peptides is also evident in the disease-associated proteins such as α-Synuclein-Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Waxman and Giasson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moussaud et al., 2014</xref>), α-Synuclein-amyloid β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Köppen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bassil et al., 2020</xref>). However, these mechanisms are still elusive for functional amyloids despite their relevance in hormone co-storage and co-release from SGs. Here, we explored the synergistic aggregation and amyloid formation by two human hormones PRL and GAL, which are highly relevant in SGs biogenesis. Although 23 kDa PRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Teilum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keeler et al., 2003</xref>) (mostly helical) has no resemblance of sequence, length, and structure with unstructured 3.1 kDa GAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans and Shine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bersani et al., 1991</xref>), it was reported that both of these hormones are co-stored in the lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary in the female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyde et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Steel et al., 1989</xref>). Moreover, their release is also modulated by the same secretagogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koshiyama et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murakami et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koshiyama et al., 1990b</xref>). Co-storage and co-release of PRL and GAL suggest that these hormones might aggregate together to form amyloids within the same SGs. Our immunofluorescence study with female rat anterior pituitary tissue probed that not only both PRL and GAL are colocalized together; they are indeed in the amyloid form as suggested by OC and ThioS staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly when PRL and GAL were co-incubated with a 1:1 or higher molar ratio in vitro, they co-aggregated synergistically to form amyloid fibrils in conditions similar to their storage in SGs without the requirement of any helper molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reggio and Palade, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zanini et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>Co-aggregation can happen in a scenario where PRL and GAL can promote the aggregation of each other but exclusively form individual, homotypic fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further, one of them might have the conformational advantage to form amyloids and other proteins/peptides can simply adhere to it, maintaining its monomeric structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Another possibility is that PRL-GAL is incorporated within the same fibrils and/or filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Immuno-EM studies with secondary antibodies tagged with different-sized gold nanoparticles showed that both PRL and GAL are present within the same fibrils suggesting they might interact together to form hybrid, heterotypic fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The incorporation of heterogenous proteins to make hybrid fibrils is also shown for α-Synuclein-Tau and for other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Köppen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Waxman and Giasson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moussaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bassil et al., 2020</xref>). The ability of co-aggregation without glycosaminoglycans (note that individual hormones are unable to form amyloids) suggests that in glycosaminoglycans deficient conditions in vitro, PRL and GAL will preferably form mixed amyloid for their storage. However, their co-aggregation does not preclude the possibility of individual storage of each hormone in the different SGs (mediated via glycosaminoglycans). Furthermore, individual hormone aggregation can be seeded with their respective fibrils seeds as shown for PRL and GAL even in absence of glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). All these possibilities suggest that functional amyloid fibril formation might be very useful for host organism and therefore is produced in an autocatalytic manner inside the secretory cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PRL-GAL homo and hetero amyloid life cycle for SGs.</title><p>PRL and GAL form the amyloid fibrils in the presence of specific glycosaminoglycans (CSA and Hep, respectively), which can be auto-catalytically amplified by their respective seeding with preformed fibrils. This seeding however does not require any glycosaminoglycans. PRL-GAL also synergistically co-aggregate to form hybrid amyloid fibrils, which are not capable of seeding either to PRL or GAL. These amyloid fibril species can together or individually reconstitute the SGs of PRL-GA storage, which can release functional PRL and GAL into the extracellular space.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73835-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Unidirectional cross seeding of GAL by PRL fibril seeds: The possible facilitator of GAL storage in SG</title><p>Homologous seeding of amyloid aggregation is relatively more abundant in nature due to quick and feasible templating mechanism involving a single protein, which decreases the lag time for aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arosio et al., 2015</xref>). Although heterogeneous seeds can also provide template/surface for a different protein/peptide to initiate their aggregation (cross-seeding), this phenomenon is less abundant because of high thermodynamic and conformational barrier between the two different protein/peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daskalov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ivanova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartman, 2013</xref>). It was shown that sequence similarity between two amyloidogenic proteins is crucial for their cross seeding capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krebs et al., 2004</xref>). However, the ability of cross seeding also depends on the conformation of the seed and its compatibility with the monomeric protein, which creates different cross seeding barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daskalov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walker et al., 2013</xref>) (also species barrier for prion diseases).</p><p>Our data showed PRL amyloid fibrils can cross-seed GAL monomers. Strikingly, GAL fibrils were not able to cross seed PRL monomers suggesting specificity and regulation in functional amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Unidirectional, as well as bidirectional seeding between amyloid proteins, are indeed evident. Cross seeding between amyloid β–42 and hIAPP, where amyloid β–42 seeds can cross seed hIAPP to promote aggregation but hIAPP seed is unable to induce aggregation to amyloid β–42 monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">O’Nuallain et al., 2004</xref>) (<italic>unidirectional cross seeding</italic>). In contrast, α-Synuclein and Tau seeds can accelerate each other’s amyloid aggregation suggesting a bidirectional cross seeding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Waxman and Giasson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moussaud et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since PRL has less propensity to form amyloid due to higher structural stability, GAL seeds are unable to provide surface or structural compatibility for PRL cross seeding. In contrast, GAL is a highly disordered peptide, which might easily bind to the PRL amyloid surface nonspecifically and increase its stability, and proceeds the aggregation. This suggests that tight regulation of co-species aggregation ensures the right amount of storage of PRL and GAL in SGs with physiologically appropriate ratios. Furthermore, the amyloid-prone sequence of PRL could also be sequestered inside the helical structure, which might not be compatible with the surface and/or amyloid core structure of GAL to mediate the cross-seeding. Previously it was shown for K18 and K19 of Tau isoforms that K19 fibrils can cross seed K18 through the catalytic motif of R3, whereas K18 fibrils with the catalytic center as R2 is unable to seed K19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) (lacking R2 motif). The difference in seeding could also be due to the relative tendency of amyloid fibril formation by GAL and PRL. We propose that ‘PRL seeding of GAL’ is not due to elongation (which requires specific interaction) as PRL cross-β spine might not be accessible for GAL. In this context, we previously proposed that a small segment of GH (structurally similar to PRL) might be involved in fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacob et al., 2016</xref>) while other structural domains might surround this cross-β spine as proposed for RNaseA fibrils model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sambashivan et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, GAL being a short neuropeptide has the conformational flexibility to adhere to the surface of the PRL amyloid seeds and subsequently can undergo surface-mediated secondary nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2009</xref>). Afterwards, more and more GAL monomers will be accommodated on the PRL seed surface as the fibril growth progresses—resulting in similar bulk fibril morphology like GAL fibrils formed by homo-seeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koloteva-Levine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The more efficient (faster kinetics) cross-seeding of GAL amyloid aggregation by PRL seeds compared to GAL seeds (homo-seeding) also indicates a possibility of the greater abundance of surface-mediated secondary nucleation mechanism for the former scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koloteva-Levine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that specific interaction between GAL and PRL synergistically facilitates their aggregation into amyloid. This is further evident from the SPR analysis showing strong interaction and direct binding between the monomeric forms of PRL and GAL in contrast to the other hormone pair, PRL-ACTH or GH-GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). PRL-GAL interaction and conformational transition are further supported using in silico study, which showed interaction of the PRL N-terminal loop and GAL, where GAL promotes the conformational transition of the N-terminus of PRL into the β-sheet structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The interaction of PRL and GAL is mandatory for their aggregation, as no amyloid fibril formation was observed when PRL and GAL were incubated alone.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications of PRL-GAL co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding</title><p>Our study probes that PRL-GAL co-aggregation is one of the key mechanisms for PRL and GAL storage inside the SGs and their subsequent release as functional hormones. PRL and GAL can also undergo homotypic aggregation in the presence of specific glycosaminoglycans like CSA or Hep, respectively. However, homotypic aggregation might not be sufficient for PRL/GAL protein homeostasis in the anterior pituitary especially during lactation in females, which could be achieved by PRL-GAL co-aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is known that PRL and GAL are co-stored in the lactotrophs of the female rat anterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyde et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Steel et al., 1989</xref>). Peptide hormone GAL is known to be highly expressed in the hypothalamus and performs various tropic activities including regulating the secretion of other neuropeptide hormones and neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lundström et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, GAL overexpression in the anterior pituitary during lactation is known to regulate PRL expression, storage, and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaplan et al., 1988</xref>). Storing a high amount of PRL in the anterior pituitary during lactation is also important for the development of lactotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wynick et al., 1998</xref>). This is evident as the loss of function mutation in the endogenous <italic>GAL</italic> gene in mice has shown a drastic decrease in PRL level compared to the wild-type control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wynick et al., 1998</xref>). This was accompanied by reduced PRL secretion, failure in mammary gland maturation, and loss of lactotroph proliferation upon estrogen treatment in the mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wynick et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, estrogen treatment enhanced the GAL mRNA by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wynick et al., 1993</xref>), which was subsequently shown to be highly effective for lactotroph proliferation and subsequent PRL production and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wynick et al., 1993</xref>). However, functional implications due to the loss of PRL-synthesis/function for GAL storage and its release are yet to be established.</p><p>The present co-aggregation data clearly shows that GAL and PRL are interdependent on their storage within the same SGs in the amyloid-like state (without helper molecules), which facilitates the controlled and efficient release of these hormones. This is supported by the fact that functional monomer release from PRL-CSA amyloid and GAL-Hep amyloid is much slower compared to the functional monomer release from mixed amyloids of PRL-GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When GAL monomers release from the co-aggregates (PRL-GAL), it ensures further release of PRL and other tropic factors both in an autocrine and paracrine manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cai et al., 1998</xref>). The co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding mechanism not only supports PRL storage and release but also helps to maintain a very low titre of unstable GAL to efficiently store in SGs for future use. However, a substantial decrease in physiological PRL levels would inevitably affect the storage of GAL and its subsequent release as they are in a positive feedback loop. On the other hand, over-production of GAL may result in hypersecretion of PRL—leading to prolactinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cai et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, tight regulation is required for GAL synthesis and secretion. Taken together, our findings probe that co-aggregation and co-storage would allow much higher efficiency for hormone release and function than their individual storage. The impairment of PRL-GAL co-aggregation would very likely be detrimental in achieving the PRL-mediated lactation and other tropic functions of GAL.</p><p>Further, as efficient storage and release of GAL are necessary for PRL homeostasis, GAL deficiency or functional mutation inhibits the PRL release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wynick et al., 1998</xref>). GAL is also responsible for the regulation and secretion of other neuropeptides such as VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wynick et al., 1993</xref>). Intriguingly, lactotrophs that do not produce GAL, are also highly sensitive to this hormone but not to the other secretagogues such as VIP peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wynick et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting the essential requirement of GAL for several pituitary functions. In contrast to the requirement, only a minority of lactotrophs ( ~ 9% of cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wynick et al., 1993</xref>) produce the GAL. Apart from the synthesis issue, its half-life (turnover cycle) is also reported to be low (3–4 min in circulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hinghofer-Szalkay et al., 2006</xref>) in comparison to hormone like PRL ( ~ 41 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yoshida et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yu et al., 2019</xref>), possibly due to its short length and unstructured nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans and Shine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bersani et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, efficient storage of GAL is essential not only for PRL storage/release (which is required during pregnancy/lactation) but also for performing other pituitary functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kask et al., 1997</xref>). In this context, cross-seeding by PRL amyloids increases the chances of GAL storage and subsequent release. On the other hand, PRL storage needs tight regulation due to the risk of developing prolactinoma upon over-secretion. Interesting to note that templating mechanism (seeding) requires the client monomers to change their fold—which requires a substantial amount of energy. As discussed earlier, it is very likely that for a folded protein like PRL, it is thermodynamically less favorable to undergo a large conformational transition upon templating by GAL seeds. On the other hand, GAL is an unstructured neuropeptide and can easily be templated by PRL seeds. This could be an evolutionarily optimized design by nature so that tight regulation of GAL storage and functions can be regulated.</p><p>Since PRL and GAL cross-talk via a positive feedback loop for both their storage and release, a decrease in GAL level would also decrease the storage and release of PRL. This is also evident from our co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding data. Exploiting this phenomenon, one could argue that by controlling (reducing) excess GAL, it is possible to prevent PRL hypersecretion (prolactinoma). This could, in principle, be achieved by targeting excess GAL in the bloodstream using various methods including specific antibodies, targeted proteolysis, or by engineering small molecules/metabolites capable of inhibiting GAL secretion/functions as previously demonstrated for various hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Békés et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Slastnikova et al., 2018</xref>). Further, instead of targeting GAL, other metabolites such as tryptophan amino acid can also be used that target PRL directly to control its release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">MacIndoe and Turkington, 1973</xref>).</p><p>One more interesting aspect of functional amyloids is that they must exhibit sustained release of functional monomers at the target site. It will be of great interest in the future to design GAL analogs that can form stable co-amyloids with PRL, which would be incapable of releasing PRL monomers—thereby controlling the excess secretion of PRL. However, translating the current knowledge into therapeutics has challenges—primarily because, although PRL-GAL co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding is very efficiently designed by nature, both hormones can also form functional amyloids independently in the presence of helper molecules such as glycosaminoglycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the current study demonstrates that contrary to disease-associated co-aggregation, which promotes the spread of the disease, co-aggregation of hormones is specific and functional in the SGs.

The human PRL plasmid was obtained as a kind gift from Prof. Dannies and Prof. Hodsdon from Yale University. BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were transformed with the human PRL gene encoded in the pT7L plasmid and were made to grow in terrific broth (TB) followed by IPTG induction for 4 hr. After harvesting the cells at 8000 rpm for 20 min, the pellet was dispersed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (with added protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). After that, the cells were sonicated (2 s on, 1 s off at 50% amplitude) for 20 min to complete cell-lysis, which was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for half an hour to recover the inclusion bodies (IB). The cell pellet containing IBs was subsequently washed two times with 0.5% triton-X and then it was dissolved in urea (8 M) with 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The solution was then dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 so that the PRL protein refolds to its native state. After dialysis, the protein solution was again centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 1 hr and was loaded in an anion exchange column (Resource Q, GE healthcare) through an AKTA purifier FPLC system (Cytiva). The protein was eluted through NaCl (1 M) gradient and subsequently lyophilized after snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Size exclusion profile (SEC) suggested the protein is monomeric in nature and the purity of the protein is further checked by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF spectrometry. CD spectroscopy was also performed to confirm that the purified PRL has refolded to its native helical conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Aggregation of PRL and GAL in the presence of glycosaminoglycans</title><p>PRL was dissolved in Milli-Q water and buffer exchanged to 20 mM phosphate buffer with 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0, 0.01% sodium azide using 10 kDa mini dialysis units (Thermo Scientific Slide-A-Lyzer). 5 mM solution of CSA (Sigma, USA) was prepared in the same buffer, and appropriately mixed with PRL to obtain an ultimate concentration of 400 μM for both PRL and CSA. Similarly, for GAL aggregation in the presence of Hep, GAL peptide was dissolved in 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0, 0.01% sodium azide to obtain a concentration of 500 μM. Hep solution from a stock of 5 mM (made in the same buffer) was then mixed with GAL solution to obtain an ultimate concentration of 400 μM for both GAL and Hep. These tubes containing PRL and GAL of various mixtures were kept into an Echo Thermmodel RT11 rotating mixture with a speed of 50 rpm for 15 days inside a 37 °C incubator. As a control, 400 μM PRL and GAL alone in the same buffer, was also incubated in a similar condition.

For measuring both excitation and emission, the slit width was kept at 5 nm. Three independent experiments were performed for each sample. The fluorescence value at 480 nm were plotted against incubation time, which produces the sigmoidal growth curve of amyloid formation.

These fibrils were then subjected to sonication (03 s ‘on’ and 01 s ‘off’ at 20% amplitude) for 10 min to obtain preformed fibril seeds, which were mixed (1%, 2%, and 5% (v/v)) in the respective monomeric protein for homo seeding or to the other protein for cross seeding. The time-dependent aggregation was probed by ThT binding and CD spectroscopy. The ThT fluorescence data for GAL aggregation by PRL seed was fitted using the web-based software interface Amylofit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meisl et al., 2016</xref>).

To do that, 300 µg/ml of GAL solution was made in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and was injected at a rate of 10 µl/min for 720 s to achieve a response unit (RU) of 1252 RU. PRL protein was dissolved in 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 to obtain 1 mM stock solution and was used for preparing different dilutions (7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.4, 125, 250, and 500 µM). These solutions were then injected over the immobilized GAL at a flow rate of 45 µl/min for 60 s. The dissociation was initiated at a flow rate of 30 µl/min, and the signal was recorded for 300 s. The chip was further regenerated using a 10 mM NaOH solution. ACTH and GH protein were used to examine the binding with PRL and GAL, respectively using a CM5 chip. For immobilization, 500 µg/ml of ACTH solution was made in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). For PRL immobilization, 2 mg/ml of PRL protein in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4) was used. A similar range of concentrations was used for ACTH and GH as mentioned before. All the binding experiments were performed at 37 °C. The data were subjected to reference subtraction to compensate for bulk refractive index differences. Further, the buffer system for all the proteins was constant to avoid bulk/viscosity changes. The kinetics data for all protein interactions were fitted using a 1:1 state kinetic model in the Biacore T200 Software. The k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>off</sub>, and K<sub>D</sub> values were determined for better understanding of the protein-protein interactions.

For this, the initial structure of PRL was obtained from PDB ID: 1RW5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Teilum et al., 2005</xref>). Since there was no entry for GAL structure in PDB, the GAL structure was built from its primary amino acid sequence and energy minimized. Subsequently, the minimized structure was equilibrated and simulated for 300ns. Initially, GAL was docked at two amyloidogenic regions of PRL (residues 18–28) (set-1) and (residues 80–88) (set-2), which were predicted by TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004</xref>). The docking was performed by the protein-protein docking program, HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>). The lowest energy complexes were extracted from each set, denoted as complex 1 from set-1 and complex 2 from set-2. These two complexes were used as starting structures for the MD simulations. The first sets of simulations were performed using the AMBER16 package with the Amberff99SB force field. The LEAP module of AMBER16 was used to add the hydrogen for the heavy atoms. The complexes were then energy minimized for 2000 steps using the steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms. Subsequently, the structures were hydrated in a cubic periodic box extending 9 Å outside the protein-protein complex on all sides with explicit water molecules. The three-site TIP3P model was chosen to describe the water molecules. The charge of each system was neutralized by placing Na<sup>+</sup> ions randomly in the simulation boxes. The systems were again minimized to prevent any random contacts formed due to the solvation. All the systems were then equilibrated for 500 ps in NVT ensemble at 300 K followed by one ns in NPT ensemble at 1 atm of pressure. After the density and potential energy of the systems had converged, each complex was subjected to 300 ns of the production run. To further validate our simulations, we performed a new set of simulations using different force fields. Each complex was subjected to a 250 ns simulation using the GROMOS 53a6 force field. The new sets of simulations were performed using the GROMACS package following the above-mentioned protocol. VMD tool was used for visual analysis of the trajectories.</p><p>To further strengthen our results from MD simulations, we have performed computational mutagenesis studies on complex 2 from the Amberff99SB force field. A total of four cases were examined – case 1: four GAL residues that were involved in the β-sheet formation were mutated to alanine (W2A, T3A, L4A, N5A); case 2: four PRL residues that were involved in the β-sheet formation were mutated to alanine (I146A, Y147A, P148A, V149A). Furthermore, we simulated a single mutation in PRL (Y147P), since proline is known as β-sheet breaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soto et al., 1998</xref>) (case 3), and one deletion system by deleting the first two N-terminal residues of GAL (case 4). We did not simulate the PRL deletion system, as deletion at the middle of a structure would bring in conformational changes in itself, and correlating that with our interest in PRL-GAL β-sheet formation will be difficult.</p><p>MD simulations of all the systems were performed by following the protocol described in the previous section using the AMBER16 package with the Amberff99SB force field. While the mutated systems, systems 1–3 had to be simulated for ~400 ns to see the change, the deletion system showed the disappearance of the β-sheet rather quickly in 100–150 ns.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Monomer release assay</title><p>Amyloid fibrils of PRL and GAL formed in the presence of glycosaminoglycans, and co-aggregated fibrils of PRL-GAL were harvested by ultracentrifugation at 90,000 rpm for 1 hr. The concentration of the soluble fraction (supernatant) was calculated using the absorbance at 280 nm (Jasco V-650) and was used to determine the concentration of the pelleted fibrils. A total of 100 μl re-dissolved pellet of 400 μM concentration was chosen to examine the monomer release study using the experimental setup, which has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacob et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maji et al., 2008</xref>). 400 μM PRL and GAL solutions incubated for 15 days were used as a monomer control. Briefly, for PRL monomer release, the pellet solutions (PRL, PRL-CSA, and PRL-GAL) were transferred into a modified PCR tube with a pierced hole in its cap, which was attached and sealed with a 50 kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane (Pierce, USA). This whole setup was then placed inside a 1 ml cryotube (Nunc, Denmark) containing 500 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 0.01% sodium azide. Meanwhile, to investigate the release of GAL monomers from the fibril of GAL-Hep, pellet solution was placed in a 10 kDa cutoff Slide-A-Lyzer mini dialysis unit system (Pierce, USA), which was positioned onto a 1 ml cryo-tube (Nunc, Denmark) containing 500 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 0.01% sodium azide. The tubes were then kept at 4 °C to prevent evaporation of solutions. To calculate the concentration of the protein outside of the membrane, an aliquot of 100 μl of the solution was taken from the buffer outside of the dialysis membrane at different times, and absorbance was measured at 280 nm. For measuring the monomer release of PRL and GAL from PRL-GAL co-aggregates, 100 μl releasing medium was taken out, and the same volume of fresh buffer was added back as volume correction (subsequent concentration correction has been done in the data). The separated 100 μl releasing medium was passed through a 10 kDa centrifugal filter unit (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). After which, the GAL monomer was obtained as filtrate, and the PRL was recovered from the retentate by washing the reversed filter unit with 100 μl of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 as per the manufacturer’s protocol. In an identical experimental setup, the absorbance was measured from the buffer both inside and outside of the membrane. This control is kept to check whether degradation of the materials of the dialysis membrane is interfering with the assay. Each time, the released solution was returned after the spectra recording. Three independent experiments were performed for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cell proliferation assay using Nb2 cells</title><p>Nb2 cell line was grown in plastic culture flasks in RPMI medium (HiMedia, India) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 10% horse serum (HiMedia, India), and 1 X antibiotic solution and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in the air. The Nb2 cell line was tested as mycoplasma negative. Since there is no publicly available database for rat-derived cell lines to be used as a reference, the STR profiling was not employed. However, the authentication of the Nb2 cell line was done by monitoring the morphology and the characteristic property of the cell line (comprising PRL receptors) to proliferate in presence of PRL as evident from our cell proliferation study. For proliferation assay, cells ( ~ 10<sup>5</sup>/well) in a 96-well plate were seeded in RPMI medium in the presence of 1% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum and incubated for 24 hr to synchronize the cells at G0/G1 phase. After 24 hr, cells were treated with PRL monomer, monomer released from PRL-CSA and PRL-GAL at a dose range from 0.5 to 4 µM. The unrelated protein ovalbumin was used as the negative control. After incubation, cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. To do so,10 µl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to the cells and incubated for 4 h. Subsequently, 100  μl of SDS-DMF solution (50% DMF and 20% SDS, pH 4.75) was added for overnight incubation. The absorption value of the product was measured at 560  nm and 690  nm as a background absorbance using a Spectramax M2e microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The fold increases in cell proliferation compared to untreated cells were plotted against the concentration of the sample administered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Adult, Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) (both male and female) taken for this study were maintained under the standard environmental conditions (12 h: 12 h, light: darkness cycle, chow, and water ad libitum). The Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC) at NISER, Bhubaneswar (ethical approval protocol number: NISER/SBS/AH-210 and NISER/SBS/AH-212), under the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments for Animals (CPCSEA), New Delhi, India, approved the experimental protocol. First, the animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and perfused transcardially with 50 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4), followed by 100 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The pituitary glands were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C followed by immersion in 25% sucrose solution in PBS for 24 hr at 4°C. The pituitary glands were rapidly frozen in powdered dry ice, sectioned on the cryostat (Leica, CM3050 S), and sections were mounted on poly-L-lysine (Sigma) coated glass slides. The sections were processed for double immunofluorescence. The sections were rinsed twice in PBS/TBS followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20  min. The sections were incubated in blocking solution for 30 min. The double immunofluorescence was performed in a humidified chamber by incubating the sections in a mixture of anti-PRL (Guinea pig polyclonal, from A. F. Parlow, National Hormone, and Pituitary Program, Harbor-ULCA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, 1:1500) and mouse polyclonal anti-GAL antibody (Abcam, dilution 1:1500) overnight at 4 °C. Further, co-staining of pituitary tissue amyloids of GAL or PRL was performed using amyloid-specific (OC) antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, 1:500) and with respective hormone antibodies. All the primary antibody-stained tissue slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. The sections were rinsed in TBST and further incubated with the secondary antibody of goat anti-mouse FITC (1:500) or goat anti-rabbit FITC (1:500) or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-555 (1:500) (Thermo Scientific, USA) or goat anti-Guinea pig Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500) for 2  h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The sections were washed with TBST and mounted with a mounting medium. The sections were analyzed using a confocal microscope (Olympus IX81 combined with FV500) (Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) and images were recorded using a multi-channel image acquisition tool of Fluovision software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Similarly, the GH and ACTH double immunofluorescence was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-ACTH (kind gift of Dr. A. F. Parlow, NHPP, dilution 1:1000) and goat polyclonal anti-GH (R&amp;D Systems, dilution 1:1000) overnight at 4°C. The sections were washed and further incubated in a mixture of secondary antibodies [Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat IgG (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)] for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were rinsed and sealed with mounting medium, and the association between GH and ACTH analyzed under an AxioImager M2 fluorescence microscope attached with AxioCamMRm digital microscope camera (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). The microscopic images of pituitary sections showing GH and ACTH were captured using the same microscope and camera. For Thioflavin S (ThioS) staining, GAL and PRL staining was done using goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-555-conjugated secondary antibody or goat anti-Guinea pig Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500 dilution) respectively. The sections were then stained with 0.6% ThioS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5  min in dark. The sections were washed with 50% ethanol for 2 min followed by TBST washing for 3 min. The slides were then mounted in 90% glycerol and 10% PBS containing 1% DABCO (1, 4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2] octane, Sigma-Aldrich). The images and the sections were analyzed by multi-channel image acquisition tool of Fluovision software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and Olympus FV-500 IX 81 confocal microscope (Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan), respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Adult, female, Sprague-Dawley rats taken for this study were maintained under the standard environmental conditions and Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC) at NISER, Bhubaneswar, India approved the experimental protocols.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Co-aggregation and secondary nucleation in the life cycle of human prolactin/galanin functional amyloids&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Erik Otzen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Consider testing for colocalization of ACTH and GH</p><p>2) Consider analyzing the data with chemical kinetics</p><p>3) Consider discussing the physiologic implications of the findings</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>What are the physiologic implications of the findings? If co-aggregation of PRL-GAL is impaired and secretion is slowed, would this inhibit normal prolactin-mediated effects (lactation) or normal galanin-mediation effects (regulation of energy metabolism)? Could this have therapeutic implications for the treatment of prolactinoma? What are the functional implications of the finding that PRL amyloid fibers can cross-seed GAL monomers, but that GAL fibrils can't cross-seed PRL monomers? It would be useful to see if PRL-GAL facilitates synergistic aggregation to amyloid fibers in male rats in addition to female rats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is well written and easy to understand. All the results are explained clearly and the conclusions are drawn based on the provided results only. There are no major changes that need to be made. However, I would like to make a few suggestions in order to improve the manuscript.</p><p>– Although the term GAG is very familiar, incorporating the expanded form of GAG (Glycosaminoglycans) in the manuscript makes the readers more comfortable.</p><p>– In Line 180: &quot;We hypothesized that there could be 4 possibilities (case 1-4) when PRL and GAL are co-stored as amyloids&quot;.</p><p>The authors had mentioned about 4 cases and they have shown it as 5 cases in line 186 and Figure 2a.</p><p>– In line 669: &quot;After harvesting the cells at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes, it was dissolved in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0&quot;.</p><p>The fact that the cells were dissolved confuses the general reader.</p><p>– Authors should be appreciated for efforts to understand the Prolactin Galanon interactions at the atomic level by molecular dimensions simulations. Although it is not required as per the claims that authors have made, it might be better if they show a loss of interactions when the proposed site of interactions is mutated or deleted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I only have two major comments for the authors to reflect on.</p><p>1. The authors identify colocalization of PRL and GAL in Figure 1d. This is fine but potentially rather limited. What other hormones are stored in this tissue and could they conceivably be colocalized with these deposits? I.e. are we missing the bigger picture of higher-order colocalization? Did the authors test for other hormones as well or did they make an educated guess from the start? At least the prospect should be addressed. The authors subsequently examine ACTH and GH but it is not clear whether these hormones could be present in e.g. Figure 1d. Have the authors tested for colocalization of these hormones?</p><p>2. The authors present good arguments for secondary nucleation rather than elongation/fragmentation based on data in Figure 3. However, additional information could possibly be provided by analyzing the data with chemical kinetics using web-server programs such as Amylofit or designing experiments that might in principle distinguish between these options. I would like the authors to explore this further.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73835.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Consider testing for colocalization of ACTH and GH</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this revision.

It is known that intermolecular interaction (such as hormone-hormone, hormone-receptor), cross talk, and feedback (both positive and negative) are the important mechanisms, which are associated with hormone regulation in mammals. Further, protein/peptide hormone synthesis and their storage/secretion are controlled by various secretagogues/cellular factors. These mechanisms, often in combination, maintain normal physiological functions of hormones. In the context of the present study, peptide hormone galanin (GAL), which is known to be highly expressed in the hypothalamus performs various tropic activities including regulating the secretion of other neuropeptide hormones and neuronal differentiation<sup>1</sup>. Interestingly, GAL is overexpressed in the anterior pituitary during lactation<sup>2</sup>, which is known to regulate prolactin (PRL) expression, storage, and release<sup>3,4</sup>. Further, storing a high amount of PRL in the anterior pituitary during lactation is important for the development of lactotrophs<sup>4</sup>. In this line, GAL deficiency or functional mutation has been shown to inhibit PRL release as well<sup>4</sup>—suggesting its crucial role in PRL regulation in mammals. Naturally, efficient storage and release of GAL are necessary for PRL homeostasis.</p><p>However, basal expression of GAL in the endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary is low<sup>3</sup>. Further, not all PRL producing cells can synthesize GAL and its half-life (turnover cycle) is low (~3-4 min in circulation<sup>5</sup>) possibly due to its short length and unstructured nature compared to PRL (~41 min)<sup>6,7</sup>. Interestingly, irrespective of GAL secretion by a minority of lactotrophs (~ 9% of cells)<sup>3</sup>, it is however required to maintain its basal level for regulating the secretion of other neuropeptides such as PRL and VIP<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, lactotrophs that do not produce GAL are highly sensitive to this hormone but not to other secretagogues like VIP peptide<sup>3</sup>, suggesting the essential requirement of GAL for several pituitary functions. Therefore, efficient storage of GAL is essential for PRL storage and regulated release in absolute quantities as required during pregnancy and lactation. Together, these facts indicate that the physiological life cycle and functionality of PRL and GAL are complementary.</p><p>In this line, our data clearly showed GAL and PRL are interdependent on their storage inside the same secretory granules in high amounts in the amyloid-like state, ensuring the controlled release of these hormones. When GAL monomers release from the co-aggregates (PRL-GAL), it ensures further release of PRL and other tropic factors both in an autocrine and paracrine manner<sup>8,9</sup>. The co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding mechanism not only supports PRL storage and release but also helps to maintain a very low titre of unstable GAL to efficiently store in secretory granules for future use. Thus, a substantial decrease in physiological PRL levels would inevitably affect the storage of GAL and its subsequent release as they are in a positive feedback loop. On the other hand, over-production of GAL may result in hypersecretion of prolactin—leading to prolactinoma. Therefore, tight regulation is required for GAL synthesis and secretion. Taken together, our findings probe that co-aggregation and co-storage would allow much higher efficiency for hormone release and function than their individual storage.</p><p>We have now incorporated the physiological significance of our findings in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If co-aggregation of PRL-GAL is impaired and secretion is slowed, would this inhibit normal prolactin-mediated effects (lactation) or normal galanin-mediation effects (regulation of energy metabolism)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. This is an interesting point and we appreciate this query from you. Our study probes that PRL-GAL co-aggregation is one of the key mechanisms for PRL and GAL storage inside the secretory granules and subsequent release of PRL/GAL functional hormones. In this line, earlier studies showed that the generation of mice carrying a loss of function mutation in the endogenous <italic>GAL</italic> gene has shown a drastic decrease in PRL level compared to the wild-type controls<sup>4</sup>. This was accompanied by reduced PRL secretion, failure in mammary gland maturation, and loss of lactotroph proliferation upon estrogen treatment in the mutant mice after 7 days of postpartum compared to wild-type controls<sup>4</sup>. On the other hand, estrogen treatment drastically enhanced the GAL mRNA by several orders of magnitude<sup>2,4</sup> (also responsible for lactotroph proliferation and subsequent PRL over-expression), suggesting the common secretagogue for PRL and GAL. However, functional implications of GAL by loss of PRL synthesis/function are yet to be established.</p><p>It is important to note that PRL and GAL are co-stored in the lactotrophs of the female rat anterior pituitary<sup>10,11</sup>. Indeed, there are other pathways for homotypic PRL/GAL aggregation and subsequent storage in presence of glycosaminoglycans like CSA or <italic>Hep</italic>, respectively. However, homotypic aggregation might be insufficient to maintain the entire PRL/GAL protein homeostasis inside the living body, which is normally achieved by PRL-GAL co-aggregation. With the current knowledge, it is evident that impairment of PRL-GAL co-aggregation would very likely be detrimental in achieving the PRL mediated lactation and other tropic functions of GAL.</p><p>We have now discussed these points in the revised Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could this have therapeutic implications for the treatment of prolactinoma?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study indeed has potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of prolactinoma, which is caused by hypersecretion of PRL. Studies have shown that transgenic mice containing mouse GAL gene fused to rat PRL promoter causes hyperplasia and hyperprolactinemia (symptoms of prolactinoma) with a dramatic increase in GAL<sup>12</sup>. It has been well established that PRL secretion is directly governed by GAL secretion because over-expression of GAL, in most cases, is accompanied by over-expression of PRL<sup>3,13,14</sup>.</p><p>It is important to note that PRL and GAL cross-talk via a positive feedback loop for both storage and release. GAL, once released, causes further release of PRL and other tropic factors<sup>8</sup> via both autocrine and paracrine manner<sup>9</sup>. Therefore, a decrease in GAL level would also decrease the storage and release of PRL. This is also evident from our results indicating the co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding data. Exploiting this phenomenon, one could argue that by controlling (reducing) excess GAL levels, it is possible to prevent PRL hypersecretion (as seen for prolactinoma). This could, in principle, be achieved by targeting excess GAL in the bloodstream using specific antibodies targeted for proteolysis or by engineering small molecules/metabolites capable of inhibiting GAL secretion as previously demonstrated for various hormones<sup>15-18</sup>. Further, instead of targeting GAL, other metabolites such as Tryptophan amino acid can also be used that target PRL directly to control its release<sup>19</sup>.</p><p>One more interesting aspect of functional amyloids is that they must exhibit sustained release of functional monomers at the target site. It will be interesting to try to generate GAL analogs that can form stable co-amyloids with PRL, which would be incapable of releasing PRL monomers—thereby controlling the excess secretion of PRL. However, translating the current knowledge into therapeutics has challenges—primarily because, although PRL-GAL co-aggregation and unidirectional cross-seeding is very efficiently designed by nature, both hormones can also form functional amyloids independently in the presence of helper molecules such as GAGs.</p><p>We have now discussed this in detail in the revised Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the functional implications of the finding that PRL amyloid fibers can cross-seed GAL monomers, but that GAL fibrils can't cross-seed PRL monomers?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this interesting aspect. As we mentioned in response to question-1 the activities of GAL in the pituitary depend on its efficient storage and sufficient release. However, basal expression of GAL in the endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary is low<sup>3,4</sup> (unless overproduce by circulating steroid hormone, estrogen)<sup>3</sup>. Despite GAL being the most important factor for PRL release, not all PRL producing cells in the anterior pituitary produce GAL<sup>3</sup>. In addition, the lifetime of GAL is relatively low (~ 3-4 minutes)<sup>5</sup> in the bloodstream due to its short length and unstructured nature compared to PRL (~ 41 minutes)<sup>6,7</sup>. Therefore, efficient storage and release of GAL is physiologically highly relevant. Cross-seeding by PRL amyloids increases the chances of GAL storage and subsequent release. On the other hand, PRL storage needs tight regulation due to the risk of developing prolactinoma upon over-secretion.</p><p>From a thermodynamic point of view, templating mechanism requires the client monomers to change their fold—which requires a substantial amount of energy. It is very likely that for a folded protein like PRL, it is thermodynamically less favorable to undergo a conformational transition upon templating by GAL seeds. On the other hand, GAL is an unstructured neuropeptide and can easily be templated by PRL seeds. This is probably an evolutionary optimized design by nature so that tight regulation of multiple hormones storage and functions can be regulated.</p><p>We have discussed these points in the revised Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to see if PRL-GAL facilitates synergistic aggregation to amyloid fibers in male rats in addition to female rats.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for suggesting this important experiment. Notably, earlier studies on rat models have already shown that PRL and GAL co-localize exclusively in the lactotrophs (PRL secreting cells) of the female (and not in the male) rat anterior pituitary<sup>10,11</sup>. Based on this, we had limited our study to examine PRL/GAL co-aggregation only in the female rat anterior pituitary in our initial submission. However, after your suggestions, we have now performed the double immunofluorescence study of PRL/GAL colocalization in anterior pituitary of male rats. Consistent with previous studies, we also observed no significant colocalization of PRL/GAL (incorporated in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript is well written and easy to understand.

We want to emphasize that Case 4 (PRL monomers adhere to the GAL fibrils) and Case 5 (GAL monomers adhere to the PRL fibrils) are in essence vice-versa and fall under the same category. As per your suggestions, we have now replaced the case 4 and 5 terms in the manuscript as case 4a or 4b, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In line 669: &quot;After harvesting the cells at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes, it was dissolved in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0&quot;.</p><p>The fact that the cells were dissolved confuses the general reader.</p></disp-quote><p>The cells were pelleted down by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes and the pellet was subsequently dispersed in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0.

To address your queries, we have now done the MD simulation with various mutations/deletions to either of these hormones<bold>.</bold> We have chosen the complex 2 structure obtained from the Amber ff99SB force field to examine the effect of change in amino acids in hormones. We chose this structure as the formation of β-sheet is evident in complex 2 structures (GAL docked near the 80-88 residues of PRL) when the simulation is done using two different force fields (Amber ff99SB and GROMOS 53a6). We have mutated the residues of both PRL and GAL, which are involved in the formation of β-sheet to alanine, and also introduce a point mutation, to examine if there is a loss of interaction and the β-sheet formation. After altering these changes in complex 2 structure in Amber force field, we further simulated 400 ns simulation and examine the structural changes. We used the following alterations:</p><p>Case 1. GAL residues 2 to 5 (WTLN), which showed to form β-sheet after interaction with PRL are mutated to alanine as W2A, T3A, L4A, N5A.</p><p>Case 2. PRL residues 146 to 149 (IYPV), which showed to form β-sheet after interaction with GAL are mutated to alanine as I146A, Y147A, P148A, V149A.</p><p>Case 3. A point mutation is introduced at the 147<sup>th</sup> position of PRL with proline (β-sheet forming residues are 146 to 149) which is Y147P. The proline was chosen as it is known as a β-sheet breaker<sup>20</sup> and our goal was to examine if there is a loss of interaction due to substitution of tyrosine by proline, which would disrupt the β-sheet formation.</p><p>Case 4. N-terminal first two (GW) amino acid residues were deleted. These N-terminal amino acids were deleted as N-terminal 2-5 residues of GAL are involved in the PRL-GAL β-sheet formation in the complex 2.</p><p>We did not simulate the PRL deletion system, as deletion at the middle of the PRL helical structure (PRL residues 146 to 149) would bring in conformational changes in the PRL secondary structure itself, and correlating that with our interest of PRL-GAL β-sheet formation will be difficult.</p><p>Interestingly, in all the mutated systems, we observed loss of interactions (H-bonds) at the PRL-GAL interface, which eventually led to the loss of β-sheet structures (incorporated in the revised manuscript). It is worth mentioning here that a single mutation in PRL (Y147P; Case 3) was sufficient to disrupt the secondary structure formation, suggesting its key role in inducing the formation of β-sheet during co-aggregation of PRL and GAL (incorporated in the revised manuscript). Furthermore, deletion of N-terminal residues in GAL (Case 4) also resulted in the loss of β-sheet formation (incorporated in the revised manuscript). Thus, our MD simulation results convincingly show that the mutation or deletion at the PRL-GAL interface could result in the loss of β-sheet formation, which eventually affects the PRL-GAL co-aggregation. Now we have included this data in the revised manuscript with relevant discussions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I only have two major comments for the authors to reflect on.</p><p>1. The authors identify colocalization of PRL and GAL in Figure 1d. This is fine but potentially rather limited. What other hormones are stored in this tissue and could they conceivably be colocalized with these deposits? I.e. are we missing the bigger picture of higher-order colocalization? Did the authors test for other hormones as well or did they make an educated guess from the start? At least the prospect should be addressed. The authors subsequently examine ACTH and GH but it is not clear whether these hormones could be present in e.g. Figure 1d. Have the authors tested for colocalization of these hormones?</p></disp-quote><p>The query is very important in understanding the implication of our work and we thank you for asking this important question. The hormones produced in the anterior pituitary are Growth hormone (GH), Prolactin (PRL), Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and Luteinizing hormone (LH) and there can be at least 6x5=30 combinations by which two individual hormones can co-localize. However, it is also possible that more than 2 hormones can co-localize, which increases the possible combinations to a very large, unfeasible number to experimentally explore.</p><p>However, there are ample evidence that GAL over-expression enhances PRL release and PRL/GAL is released from a common secretagogue<sup>4,13,14</sup>. In this line, you are right that we indeed made an ‘educated guess’ by picking up PRL and GAL for studying their co-aggregation. This was primarily because PRL and GAL were found in the same secretory granules of the female anterior pituitary<sup>10,11</sup>.</p><p>However, after your suggestion, we have now tested for the co-localization for GH and ACTH in the female rat anterior pituitary using immunofluorescence. We found that GH and ACTH do not co-localize with each other (incorporated in the revised manuscript). This indeed increases the relevance of our findings and we thank you for this suggestion. We have now included this discussion and results in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As per your suggestion, we have now performed the global fitting analysis of the PRL-GAL cross-seeding kinetics data at different PRL seed concentrations (1%, 2%, and 5%) using Amylofit<sup>21</sup> (version 2.0), which has been extensively used to identify the underlying mechanism behind the kinetics of amyloid aggregation<sup>22-25</sup><bold>.</bold> We observed the data poorly fit with the nucleation-elongation model, which considers primary nucleation and elongation events. However, the kinetics data of GAL aggregation in presence of various PRL seeds (1%, 2%, and 5%) could be satisfactorily fit with the secondary nucleation model, which considers surface catalyzed secondary nucleation, along with classical elongation. The mean residual error (M.R.E.) in fitting in the elongation mechanism was observed to be higher compared to the fitting using the model with surface catalyzed secondary nucleation. The fitting data were in line with our hypothesis of surface-mediated amyloid assembly playing a dominant role in the aggregation mechanism of GAL in the presence of PRL seed (incorporated in the revised manuscript). We have now added this fitted data along with relevant discussions.</p><p>References</p><p>1. Lundstrom, L., Elmquist, A., Bartfai, T. and Langel, U.
