REMs is homeostatically regulated, ensuring that any loss of REMs is compensated by a subsequent increase in its amount. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the homeostatic control of REMs are largely unknown. Here, we show that GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons) are crucial for the homeostatic regulation of REMs in mice. POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are most active during REMs, and inhibiting them specifically decreases REMs. REMs restriction leads to an increased number and amplitude of calcium transients in POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons, reflecting the accumulation of REMs pressure. Inhibiting POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction blocked the subsequent rebound of REMs. Our findings reveal a hypothalamic circuit whose activity mirrors the buildup of homeostatic REMs pressure during restriction and that is required for the ensuing rebound in REMs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rapid eye movement sleep</kwd><kwd>sleep homeostasis</kwd><kwd>preoptic area of the hypothalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Shinjae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Shinjae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

REMs restriction leads to an increased homeostatic need for REMs. During the subsequent recovery sleep, the amount of REMs is increased to compensate for the amount lost during restriction. While seminal dissection studies indicate a pontine origin of REMs, recent studies have revealed that neural populations in the hypothalamus, midbrain, amygdala and medulla regulate REMs by promoting or inhibiting REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clément et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jego et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Dort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Torontali et al., 2019</xref>). However, we do not have a clear understanding about the homeostatic mechanisms regulating REMs and which brain regions integrate homeostatic REMs pressure.</p><p>The preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) is crucial for sleep regulation. The POA contains neurons that become activated during sleep and that are sufficient and necessary for sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Economo, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nauta, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinty and Sterman, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sallanon et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szymusiak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, POA GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons) form a subpopulation of sleep-active POA neurons, and promote sleep when optogenetically activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that c-Fos expression in the POA is increased in REMs restricted rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gvilia et al., 2006</xref>). However, the molecular identity of POA neurons that become activated during heightened REMs pressure and whether their activity is necessary for homeostatic REMs regulation remains largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, using fiber photometry, we found that POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons become gradually activated during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMs) before the onset of REMs and are most active during REMs. Optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons significantly decreased REMs. We therefore hypothesized that the POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are well suited to encode homeostatic pressure for REMs. Using fiber photometry recordings combined with REMs restriction, we show that the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons significantly increased during periods of heightened REMs pressure. Optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons during REMs restriction prevented the subsequent increase of REMs during recovery sleep. Our findings identify a hypothalamic circuit regulating the homeostatic need for REMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons are most active during REMs</title><p>To monitor the population activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons in vivo during spontaneous sleep, we performed fiber photometry recordings.

We found that the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons is preceded by an increase in the θ and σ power and reduction in the δ (0.5–4.5 Hz) power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These changes in the EEG are characteristic for the stage of NREMs preceding REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gottesmann, 1996</xref>) and their correlation with the activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons is consistent with a role of these neurons in promoting NREMs to REMs transitions.</p><p>In a complementary experiment, we monitored the calcium activity of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN axonal fibers.

Briefly, the animal’s brain state was classified based on real-time analysis of the EEG/EMG signals. As soon as a REMs episode was detected, a small vibrating motor attached to the animal’s head was turned on to terminate REMs by briefly awakening the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osorio-Forero et al., 2023</xref>).

Similarly, recent fiber photometry recordings demonstrated that GABAergic neurons in the POA and their subtypes expressing cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, tachykinin 1, or galanin are most active during REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miracca et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2024</xref>). Deleting the NMDA receptor GluN1 subunit in the POA reduced REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miracca et al., 2022</xref>), and in line with this, sustained optogenetic inhibition of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons specifically decreased REMs. Consistent with these studies, our findings also support an important role of the POA in REMs regulation and, in addition, provide evidence that these neurons are also part of the homeostat regulating REMs.</p><p>A previous study showed that the number of c-Fos positive POA neurons is positively correlated with the amount of REMs in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2002</xref>).

Together with our findings that the number of calcium transients of POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neurons increased during REMs restriction and that inhibition of these neurons blocked the following REMs rebound, these results support a crucial role of the POA in the homeostatic regulation of REMs. For the future, it would be interesting to test whether POA neurons projecting to other postsynaptic areas are also involved in the homeostatic regulation of REMs. A previous study showed that POA neurons projecting to REMs-regulatory pontine regions including the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC), and dorsal raphe nucleus express increased levels of c-Fos after periods of dark exposure that increased REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2002</xref>). However, the number of c-Fos positive POA neurons projecting to the LC was not increased upon REMs restriction, suggesting that this subpopulation may not be involved in the homeostatic regulation of REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verret et al., 2006</xref>). Besides the TMN, the POA also projects to other REMs-regulatory regions such as the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steininger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saito et al., 2018</xref>).

For sleep recordings, EEG and EMG signals were recorded using an RHD2132 amplifier (Intan Technologies, sampling rate 1 kHz) connected to an RHD USB interface board (Intan Technologies). For fiber photometry experiments, a calcium signal was recorded using an RZ5P amplifier (Tucker-Davis Technologies, sampling rate 1.5 kHz). EEG and EMG signals were referenced to a ground screw located on top of the cerebellum. At the start of each sleep recording, EEG and EMG electrodes were connected to flexible recording cables via small connectors. To determine the brain state of the animal, we first computed the EEG and EMG spectrogram for sliding, half-overlapping 5 s windows, resulting in 2.5 s time resolution. To estimate within each 5 s window the power spectral density (PSD), we performed Welch’s method with Hanning window using sliding, half-overlapping 2 s intervals. Next, we computed the time-dependent δ (0.5–4 Hz), θ (5–12 Hz), σ (12–20 Hz), and high γ (100–150 Hz) power by integrating the EEG power in the corresponding ranges within the EEG spectrogram. In addition, we calculated the ratio of the θ and δ power (θ/δ) and the EMG power in the range of 50–500 Hz. For each power band, we used its temporal mean to separate it into a low and high part (except for the EMG and θ/δ ratio, where we used the mean plus one standard deviation as threshold). REMs was defined by a high θ/δ ratio, low EMG, and low δ power. NREMs was defined by high δ power, a low θ/δ ratio, and low EMG power. In addition, states with low EMG power, low δ power, but high σ power were scored as NREMs. Wake was defined by low δ power, high EMG power, and high γ power (if not otherwise classified as REMs). Our automatic algorithm that has been previously used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antila et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schott et al., 2023</xref>, has 90.256% accuracy compared with the manual scoring by expert annotators. We manually verified the automatic classification using a graphical user interface visualizing the raw EEG and EMG signals, EEG spectrograms, EMG amplitudes, and the hypnogram to correct for errors, by visiting each single 2.5 s epoch in the hypnograms. The software for automatic brain state classification and manual scoring was programmed in Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tortugar/Lab/tree/tortugar-patch-1/PySleep">https://github.com/tortugar/Lab/tree/tortugar-patch-1/PySleep</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">tortugar, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Prior to the recording, the optic fiber and EEG/EMG electrodes were connected to flexible patch cables. For calcium imaging, a first LED (Doric lenses) generated the excitation wavelength of 465 nm and a second LED emitted 405 nm light, which served as control for bleaching and motion artifacts. 465 and 405 nm signals were modulated at two different frequencies, 210 and 330 Hz respectively. Both lights traveled through dichroic mirrors (Doric lenses) before entering a patch cable attached to the optic fiber. Fluorescence signals emitted by GCaMP8s or GCaMP6s were collected by the optic fiber and traveled via the patch cable through a dichroic mirror and GFP emission filter (Doric lenses) before entering a photoreceiver (Newport Co.). Photoreceiver signals were relayed to an RZ5P amplifier and demodulated into two signals using the Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies), corresponding to the 465 and 405 nm excitation wavelengths. To analyze the calcium activity, we used custom-written Python scripts. First, both signals were low-pass filtered at 2 Hz using a fourth order digital Butterworth filter. Next, we fitted the 405 nm to the 465 nm signal using linear regression. Finally, the linear fit was subtracted from the 465 nm signal to correct for photobleaching and/or motion artifacts, and the difference was divided by the linear fit yielding the ΔF/F signal. Both the fluorescence signals and EEG/EMG signals were simultaneously recorded using the RZ5P amplifier. Fiber photometry recordings were excluded if the signals suddenly shifted, likely due to a loose connection between the optic fiber and patch cable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Optogenetic manipulation</title><p>Sleep recordings were performed during the light phase (ZT2–8). Mice were tethered to bilateral patch cables connected with the lasers and a flexible recording cable to record EEG/EMG signals. The recording started after 30 min of habituation. For optogenetic inhibition experiments, 2 s step pulses (1–3 mW, 60 s intervals) were generated by a blue laser (473 nm, Laserglow) and sent through the optic fiber (200 µm diameter, Thorlabs) connected to the ferrule on the animal’s head for 3 hr (ZT2–5). This laser stimulation protocol was rationally designed based on previous reports of sustained inhibition and prior results that recapitulate similar findings as inhibitory chemogenetic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>). TTL pulses to trigger the laser were controlled using a Raspberry Pi, which was controlled by a custom-programmed user interface programmed in Python. Following sustained inhibition, an additional 3 hr (ZT5–8) recording was performed without laser stimulation (post-laser session). Baseline recordings were performed (without laser stimulation, ZT2–5), and counterbalanced across mice and days to avoid potential order effects. For each mouse, we collected two to three baseline and laser recordings each.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>REMs restriction</title><p>We employed an automatic REMs detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stucynski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schott et al., 2023</xref>) and used a small vibrating motor to terminate/restrict REMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osorio-Forero et al., 2023</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/luthilab/IntanLuthiLab">https://github.com/luthilab/IntanLuthiLab</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">luthilabcol, 2023</xref>). A small vibrating motor (DC 3 V Mini Vibration Motor, diameter: 10 mm, thickness: 3 mm, BOJACK) with a soldered lobster claw clasp was attached to a small wire hook secured in the dental cement of each mouse head. The motors had cables that were connected to a Raspberry Pi which controlled the motor onset and offset.</p><p>The automatic REMs detection algorithm determined whether the mouse was in REMs or not based on real-time spectral analysis of the EEG/EMG signals. The onset of REMs was defined as the time point where the EEG θ/δ ratio exceeded a threshold (mean + 1 std of θ/δ), which was calculated from the same mouse using previous recordings. As soon as a REMs episode was detected, the small vibrating motor turned on to terminate REMs and consequently woke up the mouse. The motor vibrated until the REMs episode was terminated, i.e., when the θ/δ ratio dropped below its mean value or if the EMG amplitude surpassed a threshold (mean + 0.5 std of amplitude). All REMs restriction experiments started at ZT1.5 and lasted until ZT7.5. Following the restriction, motors were turned off and mice were permitted to enter recovery sleep.</p><p>To monitor the calcium activity during REMs restriction using fiber photometry, we performed manual REMs restriction to avoid potential motion artifacts caused by the vibrating motor that could interfere with the integrity of the fiber photometry signals. Briefly mice underwent a 4 hr automatic REMs restriction protocol as described above. During the last 2 hr of restriction, REMs was detected manually based on the EEG and EMG signal by an experimenter who gently pulled on a string attached to the hook secured in the dental cement of the mouse head. To avoid potential photobleaching, the recording was performed during the last 1 hr of REMs restriction and 1 hr of REMs rebound. Each mouse also underwent a baseline recording on a separate day. The order of REMs restriction and baseline recordings were varied to minimize the impact of the experimental sequence on the results.</p><p>We also performed automatic REMs restriction combined with optogenetic inhibition. Each mouse underwent REMs restriction for 6 hr, and we continuously delivered 2 s step pulses (1–3 mW, 473 nm, Laserglow) at 60 s intervals during the last 3 hr of restriction (ZT4.5–7.5). Following REMs restriction, the recovery sleep was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of ΔF/F activity at brain state transitions and during NREMs</title><p>To calculate the neural activity changes relative to brain state transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2D</xref>), we aligned the ΔF/F signals for transitions across all mice relative to the time point of the transition (t=0 s). For each NREMs→ REMs or NREMs→wake transition, we ensured that the preceding NREMs episodes lasted for at least 60 s, only interrupted by short awakenings (≤20 s). To determine the time point at which the activity significantly started to increase or decrease, we used the first 10 s of NREMs as baseline. For REMs→wake and wake→NREMs transitions, the preceding REMs or wake episode was at least 30 s long. Using one-way repeated measures (rm) ANOVA, we tested whether the activity (downsampled to 10 s bins) within each 10 s bin was significantly modulated throughout the transition (from –60 to 30 s). Finally, using pairwise t-tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction, we determined the time bins for which the activity significantly differed from the baseline bin (activity for bin –60 to –50 s). The time point for a given 10 s bin was set to its midpoint. To account for multiple comparisons, we divided the significance level (α=0.05) by the number of comparisons (Bonferroni correction). To analyze the activity throughout NREMs, we normalized the duration of all NREMs episodes and the corresponding ΔF/F signals to the same length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Spectrotemporal correlation analysis</title><p>To identify features of the EEG spectrogram associated with POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN calcium activity, we adapted a receptive field model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schott et al., 2023</xref>) to predict POA<sup>GAD2</sup>→TMN neural activity from the spectrogram. Intuitively, we estimated a spectrotemporal filter using linear regression that predicts for each time point the POA<sup>GAD2</sup> →TMN calcium response. In more detail, we first computed the EEG spectrogram E(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>j</sub>) using 2 s windows with 80% overlap, resulting in a time resolution dt of 400 ms. Each spectrogram frequency was normalized by its mean power across the recording, and the parameter E(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>j</sub>) specifies the relative amplitude of frequency f<sub>i</sub> for time point t<sub>j</sub>. We then downsampled the ΔF/F response using the same time resolution as for the spectrogram, and extracted all time bins with REMs, NREMs, or wake for analysis.</p><p>To predict the calcium response, the EEG spectrogram was linearly filtered with the kernel H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>). In analogy to receptive fields estimated using similar approaches for sensory neurons, we used the term ‘spectral field’ for H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>). The spectral field can be described as the set of coefficients that optimally relate the neural activity at time t<sub>j</sub> to the EEG spectrogram at time t<sub>j + l</sub><italic>,</italic> where l represents the lag between the time points of the spectrogram and the neural response. The estimated frequency components of H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>) ranged from f<sub>1</sub>=0.5 Hz to f<sub>nf</sub> = 20 Hz, while the time axis ranged from –n<sub>T</sub> * dt = –50 s to n<sub>T</sub> * dt = 50 s. Thus, H(f<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>l</sub>) comprises n<sub>f</sub> frequencies and 2 * n<sub>T</sub>+1 time bins over a window from –50 to +50 s relative to the neural response.

To account for the large number of estimated parameters, we included a regularization term in the error function, which penalizes large kernel components and therefore guards against overfitting of the model.

To calculate the power within a given frequency band, we approximated the corresponding area under the spectral density curve using a midpoint Riemann sum. To compute the EMG amplitude, we calculated the PSD of the EMG and integrated frequencies between 5 and 100 Hz. To test whether laser stimulation changed the spectral density during a specific brain state, we determined for each mouse the δ, θ, or σ power for that state with and without laser. To compare the PSD between experimental and control mice, we calculated the δ, θ, and σ power with and without laser stimulation for each mouse and normalized the power values with laser by the power obtained for epochs without laser.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Detection of calcium transients</title><p>To detect calcium transients, we first filtered the ΔF/F signal with a zero-lag, fourth order digital Butterworth filter with cutoff frequency of 1/20 Hz.

By calcium photometry, these preoptic cells are most active during REM, and show more calcium signals during REM deprivation, suggesting they respond to &quot;REM pressure&quot;. Inhibiting these cells ontogenetically diminishes REM sleep. The optogenetic and photometry work is carried out to a high standard, the paper is well written, and the findings are interesting and enhance our understanding of REM sleep regulation. The new findings make it clear that as for the circuitry that regulates NREM sleep, REM sleep circuitry is also quite distributed in the brain. It is unclear if there is a true &quot;REM center&quot;. The study of mechanisms of catching up on lost sleep (sleep homeostasis), has previously focused on NREM sleep, where various circuits have been identified. That there is a special mechanism that also tracks time awake and compensates with REM sleep is intriguing.</p><p>In a broader context, the existence of REM rebound suggests that REM sleep must have a function, otherwise why catch up on it. There is a lot of literature that suggests REM contributes to emotional processing, for example. The new findings deepen our appreciation of REM regulation. As REM sleep is often disturbed in stress (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) and in depression, understanding more about REM regulation could ultimately aid treatments for people living with these conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92095.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Maurer et al investigated the contribution of GAD2+ neurons in the preoptic area (POA), projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), to REM sleep regulation. They applied an elegant design to monitor and manipulate activity of this specific group of neurons: a GAD2-Cre mouse, injected with retrograde AAV constructs in the TMN, thereby presumably only targeting GAD2+ cells projecting to the TMN. Using this set-up in combination with technically challenging techniques including EEG with photometry and REM sleep deprivation, the authors found that this cell-type studied becomes active shortly (≈40sec) prior to entering REM sleep and remains active during REM sleep. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of GAD2+ cells inhibits REM sleep by a third, and also impairs the rebound in REM sleep in the following hour. Thus, the data makes a convincing case for a role of GAD2+ neurons in the POA projecting to the TMN in REM sleep regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92095.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maurer</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Jiso</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sathi</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cardis</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Osorio-Forero</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lüthi</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Shinjae</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This valuable study advances our understanding of the brain nuclei involved in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep regulation. Using a combination of imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetic tools, the study provides convincing evidence that inhibitory neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus influence REM sleep. This work will be of interest to neurobiologists working on sleep and/or brain circuitry.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper identifies GABA cells in the preoptic hypothalamus which are involved in REM sleep rebound (the increase in REM sleep) after selective REM sleep deprivation. By calcium photometry, these cells are most active during REM, and show more claim signals during REM deprivation, suggesting they respond to &quot;REM pressure&quot;. Inhibiting these cells ontogenetically diminishes REM sleep. The optogenetic and photometry work is carried out to a high standard, the paper is well-written, and the findings are interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed feedback and thoughtful comments on how to improve our manuscript. To address the reviewer’s concerns, we revised our discussion and added new data. Below, we address the concerns point by point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points that could be addressed or discussed:</p><p>(1) The circuit mechanism for REM rebound is not defined. How do the authors see REM rebound as working from the POAGAD2 cells? Although the POAGAD2 does project to the TMN, the actual REM rebound could be mediated by a projection of these cells elsewhere. This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrate thatPOA GAD2→TMN cells become more frequently activated as the pressure for REMs builds up, whereas inhibiting these neurons during high REMs pressure leads to a suppression of the REMs rebound. It is not known how POA GAD2→TMN cells encodeincreased REMs pressure and subsequently influence the REMs rebound. REMsdeprivation wasshown to changethe intrinsic excitabilityof hippocampal neurons and impact synaptic plasticity (McDermott et al., 2003; Mallick and Singh, 2011 ; Zhou et al., 2020) . We speculate that increasedREMs pressure leads to an increase in the excitabilityof POA-&gt;TMN neurons, reflected inthe increased number ofcalcium peaks. The increased excitability of POA GAD2→TMN neurons in turn likely leads to stronger inhibition of downstream REM-off neurons. Consequently, as soon as REMsdeprivation stops, there is an increased chance for enteringREMs. The time coursefor how long it takes till the POA excitability resettles toits baseline consequently sets a permissive time window for increasedamounts of REMs to recover its lostamount. For future studies, it would be interesting to map how quickly the excitability ofPOA neurons increases or decays as afunction of the lost or recovered amount of REMs andunravel the cellularmechanisms underlying the elevated activity of POAGAD2 →TMN neurons during highREMs pressure, e.g., whether changes in the expression of ion channels contribute to increasedexcitability of these neurons (Donlea et al., 2014) . As we mentioned in the Discussion, the POAalso projects to other REMs regulatorybrain regions such as the vlPAG and LH. Therefore, it remains to be tested whether POA GAD2 →TMN neurons also innervate these brain regions to potentially regulate REMs homeostasis. We explicitly state this now in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The &quot;POAGAD2 to TMN&quot; name for these cells is somewhat confusing. The authors chose this name because they approach the POAGAD2 cells via retrograde AAV labelling (rAAV injected into the TMN). However, the name also seems to imply that neurons (perhaps histamine neurons) in the TMN are involved in the REM rebound, but there is no evidence in the paper that this is the case. Although it is nice to see from the photometry studies that the histamine cells are selectively more active (as expected) in NREM sleep (Fig. S2), I could not logically see how this was a relevant finding to REM rebound or the subject of the paper. There are many other types of cells in the TMN area, not just histamine cells, so are the authors suggesting that these non-histamine cells in the TMN could be involved?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that other types of neurons in the TMN may also be involved in the REMs rebound, and therefore inhibition of histamine neurons by POA GAD2 →TMN neurons may not be the sole source of the observed effect. To stress that other neurons within the TMN and/or brain regions may also contribute to the REMs rebound, we have revised the Results section.</p><p>We performed complementary optogenetic inhibition experiments of TMN HIS neurons to investigate if suppression of these neurons is sufficient to promote REMs. We foundthat SwiChR++ mediated inhibition of TMNHIS neurons increased theamount of REMs compared withrecordings without laser stimulation in the same mice and eYFPmice withlaser stimulation. Thus, while TMN HIS neurons may not bethe only downstream target of GABAergic POA neurons, these data suggest that they contribute to REMs regulation. We have incorporated these results in Fig. S4 .</p><p>We further investigated whether the activity of TMN HIS neurons changes between two REMs episodes. Assumingthat REMs pressure inhibits the activity ofREM-off histamine neurons,their firing rates should behighest right after REMs ends when REMs pressure is lowest, and progressivelydecay throughout the inter-REM interval, and reach their lowest activity right before the onset of REMs ( Park et al., 2021) , similarto the activity profile observed for vlPAG REM-off neurons (Weber et al., 2018).We indeed found that TMNHIS neurons displaya gradual decrease in their activity throughout theinter-REM interval and thus potentially reflect the build up of REM pressure ( Fig. S2F ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is a puzzle why most of the neurons in the POA seem to have their highest activity in REM, as also found by Miracca et al 2022, yet presumably some of these cells are going to be involved in NREM sleep as well. Could the same POAGAD2-TMN cells identified by the authors also be involved in inducing NREM sleep-inhibiting histamine neurons (Chung et al). And some of these POA cells will also be involved in NREM sleep homeostasis (e.g. Ma et al Curr Biol)? Is NREM sleep rebound necessary before getting REM sleep rebound? Indeed, can these two things (NREM and REM sleep rebound) be separated?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that POA GABAergic neurons, including those projecting to the TMN, are involved in NREMs homeostasis (Sherin et al., 1998; Gong et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2019) . Therefore, we predict that POA neurons that are involved in NREMs homeostasis are a subset of POA GAD2 → TMN neurons in our manuscript.</p><p>Using optrode recordings in the POA, we recently reported that 12.4% of neurons sampled have higher activity during NREMs compared with REMs; in contrast, 43.8% of neurons sampled have the highest activity during REMs compared with NREMs (Antila et al., 2022) indicating that the proportion of NREM max neurons is smaller compared with REM max neurons. These proportions of neurons are in agreement with previous results (Takahashi et al., 2009) . Considering fiber photometry monitors the average activity of a population of neurons as opposed to individual neurons, it is possible that we recorded neural activity across heterogeneous populations and therefore our findings may disguise the neural activity of the low proportion of NREMs neurons. We previously reported thespiking activity of POA GAD2 →TMN neurons at the singlecell level (Chung et al., 2017) . We have noted in themanuscript thatwhile the activity ofPOA GAD2→TMN neurons is highestduring REMs, theneural activity increases at NREMs → REMs transitions indicating these neurons also areactive during NREMs.</p><p>Using our REMs restriction protocol, we selectively restricted REMs leading to the subsequent rebound of REMs without affecting NREMs and consequently we did not find an increase in the amount of NREMs during the rebound or an increase in slow-wave activity, a key characteristic of sleep rebound that gradually dissipates during recovery sleep (Blake and Gerard, 1937; Williams et al., 1964; Rosa and Bonnet, 1985; Dijk et al., 1990; Neckelmann and Ursin, 1993; Ferrara et al., 1999) . However, during total sleep deprivation when subjects are deprived of both NREMs and REMs, isolating NREMs and REMs rebound may not be attainable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is it possible to narrow down the POA area where the GAD2 cells are located more precisely?</p></disp-quote><p>POA can be subdivided into anatomically distinct regions such as medial preoptic area, median preoptic area, ventrolateral preoptic area, and lateral preoptic area (MPO, MPN, VLPO, and LPO respectively). To quantify where the virus expressing GAD2 cells and optic fibers are located within the POA, we overlaid the POA coronal reference images (with red boundaries denoting these anatomically distinct regions) over the virus heat maps and optic fiber tracts from datasets used in Figure 1A. We found that virus expression and optic fiber tracts were located in the ventrolateral POA, lateral POA, and the lateral part of medial POA, and included this description in the text.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Location of virus expression (A) and optic fiber placement (B) within subregions of POA.</title><p>Mouse brain figure adapted from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=1#atlas=1&amp;plate=100960224&amp;structure=549&amp;x=5280.00732421875&amp;y=3744.197474888393&amp;zoom=-3&amp;resolution=11.97&amp;z=5">Allen Reference Atlas - Mouse Brain</ext-link>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92095-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It would be ideal to further characterize these particular GAD2 cells by RT-PCR or RNA seq. Which other markers do they express?</p></disp-quote><p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing of POA neurons has revealed an enormous level of molecular diversity, consisting of nearly 70 subpopulations based on gene expression of which 43 can be clustered into inhibitory neurons (Moffitt et al., 2018) . One of the most studied subpopulation of POA sleep-active neurons contains the inhibitory neuropeptide galanin (Sherin et al., 1998; Gaus et al., 2002; Chung et al., 2017; Kroeger et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Miracca et al., 2022) . Galanin neurons have been demonstrated to innervate the TMN (Sherin et al., 1998) yet, within the galanin neurons 7 distinct clusters exist based on unique gene expression (Moffitt et al., 2018) . In addition to galanin, we have previously performed single-cell RNA-seq on POA GAD2 → TMN neurons and identified additional neuropeptides such as cholecystokinin (CCK), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), prodynorphin (PDYN), and tachykinin 1 (TAC1) as subpopulations of GABAergic POA sleep-active neurons (Chung et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2023) . Like galanin, these neuropeptides can also be divided into multiple subtypes as well (Chen et al., 2017; Moffitt et al., 2018) . Thus while these molecular markers for POA neurons are immensely diverse, we agree that characterizing the molecular identity of POA GAD2 → TMN neurons and investigating the functional relevance of these neuropeptides in the context of REMs homeostasis would enrich our understanding of a neural circuit involved in REMs homeostasis and can stand as a separate extension of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Maurer et al investigated the contribution of GAD2+ neurons in the preoptic area (POA), projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), to REM sleep regulation. They applied an elegant design to monitor and manipulate the activity of this specific group of neurons: a GAD2-Cre mouse, injected with retrograde AAV constructs in the TMN, thereby presumably only targeting GAD2+ cells projecting to the TMN. Using this set-up in combination with technically challenging techniques including EEG with photometry and REM sleep deprivation, the authors found that this cell-type studied becomes active shortly (≈40sec) prior to entering REM sleep and remains active during REM sleep. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of GAD2+ cells inhibits REM sleep by a third and also impairs the rebound in REM sleep in the following hour. Despite a few reservations or details that would benefit from further clarification (outlined below), the data makes a convincing case for the role of GAD2+ neurons in the POA projecting to the TMN in REM sleep regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough assessment of our study and supportive comments. We have addressed your concerns in the revised manuscript, and our point by point response is provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors found that optogenetic inhibition of GAD2+ cells suppressed REM sleep in the hour following the inhibition (e.g. Fig2 and Fig4). If the authors have the data available, it would be important to include the subsequent hours in the rebound time (e.g. from ZT8.5 to ZT24) to test whether REM sleep rebound remains impaired, or recovers, albeit with a delay.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that it would be interesting to know how REMs changes for a longer period of time throughout the rebound phase. For Fig. 2, we did not record the subsequent hours. For Fig 4, we recorded the subsequent rebound between ZT7.5 and 10.5. When we compare the REMs amount during this 4 hr interval, the SwiChR mice have less REMs compared with eYFP mice with marginal significance (unpaired t-test, p=0.0641). We also plotted the cumulative REMs amount during restriction and rebound phases, and found that the cumulative amount of REMs was still lower in SwiChR mice than eYFP mice at ZT 10.5 (Author response image 2). Therefore, it will be interesting to record for a longer period of time to test when the SwiChR mice compensate for all the REMs that was lost during the restriction period.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cumulative amount of REMs during REMs deprivation and rebound combined with optogenetic stimulation in eYFP and SwiChR groups.</title><p>This data is shown as bar graphs in Figure 4.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92095-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>REM sleep is under tight circadian control (e.g. Wurts et al., 2000 in rats; Dijk, Czeisler 1995 in humans).

In Fig. 4, we analyzed the amount of REMs only during the last 3 hr of restriction (ZT4.5-7.5) as optogenetic inhibition was performed only during the last 3 hrs when the REMs pressure is high. In Fig. S4D, we looked at the amount of REMs during ZT1.5-4.5 and 4.5-7.5 and found that the amount of REMs during ZT4.5-7.5 (4.46 ± 0.25 %; mean ± s.e.m.) is indeed higher than ZT 1.5-4.5 (1.66 ± 0.62 %), and is comparable to the amount of REMs during ZT4.5-7.5 in eYFP mice (5.95 ± 0.52 %) in Fig. 4.

An alternative approach to tackle this could be the application of a different technique to achieve the same output (e.g. chemogenetics). However, both experiments (confirmation of inhibition, or using a different technique) would require a significant amount of work, and given the numerous studies out there showing that these optogenetic tools tend to work, may not be necessary.
