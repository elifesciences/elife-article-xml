Here we leveraged the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell RNA-seq data set to systematically characterize gene expression changes during aging across diverse cell types in the mouse. We identified aging-dependent genes in 76 tissue-cell types from 23 tissues and characterized both shared and tissue-cell-specific aging behaviors. We found that the aging-related genes shared by multiple tissue-cell types also change their expression congruently in the same direction during aging in most tissue-cell types, suggesting a coordinated global aging behavior at the organismal level. Scoring cells based on these shared aging genes allowed us to contrast the aging status of different tissues and cell types from a transcriptomic perspective. In addition, we identified genes that exhibit age-related expression changes specific to each functional category of tissue-cell types. Altogether, our analyses provide one of the most comprehensive and systematic characterizations of the molecular signatures of aging across diverse tissue-cell types in a mammalian system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>computation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan-Zuckberg Biohu</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF 1763191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 MD012867-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AG059307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000923</institution-id><institution>Silicon Valley Community Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH115676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Martin Jinye</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals global and tissue-specific aging markers and characterizes the heterogeneous aging status of different cell types and tissues in mouse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging leads to the functional decline of major organs across the organism and is the main risk factor for many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niccoli and Partridge, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>). Past studies have highlighted different hallmarks of the aging process, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vijg and Suh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikolich-Å½ugich, 2018</xref>). However, the primary root of aging remains unclear, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be fully understood.</p><p>To gain a better insight into the mammalian aging process at the organismal level, the Tabula Muris Consortium, which we are members of, created the single-cell transcriptomic data set Tabula Muris Senis (TMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>). TMS is one of the largest expert-curated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets, containing over 300,000 annotated cells from 23 tissues and organs of male and female mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). The cells were collected from mice of diverse ages, making this data a tremendous opportunity to study the genetic basis of aging across different tissues and cell types. The TMS data is organized into scRNA-seq expression of different tissue-cell type combinations (e.g., B cells in spleen) via expert annotation and clustering.</p><p>The original TMS paper explored primarily the cell-centric effects of aging, aiming to characterize changes in cell type composition within different tissues. Here we provide a systematic gene-centric study of gene expression changes occurring during aging across different cell types. The cell-centric and gene-centric perspectives are complementary, as the gene expression can change within the same cell type during aging, even if the cell type composition in the tissue does not vary over time.</p><p>Our analysis focused on the TMS FACS data (acquired by cell sorting in microtiter well plates followed by Smart-seq2 library preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>) because it has more comprehensive coverage of tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and is more sensitive at quantifying gene expression levels as compared to the TMS droplet data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the FACS data was collected from 16 C57BL/6JN mice (10 males, 6 females) with ages ranging from 3 months (20-year-old human equivalent) to 24 months (70-year-old human equivalent). It contains 120 cell types from 23 tissues, totaling 110,096 cells. We also used the TMS droplet data (derived from microfluidic droplets) for those tissues where the data is available, to further validate our findings on an additional data set generated by a different method.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis overview.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample description.

Furthermore, we characterized both shared and tissue-cell-specific aging signatures. Our study identified global aging genes (GAGs), namely genes whose expression varies substantially with age in most (&gt;50%) of the tissue-cell types. Interestingly, the changes in expression of these genes are highly concordant across tissue-cell types and exhibit strong bimodality. That is, these genes tend to be either downregulated during aging in most of the tissue-cell types or upregulated across the board. We leveraged this coordinated dynamic to construct an aging score based on the GAGs. We found that the aging score is significantly positively correlated with the chronological age, both in the FACS data and in multiple independent data sets. Moreover, the aging score contrasts the aging status of tissue-cell types with different functionalities and turnover rates, shedding light on the heterogeneous aging process across the 76 tissue-cell types. The score distinguished itself by its single-cell resolution and large data scale, as previous works either studied the biological age at an individual-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">JylhÃ¤vÃ¤ et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>) or focused on a small number of organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arrojo E Drigo et al., 2019</xref>).

We performed DGE analysis for each tissue-cell type separately, treating all cells from the tissue-cell type as samples. We tested if the expression of each gene is significantly related to aging using a linear model treating age as a numerical variable while controlling for sex. We applied an FDR threshold of 0.01 (the number of comparisons corresponds to the number of genes in the tissue-cell type) and an age coefficient threshold of 0.005 (in the unit of log fold change per month, corresponding to 10% fold change from 3 m to 24 m).

Interestingly, most tissue-cell types have more downregulated aging-related genes than upregulated aging-related genes, suggesting a general decrease in gene expression over aging. This downregulation pattern is unlikely to be confounded by technical factors such as sequencing depth because the 18 m/24 m mice were sequenced at a higher depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>). By doing separate DGE analyses using mice from one sex or mice from a subset of age groups (3 m/18 m), we further found that such a downregulation pattern was mostly driven by 24 m mice and was not specific to one sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

The x-axis shows the weighted proportion of tissue-cell types (out of 76 tissue-cell types) where the gene is significantly related to aging, while the y-axis shows the weighted proportion of tissue-cell types where the gene is upregulated. The tissue-cell type weights used here are inversely proportional to the number of cell types in the tissue, in order to ensure equal representation of the tissues. The visualization makes it clear that there are more downregulated aging genes than upregulated ones, consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Perhaps more strikingly, a bimodal pattern is apparent, in the sense that the aging-related genes tend to have a consistent direction of change during aging across most tissue-cell types. Interestingly, it was also recently reported in other studies that many shared aging-related genes exhibit consistent direction of change during aging across mouse tissues and cell types, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>), kidney, lung, and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tissue-cell level global aging genes (GAGs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tissue-cell level aging-related genes with color indicating the number of the genes.

This motivated us to define <italic>global aging genes</italic> (<italic>GAGs</italic>), namely the genes that are significantly related to aging in more than 50% of weighted tissue-cell types (i.e., cell types after normalizing by cell type frequencies using the tissue-cell type weights as described above). We identified 330 GAGs in total, among which 93 are consistently upregulated and 190 consistently downregulated (&gt;80% of weighted tissue-cell types); only 47 have an inconsistent directionality (upregulated in 20â80% of weighted tissue-cell types). We found that the GAGs significantly overlap with genes known in aging-related diseases, including strong overlap with genes related to Alzheimerâs disease (p=2.4e-11), neuroblastoma (p=1.4e-7), fibrosarcoma (p=3.3e-5), and osteoporosis (p=1.5e-4), and relatively weaker overlap with genes related to Huntingtonâs disease (p=2.5e-3), skin carcinoma (p=3.6e-3), kidney cancer (p=1.2e-3), acute promyelocytic leukemia (p=3.2e-3), acute myeloid leukemia (p=3e-3), endometrial cancer (p=1.6e-3), and hypertension (p=1.9e-3) (please see the Global aging genes subsection in Materials and methods for details). Our results are not sensitive to the specific choice of the 50% threshold for selecting GAGs; using different thresholds produced similar gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C</xref>) or GAG scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>) as detailed below.</p><p>We visualized the age coefficients for 10 top up/downregulated GAGs (a consistent direction in &gt;80% of weighted tissue-cell types) that are related to aging in the most number of tissue-cell types, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Many of these genes have been previously shown to be highly relevant to aging. For example, the downregulation of <italic>Lars2</italic> has been shown to result in decreased mitochondrial activity and increase the lifespan for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).

Moreover, <italic>Rpl13a</italic> was observed to be upregulated in almost all tissue-cell types. As a negative regulator of inflammatory proteins, <italic>Rpl13a</italic> contributes to the resolution phase of the inflammatory response, ensuring that the inflamed tissues are completely restored back to normal tissues. It also contributes to preventing cancerous growth of the injured cells caused by prolonged expression of the inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazumder et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to observe the upregulation of <italic>Rpl13a</italic> given that most old mice have severe inflammatory symptoms.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Gene Ontology (GO) biological pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the 330 GAGs are associated with apoptosis, translation, biosynthesis, metabolism, and cellular organization. These biological processes are highly relevant to aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tower, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anisimova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barzilai et al., 2012</xref>) and are shared across most cell types, consistent with the intuition that GAGs represent the global aging process across tissue-cell types. In addition, the KEGG pathways associated with the GAGs are consistent with the GO terms and additionally highlighted immune-related pathways and multiple aging-related diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Moreover, the findings were supported by similar analyses on the set of 59 GAGs discovered in the droplet data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A B</xref>). We also performed pathway enrichment analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">KrÃ¤mer et al., 2014</xref>), which confirmed our findings for the biological processes associated with the GAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Of note is the finding that the mTOR pathway, a known aging-associated pathway, is predicted to be inhibited given the expression of the GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weichhart, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papadopoli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C</xref>).

We aggregated the expression of global aging markers into a single score for each cell, referred to as the GAG score (please see the GAG score subsection in Materials and methods for details). We used the FACS data to identify the GAGs because it has more comprehensive coverage of different tissue-cell types. Intuitively, the GAG score tags the global aging process, and it reflects both the chronological age of the organism and the tissue-cell type-specific aging effects. To formally dissect these components, we defined a fixed-effect model with the GAG score being the response variable and various other factors, including the chronological age, sex, and binary-coded tissue-cell types, being explanatory variables. As a sanity check, the chronological age effect on the GAG score is significantly positive (p&lt;1e-100). The model explains 60.2% of the GAG score variance in the TMS FACS data while adding extra interaction terms between age and each tissue-cell type only slightly increased the model fit (explained variance 62.6%), indicating a reasonable fit for the current model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, while most young cells have smaller GAG scores and old cells have larger GAG scores, we also found four tissue-cell types whose GAG scores are similar between age groups and eight tissue-cell types that have a subpopulation of cells whose GAG scores are more similar to that of cells from a different age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), highlighting the heterogeneity of the aging process across tissue-cell types.</p><p>We next considered the tissue-cell type effects on the GAG score. Intuitively, a larger GAG score effect suggests that the corresponding cell type could be molecularly more sensitive to aging compared to other cells in the same animal. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, immune cells and stem cells have higher GAG score effects, while most parenchymal cell types have lower GAG score effects; such a contrast is also statistically significant, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Indeed, immune cells and stem cells are known to undergo the most substantial changes with aging. Specifically, the aging of the immune system is commonly linked to the impaired capacity of elderly individuals to respond to new infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). Also, adult stem cells are critical for tissue maintenance and regeneration, and the increased incidence of aging-related diseases has been associated with a decline in the stem cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ermolaeva et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, parenchymal cells like pancreatic cells, neurons, heart myocytes, and hepatocytes have lower aging scores. This could be an indication that these tissue-specialized cell types are more resilient to aging and are able to maintain their functions despite the changes in the animal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>GAG score.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tissue-cell GAG score effects with 95% confidence intervals.

To quantify this observation, we assigned a binary cell lifespan label to a subset of cell types where such data is available from literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hobson and Denekamp, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stewart et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arrojo E Drigo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darwich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lowry and Zehring, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geering et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheshier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fulcher and Basten, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scollay et al., 1980</xref>) (long for &gt;180 days and short for &lt;90 days, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>); using binary labels instead of the actual values allows us to incorporate more cell types whose exact lifespan information is not available but are known to be long-/short-lived. We found that short-lived cells have significantly higher GAG score effects than long-lived cells (p=1.68e-3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). One possible explanation is that the GAG score is associated with the biological processes related to cell proliferation, development, and death, which are more active in cell types that have a higher turnover rate. This striking difference is also consistent with the intuition that cells that have undergone more divisions (also with higher turnover rates) are ââolderâ and could have molecular memories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Validating the GAG score on external data</title><p>We performed several analyses to validate the robustness of the GAG score. First, the GAG score is not sensitive to perturbations of the current scoring method, including using different criterion to select GAGs or not performing cell-wise background correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>). We also found that estimating tissue-cell GAG score effects using only old cells gave an almost identical result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed a parallel analysis to identify GAGs on the TMS droplet data and found 59 such genes (due to smaller sample size and detection power). We found that 34 genes were shared between the droplet GAGs and the 330 FACS GAGs as described above (p=9e-48). Similar to the FACS GAGs, we also found that the droplet GAGs significantly overlap with genes known in many aging-related diseases, including Alzheimerâs disease (p=2.8e-4), neuroblastoma (p=1.2e-3), and fibrosarcoma (p=1.4e-3). In addition, we considered a set of 261 shared aging genes reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>. This scRNA-seq study contains cells from the kidney, lung, and spleen in both young and old mice, and the 261 shared aging genes were defined as genes significantly related to aging in more than five cell types in the paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>). We found that 90 genes were shared between Kimmel et al. genes and the FACS GAGs (p=2e-105) and 42 genes were shared between Kimmel et al. genes and the droplet GAGs (p=7e-69). All p-values reported here were computed via Fisherâs exact tests.</p><p>Using the GAGs identified from the TMS FACS data, we computed the GAG score and further estimated the GAG score effects for cells in the TMS droplet data, the bulk data (treating each mouse sample as a ââcellââ), the Kimmel et al. data, and the data set from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>. This last data set has only three subtypes of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and was therefore omitted in other analyses. We found that the chronological age effect on the GAG score is significantly positive in all four validation data sets (p=7e-10 for the bulk data due to smaller sample size and detection power, and p&lt;1e-100 for the other three data sets). Since the GAGs were selected based on the FACS data, the GAG score is agnostic of the age labels in the four validation data sets, confirming that the GAG score is truly indicative of the aging process.</p><p>The tissue-cell GAG score effects estimated from the other four data sets are also in line with those estimated from the FACS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4E F</xref>). Specifically, in the droplet data and the Kimmel et al. data, immune cell types have higher GAG score effects while epithelial, endothelial, and parenchymal cell types have lower GAG score effects. In particular for the droplet data, short-lived cell types also have higher but non-significant GAG score effects, due to a smaller number of annotated cell types. While looking at the bulk data, we found that immune-related tissues and organs such as whole blood, spleen, and marrow have the highest GAG score effects. It is interesting to observe that in the Kowalczyk et al. data, the GAG score effects of MPPs (multipotent progenitors) is less than that of ST-HSCs (short-term HSCs) which is less than that of LT-HSCs (long-term HSCs). This is exactly aligned with the differentiation potentials of these three cell types, consistent with the hypothesis that more stem-like cells have higher GAG score effects as observed in the FACS data.</p><p>Finally, we found that the tissue-cell GAG score effects are highly consistent between data sets (correlation 0.76 with p=2e-19 between the FACS data and the droplet data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, correlation 0.75 with p=1e-3 between the FACS data and the Kimmel et al. data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). In summary, we showed that the GAG score is capable of describing the chronological age as well as the transcriptional changes during the aging process. Furthermore, we could use the tissue-cell GAG score effects to contrast the aging status of cell types with different biological properties, including functional categories and turnover rates. This provides a comprehensive analysis demonstrating how the GAG score captures the heterogeneous molecular effects of aging. Additionally, we repeated both the DGE analysis and the GAG score analysis at the tissue-level by combining all cell types from the same tissue. We observed qualitatively similar findings, supporting the robustness of the analyses.

Given a set of tissue-cell types, in order to have an overall meta age coefficient for cells in this tissue-cell type set, we first combined the age coefficients of all tissue-celï»¿ types within the set by meta-analysis; similarly, we also computed the outside-set meta age coefficient by meta-analyzing all outside-set tissue-cell types. Then we selected the genes that have significantly different within-set and outside-set meta age coefficients as the set-specific genes (please see the Category-specific aging genes subsection in Materials and methods for more details). Of note, almost no genes identified here are shared by GAGs.</p><p>In the original TMS paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>), each tissue-cell type was assigned one of the six functional category labels, namely endothelial, epithelial, immune, stem/progenitor, stromal, and parenchymal cells. When examining the data by functional category, we found that the endothelial, immune, stem, and stromal cells exhibit highly category-specific aging behavior. Indeed, we found a higher number of specific aging genes for these categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, their age coefficients are specific to the respective functional category, as we can see from the clear block structure across tissue-cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, when performing GO biological pathway enrichment analysis on these six sets of genes separately, we only found significant pathways for these four categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Among them, endothelial-specific genes were associated with various processes related to angiogenesis and negative regulation of cell migration; the latter suggests decreased endothelial cell functionality during aging because endothelial cell migration is essential to angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamalice et al., 2007</xref>). Also, immune-specific genes were associated with activation of various immune responses, in line with a strong link between the aging process and the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikolich-Å½ugich, 2018</xref>).

Together with the analysis in the first publication of Tabula Muris Senis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>), it forms one of the largest analysis to date of the mammalian aging process at the single-cell resolution. Of particular interest are the 330 global aging genes (GAGs) identified in the study. These genes exhibit aging-dependent expressions in a majority of tissue-cell types in the mouse. The GAGs are enriched with many interesting genes, including known human and mouse aging markers, aging-related disease genes, senescence genes, transcription factors, eukaryotic initiation factors, and ribosomal protein genes. Interestingly, most of the GAGs are strongly bimodal as their expressions either decrease or increase during aging across almost all tissue-cell types, suggesting that these genes have a uniform response to aging, which is robust to the specific tissue or cellular context. Moreover, we find a systematic decrease in expression for most genes as well as a decrease in the number of actively expressed genes, suggesting a turning off of transcription activity as the animal ages. A recent study has observed that the number of expressed genes decreases during cellular differentiation in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gulati et al., 2020</xref>). It is interesting that we quantify a similar phenomenon for aging, despite the substantial longer time-scale of aging compared to differentiation.</p><p>While we focused on detecting genes whose changes with age are linear and non-sex-specific, it is also interesting to study aging-related changes that are non-linear or sex-specific. For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, the number of expressed genes changes with age in a non-linear and sex-specific manner, suggesting the existence of such genes. We have validated our findings using the TMS droplet data, the bulk RNA-seq data, and external data sets, and it is important to have further validations in future studies. In particular, the bimodal expression pattern is less apparent in the TMS droplet data, perhaps due to its limited tissue-cell type coverage and relatively shallower sequencing depth.</p><p>The remarkable bimodal consistency of the GAGs makes them useful as biomarkers to characterize the aging status of individual cells. We proposed a new aging score, namely the GAG score, based on the GAGs. The tissue-cell type-specific GAG score effects quantify how sensitive each tissue-cell type is to aging and are positively correlated with the cell division rate. For example, immune cells tend to have higher GAG scores than other cells of the same age and sex, which reflects the phenomenon that they undergo many cycles of cell division and also change substantially during the animalâs lifespan. One hypothesis is that the GAG score captures some aspects of the true biological age of the cells, which could be different from the birth age of the animal. An interesting direction of future work is to further investigate this model with functional experiments. In line with this, it would be important to study how some of the transcriptomic changes we quantify here, for example the downregulation of mTOR, point toward healthy aging or how can they inform experiments that can uncover the mechanism to ameliorate the aging effects. In addition, while the GAG score was proposed to capture the global aging status, there also exist cell type-specific aging programs; a combination of both would better characterize the overall aging status of a cell. The construction of cell type-specific aging scores would require a more comprehensive longitudinal catalog of diverse subtypes and states of cells within different cell types. While this is beyond the scope of the current work, it is an exciting direction to pursue when such data becomes available.</p><p>The GAG score is also related to the transcriptome age predictors developed in previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>), in the sense that they all use the gene expression information and are predictive of the animalsâ chronological age. The commonly used approach in previous works is to train a model (e.g., linear/logistic regression model) to predict the individualsâ chronological age from their gene expression. Instead of a model-fitting algorithm, our GAG score uses the GAGs that were selected from a broad range of tissue-cell types in an unbiased manner, by meta-analyzing the DGE results of 76 tissue-cell types and putting each tissue-cell type on the same footing. This ensures that the genes used by the GAG score capture the shared aging process and are not biased toward certain tissue-cell types. Indeed, the GAGs were shown to be associated with biological processes that are highly relevant to aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), providing better interpretability of the score. In comparison, previous studies focused on only one specific tissue, such as the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2015</xref>) or dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>), and hence may have selected genes that were biased toward that particular tissue.</p><p>Overall, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of aging genes across a wide range of tissue-cell types in mice. In addition to the biological insights, it also serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers working on related topics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>We considered five data sets, namely the TMS FACS data, the TMS droplet data, the data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaum et al., 2020</xref> (referred to as the bulk data), the data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>, and the data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>. For the TMS FACS data and the TMS droplet data, we filtered out genes expressed in fewer than 3 cells, filtered out cells expressing fewer than 250 genes, and discarded cells with a total number of counts fewer than 5000 for the FACS data and a total number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) fewer than 2500 for the droplet data. For the bulk data, we filtered out genes expressed in fewer than five samples, and filtered out samples expressing fewer than 500 genes. We did not filter cells for the other two data sets. For all five data sets, we normalized each sample to have 10,000 reads/UMIs per sample, followed by a log transformation (log(x + 1) where x is the read count). We note that such a procedure is the same as that in the original paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>).

Therefore, it is not a confounding factor and was not controlled for. We used the MAST package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finak et al., 2015</xref>) (version 1.12.0) in R to perform the DGE analysis. The zero counts in the scRNA-seq data were handled by the MAST package and we do not observe other types of missing data. We did not control for the cellular detection rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finak et al., 2015</xref>) (CDR, corresponding to the number of expressed genes in a cell) because we found that in our data, CDR is positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with technical covariates such as sequencing depth and the number of detected ERCC spike-ins, both when considering all the cells or when stratified by sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). As a result, controlling for CDR may remove genuine aging effects. We note that CDR is defined as the number of expressed genes in a cell, which is a fundamental quantity of the data set and is not specific to the MAST package. Therefore, such an observation does not imply a potential issue of MAST. Nonetheless, we found that the age coefficients, estimated with and without CDR correction, were highly correlated (0.89 for the FACS data and 0.93 for the droplet data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>), ruling out the possibility that CDR correction would significantly alter the result.</p><p>We used the BenjaminiâHochberg (FDR) procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) to control for multiple comparisons, where the number of comparisons corresponds to the number of genes in the tissue-cell type.

For a set of tissue-cell types, for example the set of all immune tissue-cell types, the genes specific to the set (or set-specific genes) are selected as follows. For each gene, we first estimate its within-set meta age coefficient by meta-analyzing the age coefficients of all tissue-cell types in the set assuming a random effect model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riley et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, it is done by assuming that there is a meta age coefficient for the set of tissue-types, and the age coefficient for each tissue-cell type in the set is a random variable whose mean is equal to the meta age coefficient of the set. Similarly, we estimate the outside-set meta age coefficient by meta-analyzing all tissue-cell types outside the set. Then, we define the set-specific genes to be genes whose:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>within-set meta age coefficient is significantly different from its outside-set meta age coefficient (FDR &lt; 0.01);</p></list-item><list-item><p>within-set meta age coefficient is large enough (absolute value &gt; 0.005);</p></list-item><list-item><p>outside-set meta age coefficient is not significantly different from 0 (FDR &gt; 0.01).</p></list-item></list><p>The p-values are computed based on the mean and the standard error assuming a normal distribution, and FDR is computed with respect to all genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Code availability</title><p>The code for reproducing all results is at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris-senis/tree/master/2_aging_signature">https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris-senis/tree/master/2_aging_signature</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Pisco, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:7dc782970300a97e9bca9038ba34728c857a0638;origin=https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris-senis;visit=swh:1:snp:40213ae8e5dd05dbdbdeb6bb45166c8436b328f1;anchor=swh:1:rev:0fd2ee501f4f3bd0e691b6071aee2c9286f1cf92/">swh:1:rev:0fd2ee501f4f3bd0e691b6071aee2c9286f1cf92</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank S Quake, R Sinha, R Sit, J Cool, B van de Geijn, H Shi,Â and X Xu for feedback.

presents a highly refined and validated global aging (GAG) score, as well as establishing category-specific murine aging genes, which together provide a comprehensive angle to understand aging at different scales. The GAG score enables capture of tissue-cell-type specific effects, setting more focus on the tissue- and cell type-specific aging status, and enables assessment of the general aging status.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Mouse Aging Cell Atlas Analysis Reveals Global and Cell Type Specific Aging Signatures&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lei Hou (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The proposed studies aims to in-depth analyses of aging transcriptomic signatures in mouse both at tissue-cell type and global level from single-cell data. It is an important perspective to understand aging not only for specific tissue-cell type but also the differences among them. One of the main contributions is a novel aging score metric, based on which aging process is compared across tissue-cell type pairs.

It may explain why in supplementary Figure 9, aging scores from immune cells compared to other cell types of this study show even weaker correlation with that based on blood samples from Peters' work (pvalue 5.4e-4, 0.08, compared to 1.8 e-5).</p><p>4.

The authors used a linear regression model to identify a set of up-/down-regulated aging-related genes, found a general down-regulation of gene expression in most tissue-cell types and revealed sets of aging regulated genes that shared by different tissue-cell types or that specifically enriched in some tissue-cell types. The authors further leveraged the average expression difference in the up- and down-regulated global aging genes, and proposed an aging score defined as a correlated factor that determines the change in different tissue-cell types without effects of age and sex. The manuscript is well organized, the results presented are impressing and the conclusions are pretty attractive. However, the data analyses need substantial revisions to draw any convincing conclusions, specifically, I have a list of concerns as below:</p><p>1. General concerns:</p><p>a. The sample size may be insufficient (10 males, 6 females) to build linear regression model to determine reliable correlations between certain gene expression with the two factors of age and sex in single-cell level.</p><p>b. Since the TMS datasets are curated from a collaboration program with different labs, confounding batch effects should be explicitly evaluated and resolved before any further analysis.</p><p>c. Though many platforms and technologies may have built-in strategies to deal with uncertainty of RNA copy number, normalization of single cell transcriptome are still highly recommended in the data processing to control technical inconsistency and calculation of DGE. The MAST package is aware of the problem and use the CDR calculation as alternatives of normalization, which, however, was omitted by the authors when using the package.</p><p>d. Beside the validation of the aging score, parallel analyses of droplets datasets should be performed in the same tissue-cell types to validate their findings.</p><p>2. Identification of aging-related genes:</p><p>a. In the linear model of DGE with age and sex, it is unclear what the observations were in the model, whether the statistical test performed in individual cells across different tissue-cell types; how to deal with missing data; and how to control the effect of cell numbers if the tests are performed in tissue-cell types level.</p><p>b. FDR calculation is highly depend on simultaneous consideration of comparisons in multiple tests. It is also unclear what the exact number of comparisons considered in each FDR test.</p><p>c. Figure 1B shows number comparison between up- and down-regulated genes related to age regardless of sex, however the authors should clarify whether the sex has effect on the result and a new figure of the comparison considering sex is highly recommended.</p><p>3. Tissue-cell level global aging markers:</p><p>a. The definition of global aging genes is based on an arbitrary cutoff of half of tissue-cell types without considering the data structure, tissue-cell similarities or proportions of cells determined in mice, which may be conceptually confusing if change happened as data accumulating and new tissue-cell types identified.</p><p>b. For those up- or down-regulated genes in specific tissue-cell types, a pickup top 20 genes is not convincing and it is necessary to evaluate the significance of the involvement of those genes in shared biological progresses or functions.</p><p>4. Aging score based on global aging genes:</p><p>a. The aging score is defined based simply on the potential determinants in the average expression changes between up- and down-regulated global aging genes without the effects from age and sex, which is not intuitively straightforward and confusing, given the ambiguous involvement in biological functions or regulations of the list of genes.</p><p>b. The authors claim that aging score is correlated with the cell turnover but failed to show any solid evidence.</p><p>5. Tissue-cell-specific aging genes:</p><p>a. The authors grouped tissue-cell types into 6 categories based on annotated functionality, and then identified over-represented genes in each category as tissue-cell-specific aging genes. I am wondering why not define the tissue-cell-specific aging genes in original tissue-cell types; the arbitrary grouping may be inaccurate and inevitably reduced the resolution of the tissue-cell specificity.</p><p>b. Again, the author failed to establish solid connection between these tissue-cell-specific aging genes and the tissue-cell specific functions or aging progress, which makes the result less reliable.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mouse Aging Cell Atlas Analysis Reveals Global and Cell Type Specific Aging Signatures&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

GAG score, due to its nature of capturing global pattern, may lose the power to identify the aging state of those cell types with the specific program associated with aging.

However, This may be potentially explained by catogery-specific aging genes later identified.

Further, an accurate aging score for a specific cell type may be better consisting of two parts, global aging score, and specific aging score.</p><p>3.

What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The proposed studies aims to in-depth analyses of aging transcriptomic signatures in mouse both at tissue-cell type and global level from single-cell data. It is an important perspective to understand aging not only for specific tissue-cell type but also the differences among them. One of the main contributions is a novel aging score metric, based on which aging process is compared across tissue-cell type pairs. However, I have several concerns about this aging score and would prefer a revision from the authors.</p><p>1. I am confused about the method you used to calculate the aging score.</p><p>In main text, the aging score is calculated for each cell, then averaged at tissue-cell type level, and regress out age and sex; while in method for each cell, after adjusting the background, age and sex are regressed out from the raw aging score, then the scores are averaged at tissue-cell type level.</p><p>2.

It may explain why in supplementary Figure 9, aging scores from immune cells compared to other cell types of this study show even weaker correlation with that based on blood samples from Peters' work (pvalue 5.4e-4, 0.08, compared to 1.8 e-5).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We agree with the reviewer and have substantially revised our aging score analysis. In the revised workflow, we first compute the aging score for each cell the same way as before, namely by taking the mean expression of the up-regulated global aging genes minus the mean expression of the down-regulated global aging genes. We refer to this quantity as the global aging gene (GAG) score as suggested by comment (2).</p><p>Next, as suggested by comment (3), instead of using the aging score residuals to study tissue-cell-specific aging effects, we formally define a fixed effect model to jointly model the effects of the chronological age, sex, and tissue-cell types on the GAG score:</p><p>GAG score ~ chronological age + sex + tissue-cell-type</p><p>Then we estimate the tissue-cell GAG score effects via regression (please see the GAG score subsection in Methods for more details). The tissue-cell GAG score effects capture how the GAG score of cells from the tissue-cell type deviates from the average GAG score of cells in the same age and sex group. Intuitively, a larger GAG score effect suggests that the corresponding cell type could be molecularly more sensitive to aging compared to other cells in the same animal.</p><p>We replicated all of our original findings using this estimated tissue-cell type GAG effects. First, we find that different tissue-cell types have heterogeneous effects on the GAG score, following the same ordering as in our original submission (Original Figure 3A, Revision Figure 3A). Second, stem cells and immune cells have higher effects while parenchymal cells have lower effects (Original Supp. Figure 8, Revision Figure 3B). Third, short-lived cells have higher GAG score effects (Original Figure 3B, Revision Figure 3C); and the estimates are consistent between different datasets (Original Figure 3C, Revision Figure 3D). These results demonstrate that we can reproduce and support our findings with this more principled statistical model of aging scores.</p><p>We removed the comparison to Peters et al. work since we do not focus on predicting the chronological age using the GAG score as was done in Peters et al. Instead, we focus on using the GAG score to contrast the tissue-cell specific aging effects. Moreover, Peters et al. primarily focused on blood cell types in their analyses, making it difficult to directly compare with our work which leverages a diverse range of tissue-cell types.</p><p>Instead, we included two additional data sets for comparison: Kimmel et al. GR 2019 on mouse aging in lung, kidney, and spleen, and Kowalczyk et al. GR 2015 on mouse aging in subtypes of HSCs. We further validated our GAG score analysis by showing:</p><p>1. The global aging genes identified in the Tabula Muris Senis (TMS) FACS data and the TMS droplet data significantly overlap with each other and both sets of genes significantly overlap with the 261 shared aging genes in Kimmel et al. (p=9e-48 between FACS and droplet, p=2e-105 between FACS and Kimmel, p=7e-69 between droplet and Kimmel).</p><p>2. Using GAGs identified in our FACS data, we compute the GAG score and further estimate the GAG score effects for all five data sets (TMS FACS data, TMS droplet, the bulk data from Schaum et al., Kimmel et al., Kowalczyk et al.). We found the chronological age effects on GAG score to be significantly positive in all five data sets, confirming that the GAG score captures the aging process.</p><p>3. The tissue-cell GAG score effects estimated from the five data sets are highly consistent.</p><p>4. Additionally, we showed that the GAG score is robust to different thresholds for selecting the global aging genes.</p><p>Please see the âValidating the GAG score on external dataâ section in the revised paper for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For comparing aging effects purpose, I don't understand why aging scores of cells from the young time point should be included in the final aging score for each tissue-cell type.

To address the concerns raised by the reviewer, we performed the same analysis, namely the tissue-cell GAG effects estimation via regression, using only the old cells (18m/24m). We found that the result to be highly consistent. Please see Supp. Figure 13H. Here, each dot corresponds to a tissue-cell type, x-axis corresponds to the tissue-cell GAG score effects estimated using all cells, and y-axis corresponds to the GAG score effects estimated using only old cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Mouse Aging Cell Atlas Analysis Reveals Global and Cell Type Specific Aging Signatures&quot;, Zhang and et al. systematically explored the aging-related genes in 76 tissue-cell types from 23 tissues in 10 male and 6 female mice from the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell transcriptomic dataset.

Our study is actually one of the largest single-cell RNA-seq aging studies, containing 110k annotated cells from 16 mice in the FACS data and 250k annotated cells from 23 mice in the droplet data. Other aging studies have relatively fewer cells or fewer animals, e.g., 55k cells from 7 mice in [Kimmel et al. Genome Research 2019] and 50k cells from 16 mice in [Ximerakis et al. Nat. Neurosci. 2019]. Moreover, the statistical power of our analyses is substantially enhanced due to the fact that we have a large number of sequenced cells from diverse tissue-cell types in each animal. In our study, we considered each cell as a sample, which enabled us to have sufficient samples for fitting the linear regression model. Because most single-cell RNA-seq studies have a limited number of animals, it is a common and accepted practice to treat each cell as a sample [Finak Genome Biology 2015]. We have added a clarification on this in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Since the TMS datasets are curated from a collaboration program with different labs, confounding batch effects should be explicitly evaluated and resolved before any further analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. The TMS data was centrally collected and processed at the CZ Biohub, and does not contain significant batch effects as verified in the original TMS data generation paper. Specifically, the original paper showed that cells from the same cell type would cluster together by unbiased whole-transcriptome Louvain clustering (Extended Data Figure 1g-h [The Tabula Muris Consortium Nature 2020], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2496-1/figures/5">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2496-1/figures/5</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

We agree with the reviewer that it is important to control for technical factors. We performed the size factor normalization the same as the original TMS paper (please see the âData preprocessingâ subsection in Methods).</p><p>We decided that it is better to not adjust for CDR because our analysis shows that CDR is positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with technical covariates such as sequencing depth and the number of detected ERCC spike-ins, both when considering all cells or considering each sex separately (Supp. Figure 1). As a result, controlling for CDR may remove genuine aging effects. This is why we presented the main results without CDR adjustment.</p><p>We also performed parallel analyses after adjusting for CDR and found that the age coefficients estimated with and without CDR correction were highly correlated (0.89 for the TMS FACS data and 0.93 for the TMS Droplet data, Supp. Figure 2). This demonstrates that our results are robust to CDR correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Beside the validation of the aging score, parallel analyses of droplets datasets should be performed in the same tissue-cell types to validate their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We have added parallel experiments for the droplet data as validations, including DGE analysis (Supp. Figures 1,2,4), aging trajectory analysis (Supp. Figure 6), pathway enrichment analysis (Supp. Figures 10A-B), all GAG score (global aging gene score) analysis (the âValidating the GAG score on external dataâ section in the main paper), and tissue-level validations (Supp. Figures 17-19). We found the results are consistent and added comments in the corresponding places in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Identification of aging-related genes:</p><p>a.

We performed a DGE analysis for cells in each tissue-cell type separately. The samples correspond to all cells in the tissue-cell type and the observations correspond to the expressions of the gene across the cells. The zero counts in scRNA-seq were handled by the MAST package and we do not observe other types of missing data. Since the tests were performed at a cell level for each tissue-cell type, the cell numbers will only affect the detection power for each tissue-cell type.</p><p>Therefore, it is not a confounding factor and does not need to be controlled. We have clarified these in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. FDR calculation is highly depend on simultaneous consideration of comparisons in multiple tests.

Figure 1B shows number comparison between up- and down-regulated genes related to age regardless of sex, however the authors should clarify whether the sex has effect on the result and a new figure of the comparison considering sex is highly recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the good suggestion. We also performed the same DGE analysis using only cells from one sex or using cells from a subset of age groups (3m/18m). Please see Supp. Figures 3-4 for the new results.</p><p>Specifically, Figure 1B showed that most tissue-cell types have more down-regulated aging-related genes than up-regulated aging-related genes. We found that such a pattern was mostly driven by 24m mice and was not specific to one sex. We also observed a similar pattern on the droplet data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Tissue-cell level global aging markers:</p><p>a. the definition of global aging genes is based on an arbitrary cutoff of half of tissue-cell types without considering the data structure, tissue-cell similarities or proportions of cells determined in mice, which may be conceptually confusing if change happened as data accumulating and new tissue-cell types identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the analyses to better account for the data structures that you mentioned. We instead use the weighted tissue-cell types to determine the global aging genes, where the tissue-cell weights are inversely proportional to the number of cell types in the tissue to ensure equal representation of different tissues. Please see the âGlobal aging genesâ subsection in Methods for more details.</p><p>We also performed a set of perturbation analysis to show that our results are not sensitive to variations of the global aging gene selection rules. Specifically, we have showed that:</p><p>1. Global aging genes selected using different significance thresholds give similar GO enrichment analysis results (Supp. Figure 10C).</p><p>2. Global aging genes selected using different significance thresholds and directionality thresholds give similar aging scores (i.e., the GAG scores, Supp. Figures 13A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. For those up- or down-regulated genes in specific tissue-cell types, a pickup top 20 genes is not convincing and it is necessary to evaluate the significance of the involvement of those genes in shared biological progresses or functions.</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial submission, we performed a canonical pathway enrichment analysis for global aging genes using the IPA software (previous Figure 2D, revision Supp. Figure 9B-C). In the revision, we also added a GO biological process pathway enrichment analysis using g:Profiler (Figure 2D) and performed KEGG pathway analysis using GSEA (GSEA MGSig Database, Supp. Figure 9A). The GO analysis showed that the global aging genes are significantly associated with apoptosis, translation, biosynthesis, metabolism, and cellular organization (each corresponding to multiple pathways with FDR&lt;1e-4). The result is supported by the canonical pathway analysis and the KEGG pathway analysis. These biological processes are highly relevant to the aging process and are shared across most cell types, consistent with the intuition that GAGs represent the global aging process across tissue-cell types. In addition, the IPA canonical pathway analysis also highlighted the mTOR pathway, which is known to be highly relevant to aging. Based on these analyses, we have improved the discussion of the shared biological processes and function of aging related genes in the âBimodal effects of aging and global aging genesâ section of the main paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This procedure allows us to incorporate more cell types where the exact lifespan information is not available but are commonly considered as long-/short- lived cells.

As shown in this new figure, the original model explains 60.2% of the GAG score variance in the TMS FACS data, indicating a reasonable fit. Adding the tissue-cell-type * chronological age interaction term in the model only slightly increased the model fit (explained variance 62.6%). In addition, we find the amount of improvement by the alternative model is similar across datasets. We added this result in the main paper.</p><p>It was difficult to visualize the multivariate model as scatter plotsâfor example the scatter plot of one of the covariates with the GAG score doesnât capture the joint regression. Therefore, we did not include it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. GAG score, due to its nature of capturing global pattern, may lose the power to identify the aging state of those cell types with the specific program associated with aging. It may be the reason for observations mentioned in line 135-138 and 146-148, specifically in Sup.Figure 11, for Brain.Non-Myeloid. neuron, liver.hepatocyte, mamary_glad.bascal cells, cells of 24 months even have a smaller GAG score than cells of 18 month. However, This may be potentially explained by catogery-specific aging genes later identified. Would tissue-cell type with more category-specific aging genes be more likely to show this heterogenous aging state pattern? Further, an accurate aging score for a specific cell type may be better consisting of two parts, global aging score, and specific aging score.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. As you suggested, we investigated whether tissue-cell types with more category-specific aging genes are more likely to show heterogenous aging patterns, and the data does not show a consistent association. For example, parenchymal cells, including neurons and hepatocytes as mentioned in your comment, in general have a more heterogeneous aging process pattern. However, as shown in Figure 4B, there are relatively fewer genes specific to parenchymal cells as compared to other categories.</p><p>As a side point, the mamary_glad.basal cells as mentioned in your comment only have cells from two time points (3m and 18m), and do not exhibit a heterogeneous aging pattern, namely 24m cells having smaller GAG scores than 18m cells. We removed the 24m label in the corresponding figure legend (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B, mamary_glad.basal cell panel) to avoid confusion.</p><p>More generally, while the current data allows us to construct a global aging score (GAG score), it is more difficult to construct cell-type-specific aging scores, which requires cataloging cell types at a higher granularity. For example, an immune-specific aging score would require a comprehensive catalog of different types and states of immune cells in different tissues and organs. Overall, we identified much more global aging genes (330) compared to tissue-cell type specific aging genes (14 to 76). Comprehensive characterization of tissue-cell type specific aging scores may be out of the scope of our current data, which is why we focus on the global aging score. We agree with you that this is an exciting direction of future work and we added a discussion on this in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Last session of tissue-level section is not interesting to me, since differential genes at cell type are already accurately defined, and there's no reason to go back to bulk differential signal, which may be confounded by other factors such as cell-type proportions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we have moved the tissue-level validation section to the supplementary material and added the following remark in the main paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
