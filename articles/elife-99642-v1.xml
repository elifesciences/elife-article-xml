We demonstrated that some of the key roles of the CLA complex can be attributed to the connectivity and function of a small group of neurons in its ventral subregion, the endopiriform (EN). We identified a subpopulation of EN neurons by their projection to the ventral CA1 (EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons), embedded in recurrent circuits with other EN neurons and the piriform cortex. Although the EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neuron activity was biased toward novelty across stimulus categories, their chemogenetic inhibition selectively disrupted the memory-guided but not innate responses of mice to novelty. Based on our functional connectivity analysis, we suggest that EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons serve as an essential node for recognition memory through recurrent circuits mediating sustained attention to novelty, and through feed-forward inhibition of distal vCA1 neurons shifting memory-guided behavior from familiarity to novelty.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endopiriform</kwd><kwd>ventral hippocampus</kwd><kwd>recognition memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radulovic</surname><given-names>Jelena</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamawaki</surname><given-names>Naoki</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanimura</surname><given-names>Asami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unveiling the circuit organization and functional roles of endopiriform neurons projecting to the ventral CA1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The claustrum (CLA) complex, an evolutionarily conserved brain region found across mammalian species, reptiles, and birds, is hypothesized to serve as a node for establishing higher-order cognitive functions by coordinating neuronal activity on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narikiyo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Norimoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crick and Koch, 2005</xref>). This view is based on its extensive connections with many cortical and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goll et al., 2015</xref>). Some of these functions include sensory perception and attention, which may affect memory processing, including working memory, associative memory, and recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardiner and Parkin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siegel and Castel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberauer, 2019</xref>). Consistent with this view, abnormalities of the CLA complex is found in major cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cascella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). However, microcircuitry and functional segregation of the individual constituents of the CLA complex have remained unclear.</p><p>The cytoarchitecture and genetic expression broadly divide the CLA complex into dorsal and ventral parts, with the dorsal part typically referred to as ‘CLA’ and the ventral part having its own nomenclature: ‘EN’ in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimstvedt et al., 2023</xref>). Current evidence indicates that the CLA forms reciprocal connections with dorsal cortices containing sensory, motor, and association areas generating diverse physiological effects depending on the cortical targets and their activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goll et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, EN primarily provides inputs to the piriform cortex and limbic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behan and Haberly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Majak and Moryś, 2007</xref>), suggesting its distinct circuit organization and role in bridging olfactory information processed by the piriform cortex and memory processed by the limbic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One of the distinct targets of EN, the ventral CA1 (vCA1), is known to coordinate in a range of behaviors related to exploration and recognition memory, and these functions are thought to be regulated by its afferent inputs in a domain-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunsaker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kesner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanimizu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Titulaer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broadbent et al., 2010</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that EN is a key node for the establishment of recognition memory. To address this, we set out to characterize the circuit and function of EN neurons defined by their projection to vCA1 (EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons) using genetic tools and mouse models of social and object recognition memory.</p><p>We found EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons innervated multiple components of the limbic system except the amygdala and prefrontal cortex and produced potent feedforward inhibitory control over vCA1 pyramidal neurons. During the recognition memory test, the activity of EN <sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> neurons were condensed around conspecifics or objects where mice spent most time on. However, disruption of EN <sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. activity only impaired memory-guided exploration of novel stimuli without affecting innate exploration induced by novelty. These findings demonstrate that EN subserves some of the key functions required for recognition memory governed by specific limbic systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endopiriform represents a major afferent of the ventral CA1</title><p>To assess the significance of EN as a vCA1 afferent, we injected a retrograde tracer (60 nl) into the vCA1 of mice and compared the number of the retrogradely labeled neurons in the EN and other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>).

The correlation of EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. activity with novel object preference in the pretest nevertheless suggests that these neurons ‘represent’ the innate preference without driving it. This functional specialization, likely associated with its unique circuit connectivity to the limbic system, could differentiate EN from CLA.</p><p>Studies on EN are generally scarce, and the available evidence of EN projections to vCA1 suggests that these projections are sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behan and Haberly, 1999</xref>). Potential reasons include the difficulty in clearly delineating the EN from CLA complex and non-uniform distribution of EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons along the antero-posterior axis. By leveraging contemporary circuit analysis tools, we demonstrated that the EN→vCA1 circuit is non-trivial; EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons were more numerous than commonly studied vCA1 afferents, including those from the septum and amygdala. Moreover, these axons exhibited a potent disynaptic inhibition of distal vCA1 pyramidal neurons, indicating their major functional implications for vCA1 activity.</p><p>Our data indicated that although EN axons terminated at the SLM of distal vCA1, they exhibited stronger connections to GABAergic neurons spanning from the Py-SR border to the SR-SLM border than to SLM neurons. The detection of EN inputs from GABAergic neurons at the Py-SR border was surprising, considering the distance between the soma position and the EN axons. However, there are several GABAergic cell types below SLM that extend their primary dendrites into SLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>), likely explaining the observed connectivity pattern. Among these are chandelier cells found at the Py-SR border, which preferentially inhibit the axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons, and are thus well suited to exert the powerful feedforward inhibition of vCA1 pyramidal neurons observed in our recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>There are several potential circuit effects by which EN inputs could affect the vCA1 function. One is the induction of non-linear events in vCA1 pyramidal neurons by acting in concert with other afferents (e.g. lateral entorhinal cortex targeting SLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilash et al., 2023</xref>) to generate a specific output pattern in pyramidal assemblies representing task-relevant stimuli. Alternatively, EN inputs may improve the signal to noise ratio of the information conveyed through the lateral entorhinal cortex, CA2 (in the case of social context), and possibly other afferents (e.g. CA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>). Another scenario is tuning of vCA1 pyramidal neurons’ response to familiar stimuli through a dynamic combination of a weak monosynaptic excitatory input and strong disynaptic inhibitory input. Such mechanism suggests that at a milliseconds scale novelty (EN) and familiarity (vCA1), recognition might occur though alternating rather than the simultaneous activity of brain microcircuits. Taken together, we propose a model for the role of EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons in recognition memory by balancing memory-guided attentional responses to familiarity and novelty through a combination of feedforward inhibition of vCA1 (a node for recognition of familiarity) and the recurrent circuits that contribute to sustaining attention to novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>The model of promoting novelty detection by suppressing familiarity responses is consistent with previous observations showing that vCA1 pyramidal neurons predominantly respond to familiar stimuli whereas novelty response can only occur through activation of vCA1 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, alternating activation of EN and vCA1 could prove essential for the behavioral relevance of EN activity associated with recognition memory, without affecting innate exploratory behavior to novelty. Accordingly, the latter behavior is primarily associated with the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, areas that are only weakly targeted by EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wei et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franklin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shah and Treit, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to advancing our understanding of the basic organization and function of brain circuits underlying higher cognitive processes, our findings suggest dysfunction of EN<sup>vCA1-proj</sup>. neurons could be a key contributing factor to the deficits in CLA complex function and recognition memory found in neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cascella et al., 2011</xref>).

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and were subcutaneously injected with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and Metacam (1.5 mg/Kg) for post-operative pain relief. After incising the scalp over the cranium, a small hole was bored with a microdrill bit, and a beveled glass pipette (Wiretrol II, 5-000-2010, Drummond Scientific Company) back-filled with mineral oil and front-filled with the material to be injected was slowly inserted into a target coordinate. After injecting a small volume (50–100 nL) with a custom-made displacement injector (based on MO-10, Narishige), the pipette was left in place for 3–5 min before slow retraction. The incision was closed with a nylon suture. The stereotaxic coordinates used were (relative to bregma, in mm): anteroposterior (AP) –3.0; mediolateral (ML) 3.12; dorsoventral (DV) 3.7 for ventral CA1; AP +2.0; ML 0.2; DV 1.5 and 2.5 for prefrontal cortex; AP 0.0; ML 0.2; DV 1.0 and 1.5 for anterior cingulate cortex; AP 0.0; ML 1.5; DV 0.3 and 0.7 for motor cortex; and AP –5.0; ML 3.0; DV 1.5 for dorsomedial entorhinal cortex.

Neurons were visualized with a 60 x lens (1.00 NA, LUMPlanFL N, Olympus) with the software Micro-Manager-2.0 gamma (US National Institutes of Health). Pipettes (4–5 MΩ) were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate capillary glass with a puller (model P-1000, Sutter instrument).

Photo-stimulation was repeated 3–6 times (at intervals of 10 or 20 sec) to obtain an average response trace. Photo-evoked responses less than 2 standard deviations of the baseline were considered as a ‘zero’ response.

All tested mice were habituated to the handling for 3 d. The water-soluble CNO purchased from Hellobio was dissolved in saline (final concentration was 0.1 mg/ml). Prior to the test day, we divided the subject mice into two groups. On the first test day (session 1), one group received clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and another group received a vehicle. After 30 mins, the subject mice were placed in a three-chamber box for 5 min (habituation), then in the same box with two pencil chambers containing the same object in opposite corners for 5 min (pretest). After 5 min break in their home cage, the subject mice were again placed in the same box, but this time, an object in one pencil chamber was replaced with a different object, and an object in another pencil chamber was replaced with a conspecific (3–4 wk old male, habituated to the handling and pencil chamber for 3 d prior to the session 1). This ‘sociability test’ lasted for 10 min and was followed by a social discrimination test after 30 min break in the home cage.

The aim of this study was to map the outputs of the endopiriform (EN) region of the claustrum complex, and understand their functional role. Here the authors have combined sophisticated intersectional viral tracing techniques, and ex vivo electrophysiology to map the neural circuitry of EN outputs to vCA1, and shown that optogenetic inhibition of the EN→vCA1 projection impairs both social and object recognition memory. Interestingly the authors find that the EN neurons target inhibitory interneurons providing a mechanism for feedforward inhibition of vCA1.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of this study was the application of a multilevel analysis approach combining a number of state-of-the-art techniques to dissect the contribution of the EN→vCA1 to memory function.</p><p>In addition the authors conducted behavioural analysis of locomotor activity, anxiety and fear memory, and complemented the analysis of discrimination with more detailed description of the patterns of exploratory behaviour.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99642.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Yamawaki et al., conducted a series of neuroanatomical tracing and whole cell recording experiments to elucidate and characterise a relatively unknown pathway between the endopiriform (EN) and CA1 of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) and to assess its functional role in social and object recognition using fibre photometry and dual vector chemogenetics. The main findings were that the EN sends robust projections to the vCA1 that collateralise to the prefrontal cortex, lateral entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex, and these EN projection neurons terminate in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) layer of distal vCA1, synapsing onto GABAergic neurons that span across the Pyramidal-Stratum Radiatum (SR) and SR-SML borders. It was also demonstrated that EN input disynaptically inhibits vCA1 pyramidal neurons. vCA1 projecting EN neurons receive afferent input from piriform cortex, and from within EN.

The authors propose that the EN input to the vCA1 interneurons provides a feedforward inhibition mechanism by which memory-based novelty detection could be promoted.

Finally, fibre photometry experiments revealed that vCA1 projecting EN neurons are most active when mice explore novel objects or conspecifics, and pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition led to an impairment in the ability to discriminate between novel vs. familiar objects and conspecifics.</p><p>The authors have addressed most of my concerns, but a few weaknesses remain :</p><p>(1) I expected to see the addition of raw interaction times with objects and conspecifics for each phase of social testing (pre-test, sociability test, social discrimination), as per my comment on including raw data. However, the authors only provided total distance traveled and velocity, and total interaction time in Figure S9, which is less informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologies for missing the request. We have added the raw interaction times in Fig. S9G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors observed increased activity in vCA1-projecting EN neurons tracking with the preferred object during the pre-test (object-object exploration) phase of the social tests, and the summary schematic (Figure 9A) depicts animals as showing a preference for one object over the other (although they are identical) in both the social and object recognition tests. However, in the chemogenetic experiment, the data (Fig S9B) indicate that animals did not show this preference for one object over another, making the expected baseline for this task unclear. This also raises an important question of whether the lack of effect from chemogenetic inhibition of vCA1-projecting EN neurons could be attributed to the absence of this baseline preference.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments. In Fig. S9B, although the group median at baseline (pretest) showed no preference for one object, individual subjects displayed a preference for one object (i.e., each data point deviated positively or negatively from 0.5) in saline condition. Therefore, we do not think that a lack of baseline preference accounts for the absence of the inhibition effect in the pretest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the finding that vCA1-projecting EN activity is associated with the preferred object exploration appears to counter the authors' argument that novelty engages this circuit (since both objects are novel in this instance). This discrepancy warrants further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. One possibility is that during the pretest, EN activity simply &quot;reports&quot; or &quot;represents&quot; the interaction time without driving exploratory preference. This aligns with our DREADD experiment data, which show that inhibition of EN neurons produced no overall behavioral effect. Innate exploratory behavior has been attributed to various circuits, including the medial preoptic area → PAG circuit (Ryoo et al., 2021, Front. Neuro.) and the Septal → VTA circuit (Mocellin et al., 2024, Neuron). We found no direct projection from these areas to EN (Fig. 6), but such connections could be established di- or polysynaptically. Moreover, these circuits could be driven by common inputs, such as the locus coeruleus or the cholinergic system for arousal, with only specific downstream targets, excluding EN, playing a key role in driving innate exploration and preference.</p><p>We have inserted the following sentence in discussion (line 253-255):</p><p>“The correlation of ENvCA1-proj. activity with novel object preference in the pretest nevertheless suggests that these neurons 'represent' the innate preference without driving it.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Line 209: Please remove the reference to neural activity 'predicting' behavior, as correlation analysis does not imply predictive power.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have changed the phrase to “Although EN<sup>vCA1-proj.</sup> activity was correlated with the behavior…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 236: It is unclear what is meant by: 'This circuit motif may predict the predominant role of ENvCA1-proj. neurons in social recognition memory'</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence to the following for the clarity:</p><p>“Since social odor information is crucial for discriminating conspecifics in rodents, this circuit motif may predict the predominant role of ENvCA1-proj. neurons in social recognition memory, given that social odor can engage multiple olfactory pathways innervating the piriform cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 7 title: insert 'with' after correlates: 'Activity of ENvCA1-proj. neurons correlates social/object discrimination performance'</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig S1 title: 'Projecing' typo.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig S8: Please rephrase for clarity: 'In pretest, the object was aligned by longer interaction time (preferred object is plotted in right side)'</p></disp-quote><p>We now have rephrased the sentence to:</p><p>“In the pretest plot, the object that the mice interacted with more is placed on the right side.”</p><p>References:</p><p>A septal-ventral tegmental area circuit drives exploratory behavior.
