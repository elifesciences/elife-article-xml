seasonality in impacting transmission. Misconceptions have relied on seasonal mediation of respiratory diseases driven solely by environmental variables.

Although a number of potential mechanisms driving seasonality in directly transmitted infectious diseases have been proposed, the causal process behind seasonality is still largely an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altizer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grassly and Fraser, 2006</xref>). In the case of the influenza virus, seasonal changes in humidity have been identified as a potential mechanism, with drier winter months enhancing transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaman and Kohn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shaman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalziel et al., 2018</xref>); similar patterns have been observed for respiratory syncytial virus and hand foot and mouth disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Onozuka and Hashizume, 2011</xref>). However, humidity is but one of many mechanisms contributing to seasonality in infectious disease transmission. Seasonal changes in temperature, human mixing patterns, and the immune landscape, among other factors, are thought to contribute to transmission dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metcalf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mossong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronfeld-Schor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altizer et al., 2006</xref>). The relative importance of these disparate mechanisms varies across directly-transmitted pathogens and is still largely unexplained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grassly and Fraser, 2006</xref>). The influence of seasonal host behavior on respiratory disease seasonality remains particularly understudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronfeld-Schor et al., 2021</xref>) except for a few notable examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bharti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Few et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kummer et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For respiratory pathogens spread via the aerosol transmission route, in particular, seasonality may be mediated by multiple behaviorally-driven mechanisms. Aerosol transmission, a significant mode of transmission for a number of respiratory pathogens including tuberculosis, measles, and influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tellier et al., 2019</xref>), has become increasingly acknowledged during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenhalgh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaweera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klompas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morawska and Milton, 2020</xref>). The role of aerosols in respiratory disease transmission allows for transmission outside of the traditional 6 ft. radius and 5 min duration for the droplet mode and implicates human mixing in indoor locations with poor ventilation as being a high risk for transmission, regardless of the intensity of the social contact. While more is known about the spatiotemporal variation in environmental factors such as temperature and humidity in the indoor environment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen and Dockery, 2016</xref>) and about the impact these factors have on airborne pathogen transmission (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robey and Fierce, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang and Marr, 2011</xref>), limited information is available on rates of human indoor activity and how this varies geographically and seasonally. In the United States, most studies quantifying indoor and outdoor time are conducted in the context of air pollutants, suffer from small study sizes, lack spatiotemporal resolution, and are outdated. The most cited estimates originate from the 1980s-90s and estimate that Americans spend upwards of 90% of their time indoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ott, 1988</xref>); more recent data agree with these estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klepeis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spalt et al., 2016</xref>). While it is well understood that seasonal differences and latitude likely affect time spent indoors, little is known of the spatiotemporal variation in indoor activity beyond this one monolithic estimate, vastly limiting our ability to comprehensively characterize the seasonality of airborne disease exposure risk.</p><p>Because our understanding of the drivers of seasonality for respiratory diseases has been limited, the modeling of seasonally-varying infectious disease dynamics has been traditionally done using environmental data-driven or phenomenological approaches. Environmental data-driven approaches incorporate seasonality into epidemiological models through environmental correlates of seasonality, such as solar exposure or outdoor temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coletti et al., 2018</xref>). This approach to seasonal dynamics controls for interseasonal variation in transmission dynamics and measures the strength of correlations between proposed metrics and seasonal variation in force of infection â although the observed relationship is rarely causally relevant for respiratory disease transmission. In contrast, phenomenological models such as seasonal forcing approaches modulate transmissibility over time without specifying a particular mechanism for this modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keeling et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altizer et al., 2006</xref>). By applying well-understood functions (such as sine functions), seasonal forcing allows for flexible specification and quantification of dynamics, such as periodicity or oscillation damping, and indirectly captures seasonal variation in nonenvironmental factors such as school mixing. A significant remaining gap in seasonal infectious disease modeling is thus the ability to empirically incorporate spatiotemporal variation in behavioral mechanisms driving seasonality of disease exposure and transmission.</p><p>Thus, despite the role of the indoor built environment in exposure to the airborne transmission route, seasonal variation in indoor human mixing has not yet been systematically characterized nor integrated into mathematical models of seasonal respiratory pathogens. To address this gap, we construct a novel metric quantifying the relative propensity for human mixing to be indoors at a fine spatiotemporal scale across the United States. We derive this metric using anonymized mobile GPS panel data of visits of over 45 million mobile devices to approximately 5 million public locations across the United States. We find a systematic latitudinal gradient, with indoor activity patterns in the northern and southern United States following distinct temporal trends at baseline. However, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted this structure. Lastly, we fit simple parametric models to incorporate these seasonal activity dynamics into models of infectious disease transmission when indoor activity is expected to be at baseline. Our work provides the evidence and methods necessary to inform the epidemiology of seasonal and pandemic respiratory pathogens and improve our understanding of the relationship between the physical environment and infection risk in light of global change.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data source</title><p>We use the SafeGraph Weekly Patterns data, which provides foot traffic at public locations (âpoints of interestâ, hereafter referred to as POIs) across the United States based on the usage of mobile apps with GPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Safegraph, 2021a</xref>).

(In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, we show that time at home does not display significant seasonal variation). Each POI is assigned a six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code in the SafeGraph Core Places dataset to classify each location into a business category. We classify each six-digit NAICS code (363 unique codes in total) as primarily <italic>indoor</italic> (e.g. schools, hospitals, grocery stores) or primarily <italic>outdoor</italic> (e.g. parks, cemeteries, zoos). We classify some locations as <italic>unclear</italic> if the location is a potentially mixed indoor and outdoor setting (e.g. gas stations with convenience stores, automobile dealerships). Approximately 90% of POIs were classified as indoors, 6.5% were classified as outdoors, and 3.5% were classified as unclear.

This method effectively clusters nodes (counties) into groups of nodes that are more connected within than between. The resulting clustering thus represents a regionalization of the United States in which regions consist of counties that have more similar indoor activity dynamics to each other than to other regions. One benefit of the network-based community detection approach over other clustering methods is that community detection does not require user specification of the number of clusters (regions, in this case); instead, the number of clusters emerges organically from the data connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and Reddy, 2013</xref>). For community detection, we use the Louvain method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>), a multiscale method in which modularity is first optimized using a greedy local algorithm, on the similarity network with edge weights (i.e. time series correlations) using a igraph implementation in <italic>Python</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louvain-igraph, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We performed a robustness assessment of the community structure using a set of 25 âbootstrap networks,â <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

We find three geographic clusters corresponding to groups of locations that experience similar indoor activity dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These clusters primarily split the country into two clusters: a northern cluster and a southern cluster. Among the communities in the northern cluster, activity is more commonly outdoor over the summer months, trending toward indoor during fall, with a peak in the winter months, as observed in Cook County. Comparatively, the southern cluster has a larger winter peak (i.e. between December and February) and a smaller summer peak (i.e. between July and August); most summer peaks are less extreme than that of Maricopa County (shown). We hypothesize that these two clusters are consistent with climate zones. While there is a moderate association between indoor activity seasonality and environmental variables such as temperature and humidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), we expect that the northern and southern indoor activity clusters will be more consistent with climate zones defined for the construction of the indoor built environment and find that there is indeed substantial consistency between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The third cluster differs substantially: it is geographically discontiguous and its two annual peaks occur during the spring (close to April) and fall (closer to November) seasons. Thus, the counties in this cluster have outdoor activity more frequently than average during both the winter and the summer.

To investigate the impact of heterogeneity in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> on the estimation of seasonal forcing for infectious disease models, we fit a sinusoidal model to the time series of indoor activity for each of the primary clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We note that because <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is defined as deviation from baseline indoor activity, the sinusoidal parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase) should be interpreted as a measure of seasonality in indoor activity, relative to each locationâs baseline. We find that the parameters of seasonality vary across clusters: the amplitude is higher, and the phase is lower in the northern cluster compared to the southern cluster, indicating a difference in the variability of indoor and outdoor activity seasonality in each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). While the fits are comparable for both clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), the sinusoidal model does not capture the second peak of indoor activity during the summer months in the southern cluster. These differences in best fit indicate that sinusoidal models may have an overly restrictive functional form, limiting the accuracy of the approximation, and may underestimate the impacts of seasonality on transmission, obscuring systematic differences between regions. Furthermore, differences in seasonal activity of the observed magnitude can have important implications for disease modeling; applying region-level and county-level forcing to a simple disease model alters incidence patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although region-level seasonality changes incidence timing and peak size relative to a non-seasonal model, it does not fully capture the changes produced by county-level seasonality. These differences indicate that while coarser geographic approximations of seasonality can be appropriate, these approximations can also oversimplify, reducing the accuracy of disease models. Additionally, while simple models of baseline indoor activity can capture seasonality in exposure risk, disruptions such as pandemics can alter this baseline structure and increase heterogeneity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Incorporating seasonality in epidemiological models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sine curves fit to the 2018 and 2019 time series data (analogous to seasonal forcing model components) fit the northern cluster better than the southern cluster, with a markedly poorer fit for the southern clusterâs second summer peak.

In settings with little prior immunity â such as a pandemic â host social behavior (generating contacts during which transmission may occur) primarily drives heterogeneity in disease dynamic and seasonality is dwarfed by susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2020</xref>). In settings with higher rates of immunity, the contact remains critically important, and seasonal changes in contacts (both direct and indirect) can contribute to the movement of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> above and below 1 â providing noticeable changes in incidence. Although environmental variables play a role in the seasonality of respiratory pathogens, the role of host social behavior in pathogen seasonality is poorly understood, driven by a poor understanding of indoor versus outdoor social interactions and interactions between behavior and the environment. In this study, we propose a fine-grain measure of indoor activity seasonality across time and space. This metric is a relative quantity of behavior, comparable across locations, and thus intended to be a measure of seasonality beyond a baseline. We determine that indoor activity seasonality displays significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity and that this variability is highly geographically structured. We also find that while indoor activity seasonality may be highly predictable under baseline conditions, disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic can alter these patterns. Finally, we provide an illustration of how our findings can be incorporated into classical infectious disease models using parsimonious models of exposure seasonality.</p><p>The indoor activity seasonality that we quantify may reflect heterogeneity in transmission risk via a number of mechanisms including those affecting host contact, susceptibility, or transmissibility. Increased indoor activity may indicate longer-duration airborne contact (e.g. co-location without direct interaction) between susceptible and infected individuals, elevating respiratory transmission risk. Increased indoor density may also suggest increased droplet contact (e.g. a conversation in close proximity), under homogeneous mixing. Additionally, indoor activity may suggest increased susceptibility as poor ventilation, increased pollutants, reduced solar exposure, and low humidity of the indoor environment have been shown to weaken immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moriyama et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, increased indoor activity may indicate an increase in transmissibility due to higher exposure as low humidity caused by climate control (heating, ventilation, and cooling, HVAC) in indoor environments has been shown to increase viral survival and HVAC re-circulation has been shown to increase viral dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2005</xref>). While our new measure does not disentangle these component mechanisms, it represents an integrated seasonality in exposure risk due to all of these factors and can help lead us to a more complete understanding of the heterogeneity and seasonality in disease dynamics and outcomes.</p><p>We find that spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the indoor activity metric can be decomposed into two large geographically-contiguous groups in the northern and southern United States representing distinct temporal dynamics in indoor activity. These groups closely correspond to built environment climate zones, potentially explaining this systematic variability. We note, however, that while these clusters overlap with climate classifications, this correspondence does not suggest that environmental variables such as temperature and humidity should be used to represent behavioral heterogeneity. Climatic factors within these climate zones may be related to, but not necessarily correlated with, the seasonality of human mixing within these zones. Additionally, even in the case that environmental factor variability drives behavioral variability, it would be critical to capture the effect of behavior on disease directly so as to not obscure any direct effects of climatic factors on disease.</p><p>We illustrate how to incorporate seasonality in exposure risk to future models of disease dynamics using a simple phenomenological model. We use this traditional model of infectious disease dynamics to evaluate the implications of the spatial coarseness of seasonal forcing. Our results suggest that the substantial local heterogeneity in the dynamics of indoor activity across time and space could be large enough to alter seasonality in infectious disease dynamics. While our work does not consider observed transmission patterns, we suggest that researchers carefully consider the spatial scale on which they model seasonality in theoretical models, commonly used for scenario analysis and model-based intervention design (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borchering et al., 2021</xref>). We additionally highlight that the use of simple or complex functional forms of seasonality requires statistical fits to baseline data and, in the case of disruptions, these fitted models may no longer be appropriate. . Although indoor activity is moderately anticorrelated with temperature and humidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), weather-derived covariates are not able to completely reflect the impacts of human movement (but they may have some statistical power). We show patterns of human mobility changed substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially contributing to changes in infectious disease seasonality.</p><p>Recent work during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the impact of reduced occupancy in indoor locations and increasing outdoor activity on the likelihood of disease transmission. In particular, behavioral interventions or nudges that reduce occupancy are more impactful than reducing overall mobility as they reduce visitor density and the likelihood of density-dependent airborne tnsmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the availability of outdoor areas in urban settings, such as public parks, has been demonstrated to reduce case rates when population mobility becomes less restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>). Our results suggest that such public health strategies should be implemented in a targeted manner, informed by real-time data, and with clear communication of the goals. We found notable changes occurred in indoor activity seasonality at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite relatively consistent patterns during the spring season in prior years. Designing a behavioral strategy and measuring its effectiveness without real-time data could thus be misleading. Our finding of two distinct geographic clusters of indoor activity suggests the need for geographical targeting of strategies to reduce indoor transmission risk. While northern latitudes might benefit from decreased indoor occupancy and increased outdoor activity in Northern Hemisphere winters, southern latitudes should be additionally targeted for such interventions in the summer months. Lastly, our findings highlight the need to communicate the goals of behavioral interventions clearly. While all communities universally reduced overall activity during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, some increased indoor activity during this time, potentially diminishing the positive effects of the social distancing policies put into place. A public health education campaign to clarify the role of indoor interactions in transmission risk may have ameliorated this.</p><p>Our study leverages a novel data stream made available to researchers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar datasets are available globally, part of a $12 billion location intelligence industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keegan and Ng, 2021</xref>). Such novel data streams offer many opportunities to address long-unanswered questions in infectious disease and climate change behavior dynamics, but these data must be interpreted carefully. Safegraphâs mobile-app-based location data does not include data on individuals less than 16 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Safegraph, 2021b</xref>). While we may expect that children under 12 may be accompanied by adults that may be represented in the dataset, our metric likely does not capture the activity dynamics of older children (children 12â15 make up 5% of the US population). For those included in the Safegraph database, representation is dependent on smartphone usage and a number of business processes not transparent to users of the data, thus we expect that there is geographic variation in the representativeness of the data. Smartphone ownership has increased in recent years, with 85% of US adults reporting smartphone ownership; however, smartphone usage does vary significantly by age, with only 61% of adults over 65 reporting smartphone use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pew Resesarch Center, 2021</xref>). Additionally, data shows that location sharing among mobile users is not significantly biased by age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, or education (with 40â65% of all demographic groups participating in location sharing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zickuhr and Smith, 2011</xref>). Based on an analysis done by Safegraph, the panel is representative of race, educational attainment, and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fox, 2019</xref>). On the other hand, a recent independent analysis shows that older and non-white individuals are less likely to be captured in the panel for POI-specific analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coston et al., 2021</xref>). It is important to note that both studies are associative in nature as the devices in the panel are fully anonymized, so no device-level demographic data exists. Continued work to understand the sampling biases of such datasets will be needed so that improved bias correction approaches can be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coston et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, we limit our scope in this study to consider only the number of visits and do not incorporate information about visit duration. The dataset counts all visits of 1 minute or longer. For disease transmission, there may be a threshold duration required for an interaction between an infected and susceptible individual for infection to be propagated. These thresholds are not well-understood for all respiratory diseases, but evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur with brief encounters has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pringle et al., 2020</xref>). While the Safegraph dataset does provide median dwell times for POIs, the likely significant heterogeneity in the distribution of dwell times remains unknown and is difficult to capture in an aggregated manner.</p><p>Our metric and analysis also focus on the US county scale to reflect the finest scale generally used for infectious disease modeling as well as public health decision-making. This choice is likely to ignore some within-county heterogeneity and means that our metric does not represent the experience of all groups, particularly by socioeconomic status. For example, low-income and racially marginalized communities have systematically less access to outdoor, natural spaces and spend more time indoors due to structural inequities including lack of paid leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spalt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nesbitt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sefcik et al., 2019</xref>). Such socioeconomic disparities have been further exacerbated during the pandemic, which potentially affects our indoor activity estimates during 2021. Thus, our estimate of a countyâs indoor transmission risk may represent an underestimate of the risk experienced by individuals in these communities. We commit to continued work to better characterize the transmission risk experienced by vulnerable populations. Lastly, we acknowledge that data modeling work that can influence public health policy decisions, particularly during an ongoing crisis, must be done with care to prevent misconceptions from having adverse effects on risk perception and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson et al., 2020</xref>). We thus strongly note that while our measure of indoor behavioral seasonality provides a potential driver of respiratory disease seasonality, it remains one among many complex factors which integrate to predict the transmission potential of an ongoing epidemic or pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Susswein et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we cannot rely on behavioral seasonality to diminish transmission naturally, and pandemic intervention strategies should not be planned around behavioral seasonality while population susceptibility remains high in so many locations.</p><p>Ongoing global change events highlight the importance of this work, as it informs how widespread disruptions may shift patterns of indoor activity, potentially altering traditional infectious disease seasonality. Climate change events will continue to cause significant disruption to normal behavior patterns; mechanistic understanding of infectious disease seasonality and real-time data collection will be crucial components of future disease control efforts. While other global change events may impact indoor activity in different ways than the COVID-19 pandemic, a rigorous understanding of the impact of host behavior on infectious disease allows policymakers and emergency preparedness experts to effectively address future disruptions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>is currently employed at the Rockefeller Foundation as a Data Analyst.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Guillaume BÃ©raud (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the major issues is related to the definition of &quot;indoor&quot;. It should be stated from the beginning what &quot;indoor&quot; locations are about, in particular, that home is not part of it, which is an important point to understand the results (and the discussion). Did the authors conduct any sensitivity analysis related to these choices?</p><p>2) Compare trends with other proxies for seasonality.</p><p>3) Provide a better justification of the clustering approach used (choice of methodology) and conduct the necessary sensitivity analyses (including choice of threshold).</p><p>4) Compare model fits to real COVID-19 data and/or ILI (because of the difficulty in dealing with NPIs for COVID-19), or step back from the claims that the 'Ï' metric generates better model fits given that you've shown that it yields different model fits, but not necessarily better ones.</p><p>5) Provide formal justifications for several claims throughout the Results section (e.g. a measurement of geographic heterogeneity in trends, and differences in pre-pandemic vs. peri-pandemic patterns).</p><p>In summary, this work has potential but requires essential revisions, particularly by clarifying some of the language used and by including more detailed and quantitative analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found this study to be well-conducted and impactful. There are a number of areas where it could be improved, particularly by clarifying some of the language and by including more detailed and quantitative analyses. In the following comments, I'll try to provide specific suggestions for where the authors might focus their efforts.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>10: Perhaps &quot;impacting&quot; rather than &quot;suppressing&quot;? The rest of the manuscript makes clear that the authors interpret seasonality as a force that can both enhance and suppress transmission, so it would be worth using consistent language here.</p><p>54-56 (&quot;While more is known aboutâ¦ rates of indoor activity.&quot;) I had trouble parsing this sentence. What do you mean by spatio-temporal variation in the indoor environment? At what scale? Are you talking about the environment itself, or the variation in people's experience of it? What kinds of rates of indoor activity are unknown, and why does this matter? It seems to me that this sentence is identifying the key gap that this study aims to fill, so it would be worth making this more precise.</p><p>90: What sort of global change do you mean? As it stands, the term is too vague to be meaningful here.</p><p>Figure 1: The authors could consider grouping Figure 1B by latitude rather than alphabetically; this might reveal some interesting patterns that more clearly support their findings of different seasonal patterns in the north vs. the south.</p><p>109: systematic how? This paragraph and Figure 1A seem to discuss just two counties, but a &quot;systematic&quot; difference suggests to me that there's some kind of variation that's observed repeatedly across instances (counties). It would be good to discuss here what exactly is systematic about this variation.</p><p>Figure 2: Did the data include Alaska and Hawaii and/or the territories? I would imagine these states might also have substantially different seasonal trends relative to the lower 48 and might give some indication of what sorts of seasonal trends we might expect outside the US.</p><p>140: Heterogeneous how? Can you provide some measurement of the degree of heterogeneity?</p><p>142: (&quot;in most locations indoor activity deviated from pre-pandemic trends&quot;) â again, as measured how? In what fraction of locations? To what degree did the trends deviate?</p><p>146: (&quot;activity was more likely to be outdoor than in prior years&quot;) â how much more likely? How widespread was this change?</p><p>158-159: It would be worth reporting the changes in amplitude and phase here, with appropriate units.</p><p>161: A poorer fit as measured how?</p><p>170: &quot;accuracy of disease models&quot; â I appreciate that the authors have shown that using different seasonal forcing terms as inputs can yield different epidemic curves, but I don't think they've made a formal assessment of accuracy here, which would require comparing model fits to disease transmission data. The evidence presented so far does not make clear to me the degree of detail needed in the seasonal forcing term to accurately characterize disease transmission trends, as this will depend on the disease dynamics themselves and the temporal and geographic scale of the model.</p><p>234: Perhaps &quot;southern latitudes should be targeted for such interventions in summer months as well&quot;? It seems that southern latitudes still have a substantial winter peak, it's just that they also have a summer peak.</p><p>278: Again, it would be worth specifying what global change events the authors have in mind here.</p><p>Another general point for the Discussion: how should we interpret differences in amplitude across locations? Since Ï is a measurement of the percent change in baseline activity, the indoor activity in a location with a high baseline but low Ï might still be higher than the indoor activity in a location with a low baseline but a large Ï. To what extent can we use Ï to compare indoor activity across locations in the US? Or can we only use it to compare variations in indoor activity within counties? Would it be worth including some analysis of the baseline indoor activity across the US, since Ï is really operating on this baseline?</p><p>288: Make explicit that you'll be referring to this as a POI.</p><p>294: What kind of spatial imputation did you do? Why?</p><p>Figures S7: It feels odd to me to have amplitude, frequency, and phase all plotted on the same vertical axis despite them all having different units. Perhaps a table would be better?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am confident that a revision of the issues in the public review would improve the quality of the paper and allow it to exploit the full potential of this work.</p><p>I believe that it is crucial to repeat the analysis taking into account the nature of the correlation matrix, so either adjusting the null hypothesis on modularity optimization or by using a different community detection algorithm.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, it is an excellent paper and very well written. However, there are some issues I'd like to be considered:</p><p>The major issue is related to the definition of &quot;indoor&quot;. It should be stated from the beginning what is &quot;indoor&quot; locations, in particular, that home is not part of it, which is an important point to understand the results (and the discussion). At the moment, it is only defined within the methods (Line 300), at the end of the article.</p><p>Line 43-41: Maybe authors could extend a few references on seasonality causes. But it is not mandatory.</p><p>Figure 1B: Why counties are ordered in alphabetical order? Which does not bring a lot of information, while it could be ordered by latitude, as an example, which could reveal some patterns.</p><p>Lines 103-106: authors should define more precisely what is the average (county-level? season? â¦).</p><p>Cluster: Maybe the clustering methods could be explained more extensively in the appendix.</p><p>Figure 3: I found it difficult to observe a shift in indoor activities, according to season.</p><p>Line 232-233: Isn't it the contrary? Increase of indoor activities in winter for northern regions?</p><p>Finally, a discussion on the difference between relationship and causality could be useful to distinguish human behavior seasonality and infectious diseases seasonality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80466.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the major issues is related to the definition of &quot;indoor&quot;.
