response to hypoxic conditions. The exact mechanisms behind HAPC are not fully understood. We utilized a mouse model exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (HH), replicating the environmental conditions experienced at 6000 m above sea level, coupled with in vitro analysis of primary splenic macrophages under 1% O<sub>2</sub> to investigate these mechanisms. Our findings indicate that HH significantly boosts erythropoiesis, leading to erythrocytosis and splenic changes, including initial contraction to splenomegaly over 14 days. A notable decrease in red pulp macrophages (RPMs) in the spleen, essential for RBCs processing, was observed, correlating with increased iron release and signs of ferroptosis. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia further exacerbated these effects, mirrored in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Single-cell sequencing showed a marked reduction in macrophage populations, affecting the spleen’s ability to clear RBCs and contributing to splenomegaly. Our findings suggest splenic ferroptosis contributes to decreased RPMs, affecting erythrophagocytosis and potentially fostering continuous RBCs production in HAPC. These insights could guide the development of targeted therapies for HAPC, emphasizing the importance of splenic macrophages in disease pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>high altitude</kwd><kwd>hypobaric hypoxia</kwd><kwd>high-altitude polycythemia</kwd><kwd>spleen</kwd><kwd>erythrophagocytosis</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32271228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Qian-qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81873924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Qian-qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82171190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Guo-hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338</institution-id><institution>Key Laboratory of Extreme Environmental Medicine, Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Cooperation Program KL2019GY011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Qian-qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hypobaric hypoxia exposure initiates splenic ferroptosis, reducing red pulp macrophages and exacerbating high-altitude polycythemia by impairing erythrophagocytosis and increasing red blood cell retention.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A plateau is a special environment characterized by low atmospheric pressure and low partial oxygen pressure. Long-term exposure to plateau environments may lead to chronic mountain disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pérez-Padilla, 2022</xref>). High-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) is a common and widespread chronic mountain sickness characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Hypobaric hypoxia (HH) is the main cause of erythrocytosis, which in turn alleviates hypoxic conditions in tissues under high-altitude (HA) exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tymko et al., 2020</xref>). In a healthy organism, a balance is maintained between erythropoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) and erythrophagocytosis in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dzierzak and Philipsen, 2013</xref>). Even though HA/HH exposure can disrupt the equilibrium between RBCs formation and clearance, healthy individuals can swiftly establish a new steady state of RBCs homeostasis in chronic hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robach et al., 2018</xref>). This adaptation is a critical response to the altered oxygen availability characteristic of HA environments. However, in patients with HAPC, RBCs homeostasis is disrupted, failing to reach a state of equilibrium, which ultimately leads to a persistent increase in RBCs count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dzierzak and Philipsen, 2013</xref>). This deviation from the normative adaptation process implies a pathological deviation from the usual compensatory mechanisms employed under chronic hypoxia conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). It is well-established that exposure to HA/HH can induce erythropoiesis, yet the pathogenesis of erythrophagocytosis under these conditions remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The spleen plays a crucial role in maintaining erythropoietic homeostasis by effectively clearing impaired and senescent RBCs from circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiang et al., 2023</xref>). Particularly, red pulp macrophages (RPMs) within the spleen, serving as primary phagocytes, are responsible for clearing senescent, damaged, and abnormal erythrocytes from circulation to recycle iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wirth et al., 2020</xref>). RPMs initiate the process of RBCs endocytosis and lysosomal digestion into heme, following the recognition of the RBCs earmarked for removal via their cell surface signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Slusarczyk et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vahedi et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequently, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) decomposes the heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nemeth and Ganz, 2021</xref>). Most of the iron recycled from heme is transported out of the cell through a protein called ferroportin (Fpn). This iron then binds to transferrin (Tf), a plasma protein that transports iron in the blood. The iron-transferrin complex interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR) on the cell membrane, contributing to the formation of RBCs in the erythroid compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hidalgo et al., 2021</xref>). A portion of the released iron is loaded into cellular ferritin (Ft; including Ft-H and Ft-L). In the presence of oxygen, the Ft-H facilitates the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> (ferrous ion) to Fe<sup>3+</sup> (ferric ion). Subsequently, the Ft-L stores this Fe<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The Ft-L features a nucleation site, consisting of a cluster of cavity-exposed carboxyl residues, which readily bind to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, thereby simplifying the storage process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finazzi and Arosio, 2014</xref>). When the iron metabolism is vigorous, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) can recognize Ft-H, bring Ft into the lysosomal pathway for degradation, and release iron in Ft for iron utilization in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellelli et al., 2016</xref>). However, some iron exists in cells in the form of ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), which is well known to be an important initiator of free radical oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the accumulation of large amounts of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in cells may cause ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Krusenstiern et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Despite the extensive study of erythropoiesis under HA/HH conditions, the precise effects of HA/HH on erythrophagocytosis within the spleen remain largely unexplored. Considering the significant role of the spleen in RBC processing and the crucial function of RPMs in iron recycling from RBC clearance, we evaluated the impacts of HA exposure on the spleen/splenic macrophages using an HH-exposed mouse model (simulating 6000 m exposure conditions). In the current study, we sought to further investigate whether HA/HH can influence the erythrocyte disposal and iron recycling processes in macrophages. More specifically, we aimed to determine the potential impact of HA/HH exposure on the integrity of the erythrophagocytosis process. We discovered that exposure to HH triggered ferroptosis in the spleen, particularly in macrophages. This led to a reduction in macrophage numbers, which was subsequently followed by disruptions in erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling within the spleen. These findings may hold clinical significance, particularly in the context of continuous pathological erythrocytosis and the progression of HAPC under HA exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HH exposure promotes erythrocytosis in mice</title><p>To mimic 6000 m HA exposure, we placed C58BL/6 mice in an animal hypobaric oxygen chamber and detected the blood indices in the blood of the mice after HH exposure for different times. The blood smear showed that the number of RBCs was increased from 3 to 14 days after HH exposure compared with the NN group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Routine blood tests further confirmed the results in blood smears, which showed that the RBC number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), HGB content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and HCT value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) were all increased significantly to varying degrees, while MCH was not changed after HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We further performed flow cytometry using TO staining to detect reticulocytes after 3, 7, and 14 days of HH treatment. The results showed that the proportion of reticulocytes increased after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-G</xref>), and the number of RBCs reached the peak after 7 days of HH exposure. These results suggested that the HH-treated mouse model effectively mimics HA exposure, which promotes erythropoiesis and results in erythrocytosis in mice following HH exposure.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HH exposure promotes the induction of erythrocytosis in mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either normobaric normoxia (NN) or hypobaric hypoxia (HH) conditions for durations of 3, 7, and 14 days.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the spleen volume and weight were decreased significantly after HH exposure for 1 day compared to NN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). However, the spleen was obviously enlarged from 2 to 14 days after HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). The results indicated that the spleen contracted, the stored RBCs in the spleen were released into the blood at 1 day, and the RBCs were produced and/or retained in the spleen from 2 to 14 days after HH exposure. In our research, we also examined the influence of the spleen on RBCs homeostasis under HH conditions. We investigated whether the role of spleen in RBCs clearance under HH conditions could be compensated by the liver or other components of the mononuclear macrophage system. To conduct this, we performed splenectomies on mice and subsequently exposed them to HH conditions for 14 days. This allowed us to monitor RBCs counts and blood deposition. Our findings indicated that, in comparison to both the splenectomized mice under NN conditions and the sham-operated mice exposed to HH, erythrocyte deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as well as HGB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and HCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) levels, significantly increased 14 days post-splenectomy under HH conditions. Meanwhile, MCH levels remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These indices did not vary in mice, regardless of whether they had undergone a splenectomy, under NN conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These results indicate that in the splenectomized group under NN conditions, erythrophagocytosis is substantially compensated for by functional macrophages in other tissues. However, under HH conditions, our data also suggest that the spleen plays an important role in managing erythrocyte turnover, as indicated by the significant impact of splenectomy on erythrophagocytosis and subsequent RBCs dynamics.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The spleen plays an important role in suppressing the immoderate increase in RBCs under HH conditions.</title><p>C57BL/6 mice with or without splenectomy were treated with NN and HH for varying durations, and the spleen and blood were collected for subsequent analyses.

Calcein/PI double staining, examined via flow cytometry, revealed a significant decrease in viable splenic cells and a concomitant increase in dead cells following 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). This observation was further substantiated by single-cell sequencing, which elucidated a pronounced reduction in the population of splenic macrophages after 7 days of HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Additionally, flow cytometry results indicated a marked decrease in the population of RPMs, identified as F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup>, in the spleen post 7 days of HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Complementary to these findings, immunofluorescence detection demonstrated a significant diminution in RPMs, characterized by F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup> and F4/80<sup>hi</sup>CD68<sup>hi</sup> cell populations, after both 7 and 14 days of HH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, our single-cell sequencing analysis of the spleen under NN conditions revealed a predominant association of RPMs with Cluster 0. Intriguingly, HH exposure led to a notable reduction in the abundance of RPMs within this cluster. Pseudo-time series analysis provided insights into the transitional dynamics of spleen RPMs, indicating a shift from Cluster 2 and Cluster 1 towards Cluster 0 under NN conditions. However, this pattern was altered under HH exposure, where a shift from Cluster 0 and Cluster 1 towards Cluster 2 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>HH exposure results in a decrease in the number of splenic macrophages.</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were treated with NN and HH for 7 or 14 days, and the spleen and blood were collected for subsequent analysis.

HE staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>) and Band 3 immunostaining in situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D and G–H</xref>) revealed a significant increase in RBCs numbers in the spleen following 7 and 14 days of HH exposure.

The results consistently indicated a substantial elevation in RBC counts within the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).

Initially, RBCs were labelled with PKH67 cell linker and then injected into mice. Subsequently, Tuftsin was administered to stimulate the phagocytic activity of macrophages. After 1 hr, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, or 7 days of NN exposure, PKH67 fluorescence was analyzed via flow cytometry. The findings demonstrated a gradual reduction in PKH67 fluorescence over the course of NN exposure; however, a significant decrease in PKH67 fluorescence was noted in the spleen following Tuftsin administration compared to the NN group. This observation suggested that RBC lifespan is diminished following enhanced erythrophagocytosis (as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Further investigation was conducted on the ability of the spleen to regulate heme iron recycling under HH conditions through immunofluorescence and iron staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

These findings collectively suggest that the splenic capacity for erythrocyte phagocytosis and subsequent heme iron recycling is significantly compromised under HH conditions, primarily due to a reduction in RPMs. This reduced erythrophagocytic capacity of the spleen under HH exposure is a critical factor contributing to the decreased efficiency of iron processing and increased RBCs retention in this organ.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Impaired erythrophagocytosis of RBCs after HH exposure leads to a decrease in iron processing capacity in the spleen.</title><p>To stimulate phagocytosis of macrophages, Tuftsin was administered immediately following the injection of PKH67-labeled RBCs into mice.

Here, we used an HH chamber to simulate 6000 m HA exposure and found that HH exposure induced iron mobilization and activated ferroptosis in the spleen, especially in RPMs, which subsequently inhibited the phagocytosis and clearance of RBCs. Finally, chronic exposure to HA/HH may promote the retention of RBCs in the spleen, cause splenomegaly, advance RBC production, and promote the occurrence and development of HAPC.</p><p>RBCs/erythrocytes are the carriers of oxygen and the most abundant cell type in the body. Erythrocytes are rapidly increased by triggering splenic contraction in acute HA/HH exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schagatay et al., 2020</xref>) and stimulating erythropoiesis in subsequent continuous or chronic HA/HH exposure. Changes in spleen morphology and size are closely related to the spleen’s ability to recover RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khairullah and Jackson, 2021</xref>), and studies have shown that the spleen is in a contraction state after short-term exposure to HA/HH, and approximately 40% of the increase in RBCs is due to the contraction of the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alafi and Cook, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schagatay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, mice were treated under HH to mimic HA exposure (mainly mimicking the low oxygen partial pressure environment of 6000 m HA) for different times according to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brent et al., 2022</xref>). Our results showed that HH exposure significantly increased the number of RBCs and HGB contents. However, short-term (1 day) HH exposure caused spleen contraction and induced splenomegaly after 3 days of HH treatment. This contraction can trigger an immediate release of RBCs into the bloodstream in instances of substantial blood loss or significant reduction of RBCs. Moreover, elevated oxygen consumption rates in certain animal species can be partially attributed to splenic contractions, which augment haematocrit levels and the overall volume of circulating blood, thereby enhancing venous return and oxygen delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dane et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Longhurst et al., 1986</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the body, under such conditions, is incapable of generating sufficient RBCs promptly enough to facilitate enhanced oxygen delivery. Consequently, the spleen reacts by releasing its stored RBCs through splenic constriction, leading to a measurable reduction in spleen size. These results are consistent with other research results; that is, HH or HA exposure affects spleen morphology and further affects RBCs counts and HGB levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmström et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmström et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pernett et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>HAPC is a common chronic HA disease characterized by excessive proliferation of RBCs caused by HH conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Under physiological conditions, RBC homeostasis is maintained by balancing erythropoiesis and erythrocyte clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dzierzak and Philipsen, 2013</xref>). The ability of RBC disposal in the spleen for iron recycling under HA/HH exposure was important to RBC regeneration in BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pivkin et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in the spleen were altered by HA/HH exposure and further disturbed RBC homeostasis and affected the progression of HAPC. We found that compared with sham group mice, HH significantly increased the contents of RBCs and HGB in the blood of splenectomy mice. This strongly verified that the spleen is a key organism that maintains RBC magnitude within a certain range of physiological statuses under HA/HH conditions.</p><p>As originally proposed by Metchnikoff in the 19th century, macrophages, especially RPMs, play a pivotal role in the regulation of RBCs and iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wynn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gammella et al., 2014</xref>). We detected the macrophage population in the spleen and found that HH exposure for 7 and 14 days reduced the total macrophages in the spleen. We next observed whether the migration and differentiation of monocytes from the BM to the spleen supplemented the reduced macrophages after HH treatment and maintained their homeostasis. It is well known that splenic erythrophagocytosis is a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dzierzak and Philipsen, 2013</xref>). Upon phagocytosing erythrocytes in macrophages, spleen tissue (including macrophages and fibroblasts) produces the chemokine C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 and 7 (CCL2 and CCL7) to recruit blood monocytes to the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellomo et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, the expression of <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl7</italic>, and <italic>Csf1</italic> in the spleen decreased after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure. Furthermore, we found that HH exposure inhibited Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocyte migration from the BM to spleen, where these cells subsequently differentiated into RPMs. The combination of decreased splenic RPMs, along with the reduced BM-derived Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, suggests that the homeostasis of the RPMs population in circulating monocytes was also inhibited after the depletion of RPMs induced by HH exposure. The observed decrease in monocytes within the BM is likely attributable to the fact that monocytes and precursor cells for RBCs both originate from the same hematopoietic stem cells within the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bapat et al., 2021</xref>). As such, the differentiation to monocyte is reduced under hypoxic conditions, which may subsequently cause a decrease in migration to spleen.</p><p>HO-1 is a pivotal antioxidant and cytoprotective enzyme, instrumental in catalyzing the degradation of heme, thereby maintaining heme homeostasis and mitigating free heme-induced toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vijayan et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, it has been posited that mice deficient in HO-1 exhibit a significant depletion of RPMs, emphasizing the important role of this enzyme in the development and maintenance of RPM after RBCs clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kovtunovych et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, the observed decrease in HO-1 protein levels in the red pulp suggests a potential reduction in the number of macrophages induced by HH exposure. This inference is made despite the general understanding that HO-1 expression is typically upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawn and Bolli, 2005</xref>). Along with the decrease in the number of macrophages caused by HH, we also noticed that the phagocytic ability of macrophages in the spleen is inhibited, as evidenced both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the administration of tufftsin markedly enhanced heme iron processing in the spleen under HH conditions. However, our findings appear to diverge from those reported by Anand et al., which suggested an increase in macrophage phagocytosis under hypoxic conditions, mediated by HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2007</xref>). This discrepancy may stem from the differing methodologies employed; whereas Anand et al. utilized intermittent hypoxia in their research, our study was characterized by consistent hypoxia. However, it should be acknowledged that using HO-1 expression as an alternative marker to quantify macrophage numbers is not without limitations. Variations in HO-1 expression per cell can yield misleading results, and the localization of this effect to the red pulp does not definitively equate to a conclusion applicable to macrophages, given the inherent heterogeneity of this region and the spleen overall. Considering the multifaceted nature of spleen function and cellular dynamics under hypoxic stress, this complexity requires careful interpretation of our data.</p><p>Macrophages play a crucial role in maintaining erythrocyte homeostasis, partially due to their function in digesting the HGB content of cleared RBCs and recycling the iron back to erythroid progenitors for heme synthesis and HGB production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korolnek and Hamza, 2015</xref>). In mammals, most of the bodily iron exists in the form of heme, with the most substantial pool comprising HGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamza and Dailey, 2012</xref>). HGB contains four prosthetic hemoglobins, and each mature RBC is thought to contain approximately 1.2×10<sup>9</sup> heme moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korolnek and Hamza, 2015</xref>). As previously mentioned, most of the iron required to sustain erythropoiesis is derived from recycled RBCs. In general, RPMs are equipped with molecular machinery capable of neutralizing the toxic effects of heme and metabolizing iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soares and Hamza, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganz, 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, any disruptions in the process of erythrophagocytosis, the uptake and degradation of erythrocytes by macrophages, could potentially result in abnormal iron metabolism, potentially manifesting as conditions such as anemia or iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soares and Hamza, 2016</xref>). The release of heme upon processed RBCs constitutes a permanent and considerable threat for iron cytotoxicity in macrophages and may eventually result in a specific form of programmed cell death termed ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>), which may cause decreased cell counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, we investigated the iron metabolism status and explored ferroptosis in spleen/macrophages after HH/hypoxia treatment and found that HH exposure prompted iron mobilization, especially in ferritinophagy and lipid peroxidation in the spleen. Interestingly, we found that all gene expression changes in PBMCs after acute HA exposure in humans, except for NCOA4, were similar to those in the spleen of mice exposed to HH for 7 and 14 days. This is probably because NCOA4 in the spleen mediates iron release from Ft-L and facilitates iron reuse, while PBMCs do not possess this function in vivo. These results not only indicated that HH exposure induces spleen ferroptosis but also implied that the gene expression changes in PBMCs under HA/HH may reflect RBC processing functions in the spleen and further indicate the iron metabolism status in the clinic. We further found that the exact mechanism of macrophage ferroptosis induced by HH exposure was caused by increased Fe<sup>2+</sup> and decreased antioxidative system expression, which finally resulted in lipid peroxidation of macrophages. It has been proposed that heme catabolism by HO-1 protects macrophages from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soares and Hamza, 2016</xref>). The enhanced ROS and lipid peroxidation in vivo were also consistent with the decreased HO-1 expression in the spleen. In addition, 1% hypoxia treatment induced ferroptosis in vitro, which was reduced by treatment with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. However, our data were inconsistent with the study of Fuhrmann et al., which reported that hypoxia inhibits ferritinophagy and protects against ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuhrmann et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that the enhanced iron demand for new RBCs regeneration in BM caused by HH leads to a decrease in the expression of NCOA4 and Ft-L proteins in the spleen. On the other hand, hypoxia inhibited anti-ferroptosis system expression, including reduced Gpx4 expression and increased lipid ROS production. The results were supported by the group of Youssef LA et al, who reported that increased erythrophagocytosis induces ferroptosis in RPMs in a mouse model of transfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Youssef et al., 2018</xref>). However, as most studies have reported, ferroptosis is not only characterized by increased lipid ROS but also significantly shrinking mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). We never found shrinking mitochondria in RPMs after HH exposure (data not shown). Gao et al. proposed that mitochondria played a crucial role in cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis but not in that induced by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), the most downstream component of the ferroptosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, in our in vivo study, Gpx4 expression was also not changed after HH exposure. It is still not clear whether mitochondria are involved in ferroptosis. Whether HH treatment caused mitochondrial swelling directly and the exact mechanism involved in this process still need to be further investigated.</p><p>It is also possible that the spleen may adapt to the increased load of RBCs by expanding the red pulp, leading to splenomegaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The red pulp is highly vascular and contains numerous sinuses lined with macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mebius and Kraal, 2005</xref>). This expansion could potentially accommodate a greater number of RBCs, thus enhancing the splenic capacity for erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling. However, these compensatory mechanisms may be insufficient or become overwhelmed over time, leading to pathological conditions such as HAPC. Further research is necessary to fully understand the consequences of splenic ferroptosis on RBC homeostasis and how these effects could be mitigated or reversed. Finally, as these observations are based on experimental models, they should be corroborated in human studies to assess their clinical relevance and potential implications for managing conditions related to high altitude exposure. The potential for therapeutic interventions that target ferroptosis, erythrophagocytosis, and iron recycling should also be explored, as these could provide new avenues for treating HAPC and other conditions related to HA exposure.</p><p>Based on the above experiments, we propose the ‘spleen theory’ of HAPC as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. It hypothesizes that HH exposure precipitates ferroptosis within the spleen, particularly affecting RPMs. This process, in turn, impedes erythrophagocytosis, RBCs clearance, HGB processing, and iron recycling. Consequently, this leads to an accumulation of RBCs within the spleen, exacerbating splenomegaly and perpetuating the production of RBCs under HH conditions. The ‘spleen theory’ of HAPC provides a novel perspective on the physiological responses to hypoxia and highlights the role of the spleen as a vital organ in managing erythrocyte homeostasis under high altitude/hypoxic conditions. These findings may be clinically relevant to the pathological conditions of HAPC progression.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>HA/HH exposure suppresses erythrophagocytosis by inducing macrophages ferroptosis in the spleen.</title><p>This figure summarizes the multifaceted impact of HA and HH exposure on splenic macrophage function. HA/HH exposure is demonstrated to trigger significant iron mobilization, notably increasing Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, which are further elevated in the spleen and macrophages of mice. Concurrently, HA/HH exposure is associated with an upregulation of ACSL4 expression, coupled with a suppression of xCT expression and GSH production. This alteration results in enhanced lipid peroxidation, culminating in the escalation of macrophage ferroptosis. Additionally, the exposure adversely affects monocyte migration and differentiation from BM to the spleen. Collectively, these effects of HA/HH exposure contribute to a notable inhibition of erythrophagocytosis, thereby promoting erythrocytosis and potentially exacerbating the progression of HAPC. This comprehensive analysis underscores the intricate interplay between environmental factors and cellular mechanisms in the spleen, which could significantly influence the pathogenesis of HAPC.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87496-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>HH mouse exposure model</title><p>Male C57BL/6 male mice (at 8 weeks of age) were obtained from the animal experimental centre of Nantong University.

These measurements were then normalized to the NN group to account for any experimental variations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Tissue iron staining (DAB-enhanced Perls' staining)</title><p>DAB-enhanced Perls’ staining for the spleen paraffin sections was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, the sections were washed with PBS and cultured in freshly prepared Perls’ solution (1% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid buffer). The slides were then immersed and stained with DAB. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and visualized under a DM4000B microscope (Leica, Germany). Data were collected from three fields of view per mouse and semiquantitatively analysed with ImageJ software. Quantitative results of iron staining were finally normalized to the NN control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Flow cytometry</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The steps of reticulocyte ratio detection were as follows: Whole blood was extracted from the mice and collected into an anticoagulant tube, which was then set aside for subsequent thiazole orange (TO) staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nébor et al., 2018</xref>). The experimental tube and negative control tube were prepared, 125 μL normal saline, 4 μL anticoagulant and 125 μL TO working solution (1 μg/mL, Sigma, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.cn/CN/zh/product/sial/390062">390062</ext-link>, USA) were added to each tube, and 250 μL normal saline and 4 μL anticoagulant were added to each tube of the negative control tube.

The RBCs within the entire sample were subsequently lysed and eliminated, and the remaining cell suspension was resuspended in PBS in preparation for ensuing analyses. A total of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were incubated with 100 μL of BioTracker Far-red Labile Fe<sup>2+</sup> Dye (1 mM, Sigma, SCT037, USA) for 1 h or C11-BODIPY 581/591 (10 μM, Thermo Fisher, D3861, USA) for 30 min. After the cells were washed with PBS twice, flow cytometry analysis was carried out by using the FL6 (638 nm/660 nm) channel for determination of intracellular divalent iron content or the FL1 (488 nm/525 nm) channel for determination of lipid peroxidation level.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The steps for detecting the mortality of spleen cells and macrophages were as follows: 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were incubated at room temperature for 40 min with 2 μM Calcein AM and 8 μM Propidium Iodide (PI).

Flow cytometry analysis was carried out by using FL2 (488 nm/575 nm, F4/80- PE), FL5 (488 nm/755 nm, CD11b-PE/CY7) and FL6 (638 nm/660 nm, Ly6C-APC) channels.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The steps employed for assessing erythrophagocytosis in the spleen was scrupulously performed as follows: Initially, RBCs were harvested from mice and subjected to in vitro labelling with PKH67 cell linker. Subsequently, these PKH67-labeled RBCs were administered into mice, followed by exposure to either NN or HH. After a duration of 7 or 14 days of exposure, splenic single-cell suspensions were carefully prepared. From these suspensions, a quantity of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells was isolated and washed in PBS for a period of 5 min. The analytical phase involved flow cytometry, utilizing the FL1 channel (490 nm excitation/502 nm emission) specifically used for detecting PKH67. This approach facilitated the precise quantification and analysis of erythrophagocytosis within the spleen under the specified experimental conditions.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic> and RBCs</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> was labelled with Cy5.5 (5 mg/mL), and RBCs were labelled with NHS-biotin (20 mg/mL).

Single-cell dissociation was performed by the experimentalists at the GENECHEM laboratory (Shanghai, China). Dissociated single cells were then stained for viability assessment using Calcein-AM (BD Biosciences, USA) and Draq7 (BD Biosciences). The BD Rhapsody system was used to capture transcriptomic information from single cells. Single-cell capture was achieved by random distribution of a single-cell suspension across &gt;200,000 microwells through a limited dilution approach. Beads with oligonucleotide barcodes were added to saturation so that a bead was paired with a cell in a microwell. The cells were lysed in the microwell to hybridize mRNA molecules to barcoded capture oligos on the beads. Beads were collected into a single tube for reverse transcription and ExoI digestion. Upon cDNA synthesis, each cDNA molecule was tagged on the 5′ end (that is, the 3′ end of an mRNA transcript) with a unique molecular identifier (UMI) and cell barcode indicating its cell of origin. Whole transcriptome libraries were prepared using the BD Rhapsody single-cell whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA) workflow, including random priming and extension (RPE), RPE amplification PCR and WTA index PCR. The libraries were quantified using a High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent) and High Sensitivity D1000 Reagents (Agilent) on a 4150 TapeStation System (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina sequencer (Illumina Nova Seq 6000, San Diego, CA) in a 150 bp paired-end run.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. All values were represented as the mean ± standard error (SEM). The homogeneity of variance was verified before the application of a parametric test. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was employed for data from two groups, while a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple comparisons using Tukey’s post hoc test was utilized for data from multiple groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Investigation, Data curation, Project administration, Supervision, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Formal analysis, Visualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal care and experimental protocols were carried out according to the Chinese Animal Management Rules of the Ministry of Health and were authorized by the Animal Ethics Committees of Nantong University research program protocol #S20190219-011.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87496-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The scRNA-seq data underpinning the discoveries of this study are archived in the GEO database under the accession code GSE263133.

Via interpretation of their data, the authors proposed a model that hypoxia causes an increase in cellular iron levels, possibly in RPMs, leading to ferroptosis, and downregulates their erythrophagocytic capacity.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The manuscript has now improved with all the new data, supporting the model proposed by the authors. However, it remains not very easy to follow for the conclusions and experimental details. Some of the most important remaining comments are listed below:</p><p>(1) Lines 401-406 - The conclusions in this new fragment sound a bit overstated - the authors do not directly measure erytrophagocytosis capacity, only the total RBC parameters in the circulation. The increase is also very mild biologically between sham and splenectomized mice in HH conditions.</p><p>(2) scRNA seq data are still presented in a way that is very difficult to understand. The readers could not see from the graphics that macrophages are depleted. The clusters are not labelled - some clusters in the bin 'macrophahes+DC' seem actually to be more represented in Fig. 3E; Fig. 3F does not correspond to Fig. 3D. It would be maybe more informative to present like in Figure D side by side NN versus HH? The authors could consider moving the data from supplements that relate to RPMs to the main figure and making it consistent for the Clusters - eg, the authors show data for Cluster 0 in the supplement, and the same Cluster is not marked as macrophages in the main figure. This is quite difficult to follow.</p><p>(3) Figure 3G has likely mislabeled axis for F4/80 and CD11b - such mistakes should be avoided in a second revised version of the manuscript, and this data is now redundant with the data shown as new Figure 5A.</p><p>(4) The data from new Figure 4 should be better mentioned in the main body of the manuscript - all panels are mentioned twice in the text, first speaking about the decline of labelled RBCs and second referring to phagocytic capacity, whereas this figure only illustrates the decline of labelled RBCs, not directly phagocytic capacity of RPMs. What is lacking, as opposed to typical RBC life span assay, is the time '0' ('starting point') - this is particularly important as we can observe a big drop in labelled RBCs for eg 7 days between NN and HH group, actually implying increased removal of labelled RBCs within the first days of hypoxia exposure. What should be better labelled in this figure is that the proportion of RBCs are labelled RBCs not all RBCs (Y axis in individual panels). Overall, the new Figure 4 brings new data to the study, but how it is presented and discussed is not at the 'state-of-the-art' level (eg, missing the time '0') and is not very straightforward to the reader.</p><p>(5) In Figure 7, the experiments with Tuftsin are not very easy to follow, especially for the major conclusions. In panels A and B, the focus is the drug itself under NN conditions, with RBC removal as a readout. Then, in the next panels, the authors introduce HH, and then look at the F4/80 and iron staining. What was exactly the major point the authors wanted to make here?</p><p>(6) The data from Figure 8 are informative but do not address the individual cell types - eg, a drop in HO1 or FT may be due to the depletion of RPMs. An increase of TFR1 could be due to the retention of RBCs, the same as maybe labile iron.

We have utilized a combination of techniques, including flow cytometry and histological staining, to investigate this aspect comprehensively. Below is a summary of our findings and methodology.</p><p>(1) Flow cytometry analysis of labeled RBCs:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Our study employed both NHS-biotin (new Figure 4, A-D) and PKH67 labeling (new Figure 4, E-H) to track RBCs in mice exposed to HH. Flow cytometry results from these experiments (new Figure 4, A-H) showed a decrease in the proportion of labeled RBCs over time, both in the blood and spleen. Notably, there was a significantly greater reduction in the amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs after NN exposure compared to the reduced amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs observed in blood and spleen under HH exposure. The observed decrease in labeled RBCs was initially counterintuitive, as we expected an increase in RBC retention due to reduced erythrophagocytosis. However, this decrease can be attributed to the significantly increased production of RBCs following HH exposure, diluting the proportion of labeled cells.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Specifically, for blood, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 12.06% under NN exposure and by 7.82% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 9.70% under NN exposure and by 4.09% under HH exposure. For spleen, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 3.13% under NN exposure and by 0.46% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 1.16% under NN exposure and by 0.92% under HH exposure. These findings suggest that HH exposure leads to a decrease in the clearance rate of RBCs.</p></list-item></list><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(2) Detection of erythrophagocytosis in spleen:</p><p>To assess erythrophagocytosis directly, we labeled RBCs with PKH67 and analyzed their uptake by splenic macrophages (F4/80hi) after HH exposure. Our findings (new Figure 5, D-E) indicated a decrease in PKH67-positive macrophages in the spleen, suggesting reduced erythrophagocytosis.</p><fig id="sa3fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(3) Flow cytometry analysis of RBC retention:</p><p>Our flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in PKH67-positive RBCs in both blood and spleen (Figure S4). We postulated that this was due to increased RBC production after HH exposure. However, this method might not accurately reflect RBC retention, as it measures the proportion of PKH67-labeled RBCs relative to the total number of RBCs, which increased after HH exposure.</p><fig id="sa3fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 9.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(4) Histological and immunostaining analysis:</p><p>Histological examination using HE staining and band3 immunostaining in situ (new Figure 6, A-D, and G-H) revealed a significant increase in RBC numbers in the spleen after HH exposure. This was further confirmed by detecting retained RBCs in splenic single cells using Wright-Giemsa composite stain (new Figure 6, E and F) and retained PKH67-labelled RBCs in spleen (new Figure 6, I and J).</p><fig id="sa3fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 10.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(5) Interpreting the data:</p><p>The comprehensive analysis suggests a complex interplay between increased RBC production and decreased erythrophagocytosis in the spleen following HH exposure. While flow cytometry indicated a decrease in the proportion of labeled RBCs, histological and immunostaining analyses demonstrated an actual increase in RBCs retention in the spleen. These findings collectively suggest that while the overall RBCs production is upregulated following HH exposure, the spleen's capacity for erythrophagocytosis is concurrently diminished, leading to increased RBCs retention.</p><p>(6) Conclusion:</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate a significant increase in RBCs retention in the spleen post-HH exposure, likely due to reduced residual RPMs and erythrophagocytosis. This conclusion is supported by a combination of flow cytometry, histological staining, and immunostaining techniques, providing a comprehensive view of RBC dynamics under HH conditions.

This observation was substantiated through flow cytometry analysis (as depicted in Figure S4), which affirmed an enhanced migration of monocytes to the liver.

We acknowledge the significance of precisely defining such key terminologies, particularly when they play a crucial role in the context of our research findings.Eryptosis, a term referenced in our study, is a specialized form of programmed cell death unique to erythrocytes.

The production of RBCs, including bone marrow and spleen production, was significantly increased following HH exposure, resulting in a consistent decrease in the proportion of labeled RBCs via flow cytometry detection both in the blood and spleen of mice compared to the NN group. However, compared to the reduced amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs observed in blood and spleen under NN exposure, there was a significantly weaker reduction in the amplitude of fluorescently labeled RBCs after HH exposure. Specifically, for blood, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 12.06% under NN exposure and by 7.82% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 9.70% under NN exposure and by 4.09% under HH exposure. For spleen, the biotin-labeled RBCs decreased by 3.13% under NN exposure and by 0.46% under HH exposure, while the PKH67-labeled RBCs decreased by 1.16% under NN exposure and by 0.92% under HH exposure.</p><fig id="sa3fig14" position="float"><label>Author response image 14.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87496-sa3-fig14-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(2) Increased RBCs production under HH conditions:</p><p>It's important to note that RBCs production, including from bone marrow and spleen, was significantly increased following HH exposure. This increase in RBCs production could contribute to the decreased proportion of labeled RBCs observed in flow cytometry analyses, as there are more unlabeled RBCs diluting the proportion of labeled cells in the blood and spleen.</p><p>(3) Analysis of erythrophagocytosis in RPMs:</p><p>Our analysis of PKH67-labeled RBCs content within RPMs following HH exposure showed a significant reduction in the number of PKH67-positive RPMs in the spleen (new Figure 5).

This increased production could mask the actual erythrophagocytosis activity in terms of the proportion of labeled cells. Therefore, while the proportion of labeled RBCs decreases more significantly under HH conditions, this does not necessarily indicate an enhanced erythrophagocytosis rate, but rather an increased dilution effect due to higher RBCs turnover.</p><p>(5) Revised interpretation and manuscript changes:</p><p>Given these factors, we update our manuscript to reflect this detailed interpretation and clarify the implications of the increased RBCs production under HH conditions on our observations of labeled RBCs clearance and erythrophagocytosis.

This uninterrupted exposure was crucial for maintaining consistent hypobaric conditions throughout the experiment. The hypobaric chamber was configured to ensure a ventilation rate of 25 air exchanges per minute. This high ventilation rate was effective in regulating the concentration of CO2 inside the chamber, thereby maintaining a stable environment for the mice.</p><p>(2) The splenectomy was performed as follows:</p><p>After anesthesia, the mice were placed in a supine position, and their limbs were fixed. The abdominal operation area was skinned, disinfected, and covered with a sterile towel. A median incision was made in the upper abdomen, followed by laparotomy to locate the spleen. The spleen was then carefully pulled out through the incision. The arterial and venous directions in the splenic pedicle were examined, and two vascular forceps were used to clamp all the tissue in the main cadre of blood vessels below the splenic portal. The splenic pedicle was cut between the forceps to remove the spleen. The end of the proximal hepatic artery was clamped with a vascular clamp, and double or through ligation was performed to secure the site. The abdominal cavity was then cleaned to ensure there was no bleeding at the ligation site, and the incision was closed. Post-operatively, the animals were housed individually. Generally, they were able to feed themselves after recovering from anesthesia and did not require special care.</p><p>We hope this detailed description addresses your queries and provides a clear understanding of the experimental conditions and procedures used in our study.

This finding underscores the spleen's critical role in modulating RBCs dynamics under HH. It also indirectly suggests that the diminished phagocytic capacity of the spleen following HH exposure contributes to an augmented RBCs count, albeit to a lesser extent than in the splenectomy group.
