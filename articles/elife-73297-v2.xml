Bacteriocin proteins evolved to exploit the accessible, surface-exposed proteins embedded in the outer membrane to deliver cytotoxic cargo. Colicin E1 is a bacteriocin produced by, and lethal to, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that hijacks the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) TolC and BtuB to enter the cell. Here, we capture the colicin E1 translocation domain inside its membrane receptor, TolC, by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to obtain the first reported structure of a bacteriocin bound to TolC. Colicin E1 binds stably to TolC as an open hinge through the TolC pore—an architectural rearrangement from colicin E1’s unbound conformation. This binding is stable in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells as indicated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Finally, colicin E1 fragments binding to TolC plug the channel, inhibiting its native efflux function as an antibiotic efflux pump, and heightening susceptibility to three antibiotic classes. In addition to demonstrating that these protein fragments are useful starting points for developing novel antibiotic potentiators, this method could be expanded to other colicins to inhibit other OMP functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria are constantly warring with each other for space and resources.

Of these protective structures, the outer membrane forms a particularly formidable obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Rietschel, 2001</xref>), owing to the impermeability of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer that constitutes the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kamio and Nikaido, 1976</xref>). The primary means by which external molecules can gain access to the cell is through the ~100 variations of barrel-shaped proteins that are embedded in each bacterium outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Freeman and Wimley, 2012</xref>) and whose diverse functions include the transport of molecules across the membrane—specifically, the import of nutrients and metabolites and the export of toxins and waste.</p><p>Because outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are accessible from outside the cell, bacteriophage and bacterial toxins have evolved to exploit OMPs to initiate delivering cargo across the outer membrane. Bacteriocins hijack the OMPs of a target bacterium to cross its impermeable outer membrane and kill the bacterium. Colicins are <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-specific bacteriocins, protein toxin systems through which bacteria engage in bacterial warfare with other, similar bacteria. Colicins can be divided into groups A and B based on the requirement for which periplasmic protein systems they rely on to enter cells. The cytotoxicity of group A colicins requires the Tol system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagel de Zwaig and Luria, 1967</xref>) which is coupled to the proton motive force for its role in maintaining membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lazzaroni et al., 1989</xref>). Colicins differ in their receptor targets and killing mechanisms. Most colicins share a common tri-domain architecture, comprising the following components: (i) an N-terminal translocation (T) domain, (ii) a receptor-binding (R) domain, and (iii) a C-terminal cytotoxic (C) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Much of what is known of group A colicin import has been determined through studies of the colicins E3 and E9 as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2018</xref>. For colicins E3 and E9, import is initialized by high-affinity R domain binding to the vitamin B12 transporter, BtuB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kurisu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Housden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francis et al., 2021</xref>); this binding localizes the colicin onto the outer membrane. Once the colicin is tethered to the outer membrane surface, the T domain of ColE3 and ColE9 initiates translocation using the secondary OMP receptor/translocator OmpF to access the Tol-Pal system in the periplasm. For most colicins, the T domain requires an OMP distinct from the R domain target for colicin translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cascales et al., 2007</xref>). A handful of colicins have been structurally characterized with their OMP counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kurisu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buchanan et al., 2007</xref>). Colicin E9 bound to both BtuB and OmpF was structurally resolved as a complete translocon complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francis et al., 2021</xref>). The structure of the full ColE9 translocon showed that the T domain can fully penetrate deeply into lumen of the outer membrane receptors while the R domain interacts with the extracellular loop regions of its receptors. Studies of the bacteriocin pyocin S5 from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> suggest that bacteriocin architectures and mechanisms may be conserved across all Gram-negative species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Colicin E1-T binds within the lumen of TolC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Architecture of full-length colicin E1 showing domains and their known binding partners.

Unlike any of the other E colicins, the T domain of Colicin E1 binds to TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benedetti et al., 1991</xref>), the outer membrane component of the acridine efflux pump, and the R domain binds BtuB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benedetti et al., 1989</xref>), the primary receptor shared by all E colicins. A high-resolution X-ray structure exists of only the cytotoxic domain of colicin E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elkins et al., 1997</xref>) but not the T or R domains, thus no mechanistic insights can be gained about initial steps of import. Domain swapping experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benedetti et al., 1991</xref>) between colicin A and E1 identified regions of the protein that interact with specific OMPs. Early studies of pore-forming colicins, including E1, showed that cytotoxic-domain-induced K<sup>+</sup> efflux on the inner membrane can be reversed after it has begun by subsequent addition of trypsin to cells. This, in addition to trypsin’s inability to cross the outer membrane, led to the belief that portions of colicin remain tethered to their OMP partners as the cytotoxic domain depolarizes the cytoplasmic membrane.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plate and Luria, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dankert et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dankert et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bénédetti et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the early stages of colicin E1 import, functional studies of truncations of colicin E1 which lack the cytotoxic domain have been characterized in vitro. Residues 100–120 of colicin E1 (termed the ‘TolC box,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) have been shown to be necessary but not sufficient for binding TolC. Peptides that include the TolC box co-elute with TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>) and disrupt channel conductance in planar lipid bilayer membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zakharov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, <italic>E. coli</italic> exposure to TolC-box-containing peptides can prevent subsequent binding and cytotoxicity of full-length colicin E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jakes, 2017</xref>).

This measurement led to the proposal, known as the ‘pillar model,’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>) that the T domain inserts into the TolC barrel as a helical hairpin where the N and C-termini are pointing to the cell exterior. According to this model, the hairpin stuck in TolC acts as a buttress to facilitate the C terminal-first cytotoxic domain entry directly through the membrane where it is possibly cleaved from the TR domain to reach its inner membrane target similar to ColE7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi et al., 2005</xref>) and ColD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Zamaroczy et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>A competing model for colicin E1 import, known as the ‘total thread’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Housden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francis et al., 2021</xref>) posits that the protein unfolds and passes through TolC N-terminus-first as an unstructured peptide and binds to TolA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pilsl and Braun, 1995</xref>) in the periplasm.

We find that colicin E1 binds stably to TolC, not as a helical hairpin but as a single-pass folded helix with the N-terminus inside the periplasm. Additionally, we find that the ColE1 TR domain binds TolC in vivo as well. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we find that ColE1-TR, lacking the cytotoxic domain, remains stalled on the outer membrane and does not fully translocate into cells. Lastly, we leverage this stalling of ColE1 to block the native TolC function as an antibiotic efflux pump. Because they are accessible from outside the cell, OMPs are attractive targets for the development of novel antibiotics, and research has begun to reveal the therapeutic potential of interfering with OMP structure and function. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here by determining the structure and mechanism of ColE1 insertion, we establish an alternative approach for targeting OMPs—the development of molecular plugs that block OMP pores. Such plugs would allow for the manipulation of bacterial transport, providing a means of either starving the bacterium by preventing the import of valuable nutrients or poisoning the bacterium by preventing the export of toxins. Through real-time efflux assays and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) experiments, we find that ColE1-TR and ColE1-T are able to inhibit TolC-mediated efflux. We find that this plugging of TolC reduces the amount of antibiotics required to inhibit the bacterial growth—indicating that this colicin E1 fragment reduces the antibiotic resistance conferred by TolC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CryoEM structure of TolC embedded in nanodiscs</title><p>To determine the structural details of colicin E1 binding to TolC, we solved the cryoEM structure of TolC embedded in nanodiscs with and without added ColE1-T (PDB 6WXH and 6WXI, respectively). We recently reported a high-yield TolC preparation by refolding from inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Budiardjo et al., 2021</xref>) and inserted refolded TolC into nanodiscs.

There was local variation in resolution within the model with lower resolution associated with the extracellular/periplasmic ends and the nanodisc scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The lower residue resolution at these apertures may indicate dynamics not captured in the X-ray crystal structures.</p><p>We next determined the binding of colicin E1-T domain to capture the complex for structure determination. Residues 1–190 (ColE1-T) which span the translocation domain are known to bind to TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We identified ColE1-T:TolC binding in vitro via co-elution by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>). When ColE1-T and TolC were mixed, we observed a leftward shift in the TolC peak and a decrease in intensity associated with the ColE1-T peak indicating that a subset of the population had migrated with TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We analyzed the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> arrow) using SDS-PAGE and found the presence of both ColE1-T and TolC. The unimodal shifted peak observed with ColE1-T:TolC indicates that there is a single species of fully bound TolC. When resolved by cryoEM, addition of ColE1-T to TolC breaks the threefold channel symmetry and the additional protein is observed running all the way through the TolC barrel as a single-pass, all-α-helical chain spanning more than 130 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In a Δ<italic>tolC</italic> strain, puncta were observed on only 18% of cells (n=99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); on average, the Δ<italic>tolC</italic> cells had 0.2 puncta. As a Δ<italic>btuB</italic> control strain, we used BL21 (DE3) which is known to have a premature stop codon at BtuB residue 58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Studier et al., 2009</xref>). Puncta were observed on only 3% of cells lacking BtuB (n=105) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> ); on average, the Δ<italic>btuB</italic> cells had 0 puncta.</p><p>The bright ColE1-TR-Cy3 puncta photobleach over time as they are observed in the fluorescence microscope, ultimately leaving a single-molecule fluorescing before complete photobleaching. We therefore divided the brightness of each punctum by the brightness of that single molecule to estimate the number of molecules in each cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>). In WT and Δ<italic>tolC</italic> cells that featured puncta, ColE1-TR form puncta consistent with ~20 molecules; we never detect an isolated single ColE1-TR molecule on either WT or Δ<italic>tolC</italic> cells before photobleaching. The observed size and number of molecules agree with previous studies of BtuB clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chavent et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rassam et al., 2015</xref>) and the punctum locations within the cell were variable. To rule out punctum formation as an artifact of Cy3 conjugation, we found ColE1-TR-GFP displayed the same cluster formation as ColE1-TR-Cy3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Because we usually only see one punctum per cell, we anticipate that some BtuB and TolC may remain unbound because of the geometric constraints of punctum formation. ColE1 must engage both TolC and BtuB simultaneously. Therefore, both receptors must be in close proximity, similar to the ~50 Å proximity of BtuB to OmpF when both bound to another type A colicin, ColE9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francis et al., 2021</xref>). Given the two-dimensional surface of a membrane, there are restrictions to how many proteins can be within 50 Å of any other protein. For the clusters we see to occur, when BtuB clusters together in groups of approximately 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) TolC must also cluster in groups of approximately 20, ultimately requiring approximately 40 proteins in a relatively small area. The competition between the clustering of BtuB and the requirement for proximity of BtuB and TolC for binding could lower the number of BtuB/TolC sites available for the T and R domains of colicin E1 due to the relative TolC and BtuB geometries needed for ColE1 binding.</p><p>Fluorescently labeled pyocins, the colicin analog in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, have previously been used to detect translocation across the outer membrane of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we use an analogous experiment with fluorescently labeled ColE1 to determine cellular localization in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In time courses, bound ColE1-TR puncta remained immobile for &gt;5 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref> corresponds to 30 s of data used to attain the WT image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with the continued association of ColE1-TR with membrane-embedded BtuB, which has limited mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kleanthous et al., 2015</xref>). This result indicates that ColE1-TR does not fully translocate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2017</xref>), because if ColE1-TR entered the periplasmic space it would freely diffuse on these timescales.</p><p>Colicin constructs lacking the R domain (ColE1-T-Cy3) showed no detectable binding either to WT or Δ<italic>tolC</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), indicating that the TolC-ColE1-T interaction is weaker than the BtuB-ColE1-TR interaction, likely due to the absence of the R domain-BtuB interaction.</p><p>TolA is known to be required for ColE1 cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagel de Zwaig and Luria, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pilsl and Braun, 1995</xref>). ColE1 lacking the TolA box at the N-terminal T-domain would likely be translocation incompetent due to uncoupling from TolA. Similarly, there is a loss of biological activity due to mutations in ColE9 N-terminal region that indirectly interacts with TolA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loftus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garinot-Schneider et al., 1997</xref>). Biological inactivation has also been caused by mutation to the Tol-Pal interacting regions of ColE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Escuyer and Mock, 1987</xref>) and ColA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pilsl and Braun, 1995</xref>). We found that ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1–40</sub> binds to the cell surface of WT, Δ<italic>tolC</italic>, and Δ<italic>btuB</italic> in a similar manner as ColE1-TR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Cell surface localization of ColE1-TR matching that of translocation deficient ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1–40</sub> suggests that ColE1-TR puncta are not within the cell and likely stalled on the outer membrane receptor. The requirement for TolA may serve an alternate role in translocation as we consider in the Discussion section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ColE1-TR inhibits efflux and makes <italic>E. coli</italic> more susceptible to antibiotics</title><p>Since the colicin truncations are stalled on their respective OMP receptors, we investigated if this stalling could disrupt native TolC efflux. Real-time efflux inhibition by colicin E1 fragments was assessed using a live-cell assay with N-(2-naphthyl)-1-naphthylamine (NNN)-dye, which passively diffuses into cells and is effluxed by the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. NNN fluoresces when it is localized in the hydrophobic interior of one of the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohnert et al., 2011</xref>) thereby acting as a reporter for the relative rates of diffusion and efflux. NNN efflux can be turned off by the protonophore CCCP, which neutralizes the proton motive force and allows NNN to accumulate within the cell. Active efflux can then be monitored by the fluorescence decay once the proton motive force is reenergized by glucose addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seeger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohnert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Misra et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We assessed the ability of colicin E1 truncations to plug TolC by monitoring real-time NNN efflux.

An effective TolC plug will reduce the concentration required to inhibit growth as antibiotics remain trapped within the cell.

Like Colicin E1, Colicin E9 contains an intrinsically unstructured N-terminus that engages the Tol-Pal system once it penetrates into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loftus et al., 2006</xref>). Engagement of the Tol-Pal system by the N-terminal region of colicin E9 disrupts native Tol-Pal system function leading to outer membrane defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rassam et al., 2018</xref>). Outer membrane defects may lead to enhanced antibiotic susceptibility. To rule out outer membrane-mediated defects as the main contributor to the reduction in MICs seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we tested the effect of using a truncation of ColE1-TR (ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1–40</sub>) lacking the N-terminal 40 residues including the TolA box. The MIC of ColE1-TR and ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1–40</sub> is identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating that ColE1-TR engagement of TolA does not contribute to the observed antibiotic susceptibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are two conflicting models of ColE1 translocation: (1) the total thread model in which the entire colicin unfolds and threads through TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jakes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francis et al., 2021</xref>) and (2) the pillar model, in which colicin E1 inserts into TolC as a helical hairpin, facilitating LPS-mediated, self-translocation of the colicin cytotoxic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>). Our data support aspects of both models. The belief in a closed hinge conformation of bound ColE1 prompted two arguments against the total thread mechanism: (1) the ColE1-T closed hinge conformation is too wide to fit through TolC and (2) both ends would face the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakharov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cramer et al., 2018</xref>). The ColE1-T hinge opening in the bound state—which was unanticipated by the pillar model—resolves these objections: colicin threads into the TolC barrel with the amino terminus pointing into the periplasm, as the total thread model hypothesized. Our trypsin digests show ColE1-TR stalls at the outer membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and the single-molecule fluorescence images confirm that ColE1-TR remains clustered and does not diffuse as would be expected if entering the periplasm or cytoplasm. These puncta form regardless of the presence or absence of the TolA binding region on ColE1-TR.</p><p>Though we cannot exclude the possibility that ColE1 T and R domain translocation depends on the C domain, we observe—as hypothesized by the pillar model—that colicin sits inside TolC but does not translocate. These results are in agreement with early studies of pore-forming colicins in which trypsin added to the extracellular environment can reverse colicin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plate and Luria, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dankert et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dankert et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bénédetti et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duché, 2007</xref>). We anticipate that the stable ColE-TR:TolC complex forms regardless of the presence of the C domain.</p><p>If the C domain does translocate while the T and R domains remain bound, we anticipate that the requirement for TolA is due to its role in membrane maintenance. Recruitment of the Tol-Pal system by a different group A colicin (ColE9) causes membrane defects similar to those in a Δ<italic>tolA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rassam et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, in the pillar model, colicin binding of TolA may facilitate C domain insertion through the defective membrane, whereas in the total thread model binding TolA transduces the proton motive force to unfold ColE1and pull it into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because we did not use the toxic C domain, our data cannot clarify what occurs after the T and R domain of full-length colicin bind the OMPs. Although our studies find that ColE1-TR remains on the surface of the bacteria, it is certain that the C domain, when present, translocates across the membrane into the target bacteria to kill the cell. Our data do not exclude the possibility that the translocation of the T and R domains occurs along with the C domain in full-length colicin, nor does it support T or R domain translocation. Thus, though our studies give a more complete view of the early stages of ColE1 binding the surface of its target, we cannot determine if insertion of the C domain occurs via the total thread model or via a modified pillar model.</p><p>Shortly after this work was made available, a similar structure demonstrated that KlebC, a rRNAse bacteriocin from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, binds TolC from <italic>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</italic> with a binding mode similar to that of ColE1 binding TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Housden et al., 2021</xref>). KlebC is closed in the unbound state as confirmed by the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure, which supports our proposed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and opens into a single-pass, kinked-helix to bind to TolC. Taken together, these findings suggest a conserved mechanism for bacteriocins that hijack trimeric efflux pump proteins.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating a colicin insertion mechanism, our observations form the basis of a means to manipulate bacterial import and efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Though colicin E1 confers some level of antibiotic potentiation, the relatively high concentration of ColE1-TR needed to inhibit efflux may be explained by a combination of the geometric constraints of creating large clusters of BtuB and TolC, and residually unblocked pore, even in the bound state as the large internal volume of TolC is not fully occupied by ColE1. Because of their limited potency, our ColE1-T and ColE1-TR fragments are not likely to be practical in direct applications of antibiotic potentiation. However, our proof-of-concept findings offer a potential roadmap for further development. A more potent TolC binder would not need the R domain anchor for affinity. Such a binder could be designed using the atomic details of the ColE1-T:TolC structure as a basis. Moreover, this scaffold can be used for efflux pump inhibitors for at least five other bacterial organisms. Each of these organisms has a structurally characterized outer membrane efflux pump that is homologous and structurally similar to TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franklin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of colE1-TR inhibition of efflux.</title><p>The R domain of ColE1-TR (orange) binds to BtuB (cyan) with high affinity and anchors colE1-TR to the surface of the cell.

The intact cells condition and lysed condition were both split into three 270-μl aliquots. For each triplet, trypsin was added at 5 and 20 μg/ml to digest any extracellularly exposed protein. 30 μl of PBS was added to the third aliquot of each triplet for a no trypsin sample. The three aliquots were incubated at room temperature to allow for trypsin digestion. After 30 min, 20 μl of 100 mM PMSF was added to terminate the trypsin digestion reaction. Then the samples associated with the intact cells condition were lysed.

Fluorophore labeling was achieved by mixing a 20-fold molar excess of Cy3 maleimide to protein and incubating overnight at 4°C. Free dye was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex NAP-10 G-25 column. Simultaneously to the dye removal, the sample was buffer exchanged into storage buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA). The degree of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically from the concentrations of the dye and protein solutions using their respective extinction coefficients, ε, as described by their manufacturers or for the proteins as estimated by Expasy ProtParam (Cy3 ε<sub>548 nm</sub>=162,000 L mol<sup>–1</sup> cm<sup>–1</sup>; ColE1-T-E192C ε<sub>280 nm</sub>=9970 L mol<sup>–1</sup> cm<sup>–1</sup>; ColE1-TR-E366C ε<sub>280 nm</sub>=14,440 L mol<sup>–1</sup> cm<sup>–1</sup>).

Glow discharge was performed in ambient atmosphere at 0.39 mBar pressure. Imaging was performed using a Talos Arctica (FEI Company) operated at 200 kV with energy filter and K2 Summit (Gatan, Inc) for detection. To collect multiple images per hole while maintaining parallel illumination conditions, a nonstandard 20 μm condenser aperture was used to image TolC-ColE1-T in nanodiscs. At nominal magnification of 205,000×, images were acquired in counting mode with a calibrated pixel size of 0.6578 Å. Fresnel fringes attributable to the beam interaction with the aperture were often seen in images. Some investigators have moved the microscope stage and altered the nominal objective lens true focus point to generate a fringe-free condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weis and Hagen, 2020</xref>). In this study, imaging at 205,000× with a 20-μm aperture yielded better results than imaging at 130,000× with a 50-μm aperture; at 130,000× with a 20-μm aperture, the fringes were extremely severe due to the larger field of view, so a full dataset was not collected with those conditions.

Micrographs were motion-corrected using RELION 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). CTF parameters were determined by means of <italic>ctffind</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). 115,362 particles were selected with crYOLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>). 2D classification revealed that many particles had aberrant morphology and only 24,624 (21%) were selected for 3D reconstruction. Ab initio reconstruction in cryoSPARC 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) was effective at recovering a map whose shape was similar to that of previously described TolC trimers. However, the data could only be refined to a nominal global resolution of 6.0 Å, and lumenal density was insufficiently resolved. 4,492 micrographs were then collected of nanodisc-embedded TolC/ColE1-T and processed similarly. Of the 339,779 particles detected by cryoSPARC Live, 179,834 (53%) were in good classes. Although there were slightly fewer particles per micrograph in the nanodisc data set, more particles per micrograph were usable. Beginning with the <italic>ab initio</italic> model and mask derived from the amphipol data, this particle set was refined by cryoSPARC two non-uniform refinement with or without imposed C<italic><sub>3</sub></italic> symmetry. The maps refined to nominal global resolutions of 2.81 Å and 3.09 Å for the symmetrized and asymmetric maps, respectively. There was local variation in resolution within the map, with consistent, high resolution in the middle of TolC and lower resolution at the lids and for ColE1-T. Local resolution was computed in cryoSPARC by the locally-windowed FSC method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardone et al., 2013</xref>) and rendered with UCSF Chimera. To reduce the voxel-based values to averages for four regions of the complex, the local resolution map was masked to include only voxels within 3 Å of a modeled atom and then the median value was calculated for those voxels closest to ColE1, closest to TolC residues 168–172 and 386–390, closest to TolC residues 285–301 and 76–82, or closest to other TolC residues. Furthermore, it is notable that while the nanodisc appears as a double-belt in the symmetrized map, in the asymmetric map the nanodisc protein mostly appears on the side of TolC that is bound to ColE1-T. One possible explanation is that, despite masking, nanodisc asymmetry is a confounder of the asymmetric refinement and is one source of heterogeneity in the data. Another possibility is that the C-terminus of ColE1-T forms an interaction with the nanodisc, causing preferential alignment of the nanodisc with respect to the TolC/ColE1-T complex.</p><p>196,158 particles of TolC without colicin were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Budiardjo et al., 2021</xref>). Homogeneous refinement yielded a structure at 2.89 Å; local motion correction and global CTF refinement yielded a final map at 2.84 Å.</p><p>Modeling was initiated by rigidly docking a crystal structure of TolC in complex with hexamminecobalt (1TQQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Higgins et al., 2004</xref>) into the symmetrized map density. Automated, semi-automated, and manual real-space refinement was performed using phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>), ISOLDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Croll, 2018</xref>), and coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). For TolC with ColE1-T, additional refinement was performed in AMBER using the cryoEM density map as a restraint.</p><p>Although additional residues are present at the TolC C-terminus, these were not modeled because the density becomes unsharp after residue 428. Blurred density in the map suggests that the C-terminus follows helix three toward the periplasmic end of the molecule. ColE1-T was modeled <italic>ab initio</italic>. The threefold-symmetrized map contains density at ~1/3rd occupancy for ColE1-T and this density contains some high-resolution information not present in the asymmetric map, except near the TolC lid regions where symmetrization overlays ColE1-T density with TolC density at a threefold-related position. First, polyalanine helices were placed in the helical density in coot. Cross-correlation coefficients for both helices are higher with the N-terminus oriented toward the periplasm. Moreover, the side chains angle slightly toward the N-terminus like the fronds of an evergreen angle toward the ground in typical ‘Christmas tree’ conformation, indicating that this is the correct chain orientation. An estimate of the register was made by visual inspection of potential anchor residues. Finally, the hinge region was filled in using phenix and coot. This completed chain was refined against the asymmetric map in ISOLDE. Iteration between phenix, coot, and ISOLDE was continued until acceptable fit to density was achieved. In the case of TolC with ColE1-T, the map was further improved by combining map information with molecular dynamics force fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, starting with the phenix/coot/ISOLDE-refined model, we performed restrained simulated annealing in AMBER, heating from 0K to 300K for 0.2 ns, holding constant temperature for 1 ns, and then cooling to 0K over 0.2 ns. The cryoEM density map is utilized as a restraint potential in the annealing so that both map information and AMBER force field information are simultaneously utilized to obtain an optimum model consistent with the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The protein force field used the ff14SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maier et al., 2015</xref>) and a generalized Born implicit solvent model with <italic>igb=</italic>8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>), and a nonbonded cutoff of 20 Å. The relative weight of real-space map-based restraints and the force field was fixed using <italic>fcons=</italic>0.02. For ColE1-T, information from the symmetrized map was integrated into the modeling procedure during manual remodeling in coot, but map-based refinement in phenix, ISOLDE, and AMBER was against the asymmetric map. TolC without ColE1-T was modeled similarly but using the TolC-ColE1-T structure as a starting point instead of 1TQQ, and without final AMBER refinement.</p><p>Molecular representations were generated with Chimera, ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>), or PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>AlphaFold model of ColE1</title><p>AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) was used to generate a predicted structural model for full-length ColE1.

related bacteria that compete for scarce resources. While the individual proteins used for binding and taking up colicins in target bacteria are well-known, the precise pathway that those toxins ultimately take to make it into the cell is unclear. Here the authors reveal the cryo EM structure of the outermembrane protein TolC in complex with colicin E1 toxin to shed new mechanistic insights into this toxin import mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73297.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05f0yaq80</institution-id><institution>Stockholm University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05f0yaq80</institution-id><institution>Stockholm University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>van den Berg</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01kj2bm70</institution-id><institution>University of Newcastle</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Jakes</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05cf8a891</institution-id><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Colicin E1 opens its hinge to plug TolC&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Membrane localization experiments with ColE1-T and ColE1-TR are described in Figure 4. However, more experimental details need to be included in the figure legends and Methods, especially regarding protein concentrations in the experiments shown in Figure 4. For example, what is analysed in intact cells? Is bound toxin washed off into the supernatant? If the toxin has very high affinity will it come off the OMP receptor(s)? The relative concentrations of the colicin constructs used is not given, so there's no way to easily interpret some of the data. Furthermore, Figure 4C shows one cell each, and one could argue that only the best data is shown involved. Could the authors (perhaps as source data) show panels with many cells to show any differences between strains more objectively?</p><p>2. The Discussion section needs to better describe the differences between the &quot;pillar&quot; and &quot;total-thread&quot; models, perhaps by also including a schematic of both. Furthermore, the experimental evidence in this paper supports the total-thread model, whereas the more ambiguous experiments (trypsin digestion) are only suggestive of the pillar model. Please make the final proposed model clearer in the discussion and include how the downstream pore-forming cytotoxic domain is translocated.</p><p>3. Experiments with GFP attached to colE1-TR suggest efficient uptake in a tolC-dependent process. What would be a very informative further would be to delete the TolA box from the N terminus of the T domain of the T-R construct and determine whether uptake still occurs. If so, that would argue further against a translocation model whereby the C-terminal channel-forming domain of colicin E1 slithers down the outside of TolC, with its C terminus first, as proposed by Cramer et al. (2018). Additional control would be to mutate the hinge-proline.</p><p>4. The Housden klebicin paper was published very recently describing detailed studies of the interaction of TolC with another bacteriocin, including cryo-EM structures (Housden et al., Nature Commun 12(1):4625). While the work described here has been carried out independently, some acknowledgement of this work in the discussion is warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Colicin E1 is an <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteriocin that hijacks the outer membrane proteins TolC and BtuB to enter the cell. Here the authors reveal the cryo EM structure of TolC in complex with colicin E1. They show how Colicin E1 structure rearranges from a helical hairpin into an single, long extended helix that plugs the TolC pore. They further show that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that have TolC proteins plugged with a Colicin E1 fragments are more susceptible to antibiotics. Taken together, they have outlined the structural basis for Colicin E1 recognition and shown the applicability of this approach for bacterial pathogenicity.</p><p>Overall, I can find little technical issues with the paper and I think the conclusions drawn from the experiments are sound. The paper is well-written and the figures are easy to follow. From a mechanistic viewpoint the major findings was that it was unexpected for colicin E1 to open up from a helical hairpin into a single helix inside TolC. While the author have succeeded to understanding how the toxin engages with its receptor its still unclear how the downstream pore-forming cytotoxic domain is translocated across TolC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Slusky and colleagues presents cryo-EM structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> TolC in the absence and presence of the N-terminal translocation domain of Colicin-E1 (ColE1-T). Via SEC they demonstrate that the toxin domain binds tightly to TolC. Interestingly, the structure shows that the colicin is bound inside the long TolC barrel, with most of the colicin-OMP contacts provided by the β-barrel part of TolC. The cryo-EM data are nice and the map of the complex is of very good quality and supports the ColE1-T model built by the authors. While the involvement of TolC (and another OMP named BtuB) in ColE1 cell entry was known, the structure provides in my opinion clear support for a model in which the entire ColE1 is transported into the cell via the TolC conduit, utilising the proton motive force to power translocation via TolA. This latter part is not well described by the authors and I find the discussion of the two models not very clear and too much in favor of the &quot;pillar&quot; model (see detailed comments; I think also a schematic figure is warranted showing the two models). Another major issue that needs addressing is the fact that the authors have missed (or ignored) a very similar paper that was published very recently and which describes detailed studies of the interaction of TolC with another bacteriocin (Klebicin), including cryo-EM structures (Housden et al., Nature Commun 12(1):4625). Thus, in contrast to what is claimed by the authors, theirs is not the first structure of a bacteriocin bound to TolC. The authors should compare their structure with that of Housden et al. (which is very similar) and rewrite their discussion based on both papers.</p><p>To support their structural data the authors also carried out membrane localization experiments with ColE1-T and ColE1-TR (includes the receptor binding domain that interacts with the primary receptor BtuB), described in Figure 4. I didn't find this very clear. In particular I'm not sure what is analysed in Figure 4B? What do you analyse in intact cells? Bound toxin that is washed off and ends up in the sup? If so, what if the toxin has very high affinity and won't come off the OMP receptor(s)? The methods section is not complete and, rather than refer to a previous paper, the procedures should be fully described here. Figure 4C shows one cell each, and one could argue that cherry picking might be involved. Could the authors (perhaps as source data) show panels with many cells to show any differences between strains more objectively?</p><p>The final data provided by the authors utilises the fact that TolC is part of the AcrAB-TolC RND efflux pump that moves noxious substances including antibiotics out of the cell. They hypothesise that, when ColE1-T or ColE1-TR is bound to TolC (plugging the efflux channel), the pump should not work or work less efficiently. Indeed, MIC values for several antibiotics are lower in the presence of certain toxin fragments, showing that cells are sensitised due to reduced drug efflux. The required concentration of the colicins are high, however, suggesting that the pump is still partly functional while the colicin is bound, a notion supported by the structure. Together, these data lead to the interesting hypothesis that modified bacteriocins that hijack functionally important OMPs might be used to potentiate antibiotics. Together, this paper provides a nice advance in our thinking on how bacteriocins gain entry into cells (but the discussion should be improved substantially). It is also consistent with the more detailed study by Housden et al., which is satisfying. The potential application towards potentiating antibiotics via colicin-based targeting of OMPs like TolC could be an important future area of research.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Colicins are plasmid-encoded toxins produced by bacteria to kill closely related bacteria that compete for scarce resources. While the individual proteins in the target bacteria used for binding and uptake of colicins are well-known, there remains some controversy about the precise pathway that those toxins ultimately take to reach the target of their ultimate lethal act. In this work by Budiardjo et al., the path for colicin E1, which ultimately kills target <italic>E. coli</italic> by making an ion-permeable channel in their inner membrane, is clarified.</p><p>All of the E colicins use the vitamin B12 receptor, BtuB, as their primary outer membrane receptor to concentrate the colicin at the cell surface via an interaction with the central receptor-binding (R) domain. The enzymatic E colicins, E2-E9, then use the trimeric porin, OmpF, and its interactions with the N-terminal translocation (T) domain of the colicin to thread through one of the three pores of OmpF to ultimately bring the catalytic, carboxy-terminal end of the colicin into the periplasm from which it ultimately reaches and crosses the inner membrane. That process has been very thoroughly examined and documented, principally by the work of Kleanthous, Housden and their co-workers, as cited in references in this manuscript and others cited in this review. Colicin E1, which kills target bacteria by making a channel in their inner membrane and thereby depolarizing the cell, also uses BtuB as its primary outer membrane receptor. But then it differs from the other E colicins in hijacking the TolC channel, whose normal role in the cell is in drug and toxin export, and uses that channel as a means to enter the target cell. The isolated colicin E1 T domain has been found to exist in solution as a helical hairpin (Zakharov et al., 2016), but whether in vivo binding to TolC occurs as that same hairpin, with both ends pointing outside the target bacterium, or whether the hairpin unfolds, possibly around a TolC box previously shown to be essential for cytotoxicity, as proposed (Jakes, 2017), was not known. In this work, it is now clearly shown by cryoEM that the T domain hairpin unfolds completely and is captured inserted inside TolC. The previously identified TolC box acts as a hinge with a kink at a central proline in the 21-residue box sequence (residues 100-120). Residues in the TolC box are involved in specific interactions with residues of TolC within the channel. The interaction with the T domain peptide alone was sufficient to dilate both the periplasmic and extracellular apertures of TolC, without involvement of any other proteins or motive force, a very signficant finding. The structure and the specific residue interactions elucidated in this work help explain earlier results with mutations in TolC that block killing by colicin E1 (ref. #37). The structure reported here negates earlier arguments against models in which colicin E1 threads through TolC to enter the periplasm. The direction of insertion is with the N terminus facing the periplasmic end of TolC. This arrangement would logically be expected, since the known TolA box sequence lies very near the N terminus of the colicin E1 T domain and needs to interact in the periplasm with TolA, a bacterial protein anchored in the inner membrane which extends into the periplasm, is thought to provide the energy necessary to mobilize translocation of the colicin and has been demonstrated genetically to be absolutely required for colicin lethality.</p><p>Budiardjo et al. have failed to acknowledge the recent publication of nearly identical results with the closely-related <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pneumoniae klebicinC uptake via TolC (Housden et al., 2021, Nat. Commun. 12(1): 4625), in which the klebicinC T domain was also captured inside the channel of the K. pneumoniae TolC channel. In those experiments, the stretch of T domain bound inside of TolC was protected from digestion by trypsin, with residues at both ends protruding from TolC subject to protease digestion. Thus, these two different bacteriocins, targeting different bacteria, both insert their N-terminal translocation domains into the TolC protein of their respective targets.</p><p>A second very significant result from this manuscript is that binding of colicin E1 T domain inhibits drug efflux and thereby reduces the minimum concentration of some drugs to effectively kill bacteria. A significant effect was only seen in constructs that also included the R domain of the colicin, which may simply be serving to increase the concentration of T domain at the cell surface and thereby making its interaction with TolC more efficient. A shortcoming of these experiments is that the relative concentrations of the colicin constructs used is not given, so there's no way to interpret the lack of much effect from T domain alone. But the basic result suggests that there may be a route to using the E1 T domain as a means to reduce resistance of pathogenic bacteria to standard antibiotics, as has been suggested previously (Jakes, 2017).</p><p>In vivo experiments to determine whether the T domain or T-R domain were protected from trypsin digestion by virtue of having been internalized by <italic>E. coli</italic> are difficult to interpret. The protocol cited in the manuscript is a general protocol, and the relative amounts of protein used are not given. It is perhaps unsurprising that no T domain is seen bound to either intact or lysed cells, while T-R is detected, since the binding of isolated T domain, via TolC, has been shown to be orders of magnitude less efficient than that of R domain to BtuB (Jakes, 2017). The authors point out that the proteolysis results may just be a reflection of a small number of molecules entering the cells. Similarly, the failure to see much transport of the fluorescently-labeled colE1-TR-Cy3 may also be a reflection of a combination of inefficient binding and the bulky Cy3 label impeding passage through TolC. In fact, recent work on transport of colicin E9 through OmpF suggests that relatively small differences in the size of fluorescent labels attached to colicin domains can have a measurable effect on uptake of the labeled proteins (Francis et al. EMBO J. e108610/2021), and the labels used in that work had lower molecular weights than the Cy3 used in the experiments described here. Experiments with GFP attached to colE1-TR suggest more efficient uptake in a tolC-dependent process. What would be a very informative further experiment would be to delete the TolA box from the N terminus of the T domain of the T-R construct and determine whether uptake still occurs. If so, that would argue further against a translocation model whereby the C-terminal channel-forming domain of colicin E1 slithers down the outside of TolC, with its C terminus first, as proposed by Cramer et al. (2018).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Colicin E1 opens its hinge to plug TolC&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Throughout the manuscript, reference is made to the TolA box of colicins E3 and E9. However, neither of those colicins actually has a TolA box. Beginning with the early work of Bouveret et al. (Mol. Micro 1998 27, 143-157) and subsequently by others, it has been shown that what had been called the TolA box in earlier work is actually a TolB box. Colicins E2-E9 and A all interact with TolA indirectly, by binding to TolB in the periplasm, and TolB then engages TolA. The fullest picture of those interactions is in the recent work of Francis et al. (2021), which is cited in this manuscript. The only E colicin known to have a TolA box is E1. A reference (probably Pilsl and Braun, 1995) is needed when referring to the E1 TolA box. All references to a TolA box in colicins E3 or E9 need to be fixed.</p><p>4.

Experiments such as these and those that preceded this most recent work are the basis for the &quot;total thread&quot; model for colicin translocation, in which the colicin is pulled through the same pore of OmpF through which its T domain initially entered.

But in the process of expanding parts of the Introduction and Discussion, I feel they have done their work and the field a disservice by giving &quot;first billing&quot; to a model for which there is scant experimental support and giving short shrift to the model for which there is now extensive experimental support and which common sense should support.</p><p>In their expanded Introduction, the authors once again lead with a lengthy elaboration of the &quot;pillar model&quot; for the translocation of the colicin E1 pore-forming domain across the outer membrane of target <italic>E. coli</italic>. That model was introduced simply because of the assumption by Zakharov et al. (2016) that the helical hairpin structure of the E1 T domain observed in solution from CD spectra is maintained when the T domain binds in vitro to TolC, as it was shown to do by SEC, occlusion of TolC channels in planar lipid bilayer membranes (Zakharov et al., 2016), and in vivo by protecting sensitive <italic>E. coli</italic> from killing by active colicin E1 (Jakes, 2017). On the contrary, the current work has clearly demonstrated that the hairpin unfolds and inserts, amino-terminus first, into TolC., so the whole basis for a model with both N- and C-termini pointing to the outside of the target cell is gone. (In addition, recent work on the Klebicin C bacteriocin has shown that locking that protein's T domain helix in its closed state, with an inserted disulfide bond, kills its activity in the oxidized state, but not when it's reduced (Housden et al., 2021)). Another argument made by Zakharov et al. against insertion of the T domain into TolC was that the periplasmic aperture of the TolC channel is too narrow for a polypeptide to exit, so therefore the colicin couldn't possibly thread into the periplasm via that route. The structure shown in Figure 1B demonstrates that the binding of T domain within the channel opens that aperture; the colicin domain is easily accommodated within TolC. Thus, the colicin polypeptide or a part of it could transit through TolC.</p><p>The sections on potentiation of antibiotics by the E1 T domain are additional evidence that the colicin domain is occupying TolC and inhibiting its normal role in drug efflux. It's likely that the failure to see much of an effect with T domain, as compared to R-T, is simply the result of the much tighter binding of R to BtuB, which then concentrates T domain at the cell surface and makes it more likely to find and enter a TolC channel.</p><p>While the experimental details and source data have been expanded and clarified, the implications of both the trypsin digestion experiments and fluorescence labeling are less clear than the cryo-EM and drug efflux experiments, and some caveats should be added to the discussions of those experiments. It's not clear what not finding protected T domain tells us. Recently published experiments with the related KlebC and the K. quasipneumoniae TolC (Housden et al. 2021) clearly show that a significant segment of the KlebC T domain is protected from trypsin digestion when bound and digested in vitro. Mass spec analysis of the protease digestion products showed that the KlebC T domain extends out of the TolC channel at both the periplasmic and extracellular ends, and those parts of the peptide were degraded by trypsin, but there remained a protected band of &gt;40 residues that coincides with residues shown inside the TolC channel in the cryoEM structure.</p><p>The observation in most cases of just a single punctum from fluorescently-labeled colicin peptides is puzzling, although the presence of a fluorescent signal is clearly BtuB and TolC-dependent. Frankly, I'm not sure what we learn from these experiments. Somehow the videos referred to did not come through with the copy of the manuscript I received.</p><p>The new experiments with P110A and T∆1-40 are interesting and somewhat surprising. There is nothing in the Methods about how either of those mutants was generated.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, reference is made to the TolA box of colicins E3 and E9. However, neither of those colicins actually has a TolA box! Beginning with the early work of Bouveret et al. (Mol. Micro 1998 27, 143-157) and subsequently by others, it has been shown that what had been called the TolA box in earlier work is actually a TolB box. Colicins E2-E9 and A all interact with TolA indirectly, by binding to TolB in the periplasm, and TolB then engages TolA. The fullest picture of those interactions is in the recent work of Francis et al. (2021), which is cited in this manuscript. The only E colicin known to have a TolA box is E1. A reference (probably Pilsl and Braun, 1995) is needed when referring to the E1 TolA box. All references to a TolA box in colicins E3 or E9 need to be fixed.</p><p>I have taken the liberty of making a number of additions and corrections, in italics, to add some balance to the descriptions of the two models.

The belief in a closed hinge conformation of bound ColE1 prompted two arguments against the total thread mechanism: (1) the ColE1-T closed hinge conformation is too wide to fit through TolC and (2) both ends would face the extracellular milieu (Zakharov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016, Cramer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). The unanticipated ColE1-T hinge opening in the bound state resolves these objections: colicin threads into the TolC barrel with the amino terminus pointing into the periplasm, as the total thread model hypothesized. Our trypsin digests show ColE1-TR stalls at the outer membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and the single-molecule fluorescence images confirm that ColE1-TR remains clustered and do not diffuse as would be expected if entering the periplasm or cytoplasm. These puncta form regardless of the presence or absence of the TolA binding region on ColE1-TR.</p><p>Though we cannot exclude the possibility that ColE1 T and R domain translocation depends on the C domain, we observe—as hypothesized by the pillar model—that colicin sits inside TolC but does not translocate. These results are in agreement with early studies of pore-forming colicins in which trypsin added to the extracellular environment can reverse colicin activity (Plate and Luria, 1972, Dankert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980, Dankert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982, Benedetti <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992, Duche, 2007). We anticipate that the stable ColE-TR:TolC complex forms regardless of the presence of the C domain.</p><p>If the C domain does translocate while the T and R domains remain bound, we anticipate that the requirement for TolA is due to its role in membrane maintenance. Binding of TolA by a different group A colicin (ColE9) causes membrane defects similar to those in a Δ<italic>tolA</italic> strain (Rassam et al., 2018). Therefore, in the pillar model, colicin binding of TolA may facilitate C domain insertion through the defective membrane, whereas in the total thread model binding TolA transduces the proton motive force to unfold ColE1and pull it into the periplasm (Figure 6, supplemental figure 1). Because we did not use the toxic C domain, our data cannot clarify what occurs after the T and R domain of full length colicin bind the outer membrane proteins. Although our studies find that ColE1-TR remains on the surface of the bacteria, it is certain that the C domain, when present, translocates across the membrane into the target bacteria to kill the cell. Our data does not exclude the possibility that the translocation of the T and R domains occurs along with the C domain in full length colicin, nor does it support T or R domain translocation. Thus, though our studies give a more complete view of the early stages of ColE1 binding the surface of its target, we cannot determine if insertion of the C domain occurs via the total thread model or via a modified pillar model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Experiments with GFP attached to colE1-TR suggest efficient uptake in a tolC-dependent process. What would be a very informative further would be to delete the TolA box from the N terminus of the T domain of the T-R construct and determine whether uptake still occurs. If so, that would argue further against a translocation model whereby the C-terminal channel-forming domain of colicin E1 slithers down the outside of TolC, with its C terminus first, as proposed by Cramer et al. (2018). Additional control would be to mutate the hinge-proline.</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewers’ request we have deleted residues 1-40, which bind to TolA, and we have quantified single-molecule fluorescence images of ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1-40</sub>-Cy3 on WT, ∆<italic>tolC</italic>, and ∆<italic>btuB</italic> cells. We find that, like ColE1-TR, ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1-40</sub> does remains fixed on the cell in puncta.</p><p>The new data can now be found in the manuscript as Figure 4—source data 1.</p><p>And as a gallery of the pictures as Figure 4 supplemental figure 3.</p><p>We now describe this data in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“In binding to the cell surface, ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1-40</sub> binds to WT, Δ<italic>tolC</italic>, and Δ<italic>btuB</italic> in a similar manner as ColE1-TR (Figure 4 supplementary figure 3, Figure 4 supplementary table 1). Cell localization of ColE1-TR matching that of translocation deficient ColE1-TR<sub>Δ1-40</sub> suggests that ColE1-TR puncta are not within the cell and likely stalled on the outer membrane receptor.”</p><p>We also mutated the hinge proline (P110A) and found that ColE1-T still binds to TolC. This data has been added as Figure 3, supplemental figure 2.</p><p>We added the following text to the manuscript:</p><p>“These contacts are strong enough that even when the proline hinge of the TolC-box is mutated (P110A) ColE1-T still binds TolC (Figure 3, supplementary figure 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The Housden klebicin paper was published very recently describing detailed studies of the interaction of TolC with another bacteriocin, including cryo-EM structures (Housden et al., Nature Commun 12(1):4625). While the work described here has been carried out independently, some acknowledgement of this work in the discussion is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the discussion:</p><p>“Shortly after this work was made available, a similar structure demonstrated that KlebC, an rRNAse bacteriocin from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, binds TolC from <italic>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</italic> with a binding mode similar to that of ColE1 binding TolC. (Housden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021) KlebC is closed in the unbound state as confirmed by the high-resolution xray crystal structure which supports our proposed conformation (Figure 2E) and opens into a single-pass, kinked-helix to bind to TolC. This suggests a conserved mechanism for bacteriocins that hijack these trimeric efflux pump proteins.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. While we realise the PDBs were released earlier than those of Housden et al. it would be better to remove the instances of &quot;first&quot; in the text as, after all, they are not really needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Though we agree it is clear that our PDB was deposited and released before that of Housden et al., our concern is that the wording “first” is unfortunately needed. Housden et al. claims specifically that, “We next set out to delineate the TolC-binding region of KlebC and determine its structure; no structure has yet been reported for any TolC-binding domain.”</p><p>We are concerned Housden’s wording will perpetuate a misunderstanding in the literature as our structure had already been reported, in a preprint and a PDB. Such a misunderstanding might reduce the number of citations attributed to this work in this journal as other scientists would erroneously believe that priority should be attributed to Housden.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The modified text for points 23 and 24 in the previous submission was still unclear to Referee 2. We would ask you to try to re-address these points (re-pasted below for clarity).</p><p>23. line 253: &quot;need to be in close proximity for colE1 binding to occur&quot; needs a reference.</p><p>24. line 254: &quot;when BtuB clusters together in groups of 12 or more, it may exclude TolC&quot; needs a reference. Also, please explain &quot;These cluster geometries would therefore lower the number of full binding sites available for the T and R domains of colicin E1.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this passage to make it clear that we are referring to the simple need for physical proximity during binding: if a substrate is binding two proteins simultaneously, then those two proteins must therefore be near to each other. Moreover, clustering multiple proteins in a small two-dimensional area leads to physical (geometric) exclusions:</p><p>“Because we usually only see one punctum per cell, we anticipate that some BtuB and TolC may remain unbound because of the geometric constraints of punctum formation. ColE1 must engage both TolC and BtuB simultaneously. Therefore, both receptors must be in close proximity, similar to the ~50 Å proximity of BtuB to OmpF when both bound to a another type A colicin, ColE9 (Francis et al., 2021). Given the two-dimensional surface of a membrane there are restrictions to how many proteins can be within 50 Å of any other protein. For the clusters we see to occur, when BtuB clusters together in groups of approximately 20 (Figure 4) TolC must also cluster in groups of approximately 20, ultimately requiring approximately 40 proteins in a relatively small area. The competition between the clustering of BtuB and the requirement for proximity of BtuB and TolC for binding could lower the number of BtuB/TolC sites available for the T and R domains of colicin E1 due to the relative TolC and BtuB geometries needed for ColE1 binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Throughout the manuscript, reference is made to the TolA box of colicins E3 and E9. However, neither of those colicins actually has a TolA box. Beginning with the early work of Bouveret et al. (Mol. Micro 1998 27, 143-157) and subsequently by others, it has been shown that what had been called the TolA box in earlier work is actually a TolB box. Colicins E2-E9 and A all interact with TolA indirectly, by binding to TolB in the periplasm, and TolB then engages TolA. The fullest picture of those interactions is in the recent work of Francis et al. (2021), which is cited in this manuscript. The only E colicin known to have a TolA box is E1. A reference (probably Pilsl and Braun, 1995) is needed when referring to the E1 TolA box. All references to a TolA box in colicins E3 or E9 need to be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insight and have made the distinction between colicin E1 binding to TolA and colicins E3 and E9 binding to TolB. References to TolA box for colicins E3 and E9 have been corrected through the manuscript with the appropriate citations. In addition, all references to ColE1 requiring TolA now include the citation to Pilsl and Braun 1995.</p><p>The text has been updated:</p><p>“TolA is known to be required for ColE1 cytotoxicity (Nagel de Zwaig and Luria, 1967, Pilsl and Braun, 1995). ColE1 lacking the TolA box at the N-terminal T-domain would likely be translocation incompetent due to uncoupling from TolA. Similarly, there is a loss of biological activity due to mutations in the ColE9 N-terminal region that indirectly interacts with TolA (Loftus et al., 2006).(Schneider et al., 1997) Biological inactivation has also been caused by mutation to the Tol-Pal interacting regions of ColE3 (Escuyer and Mock, 1987) and ColA (Pilsl and Braun, 1995).”</p><p>“TolA is normally involved in outer membrane invagination during cell division (Gerding et al., 2007). Like Colicin E1, Colicin E9 contains an intrinsically unstructured N-terminus that engages the Tol-Pal system once it penetrates into the periplasm (Loftus et al., 2006). Engagement of the Tol-Pal system by the N-terminal region of colicin E9 disrupts native Tol-Pal system function leading to outer membrane defects (Rassam et al., 2018).”</p><p>“Recruitment of the Tol-Pal system by a different group A colicin (ColE9) causes membrane defects similar to those in a ΔtolA strain (Rassam et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While the experimental details and source data have been expanded and clarified, the implications of both the trypsin digestion experiments and fluorescence labeling are less clear than the cryo-EM and drug efflux experiments, and some caveats should be added to the discussions of those experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful discussions of recent findings. We agree that the single puncta were a surprising finding and worth pointing out in our manuscript. Though the molecular mechanism that gives rise to these puncta remains to be explored in future projects, the error bars and detection limits of the microscopy observations indicate that this clustering is true.</p><p>We also appreciate that the results of our in vivo trypsin digest were (and were expected to be) different from the recent Housden work in which trypsin digests were conducted in vitro absent any mechanism for translocation. Finally, we appreciate the reviewer for pointing out that we neglected to update our methods on the P110A mutant and the del1-40 mutant.</p><p>We have added the following to the methods:</p><p>“A gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies) was synthesized for GFP containing complimentary flanking sequences to the plasmid with ColE1-TR and inserted with the omega-PCR technique.</p><p>ColE1-TRΔ1-40 was produced by inverse PCR to delete residues corresponding to 1 through 40.</p><p>All point mutants (ColE1-T-E192C, ColE1-TR-E366C, ColE1-TR-E366CΔ1-40, and ColE1-T-P110A) were generated by inverse PCR with mutagenic primers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Those same studies and earlier ones clearly demonstrated that full engagement of the E9 T domain with its TolB translocation partner in the periplasm results in disengagement of the R domain from BtuB (Francis et al. 2021 and references therein). Experiments such as these and those that preceded this most recent work are the basis for the &quot;total thread&quot; model for colicin translocation, in which the colicin is pulled through the same pore of OmpF through which its T domain initially entered.
