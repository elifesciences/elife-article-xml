To date, therapies targeting end-stage disease plaques, tangles, or inflammation have limited efficacy. Therefore, we set out to identify a potential earlier targetable phenotype. Utilizing a mouse model of AD and human fetal cells harboring mutant amyloid precursor protein, we show cell intrinsic neural precursor cell (NPC) dysfunction precedes widespread inflammation and amyloid plaque pathology, making it the earliest defect in the evolution of the disease. We demonstrate that reversing impaired NPC self-renewal <italic>via</italic> genetic reduction of USP16, a histone modifier and critical physiological antagonist of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1, can prevent downstream cognitive defects and decrease astrogliosis in vivo. Reduction of USP16 led to decreased expression of senescence gene <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and mitigated aberrant regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Signaling (BMP) pathway, a previously unknown function of USP16. Thus, we reveal USP16 as a novel target in an AD model that can both ameliorate the NPC defect and rescue memory and learning through its regulation of both <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and BMP signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007557</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Elizabeth Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zucherberg Foundationg Biohub Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Elizabeth Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Robert C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolluru</surname><given-names>Sai Saroja</given-names></name><name><surname>Quake</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AG059712-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinitz</surname><given-names>Felicia</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Elizabeth Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicolis di Robilant</surname><given-names>Benedetta</given-names></name><name><surname>Antony</surname><given-names>Jane</given-names></name><name><surname>Gubbi</surname><given-names>Neha</given-names></name><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>Dalong</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG059712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tung Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinitz</surname><given-names>Felicia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AIRC and Marie Curie Action</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolis di Robilant</surname><given-names>Benedetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A neural precursor cell defect precedes widespread inflammation, amyloid plaque pathology, and cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease, which can be reversed by inhibiting USP16.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, occurring in 10% of individuals over the age of 65 and affecting an estimated 5.5 million people in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hebert et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, there is no treatment to stop, prevent, or reverse AD, and recent advances with monoclonal antibody therapy targeting plaques, although controversial, might at best only slow progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang and Mucke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Selkoe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sevigny et al., 2016</xref>). Historically, AD has been understood by its end-stage disease phenotype, characterized clinically by dementia and pathologically by amyloid senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castellani et al., 2010</xref>). These traditional AD pathologies are thought to begin with amyloid plaque deposition that is associated with inflammation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neurodegeneration during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glass et al., 2010</xref>); however, thus far, treatments to decrease formation of plaques have shown only minimal or no improvement in disease progression or outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knopman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Selkoe, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Adult neurogenesis is thought to be compromised in AD, contributing to early dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alipour et al., 2019</xref>). The decline of neural stem/precursor cell (NPC) function in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus has been established in both aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>) and various AD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haughey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">López-Toledano and Shelanski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mu and Gage, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodríguez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez and Verkhratsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakamoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Winner et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether these defects are cell-intrinsic resulting from changes inside the cells or extrinsic, resulting from factors present in the niche, such as inflammation. Here, we report that the NPC defects seen in an AD mouse model harboring Swedish, Dutch, and Iowa mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (Tg-SwDI) is initially cell-intrinsic and predates inflammation and widespread plaque deposition, which play a role later in the disease. We chose the Tg-SwDI model with mutations confined to <italic>APP</italic> because mice develop early plaque deposition and cognitive deficits, and express physiologic levels of transgenic human AβPP at approximately 50% the level of endogenous mouse APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2004</xref>). In this model, mice begin to develop amyloid deposition in brain parenchyma as early as 3 months of age and throughout the forebrain by 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miao et al., 2005</xref>), as well as significant cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which is thought to be a more sensitive predictor of dementia than parenchymal and amyloid plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neuropathology Group. Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Aging Study, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thal et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we targeted USP16, an upstream regulator of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, to reverse the NPC defect seen in the Tg-SwDI model. USP16 counteracts self-renewal regulator BMI1 by deubiquitinating histone H2A on Lysine 119 at the <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> locus, resulting in increased expression of protein products P16 (<italic>Ink4a</italic>) and P14 (<italic>Arf</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adorno et al., 2013</xref>). This results in increased senescence with a concomitant decrease in self-renewal. Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting USP16 is a potential novel strategy to rescue <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>-mediated pathologies in AD induced by both p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> and p19<italic><sup>Arf</sup></italic>. As <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> might not be the only player in AD pathophysiology, we probed for additional pathways regulated by USP16 and identified enrichment of the BMP pathway early on in the Tg-SwDI mice. The BMP pathway has been known to play a role in NPC function. Specifically, BMPR2 is a type II receptor that heterodimerizes with BMPR1a or BMPR1b, and is responsible for transducing BMP signaling downstream to the SMAD proteins, which translocate to the nucleus and can turn on genes related to cell fate and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). Levels of BMP2, 4, 6, and 7 expression have been found to increase in the hippocampus and SVZ with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yousef et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apostolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Bmpr2</italic> conditional ablation in <italic>Ascl1</italic> expressing neural stem cells (NSCs)/NPCs or treatment with BMP inhibitor Noggin results in activation of NSCs, increased cell proliferation, and a rescue of cognitive deficits to levels comparable to young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyers et al., 2016</xref>). For the first time, we show that targeting USP16 in a mouse model of AD rescues two aberrant aging pathways, <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and BMP, which can restore self-renewal of NPCs, decrease astrogliosis, and retard cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic summarizing therapeutic approaches to mitigate the effects of mutant APP through targeting of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, BMI1, USP16 and BMP.</title><p>Aberrant USP16/<italic>Cdkn2a</italic>/BMP signaling results in an early neural precursor cell (NPC) defect in Alzheimer’s Disease.

Therefore, we used a multimodal temporal approach, including immunofluorescence staining, in vitro neurosphere assays, Luminex assays, and behavioral studies to dissect changes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels in mice at varying ages. At 3 months of age, we found that proliferation of NPCs, marked by 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chehrehasa et al., 2009</xref>), SOX2, and GFAP, was increased threefold in the SVZ of Tg-SwDI mice (p=0.0153; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In many tissues including the blood, pancreas, intestine, and mammary gland, hyperproliferation has been linked to a premature decline in stem cell function associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Essers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krishnamurthy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheeren et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we looked at stem cell function using extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) of neurosphere-formation from single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu and Smyth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pastrana et al., 2011</xref>). We discovered that 3 and 4-month-old Tg-SwDI mice had significantly less regenerative potential of the SVZ cells than that of healthy age-matched control mice (neurosphere-initiating cell (NIC) frequencies: 1 in 14.5 versus 1 in 7.5, respectively, p=0.00166, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). As <italic>Bmi1</italic> is required for self-renewal of stem cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems and is responsible for repressing p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> expression, we queried if decreased <italic>Bmi1</italic> and/or increased <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> expression was concurrent with the observed decrease in regenerative potential of NPCs from Tg-SwDI mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molofsky et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, we measured a significant decrease in <italic>Bmi1</italic> expression and a significant increase in its downstream target <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> expression in neurospheres from Tg-SwDI mice compared to wild type (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To study whether these changes in proliferation and self-renewal capacity of NPCs occur before the well-established prominent AD phenotype of inflammation, we employed a Luminex screen to assess the presence of an array of cytokines and other inflammatory markers.

We, therefore, wanted to see if the decrease in neurosphere-initiating capacity of Tg-SwDI mice also precedes their memory impairment and progressively diminished cognitive function. Although Tg-SwDI mice are known to exhibit these features, there was no evidence of cognitive impairment in 3 and 4-month-old mice when subjected to novel object recognition (NOR) training and subsequent testing after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, given the prominent early aberrant self-renewal phenotype in the 3 and 4-month-old Tg-SwDI mice, we investigated whether or not expression of mutant <italic>APP</italic> in human NPCs might also cause a self-renewal defect.

Although our Tg-SwDI mice employ Swedish, Dutch, and Iowa mutations, we chose a human in vitro model with Swedish and Indiana mutations as the Indiana mutation allows for an increase in the Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio rather than the increased amyloidosis of the vasculature incurred by Dutch and Iowa mutations which would have been difficult to observe in vitro. Our human NPCs expressed at least a 2-fold change increase in mutant <italic>APP</italic> compared to the baseline endogenous <italic>APP</italic> levels in the Zsgreen control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Mutations in <italic>APP</italic> lead to amyloid plaque deposition throughout the brain as seen in 10-month-old Tg-SwDI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, no difference was observed in plaque burden, demonstrated by Thioflavin S staining, in the age-matched Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, a Luminex screen of 1-year-old Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice also did not reveal significant differences in the levels of inflammatory cytokines from any of the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>As expected, when studying the cognitive decline in the Tg-SwDI cohort, we found that the Tg-SwDI cohort exhibited impaired performance in the NOR task as early as 6 months of age, with preference indexes (PIs) that were not significantly different 24 hr after training, indicating no memory of the familiar object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice performed equally to their age-matched WT controls indicating memory of the familiar object with PIs in the 65–70% range (p=0.001 and p=0.0099, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Long-term memory impairment in Tg-SwDI mice and rescue in Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice was further supported by the Barnes maze (BM) where Tg-SwDI mice spent more time exploring off-target quadrants and Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice spent more time in the target quadrant (p=0.0128 and p=0.0251, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data indicate that although modulating <italic>Usp16</italic> gene dosage does not affect amyloid plaque burden, it ameliorates stem cell self-renewal defects that may be the earliest indication of pathology, as well as some of the cognitive defects in these mice that occur later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous studies have sought to target processes such as inflammation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and ROS to AD pathologies in both humans and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gjoneska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sevigny et al., 2016</xref>). The lack of robust efficacy in trials that utilize therapies directed against amyloid and inflammatory pathways, even when initiated relatively early in the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Selkoe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Imbimbo et al., 2010</xref>), suggests that other mechanisms are at play. If so, identification of these other disease mechanisms is needed to develop effective treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aisen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doody et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Group et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salloway et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>One of the primary findings in this study is that an NPC defect predates the development of measurable inflammation and amyloid plaque accumulation in a mutant <italic>APP</italic> model and that this defect is cell intrinsic. We further show this cell intrinsic NPC defect is reproduced in human fetal NPCs expressing <italic>APP</italic> Swedish and Indiana mutations, suggesting that our findings are translatable to other <italic>APP</italic> mutations and to human cells. The NPC defect that we discovered is partly regulated by <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, a central component of aging responsible for decreased neurogenesis and differentiation of NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdouh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molofsky et al., 2006</xref>). Because <italic>CDKN2A</italic> expression has been correlated with sporadic AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arendt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lüth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McShea et al., 1997</xref>) and targeting <italic>CDKN2A</italic> has shown benefit in improving age related and sporadic AD in models, we speculate our findings may have relevance for treatment of sporadic AD.</p><p>Current strategies to reverse neurogenesis defects include the use of drugs (‘senolytics’) that selectively remove p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-positive senescent cells. Removal of the p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-positive senescent cells, for instance, using a suicide gene under the regulation of the <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> promoter has been shown to attenuate progression of age-related decline and preserve cognitive function in both an accelerated aging AD mouse model and a tauopathy mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bussian et al., 2018</xref>). However, the use of a suicide gene is not directly translatable into humans, and other senolytics such as BCL2-inhibitors or the combination of Dasatinib and quercetin have toxicities which can limit their use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amaya-Montoya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we propose USP16 as a novel target that might circumvent many of the problems associated with <italic>CDKN2A</italic> inhibition or with senolytics’ treatment. When we inhibited USP16 by making Tg-SwDI mice haploinsufficient for <italic>Usp16</italic> (Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16<sup>+/-</sup></italic>), we found a rescue in the self-renewal of NPCs as early as 3 months of age. We also demonstrated a new role for USP16 in regulating the BMP pathway, a mechanism independent of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>. Previously, Gargiulo et al. found that self-renewal gene <italic>Bmi1</italic>, whose PRC1 activity is counterbalanced by USP16, represses BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gargiulo et al., 2013</xref>). NPCs from <italic>Bmi1</italic> knockout mice treated with BMP4 experience even further growth arrest than those untreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gargiulo et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Kwak, Lohuizen, and colleagues showed that treatment of human neural stem cells with secreted APPα or overexpression of <italic>APP</italic> promoted phosphorylation of SMAD 1/5/8 and induced massive glial differentiation (by expression of GFAP) through the BMP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwak et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, our results reveal expression of mutant <italic>APP</italic> in human fetal NPCs induced phosphorylation of SMAD 1/5/8 and reduced neurosphere colony formation that was rescued by a BMP receptor inhibitor. Importantly, our data extends their findings of astrogliosis to an in vivo mouse model of AD. Interestingly, BMI1 regulates both <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and the BMP pathway independently, and BMI1 expression was shown to be decreased in AD patients compared to age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flamier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The timing of therapeutic treatment in AD seems to be crucial as studies have shown that treating the disease too late has little efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sperling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yiannopoulou et al., 2019</xref>). The Tg-SwDI mice used in our study develop cognitive defects after the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques, a timeline which mimics that of humans with both dominantly inherited AD and late-onset sporadic AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bateman et al., 2012</xref>). In a study characterizing sporadic AD, for instance, Villemagne et al. used Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) to show that 31% of healthy control subjects had high PiB retention indicating Aß deposition and of these, 25% developed mild cognitive impairment or AD by 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Villemagne et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, studies such as those by Salloway et al. and Biogen’s EMERGE and ENGAGE trials found that treating the plaques alone did not rescue cognitive defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knopman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salloway et al., 2014</xref>). Although the mechanism for how mutant <italic>APP</italic> causes an NPC defect is outside the scope of this work, it has been postulated that amyloid-ß oligomers may impair neurogenesis and promote gliogenesis of human NPCs through the GSK-3ß pathway which unfortunately is not amenable to inhibition as it phosphorylates a variety of substrates and incurs large cytotoxic off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bernabeu-Zornoza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The translatability of our study therefore comes from observing that early therapeutic reduction of USP16 or BMP signaling in neural stem cells may reverse the neurogenic defect that may contribute to symptomatic AD later in life, especially if applied before cognitive deficits are present in the patient.</p><p>Understanding the pathophysiology of a disease is critical to developing therapeutic targets and designing intervening therapies. Here, we present USP16 as a potential therapeutic target acting on both BMP and <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> pathways independently. It is important to note that USP16 reduction also reduced astrocyte proliferation and restored cognitive function as measured by the NOR and Barnes Maze tests, independently of plaques and widespread inflammation. The increase in GFAP-expressing cells and impaired cognitive function seen in this AD model are purely attributable to mutant <italic>APP</italic> as Tg-SwDI mice do not develop neurofibrillary tangles that require mutations in tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilcock et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, therapeutic strategies that combine targeting USP16, which effectively rescue the mutant <italic>APP</italic>-induced cell intrinsic damage, with agents that target extracellular plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangles, and/or inflammation may improve treatments for AD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Behavior was recorded by an infrared-sensitive camera placed 2.5 m above the arena. Data were stored and analyzed using Videotrack software from ViewPoint Life Sciences, Inc (Montreal, Canada) allowing the tracking of body trajectory/speed and the detection of the nose position. On the day before NOR training, the mouse was habituated to the apparatus by freely exploring the open arena. NOR is based on the preference of mice for a novel object versus a familiar object when allowed to explore freely. For NOR training, two identical objects were placed into the arena and the animals were allowed to explore for 10 min. Testing occurred 24 hr later in the same arena but one of the familiar objects used during training was replaced by a novel object of similar dimensions, and the animal was allowed to explore freely for 7 min. The objects and the arena were cleaned with 10% ethanol between trials. Exploration of the objects was defined by the time spent with the nose in a 2.5 cm zone around the objects. The PI was calculated as the ratio of the time spent exploring the novel object over the total time spent exploring the two objects. The PI was calculated for each animal and averaged among the groups of mice by genotype. The PI should not be significantly different from 50% in the training session, but is significantly different if novelty is detected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Barnes maze</title><p>Another test of long-term memory that is indicative of spatial memory is the Barnes Maze similar to that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Attar et al., 2013</xref>. The Barnes maze is a 20-hole circular platform measuring 48&quot; in diameter with holes cut 1.75&quot; in diameter and 1&quot; from the edge. The platform is elevated 100 cm above the floor, and is located in the center of a room with many extra-maze and intra-maze visual cues. This task takes advantage of the natural preference of rodents for a dark environment. Motivated to escape the bright lights and the open-space of the platform, rodents search for an escape hole that leads to a dark box beneath the maze and with training they learn to use distal visual cues to determine the spatial location of the escape hole. A habituation day was followed by training over 2 days and a test day separated by 24 hr. Two downward-facing 150-watt incandescent light bulbs mounted overhead served as an aversive stimulus. Mice completed three phases of testing: habituation, training, and the probe test.</p><p>For habituation, mice were placed within the start cylinder in the middle of the maze to ensure random orientation for 15 s. The overhead lights were then turned on and mice were given 3 min to independently enter through the target hole into the escape cage. If a mouse did not enter the escape box freely, the experimenter coaxed the mouse to enter the escape box by touching the mouse’s tail.</p><p>For training, a mouse was placed in the middle of the maze in random orientation for 15 s. The overhead lights were turned on, and the tracking software was activated. The mouse was allowed up to 3 min to explore the maze and enter the escape hole. If it failed to enter within 3 min, it was gently guided to the escape hole using the start cylinder and allowed to enter the escape cage independently.</p><p>On the test/probe day, 24 hr after the last training day, the experiment was set up as described on training days, except the target hole was covered. The percent time in the correct zone and average proximity to the correct escape hole are more sensitive measures of memory than percentage visits to the correct hole. Therefore, during the probe phase, measures of time spent per quadrant and holes searched per quadrant were recorded. For these analyses, the maze was divided into quadrants consisting of five holes with the target hole in the center of the target quadrant. On day 4, latency (seconds) and path length (meters) to reach the target hole were measured. Number of pokes in each hole were calculated, time spent per quadrant and holes searched per quadrant were recorded and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare the percentage of time spent between quadrants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Differentiation</title><p>Neurospheres derived from the SVZ of 1-year-old mice were dissociated into single cells and 2000 cells were cultured per well on PDL and laminin-coated adherent 96-well cell culture plates (mouse neurospheres used for differentiation).

defect that precedes and appears to be independent of amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in an AD model. The authors show that targeting USP16, a BMI antagonist, can rescue some of these NSC deficits. Furthermore, scRNA-seq and GSEA points to the BMP pathway as a major player in regulating these phenotypes; in support of their hypothesis, the authors show that inhibition of BMP signaling using small molecules also rescues NSC defects. These are interesting and novel findings that will be of interest to the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66037.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM)</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>McEachin</surname><given-names>Zachary</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.12.21.383059">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.383059v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jessica Young as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zachary McEachin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general, the reviewers acknowledged the impact and novelty of the work, however concerns arose during the review process that should be addressed and/or sufficiently rebutted prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, one reviewer brought up several point where the data seem over-interpreted and the descriptions over-simplifed. I have therefore combined the reviewer comments into two sets of revisions, one set to be addressed experimentally and one set to be addressed in writing, both as rebuttals to the reviewers and as clarifications and descriptions in the manuscript text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Essential major points to be addressed experimentally prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1. Please show the NIC/neurosphere experiments the same way in each figure. In some figures there is a table of confidence intervals, in others a graph of log fraction nonresponding and in others representative images (Figure 3E). Or please explain why the representation is different clearly in the figure legend.</p><p>2. In Figure 2: Using the please show whether this is also changed in wild type (WT) cell with age. Please show BMI expression in the APP transgenic brain and Cdkn2a expression in WT and APP mut neurospheres. Please show GFAP expression in young APP transgenic mice. It seems very surprising that already one passage abolishes Bmi1 expression (Figure 2c), and it is unclear to me how that can be interpreted as a phenotype that “accompanies aging.” Please explain.</p><p>3. In Figure 6: Please show images of GFAP staining that are represented by the quantification</p><p>4. The authors’ conclusion that Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16</italic><sup>+/-</sup> rescues cognitive defects would be strengthened by additional cognition test (three chambered assay or Barnes or Morris water maze assays).</p><p>5. The authors report an initially increased proliferation of NPCs and downstream inflammatory consequences that they have measured by GFAP reactivity and astrogliosis. However, the authors have not addressed if the increased abundance of GFAP-reactive astrocytes is instead a general lineage increase in astrocytes derived from APP-mutant/over-proliferating NPCs. Could the astrocyte reactivity rate be the same in healthy animals and it is only because there are more cells generally in the fAD mouse that the authors detect this astrogliosis signature? To address this, some attempt to quantify lineage abundances by classic markers of astrocytes, neurons, and other cells differentiated from NPCs should be included, and another measure of astrocyte reactivity, like the recently reported CD49f, to supplement GFAP.</p><p>6. The study makes a very important observation in that they show that cognitive defects in an AD mouse model can be rescued independent of plaque load. However, <italic>Usp16</italic> reduction (Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) also did not rescue astrocyte over-abundance (which the authors interpret as neuroinflammation). I thus feel that additional immunohistochemical and behavioral experiments are needed to dissect late disease-related phenotypes in Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, and ideally also in LDN-treated mice, to be conclusive.</p><p>7. The authors elegantly use ELDA to test the “regenerative potential” of NSCs, and they suggest that an initial hyperproliferation is followed by exhaustion. However, some critical data seems to be missing to support this claim. Is neutrospheres formation increased at 1 month for example?</p><p>8. Did the authors check for any other signs of early hyperproliferation of NPCs such as SVZ thickness, general macrocephaly, etc.? Also, it remains to be determined by the authors at what stage/age hyperproliferation stops and stem cell exhaustion sets in.</p><p>9. When neutrospheres are transduced (not infected – this term is reserved for wildtype viruses), typically only the outside rim of cells become transgenic, and thus technical variation due to different sphere sizes could be a big issue. The assay (Figure 1E) should be better characterized regarding efficiency and variations to make it more convincing.</p><p>10. The authors suggest that extensive early proliferation decreases the stem cell pool in the SVZ, but they do not show data regarding the stem cell pool in 1-year-old Tg-SwDI mice. I feel an assessment of the SVZ stained for EdU, GFAP and <italic>SOX2</italic> should be performed at the 1-year time point, and preferentially also in the dentate gyrus to improve translatability at least to one other neural stem cell type.</p><p>11. The authors show pieces of data that lead to the conclusion that similarly reduced neurosphere numbers (Figure 2A/p6) indicate that an aging phenotype is “emulated.” Given the lack of further data comparing young and old (wt and Tg) in a rigorous manner, this statement seems overstated. In Figure 2E, it would help to interpret the age dependent nature of astrogliosis in the TgSwDI by including young animals in addition to old. Also, can the authors report neurosphere data in old mice as presented in Figure 3A/B/F?</p><p>12. In Figure 2B, it seems unclear why the authors have chosen the cortex only for this experiment. Another assay, such as a simple western blot or staining for markers for inflammation/microglial activation, would be helpful to support the interpretation.</p><p>13. The results of no increased inflammation in Figure 2F are surprising given the increased gliosis, and could be attributed to probes not included in the Luminex panel or insufficient sensitivity in the provided tissue. To address the latter, a positive control of known inflamed tissue should be included.</p><p>14. Although p16 knockdown can cause tumor formations in vivo, the authors do not have such limitations on in vitro experiments. As such, they should verify Cdkn2a’s direct involvement by specific knockdown with shRNAs and then perform neurosphere analysis.</p><p>15. The scRNAseq data are presented in a very lean manner and need more analysis. Can the authors show their scRNA data in a UMAP or tSNE plot, with cells labeled by aggregate expression of the pathways they have highlighted in Table 4? At a minimum, p-values and a volcano plot (or an appropriate alternative) of key genes should be included. Why are only gene sets presented and never individual genes? There could be some interesting changes looking at differential expression between single genes instead of aggregates of genes. With this data, the authors have an opportunity to examine the relationship between Cdkn2a and USP16 expression, do they see these more co-expression in the Tg mouse? Is there transcriptional evidence of the hyperproliferation? This dataset would also be useful to query for inflammatory markers in the NSCs.</p><p>16. In regard to the RNA-seq data: Can the authors please comment if there are other genes regulating cellular senescence that are differentially expressed? Is aberrant Cdkn2a expression replicated here?</p><p>Essential major points to be addressed in writing in the manuscript prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1. In the discussion: please comment on how this might relate to late-onset, sporadic AD which is not caused by mutations in APP. Especially as decreased neurogenesis is seen in SAD brains (PMID: 30911133)</p><p>2. Given that Bmi-1 expression is reduced in the Tg-SwDI mice (Figure 2D) and loss of Bmi-1 results in dramatic reduction of neurosphere size (Molofsky et al., 2005, Nature), is there a difference in the size (or shape) of neurospheres from wild type (WT) and Tg-SwDI mice?</p><p>3. Is an increase in NIC capacity a general result of Cdkna2a loss? Do WT/Cdkn2a-/- show similar or increased NIC capacity as WT at 3 months (Figure 3A)?</p><p>4. In the Tg-SwDI/<italic>Usp16</italic><sup>+/-</sup> is Bmi-1 expression changed (perhaps as a compensatory mechanism of <italic>Usp16</italic> loss). Could this explain the only partial rescue of NIC frequency (Figure 3F).</p><p>5. In Figure 5E, is this quantification from the ELDA assay or a different assay? If different, ELDA should be used to remain consistent.</p><p>6. While the authors show quantitative data of Thioflavin staining in Figure 6B, representative images should be included in figure or supplementary. Similarly, representative images of GFAP staining for Figure 6A should be included.</p><p>7. The authors should be more overall more critical with their own data, and explain what aspects of their model system are likely useful and can be translated to a human situation, and which ones are not. I would be very hesitant to commit to what extent the mouse SVZ relates to the human situation. A phenotype detected in a three to four-month-old transgenic mice might be translatable to early human development (fetal/early life), to adult neurogenesis in early AD pathology (late in life), or not directly translatable. Mouse and human NPCs are extremely different cells (see work from Conti L. et al., Sun et al., Elkabetz et al., etc…), and this is also eident from the data here (e.g. compare scales in Figure 1B and 1E). I suggest the authors to please avoid rushed over-interpretation.</p><p>8. It is not clear how the authors come to the conclusion that this “suggests that the self-renewal defect […] not specific to the Swedish, Dutch and Iowa mutations, but also more broadly seen with other APP mutations” (Figure 1E/p5). They did not test different expression/protein levels of WT, the individual mutations, or combinations, which would be necessary to make such a statement.</p><p>9. The attempt for assessing the effect of mutant APP on NPC phenotypes in the human system is a strength of this study. In Figure 1E/p5, the authors claim that “the effects observed in NPCs derived from a genetic mouse model can be robustly recapitulated in human NPCs expressing mutant APP.” As to the APP setting, both models are very different, in that human cells possess two copies of endogenous APP. “Fetal human NPCs” are not very well defined, an no characterization of endogenous/transgenic APP expression/protein levels are provided here. The choice of this models seems suboptimal. Also, to draw meaningful conclusions, the effect should be tested on different genetic backgrounds and well-characterized NPCs (e.g. from APP-mutant iPSCs). The conclusion that the “effects observed in NPCs derived from a genetic mouse model can be robustly recapitulated in human NPCs” is thus not appropriate and probably vastly oversimplified.</p><p>10. The authors show that the neurosphere phenotype of NPCs of 3-month-old mice that was rescued by Cdkn2a-KO. This is followed by the statement (line158) that APP mutations accelerate aging through Cdkn2a. In the context pf the presented data, this is a prominent overstatement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, the data supports the conclusions and I think this work brings several novel aspects to the field.

Interestingly, the described phenotypes, that comprise early stem cell exhaustion followed by impaired self-renewal, clearly pre-date later inflammatory, neurodegenerative classically features typically described as disease-related in mouse models. They next position Cdkn2a and BmiI at the mechanistic core of this early NPC phenotype, and present USP16 and BMP inhibition as potential therapeutic targets. The manuscript is overall well-written and figures are clear and understandable. A particular strength of the manuscript is the dogma-free approach and the general frame of the study is highly innovative, relevant and interesting. However, the authors make several assumptions that are not sufficiently backed-up by the data, and overall appear to be drawn to large overinterpretations, which have dampened this reviewer’s initial enthusiasm. Also, the manuscript reads in a way that even the authors themselves have not really decided what role they think Cdkn2a is playing here, and thus in the end it simply appears as a gene that can inhibit cell proliferation, of which they detect more in the Tg AD mouse model, and the reader is left with the feeling that probably anti-proliferative perturbation would have done the job. Further, the authors’ schematic hints at that Cdkn2a is involved in the astrogliosis process, but the current manuscript fails to present any solid data supporting that claim. Below I have listed several major points that render the paper inappropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. My points are intended to help the authors improve their manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but I currently feel that this would take some tremendous effort to address my points with new and conclusive experimental data.</p><p>1.

To further investigate reactive astrogliosis and to quantify numbers of astrocytes we performed a number of studies, including qPCR of known markers of reactive astrocytes (A1 astrocytes) vs non-reactive A2 astrocytes (Zamanian et al., 2012), microarray, and differentiation studies. In the cortex of one year old Tg-SwDI mice, there was not a significant increase in A1 astrocyte markers (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2). However, using a microarray of 2 year old mice, and analyzing the same A1 and A2 astrocyte markers, we did see an increase in the A1 astrocytic markers as seen in Figure 2 —figure supplement 4, suggesting there is eventually reactive astrogliosis but further aging is required. Additionally, we placed neurospheres derived from the SVZ of Tg-SwDI mice and WT controls into differentiation conditions and analyzed the number of GFAP positive cells following differentiation (included in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). We found that cells derived from Tg-SwDI mice formed more GFAP-positive cells than those derived from wild-type controls, suggesting at least an increase in production of astrocytes when controlling for total number of cells. All these data taken together suggest that in mutant Tg-SwDI mice, there are more astrocytes produced and that these astrocytes become reactive with aging.</p><p>The reviewer points out using CD49f as another measure of astrocyte reactivity to supplement GFAP. This marker was recently reported by Barber et al. as a “…reactivity-independent marker (expressed in both unstimulated and reactive astrocytes)…”. (Barbar et al., 2020) Thus, CD49f is a novel marker shown to be useful in identification and isolation of human and iPSC-derived astrocytes that can be stimulated to become A1-like reactive astrocytes.

Did the authors check for any other signs of early hyperproliferation of NPCs such as SVZ thickness, general macrocephaly, etc.?

As shown in the response to number 7, we do not see differences in stem cell frequencies at 1 month old, but as the manuscript shows, this difference is evident at 3 months old (Figure 1B) alongside increased proliferation (Figure 1A). We no longer see differences in proliferation at 1 year old (Figure 2A), yet we continue to see decreased stem cell frequencies in cells derived from the Tg-SwDI subventricular zone (Figure 2B). Taken together, hyperproliferation extends through stem cell exhaustion, ending by approximately 1 year of age. This is not unexpected as we know that hyperproliferation and stem cell exhaustion are dynamic processes that occur over time, thus there is not necessarily a time at which one would see that hyperproliferation abruptly ends and stem cell exhaustion begins, as they are occurring simultaneously (Molofsky et al., 2003). We have updated Figure 6D to reflect this timeline.</p><p>Moreover, we performed MRI and MRS (Magnetic resonance spectroscopy), typically used to diagnose AD in patients, on our mouse models. In particular, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a window into the biochemical changes associated with the loss of neuronal integrity that involve the brain before the manifestations of cognitive impairment in patients who are at risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Given that our Alzheimer’s mouse model, at least anatomically, does not present the same macroscopic neurodegeneration observed in patients, we sought to take advantage of MRS techniques to investigate the biochemical changes and neurodegeneration that usually appear before anatomical manifestations. We analyzed 18-22 month old mice by MRS and normalized each metabolite’s expression by the “sum of metabolites” (data were comparable when normalization was done by Creatinine). As it is possible to observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>, we did not observe any metabolic differences between the genotypes.

We tested <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> expression in three different regions of the brain in 2 year old mice as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref> (n=6): SVZ, DG, and Cortex (p value between WT and Tg-SwDI DG is 0.05; p value between WT and Tg-SwDI Cortex is 0.015).

The scRNAseq data are presented in a very lean manner and need more analysis. Can the authors show their scRNA data in a UMAP or tSNE plot, with cells labeled by aggregate expression of the pathways they have highlighted in Table 4? At a minimum, p-values and a volcano plot (or an appropriate alternative) of key genes should be included. Why are only gene sets presented and never individual genes? There could be some interesting changes looking at differential expression between single genes instead of aggregates of genes. With this data, the authors have an opportunity to examine the relationship between Cdkn2a and USP16 expression, do they see these more co-expression in the Tg mouse? Is there transcriptional evidence of the hyperproliferation? This dataset would also be useful to query for inflammatory markers in the NSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted a more thorough analysis of the data and present two additional supplementary figures addressing the reviewer’s points that show the appropriate tSNE (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1) and volcano plots (Figure 4 —figure supplement 4) with additional panels of hyperproliferation (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3) and inflammatory markers (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). The volcano plot actually bolsters our original argument that looking at gene sets is far more ideal than looking at individual genes. Oftentimes, when we are looking at individual differentially expressed genes, it can be difficult to choose which ones to pursue in a therapeutic context. The nature of GSEA is to highlight groups of genes that are significantly enriched and related in the same pathway (which can be more easily targeted), rather than to find individual genes that are significantly enriched. Furthermore, it may be difficult to see whether individual genes that are upregulated or downregulated are due to a compensatory effect rather than contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease. With regards to <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, neither the 3-4 month old or 1 year old WT and Tg-SwDI expressed this gene in at least 1% of cells at a minimum logFC of 0.01. While there were no significant differences in expression between 3-4 month old and 1 year old Tg-SwDI and WT mice for either <italic>Bmi1</italic> or <italic>Usp16</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig8">Author response image 8</xref>) using a Wilcoxon rank Sum test for differential gene expression, we did see a mild upregulation in expression of both genes in Tg-SwDI mice compared to WT with greater expression of <italic>Usp16</italic> over <italic>Bmi1</italic> at both ages.

A possible explanation for this result could be that we were selecting for a cell population (within the SVZ) that itself does not exhibit inflammation at either time point. Finally, while we were able to survey several proliferation and cell-cycle related genes, only a few were differentially expressed. We include these in the same supplementary figures (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3).

Bateman et al., conducted a study with 128 AD mutation carriers and found that Aß<sub>42</sub> concentrations in the CSF declined 25 years before expected symptom onset (estimated as patient’s age at onset) while Aß deposition as measured by PET scans with the use of Pittsburgh compound B was detected 15 years before expected symptom onset (Bateman et al., 2012). These same carriers did not have significant differences in mini-mental state examination scores until 5 years before expected symptom onset or significant differences in the logical memory test until 10 years before expected symptom onset (Bateman et al., 2012).</p><p>In another study characterizing sporadic AD, Villemagne et al. 2012 also used Pittsburgh compound B PET studies to study those with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-matched healthy controls (Villemagne et al., 2011). At baseline, 31% of healthy control subjects showed high PiB retention indicating Aß deposition and of these, 16% developed MCI or DAT by 20 months and 25% by 3 years (Villemagne et al., 2011). A similar study by Morris et al. 2009 also found that in a study of 159 participants, the mean cortical binding potential for PiB assessed with PET was also a significant predictor of progression from cognitive normality to DAT (Morris et al., 2009). Furthermore, studies such as those by Salloway et al. 2014 found that treating the plaques alone did not rescue cognitive defects (Salloway et al., 2014).</p><p>All of these studies highlight the clinical similarities of late-onset sporadic AD and the importance of early therapeutic intervention, and our work reveals a new avenue of therapeutic approach that could apply to both sporadic and familial AD based on their shared features, though confirmatory studies in humans must be pursued to confirm this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We therefore opted to perform a colony assay instead which allowed us to effectively observe differences when testing different concentrations on wild type and mutant APP neurospheres and also allowed us to accurately dose the neurospheres.

The authors should be more overall more critical with their own data, and explain what aspects of their model system are likely useful and can be translated to a human situation, and which ones are not. I would be very hesitant to commit to what extent the mouse SVZ relates to the human situation. A phenotype detected in a 3-4 months-old transgenic mice might be translatable to early human development (fetal/early life), to adult neurogenesis in early AD pathology (late in life), or not directly translatable. Mouse and human NPCs are extremely different cells (see work from Conti L. et al., Sun et al., Elkabetz et al., etc…), and this is also eident from the data here (e.g. compare scales in Figure 1B and 1E).

The timing of therapeutic treatment in Alzheimer’s disease seems to be crucial as studies have shown that treating the disease too late has little efficacy (Sperling et al., 2011; Yiannopoulou, Anastasiou, Zachariou, and Pelidou, 2019). We therefore hypothesize that when plaques are first visible in the patient, therapeutic reduction of <italic>Usp16</italic> or BMP signaling may reduce the defect contributing to symptomatic AD later on in life, as seen in our mouse model.

In this study, it would not be particularly useful to compare levels of expressed <italic>APP</italic> in WT and transgenic mice as a human transgene is required in this disease model; mutations in the endogenous mouse <italic>App</italic> gene do not produce clinical disease. However, we did test different expression levels of endogenous and mutant APP in both the human and murine cells, which are shown in response to reviewer point #9 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The attempt for assessing the effect of mutant APP on NPC phenotypes in the human system is a strength of this study. In Figure 1E/p5 the authors claim that &quot;the effects observed in NPCs derived from a genetic mouse model can be robustly recapitulated in human NPCs expressing mutant APP&quot;. As to the APP setting, both models are very different, in that human cells possess two copies of endogenous APP. &quot;Fetal human NPCs&quot; are not very well defined, an no characterization of endogenous/transgenic APP expression/protein levels are provided here. The choice of this models seems suboptimal. Also, to draw meaningful conclusions, the effect should be tested on different genetic backgrounds and well-characterized NPCs (e.g. from APP-mutant iPSCs). The conclusion that the &quot;effects observed in NPCs derived from a genetic mouse model can be robustly recapitulated in human NPCs&quot; is thus not appropriate and probably vastly oversimplified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our conclusion is oversimplified so we have appropriately corrected our choice of words to describe these results in our text. In selecting a human model, we wanted to choose primary cells that were easily available to us and would limit other potential sources of variation (such as different genetic backgrounds). As the reviewer stated, one strength of this study is our attempt to show effect of mutant APP on NPC phenotype. The transduction of the human fetal NPCs with either ZsGreen or mutant APP narrows down the phenotypes we see to solely the effects of the mutant APP. To further characterize our system, we show in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 that three different transductions of human fetal NPCs have resulted in at least a 2 fold increase in <italic>APP</italic> expression in neurospheres compared to ZsGreen controls.</p><p>To provide a characterization of mutant APP in our mouse model, we can turn to our sc-RNA-seq data where we conducted a differential expression gene test and found an ~1.5 fold change between our Tg-SwDI and WT cells in both transgenic (labeled “APPSDI”) and endogenous <italic>App</italic> expression (also shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). Our conclusion can thus be amended to say that the decrease in neurosphere formation in NPCs derived from our genetic mouse model has also been observed in our human fetal model with roughly the same fold increase in mutant APP expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors show that the neurosphere phenotype of NPCs of 3-month-old mice that was rescued by Cdkn2a-KO. This is followed by the statement (line158) that APP mutations accelerate aging through Cdkn2a. In the context pf the presented data, this is a prominent overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the manuscript to more accurately depict our findings, and the text now reads, “These results demonstrate that impairment of NPC regeneration, as measured by NIC frequencies, is a function of aging that is accelerated by <italic>APP</italic> mutations and is mitigated through loss of <italic>Cdkn2a…”</italic></p><p>References:</p><p>Barbar, L., Jain, T., Zimmer, M., Kruglikov, I., Sadick, J.
