is a prevalent systemic autoimmune disease, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Animal models suggest a role for intestinal bacteria in supporting the systemic immune response required for joint inflammation.

We also identified unique <italic>Prevotella</italic> genes that correlated with disease. Further, colonization of mice revealed the ability of <italic>P. copri</italic> to dominate the intestinal microbiota and resulted in an increased sensitivity to chemically induced colitis.

Indeed, estimates suggest that our bodies contain 10 times as many microbial cells as human cells. Our stomach and intestines alone are home to many hundreds and possibly thousands of microbial species that break down indigestible compounds and help to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. The immune system must therefore learn to tolerate these microorganisms, while retaining the ability to launch attacks against microorganisms that cause harm. Failure of this process may increase the risk of autoimmune diseases in which the body mistakenly attacks its own cells and tissues.</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease marked by inflammation of the joints. Although the causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown, mice with mutations that increase the risk of the disease remain healthy if they are kept under sterile conditions. However, if these mice are exposed to certain species of bacteria sometimes found in the gut, they begin to show signs of joint inflammation.</p><p>Here, Scher et al. used genome sequencing to compare gut bacteria from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls. A bacterial species called <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> was more abundant in patients suffering from untreated rheumatoid arthritis than in healthy individuals. Moreover, the presence of <italic>P. copri</italic> corresponded to a reduction in the abundance of other bacterial groups—including a number of beneficial microbes. In a mouse model of gut inflammation, animals colonized with <italic>P. copri</italic> had more severe disease than controls, consistent with a pro-inflammatory function of this organism.</p><p>Current treatments for rheumatoid arthritis target symptoms.

If left untreated, RA can lead to chronic joint deformity, disability, and increased mortality. Despite recent advances towards understanding its pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mcinnes and Schett, 2011</xref>), the etiology of RA remains elusive. Many genetic susceptibility risk alleles have been discovered and validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stahl et al., 2010</xref>) but are insufficient to explain disease incidence. RA is therefore a complex (multifactorial) disease requiring both environmental and genetic factors for onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mcinnes and Schett, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Among environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota has emerged as a possible candidate responsible for the priming of aberrant systemic immunity in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scher and Abramson, 2011</xref>). The microbiota encompasses hundreds of bacterial species whose products represent an enormous antigenic burden that must largely be compartmentalized to prevent immune system activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Littman and Pamer, 2011</xref>). In the healthy state, intestinal lamina propria cells of both innate and adaptive immune systems cooperate to maintain physiological homeostasis. In RA, there is increased production of both self-reactive antibodies and pro-inflammatory T lymphocytes. Although mechanisms for targeting of synovium by inflammatory cells have not been fully elucidated, studies in animal models suggest that both T cell and antibody responses are involved in arthritogenesis. Moreover, an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbiota can alter local T-cell responses and modulate systemic inflammation. Mice rendered deficient for the microbiota (germ-free) lack pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a commensal microbe commonly found in mammals, is sufficient to induce accumulation of Th17 cells in the lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sczesnak et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In several animal models of arthritis, mice are persistently healthy when raised in germ-free conditions. However, the introduction of specific gut bacterial species is sufficient to induce joint inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rath et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdollahi-Roodsaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), and antibiotic treatment both prevents and abrogates a rheumatoid arthritis-like phenotype in several mouse models. Upon mono-colonization of arthritis-prone K/BxN mice with SFB, the induced Th17 cells potentiate inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). An imbalance in intestinal microbial ecology, in which SFB is dominant, may result in reduced proportions or functions of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg) and a predisposition towards autoimmunity. This appears to affect not only the local immune response, but also systemic inflammatory processes, and may explain, at least in part, reduced Treg cell function in RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zanin-Zhorov et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, T cells whose functions are dictated by intestinal commensal bacteria can be effectors of pathogenesis in tissue-specific autoimmune disease.</p><p>Although recent studies of the human microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) have characterized the composition and diversity of the healthy gut microbiome, and disease-associated studies revealed correlations between taxonomic abundance and some clinical phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), a role for distinct microbial taxa and metagenomic markers in systemic inflammatory disease has not been defined. While treatment with antibiotics has been a therapeutic modality in RA for decades, no microbial organism has been shown to be associated with the disease. Based on the discovery that SFB-induced Th17 cells directly contribute to the onset of arthritis in gnotobiotic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), we analyzed the fecal microbiota in patients with RA. We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to classify the microbiota in patients with new-onset (untreated) RA, chronic (treated) RA, psoriatic arthritis, and age- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. We found a marked association of <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> with new-onset RA (NORA) patients and not with other patient groups. Shotgun sequencing of the microbiome indicated that some <italic>P. copri</italic> genes are differentially present in NORA-associated and healthy samples. Colonization of mice with <italic>P. copri</italic> enhanced susceptibility to chemical colitis, consistent with a pro-inflammatory potential of this organism. Taken together, our results suggest that NORA-associated <italic>P. copri</italic> may contribute to the pathogenesis of human arthritis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Association of <italic>Prevotella</italic> with new-onset rheumatoid arthritis</title><p>To determine if particular bacterial clades are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, we performed sequencing of the 16S gene (regions V1–V2, 454 platform) on 114 fecal DNA samples—44 samples collected from NORA patients at time of initial diagnosis and prior to immunosuppressive treatment, 26 samples from patients with chronic, treated rheumatoid arthritis (CRA), 16 samples from patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 28 samples from healthy controls (HLT) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Sequences were analyzed with MOTHUR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schloss et al., 2009</xref>) to cluster operational taxonomic units (OTUs, species level classification) at a 97% identity threshold, assign taxonomic identifiers, and calculate clade relative abundances. Although PsA patients revealed a reduction in sample diversity similar to that of IBD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 2012</xref>), diversity was comparable between NORA, CRA and healthy groups at 3.02 +/− 0.66 (mean, SD) overall by Shannon Diversity Index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, when applying Simpson’s Dominance Index, the NORA group was less diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that these patients harbored a relatively higher abundance of common taxa. Analysis at the major taxonomic hierarchy levels showed no significant differences in either phyla abundance or the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) between all groups. At the level of family abundances, however, we noted a significant enrichment of Prevotellaceae in NORA subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using the linear discriminant effect size method (LEfSe, see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Segata et al., 2011</xref>) to compare detected clades (33 families, 177 genera, 996 OTUs) among all groups, we found a positive association of two specific <italic>Prevotella</italic> OTUs with NORA and an inverse correlation with Group XIV Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> as compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of all detected Prevotellaceae OTUs, OTU4 was the most highly represented with 171,486 supporting reads at 11.49 +/− 17.85 (mean, SD) percent of reads per sample. OTU12, the next most abundant Prevotellaceae, was supported by 12,119 reads at 2.00 +/− 5.42 (mean, SD) percent of reads per sample. Other Prevotellaceae OTUs (including <italic>Prevotella</italic> OTU934) were more scarcely represented with 1,232 +/− 2,305 (mean, SD) total supporting reads at less than 0.5% total reads per sample. We therefore reasoned that OTU4 was the dominant <italic>Prevotella</italic> in our cohort with sixfold more supporting reads than the next most abundant OTU.

This observation suggested that the presence or absence of particular genes in these strains might correlate with health or disease phenotypes in this cohort. To address this question, we performed shotgun sequencing on fecal DNA from NORA and healthy subjects, and chose to compare <italic>Prevotella</italic> sequences from 18 NORA <italic>Prevotella-</italic>positive subjects, which allowed for a depth of at least 7 M <italic>Prevotella-</italic>aligned reads (paired-end, 100 nt, Illumina platform), to those of <italic>P. copri</italic> from 17 healthy subjects (including 15 from the HMP database and 2 HLT from our cohort) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

Overall, coverage was similar between healthy and NORA subjects in all but a few regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, blue and red horizontal lines). Eight regions were poorly covered in all subjects with mean coverage below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of 0.79 FPKM, while several regions showed substantial variability between individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, gray vertical lines). To determine if the presence or absence of these regions within individuals was consistent between samplings, we applied MetaPhlAn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segata et al., 2012</xref>) to <italic>Prevotella</italic>-positive HMP samples collected over multiple visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Briefly, MetaPhlAn determines the presence or absence of metagenomic marker genes that are specific to particular bacterial clades by analyzing the coverage of such genes by sequenced reads. Genes are called specific for a bacterial clade if they are not found in any reference genomes outside the clade, but are found in all such genomes within the clade. In concordance with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schloissnig et al., 2013</xref>) documenting the temporal stability of metagenomic SNP patterns in individuals, we found that carriage of <italic>P. copri</italic> genes within an individual varied little between samplings. In addition to a stable set of <italic>P. copri</italic> core marker genes common to all samples, a subset of variable marker genes was observed to co-occur in islands across the <italic>P. copri</italic> genome, suggesting genomic rearrangements as a mechanism of variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, blue boxes below plot).

Notably, there is a prolonged period of autoimmunity (i.e., presence of circulating auto-antibodies such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies) in a pre-clinical state that lasts many years, during which time there is no clinical or histologic evidence of inflammatory arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deane et al., 2010</xref>). Before the onset of clinical disease, there is an increase in autoantibody titers and epitope spreading coupled with elevation in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings have led to the ‘second-event’ hypothesis in RA, which proposes that an environmental factor triggers systemic joint inflammation in the context of pre-existent autoimmunity. Multiple mucosal sites and their residing microbial communities have been implicated, including the airways, the periodontal tissue and the intestinal lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mcinnes and Schett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scher et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although a role for the gut microbiota has been clearly established in animal models of arthritis, it is not known if dysbiosis influences human RA. The human gut microbiota has been classified into unique enterotypes, one of which is defined by the predominance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>). In our cohort, we found the microbiota of many subjects to be defined by a single taxon—<italic>P. copri</italic>—which was associated with the majority of untreated, new-onset rheumatoid arthritis (NORA) patients. <italic>P. copri</italic> was also detected in a minority of healthy subjects in cohorts from the Human Microbiome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</xref>), the European MetaHIT project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2010</xref>), and our study. Surprisingly, the prevalence of <italic>P. copri</italic> in chronic rheumatoid arthritis (CRA) patients, all of whom had been treated and exhibited reduced disease activity, was similar to that observed in the healthy subjects. One hypothesis is that the <italic>Prevotella-</italic>defined microbiota fail to thrive when there is less inflammation, perhaps due to a lack of inflammation-derived terminal electron acceptors, as seen for <italic>E. coli</italic> in inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winter et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the gut microbiota changes observed in newly diagnosed RA patients may be the consequence of a unique, NORA-specific systemic inflammatory response. While DAS28 scores were slightly lower in CRA and PsA patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the most remarkable difference was in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). This raises the question of whether CRP itself may have microbial modulating properties. CRP is characteristically high in early and flaring RA, but not in other autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematous, scleroderma, and PsA). A member of the pentraxin protein family, CRP was first identified in the plasma of patients with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tillett and Francis, 1930</xref>). Further, the primary bacterial ligand for CRP is phosphocholine, a component of multiple bacterial cell-wall components, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS). CRP binding to bacterial phosphocholine activates the complement system and enhances phagocytosis by macrophages. Whether or not CRP itself represents a specific response to the presence of <italic>P. copri</italic> in NORA is an area of future investigation. Interestingly, <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated healthy omnivore individuals were recently reported to have increased basal levels of serum TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a product of inflammation linked to atherogenesis, compared to <italic>Bacteroides</italic>-dominated healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koeth et al., 2013</xref>). While TMAO could be derived from increased consumption of meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koeth et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Prevotella</italic> has been previously associated with a dearth of meat in the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Additional studies are needed to determine if prevalence of <italic>P. copri</italic> in the microbiota is associated with changes in specific metabolites.</p><p>Sequence alignment most closely linked NORA-associated <italic>Prevotella</italic> with the <italic>P. copri</italic> genome. Interestingly, large regions of the <italic>P. copri</italic> genome were scarcely covered in both our cohort and subjects of the HMP. As the reference strain of <italic>P. copri</italic> was isolated in Japan and all samples analyzed in our study were collected and sequenced in North America, these differences may reflect geographically-associated strain variability, consistent with a report ranking <italic>P. copri</italic> as the second-most variable member of the human gut microbiota between continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schloissnig et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, comparison of sequences in NORA samples with those of <italic>P. copri</italic>-dominated healthy individuals evaluated in the HMP allowed us to identify ORFs associated with the NORA phenotype. Two ORFs, both encoding components of an iron transporter, were specific for NORA-associated <italic>P. copri</italic>, while two ORFs were specific for HLT-associated <italic>P. copri</italic> and encode components of a <italic>nuo</italic> operon. Iron transporters are known to be virulence factors in other bacterial clades, while the ubiquinone oxidoreductase pathway encoded by the <italic>nuo</italic> operon may provide a fitness advantage in the context of a healthy microbiome by allowing use of metabolites available therein. While colonization with <italic>P. copri</italic> increases the pre-test probability of NORA from 1% to approximately 3.95% in western cohorts (by Bayes’ theorem, see ‘Materials and methods’), the presence of one of the aforementioned ORFs may markedly increase the pre-test probability of NORA status. The diagnostic application of these biomarkers needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts.</p><p>Analysis of enzymatic functions in the <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated metagenome reveals a significant decrease in purine metabolic pathways, including tetrahydrofolate (THF) biosynthesis. This may have therapeutic implications since methotrexate (MTX), a folate analogue and a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2012</xref>) and has inter-individual variability in terms of absorption and bioavailability. The THF biosynthetic pathway encoded by the gut metagenome, which includes a DHF reductase enzyme, may compete with host DHF reductase for MTX binding and metabolism. If so, an increase in DHF reductase-high microbiota in some RA subjects (i.e., <italic>Bacteroides</italic> overabundant) may help explain, at least partially, why only about half of RA patients respond adequately to oral MTX, ultimately requiring either parenteral administration or the addition of complementary immunosuppressants. <italic>Prevotella</italic>-high NORA subjects, with a dearth of DHF reductase in the gut, may respond better to oral MTX. Prospective human studies should help to clarify these observations.</p><p>RA is a multifactorial autoimmune disease in which certain alleles within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II locus, specifically those belonging to DRB1 (i.e., shared epitope alleles), confer higher risk for disease. A recently published study with HLA-DR transgenic mice revealed that the gut microbiota was, at least partially, regulated by the HLA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez et al., 2012</xref>). Arthritis-susceptible DRB1*04:01 transgenic mice had a markedly different intestinal microbiota when compared to arthritis-resistant DRB1*04:02 animals, and this was associated with altered mucosal immune function (i.e., increased gene transcripts for Th17-related cytokines) and increased intestinal permeability. Our results suggest that, similarly, SE risk-alleles in humans may have an impact on the composition of the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, patients in the NORA cohort showed a significant inverse correlation between <italic>P. copri</italic> relative abundance and presence of SE alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is therefore possible that, as in mice, certain human gut microbial communities are determined by specific MHC alleles that favor the expansion of particular species. As in the case of cigarette smoking, this could also represent a gene-environment interaction that contributes to RA pathogenesis. It is conceivable that a certain threshold for <italic>P. copri</italic> abundance may be necessary to overcome the lack of genetic predisposition in RA subjects, while a lower abundance may be sufficient to trigger disease in those carrying risk-alleles. Validation in expanded cohorts and mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the significance of these findings.</p><p>Colonization of mice with <italic>P. copri</italic> recapitulated the differences in relative abundances of <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> previously reported in humans, and confirmed the ability of <italic>P. copri</italic> to dominate the colonic commensal microbiota in the absence of apparent disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faust et al., 2012</xref>). This shift in abundances correlated with a metagenomic shift, which may support and/or perpetuate an inflammatory environment. For example, uniquely present superoxide reductase in <italic>P. copri</italic> may facilitate resistance to or allow the use of host-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during inflammation, perhaps as terminal electron acceptors for respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winter et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>P. copri</italic> genome encodes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase (PAPS), an oxidoreductase absent in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> that participates in sulfur metabolism and leads to the production of thioredoxin. Intriguingly, thioredoxin has been widely implicated in the pathogenesis of RA and high levels of this redox protein have been found in both serum and synovial fluid of RA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maurice et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Mice colonized with <italic>P. copri</italic> displayed increased inflammation in DSS-induced colitis. An appealing hypothesis from an evolutionary and ecological perspective is that the <italic>P. copri</italic>-defined microbiota thrives in a pro-inflammatory environment and may exacerbate inflammation for its own benefit. Another key feature of the <italic>P. copri-</italic>dominated microbiome is a community shift away from <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, Group XIV Clostridia, <italic>Blautia</italic>, and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> clades, previously reported to be associated with an anti-inflammatory state and regulatory T-cell (Treg) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atarashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Round et al., 2011</xref>). This could account, in part, for the observed differences in susceptibility to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tao et al., 2011</xref>). Further characterization of changes in the host immune system associated with a <italic>Prevotella</italic>-dominated microbiota should provide deeper insight into whether expansion of <italic>P. copri</italic> contributes causally to the development of autoimmunity in early onset RA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study participants</title><p>Consecutive patients from the New York University rheumatology clinics and offices were screened for the presence of RA.

Sequences shorter than 200 bp, containing undetermined bases or homopolymer stretches longer than 8 bp, with no exact match to the forward primer or a barcode, or that did not align with the appropriate 16S rRNA variable region were not included in the analysis. Using the 454 base quality scores, which range from 0–40 (0 being an ambiguous base), sequences were trimmed using a sliding-window technique, such that the minimum average quality score over a window of 50 bases never dropped below 30.

Vectors resulting from the comparison of abundances (e.g., <italic>Prevotella</italic> relative abundance) between groups are used as input to linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which produces an effect size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In analyses performed here, the main utility of LEfSe over traditional statistical tests is that an effect size is produced in addition to a p or q value. This allows us to sort the results of multiple tests by the magnitude of the difference between groups, not only by q values, as the two are not necessarily correlated. In the case of hierarchically organized groups (e.g., bacterial clades, or KEGG pathways), this lack of correlation can arise from differences in the number of hypotheses considered at different levels in the hierarchy. For example, at the genus level, there may be 1,000 tests performed, requiring a high level of significance to pass multiple testing correction, whereas at the phylum level, only 10 tests may be performed, requiring a less stringent threshold for significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Processing of Illumina reads</title><p>Paired-end reads 100 bp in length were trimmed from both ends to yield the largest contiguous segment where all per-base QVs were &gt;= 25.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Diane Mathis, Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have now received the three reviewers' comments on your manuscript “<italic>Prevotella copri</italic> defines a metagenomic enterotype that correlates with enhanced susceptibility to arthritis”. The reviewers all agreed that the manuscript is very interesting and potentially important. They also concurred that the data on mouse models are weak, primarily due to their marginal/questionable significance (see detailed comments below). The human data are rather more convincing, but would be improved by additional bioinformatic analyses (detailed below). Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version that eliminates the mouse data and addresses the following issues:</p><p>1) The Introduction could be shortened, especially the discussion on Th17 cells, since the mechanistic studies showing that <italic>Prevotella</italic> specifically regulates Th17 cells are not conclusive. Also, human data on the role of IL-17 is really only robust for psoriasis, not RA or IBD.</p><p>2) The presentation is a bit unfocused. A large part of the paper involves genomic analyses that do not advance the main story. If the goal was to determine why <italic>P. copri</italic> increases in arthritis patients, there is very little in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2–4</xref> or the main text to convincingly suggest a specific answer. These “side experiments” distract from the more central question as to the putative mechanism linking <italic>P. copri</italic> to disease.</p><p>3) The paper also suffers from scientific jargon. For example, use of the word “enterotype” in the title and text is quite different from its original application in the MetaHIT paper. We would recommend removing this word given recent concerns about the methodology used in the original studies (Wu et al., Science 2011; Koren et al., PLoS Comp Biol 2013), the inconsistent usage of this term in the field, the lack of any quantitative enterotype clustering in the current paper, and the focus of this study on <italic>P. copri</italic> instead of more general patterns in community structure. Other more minor offenders are “high-throughput 16S”, “dysbiotic”, and “clade diversity”.</p><p>4) The main text states that “NORA and healthy subjects form distinct clusters” based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. This is clearly not the case, as the NORA subjects (stars) and healthy controls (circles) are distributed across the entire graph. A more accurate statement would be that samples cluster by <italic>Prevotella</italic> abundance irrespective of disease phenotype.</p><p>5) The prevalence of OTU4 in patients and controls is a key finding that is mentioned in the Abstract. This should be expanded upon and appropriate statistical tests need to be included.</p><p>6) The observation that “<italic>P. copri</italic> strains vary between individuals and retain their individuality over time” seems like an important point, especially in light of other recent findings (e.g., Faith et al. Science 2013). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> seems to qualitatively support this point, but no statistical testing is done. Are there quantitative and significant differences between individuals? What controls were done?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>: These groups don't hold up to multiple hypotheses so this panel and Table S3 should be removed.</p><p>8) The methotrexate discussion, albeit speculative, is really fascinating and a clearly novel aspect of this work. Are there any correlations with methotrexate usage and Bacteroides abundance? Any differences in efficacy?

We have now made changes and edits accordingly. Overall, we agree that ours represents an initial step to characterize a unique microbiome profile in human RA. Our study revealed a strong association of <italic>P. copri</italic> with RA, that, along with our metagenomic findings, should set the stage for future broader human studies (for replication and validation purposes) and, concomitantly, for mechanistic experiments aimed at gaining insights to address possible causation.</p><p><italic>1) The Introduction could be shortened, especially the discussion on Th17 cells, since the mechanistic studies showing that</italic> Prevotella <italic>specifically regulates Th17 cells are not conclusive. Also, human data on the role of IL-17 is really only robust for psoriasis, not RA or IBD</italic>.</p><p>The Introduction has been shortened as requested, especially the paragraph detailing the role of Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria. However, we feel that some reference to T cells is necessary for the reader to understand the background leading up to the experiments that we report here. Specifically, the report that a single intestinal microbial commensal—SFB—can induce spontaneous arthritis in a germ-free mouse model through activation of lamina propria and peripheral Th17 cells served as the inspiration to look for a similar microbe and mechanism in humans.</p><p><italic>2) The presentation is a bit unfocused. A large part of the paper involves genomic analyses that do not advance the main story. If the goal was to determine why</italic> P. copri <italic>increases in arthritis patients, there is very little in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4"><italic>Figures 2–4</italic></xref> <italic>or the main text to convincingly suggest a specific answer. These “side experiments” distract from the more central question as to the putative mechanism linking</italic> P. copri <italic>to disease</italic>.</p><p>We agree that there is little data to convincingly suggest a specific answer as to why this association is observed. At this stage, we are seeking to discover appealing hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. To that end, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that the <italic>Prevotella</italic> in our cohort, known only by 16S sequence, is actually one specific taxon: <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> allows for the possibility that unique genes encoded by these particular bacteria may influence the association, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides data in support of the notion that <italic>P. copri</italic> thrives in an inflammatory environment, and may exacerbate inflammation. Experiments to uncover the mechanistic basis of this association will require considerably more work, and we would like to leave readers with a sense of what may be possible and what our best leads are for future investigation.</p><p><italic>3) The paper also suffers from scientific jargon. For example, use of the word “enterotype” in the title and text is quite different from its original application in the MetaHIT paper. We would recommend removing this word given recent concerns about the methodology used in the original studies (Wu et al., Science 2011; Koren et al., PLoS Comp Biol 2013), the inconsistent usage of this term in the field, the lack of any quantitative enterotype clustering in the current paper, and the focus of this study on</italic> P. copri <italic>instead of more general patterns in community structure. Other more minor offenders are “high-throughput 16S”, “dysbiotic”, and “clade diversity”</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that certain terms and semantics are important to better clarify our findings. In particular, we are aware that the word ‘enterotype’ has been questioned by recently published work. We have now removed references to enterotype from the title and text, as requested, and clarified instances in which we utilized terminology such as high-throughput 16S, dysbiosis, and clade diversity. In addition, we have sought to explain the utility of the various bioinformatics tools.</p><p><italic>4) The main text states that “NORA and healthy subjects form distinct clusters” based on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1b</italic></xref><italic>. This is clearly not the case, as the NORA subjects (stars) and healthy controls (circles) are distributed across the entire graph. A more accurate statement would be that samples cluster by</italic> Prevotella <italic>abundance irrespective of disease phenotype</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the sentence as requested to better characterize this finding.</p><p><italic>5) The prevalence of OTU4 in patients and controls is a key finding that is mentioned in the Abstract. This should be expanded upon and appropriate statistical tests need to be included</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded upon this observation at the end of the first paragraph of the results section and performed chi-squared tests. Briefly, NORA v. HLT, CRA, and PsA are statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), while pairwise comparisons between other groups are not significant.</p><p><italic>6) The observation that “</italic>P. copri <italic>strains vary between individuals and retain their individuality over time” seems like an important point, especially in light of other recent findings (e.g., Faith et al. Science 2013).</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3b</italic></xref> <italic>seems to qualitatively support this point, but no statistical testing is done. Are there quantitative and significant differences between individuals? What controls were done</italic>?</p><p>We have updated the legend to this figure and our Methods to reflect statistical testing. Briefly, if each of 61 genes is considered independently and can be in one of two states (i.e., present or absent), the probability of an exact match between any two individuals is 2<sup>-61</sup>, or 2<sup>-60</sup> with one mismatch. Qualitatively, it can be seen that any intra- or inter-individual comparison is highly statistically significant. Further, if we concede that genes within an island are not truly independent, and there are six such islands which are considered identical with 1–2 mismatches allowed, the probability of such a match is 2<sup>-6</sup>, or 0.015625, less than a 0.05 threshold for significance.</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3c</italic></xref><italic>: These groups don't hold up to multiple hypotheses so this panel and Table S3 should be removed</italic>.</p><p>We assume the reviewers mean that the FDR-adjusted p-values (q-values) are not less than 0.05, the standard minimum required for statistical significance. In this instance, we feel that a higher threshold for significance is justified. FDR is intended to work in a different way than a standard p-value generated by, for example, a t-test. The threshold can be viewed as the percentage of biomarkers that are likely to be false positives. Given the number of hits returned in this analysis (i.e., 19), we expect only 4.75 to be false positives, with a great majority expected to be true. In exploratory analyses such as the one we conducted for this paper, a higher FDR threshold is often used—for example, the popular GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) software uses an FDR cutoff of 0.25 by default (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545">http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545</ext-link>). Additionally, the four ORFs we chose for discussion are components of the same pathway, which appear adjacent to one another on the same metagenomic contigs. While it is difficult to devise a statistical test for such a situation, biological intuition suggests that these may be meaningful. We do concede that without validation of these biomarker ORFs our claims cannot be stated too strongly, and we have tried to phrase our conclusions as such.</p><p><italic>8) The methotrexate discussion, albeit speculative, is really fascinating and a clearly novel aspect of this work. Are there any correlations with methotrexate usage and Bacteroides abundance? Any differences in efficacy? Additional bioinformatics here could be quite useful in designing follow-up studies</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise a very important point, namely that usage of methotrexate may be associated with both Bacteroides abundance and differences in treatment efficacy. The question of methotrexate efficacy, however, can only be addressed by prospective cohort design, as suggested by the reviewers. Similarly, and given the cross-sectional nature of our current study, the alteration of gut flora by the use of methotrexate cannot be answered by data accrued at this time. We agree with the reviewers that this is perhaps one of the most potentially relevant aspects of our work. We are currently engaged in prospective follow up studies to determine the effects of methotrexate in modulating gut microbiota.</p><p><italic>9) The NORA samples are the only ones with high systemic inflammation, as indicated by CRP levels. So the correlation might be with that rather than with arthritis</italic> per se<italic>. This also raises the question as to whether the increased</italic> P. copri <italic>levels reflect cause or effect vis-à-vis the inflammation. These points should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these important questions. In fact, during the study design phase, we have discussed at length which disease would represent the most appropriate control group/s, specifically to address systemic inflammation as a possible modulator of the gut microbiome. In our study, NORA samples had (as expected) overall higher disease activity scores, reflecting untreated RA. In order to address “inflammation” as a confounder, we have included two reasonable positive control groups. CRA samples in our study have, by inclusion criteria, longer disease duration and have been under various treatment regimens at the time of enrollment. We have also enrolled recent-onset, mostly untreated PsA samples as our second control group. In both cases, as reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, disease activity scores were slightly lower than those found in the NORA group. Although we believe this comparison addresses the issue of systemic inflammation as modulator of gut microbiome, it is still possible that microbiota changes observed in newly diagnosed RA patients represent rather a consequence of a unique, NORA-specific systemic inflammatory response. A paragraph has now been included discussing this alternative possibility. A second, related issue that requires further investigation is the role of CRP in the modulation of microbiota. Importantly, while DAS28 scores were slightly lower in CRA and PsA patients, the most remarkable difference was found in levels of CRP. It is particularly intriguing to us whether CRP itself may have microbial modulating properties. CRP is synthesized by the liver in response to factors released by macrophages and adipocytes. It is a member of the pentraxin protein family and was first identified in the plasma of patients with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection and it was named according to its ability to precipitate the somatic C-fraction of the pneumococcal cell wall. Curiously, CRP was the first pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to be identified. The primary bacterial ligand for CRP is now recognized to be phosphocholine, a component of several bacterial cell wall structures. The physiological role of CRP consists in binding phosphocholine and the activation of the complement system leading to phagocytosis. Interestingly, and unlike many other autoimmune diseases (such as Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE), scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and PsA), CRP is characteristically high in RA. Whether or not CRP itself represents a specific response to the presence of <italic>P. copri</italic> or other taxa is an area of future investigation. We have now added a paragraph addressing the reviewers’ comments.</p><p><italic>10) RA is an HLA-associated disease. Are the NORA and control individuals HLA-matched, which has been the norm in such studies? At least in mice, H-2 alleles impact the gut microbiota. If the cohorts aren't HLA-matched, could the authors do a correlation assessment with the individuals they have (assuming they have HLA-typed the cohort)</italic>?</p><p>RA is considered a complex polygenic multifactorial autoimmune disease. Certain alleles within the HLA Class II locus confer higher risk for disease, in particular those belonging to DRB1 (i.e., shared epitope, or SE, alleles). However, genetic variance can only explain 20-30% of the cases. To address reviewers’ points, we have now included HLA-sequencing data. Indeed, consistent with recently published mouse data, the presence of SE risk-alleles seems to have an impact in the composition of gut microbiota. Our NORA cohort shows a significant inverse correlation between <italic>P. copri</italic> relative abundance and presence of shared epitope alleles. Intriguingly, a subgroup analysis of NORA patients according to presence/absence of SE alelles, revealed a significantly higher relative abundance of <italic>P. copri</italic> in those subjects lacking predisposing genes (P&lt;0.001). It is possible therefore that, as in mice, microbiota abundance correlates with certain MHC alleles that favor an expansion of specific taxa. This could also represent a gene–environmental interaction for RA incidence, as reported for other factors such as smoking. Although we cannot prove causation, it is conceivable that a certain threshold of <italic>P. copri</italic> abundance may be necessary to overcome the lack of genetic predisposition in RA subjects, while a lower abundance may be sufficient to trigger disease in those carrying risk-alleles. Validation in expanded cohorts and mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the significance of these findings. A new figure and a paragraph expanding our findings are now included in the main text.</p><p><italic>11) The interpretation of data on the CIA model in this context is confounded by the fact that a bolus of mycobacterium (CFA) was injected together with collagen</italic>.</p><p>The CIA results have been removed.</p><p><italic>12) The data on the CIA model are weak.
