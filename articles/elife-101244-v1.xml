Here, using oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as the main research model, and combining co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), proximity ligation assays (PLA), AlphaFold 3-based molecular docking, and truncation constructs, we discovered that PA28γ interacted with complement 1q binding protein (C1QBP). This interaction is dependent on the C1QBP N-terminus (aa 1–167) rather than the known functional domain. Point mutation in C1QBP (T76A/G78N) disrupting predicted hydrogen bonding with PA28γ-D177 significantly reduced their binding. Notably, we found that PA28γ enhances C1QBP protein stability in OSCC. Functionally, PA28γ and C1QBP co-localized in mitochondria, promoting fusion (via upregulation of OPA1, MFN1/2), respiratory complex expression, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP production, and ROS generation. Crucially, PA28γ-enhanced OSCC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro were dependent on C1QBP. In vivo, orthotopic OSCC models showed Pa28γ overexpression increased tumor growth and elevated C1qbp levels, correlating with elevated ATP and ROS. Using transgenic <italic>Psme3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and subcutaneous tumor grafts, we confirmed that silencing of Pa28γ suppresses tumor growth, reduces C1qbp levels, and dampens mitochondrial metabolism—specifically in knockout hosts. Clinically, PA28γ and C1QBP expression were positively correlated during oral carcinogenesis and in metastatic OSCC tissues across cohorts. High co-expression predicted poor prognosis in OSCC patients. Thus, PA28γ stabilizes C1QBP via N-terminal interaction to drive mitochondrial OXPHOS and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oral squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>PA28γ</kwd><kwd>C1QBP</kwd><kwd>protein‒protein interactions</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>oxidative phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82472686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82270986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82201074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiongke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Province Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23NSFSC0145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82273320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82470983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The promotion of C1QBP accumulation by PA28γ leads to the malignant progression of tumor by affecting mitochondrial function, which could be a launch pad for therapeutic intervention of tumor development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>PA28γ, also known as REGγ or <italic>PSME3</italic>, is a well-known non-ATP-dependent proteasome regulator. PA28γ is overexpressed in several malignant tumors, including thyroid, colon, and breast cancer, and is significantly associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stadtmueller and Hill, 2011</xref>). By regulating the stability of key components in various complex signaling pathways, PA28γ influences the biological behavior of tumor cells. For instance, PA28γ interacts with both MDM2 and p53 proteins and facilitates their physical interaction, which promotes ubiquitination and MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53 and inhibits apoptosis after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang and Zhang, 2008</xref>). Our previous studies revealed that the expression level of PA28γ in OSCC cancer nest tissues is positively correlated with patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, its role and regulation are not well understood.</p><p>OSCC is the most common oral and maxillofacial malignant tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Siegel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). The pathogenic factors of OSCC include smoking, alcohol consumption, and viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV). Therapies for OSCC include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Despite the rapid development of imaging, surgery, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in recent years, along with the emphasis on personalized treatment and multidisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of OSCC, the overall survival rate of OSCC patients has not significantly improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peres et al., 2019</xref>). The main reasons for unsatisfactory treatment efficacy include invasion of surrounding tissue, early lymph node metastasis, and a tendency toward recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lindemann et al., 2018</xref>). Metabolic reprogramming is a crucial characteristic of tumors, closely associated with malignant behaviors such as tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohshima and Morii, 2021</xref>). Current research on metabolic reprogramming in OSCC primarily focused on the mechanism of glycolytic metabolism and metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of oral squamous cell carcinoma, which lays the groundwork for novel therapeutic interventions to counteract OSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding the molecular events that lead to the occurrence and development of OSCC can aid in developing new tumor-targeted therapies, which hold significant clinical application potential.</p><p>The complement 1q binding protein (C1QBP) is a crucial protein for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in mitochondrial OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ghebrehiwet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). OXPHOS is essential for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is necessary for tumor development. C1QBP has been shown to play a significant role in cancer progression, as influencing tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vendramin et al., 2018</xref>). Due to these roles, C1QBP presents a promising therapeutic target for various tumors, including melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsumoto and Bay, 2021</xref>). In OSCC, enhanced mitochondrial OXPHOS function might also be linked to malignant tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vyas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we discovered that PA28γ interacts with C1QBP and that PA28γ can stabilize C1QBP. This interaction enhances OXPHOS and promotes the growth, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells. Additionally, the expression of PA28γ and C1QBP is increased and positively correlated in OSCC. Therefore, PA28γ and C1QBP are potential targets for the treatment and prognosis of cancer. In our knowledge, it is the first study to describe the undiscovered role of PA28γ in promoting the malignant progression of OSCC by elevating mitochondrial function, providing new clinical insights for the treatment of OSCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PA28γ interacts with and stabilizes C1QBP</title><p>To explore how PA28γ promotes OSCC progression, we conducted a gene‒gene interaction analysis using the GeneMANIA database. This analysis identified <italic>C1QBP</italic> as a significant gene within the interaction network, with the protein-coding gene of <italic>PSME3</italic> also playing a key role in the <italic>C1QBP</italic> interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Subsequently, pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that both endogenous and exogenous PA28γ and C1QBP could bind to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Moreover, proximity ligation assay (PLA) revealed a close proximity between PA28γ and C1QBP in cells, thereby suggesting a potential interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Then, we developed four OSCC cell lines with stable overexpression of PA28γ using a Flag-PA28γ-expressing lentivirus and observed that the protein level of C1QBP was higher in these cell lines compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, PA28γ upregulated C1QBP protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine whether the upregulated C1QBP was due to increased stability, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis. As a result, in the presence of PA28γ, C1QBP exhibited a significantly lower turnover rate compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition, PA28γ stabilized C1QBP in the absence and presence of a proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), whereas the inhibitor alone did not stabilize C1QBP. Furthermore, AlphaFold 3-based structural modeling predicted that the PA28γ-C1QBP interaction could be mediated by the N-terminal region of C1QBP (amino acid residues 1–167), rather than the known functional domain (amino acids 168–213) that bind to mitochondrial antiviral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peerschke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-I</xref>). Results from a pull-down analysis of the PA28γ interaction with full-length and truncated C1QBP proteins are consistent with this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G-I</xref>). In addition, we performed energy minimization to refine the structural model for PA28γ-C1QBP complex, and used the refined model to reveal potential interactions between the two proteins. The results suggest that the T76 and G78 residues in C1QBP would form hydrogen bonds with the D177 residue in PA28γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Consistently, co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that mutations that would disrupt these hydrogen bonds (T76A and G78N) significantly reduced the binding of C1QBP to PA28γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Therefore, our results illustrated that PA28γ could interact with C1QBP, in a manner dependent on the N-terminus of C1QBP, and that PA28γ could stabilize C1QBP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The interaction between proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ) and C1QBP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) The interaction between endogenous PA28γ and C1QBP in HSC-3 cells was verified via immunoprecipitation (IP).

The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells differs from that of normal cells and dynamically changes during tumor progression. OSCC is a common head and neck malignancy that is still a growing global health problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). The development of OSCC is a complex and multifaceted process in which metabolic reprogramming appears to be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). However, the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Excitingly, we found the evidence that PA28γ interacts with and stabilizes C1QBP. We speculate that aberrantly accumulated C1QBP enhances the function of mitochondrial OXPHOS and leads to the production of additional ATP and ROS by activating the expression and function of OPA1, MNF1, MFN2, and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins. This process results in mitochondrial fusion and malignant tumor progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our study highlights the underlying mechanism by which PA28γ participates in the regulation of OXPHOS by upregulating C1QBP in OSCC.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Molecular mechanism through which proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ) interacts with C1QBP in the malignant progression of tumor.</title><p>PA28γ can interact with and stabilize C1QBP, which can activate the expression and function of OPA1, MNF1, MFN2, and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins, resulting in enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondrial fusion, and malignant tumor progression.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101244-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>C1QBP is also called gClqR, p32, p33, and HABP1, can be distributed inside cells, on the cell surface, and can also be secreted extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Egusquiza-Alvarez and Robles-Flores, 2022</xref>). Within cells, C1QBP is primarily located in the mitochondria. The key functions of mitochondrial C1QBP include maintaining OXPHOS, supplying energy to cells, and achieving homeostasis of mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ghebrehiwet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). C1QBP is highly expressed in cells that require a large amount of energy, such as the heart, skeletal muscle, testis, ovary, small intestine, and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feichtinger et al., 2017</xref>). Sufficient energy is essential for cancer development, and C1QBP promotes malignant behaviors such as tumor invasion and metastasis by enhancing OXPHOS function in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raschdorf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, there are no reports on the expression and functions of C1QBP in OSCC. In our study, we found the evidence that PA28γ interacts with and stabilizes C1QBP. As a proteasome activator, PA28γ usually affects the development of tumors by regulating the stability of various important proteins. For example, PA28γ can promote the degradation of p53, p21 leading to cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, PA28γ can also play as a non-degradome role in tumor angiogenesis. For example, PA28γ can regulate the activation of NF-κB to promote the secretion of IL-6 and CCL2 in OSCC cells, thus promoting the angiogenesis of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, the function of mitochondrial PA28γ may differ from that of nuclear PA28γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mao et al., 2008</xref>). Our study reveals that PA28γ interacts with C1QBP and stabilizes C1QBP at the protein level. Therefore, we speculate that the binding sites of PA28γ and C1QBP may mask the specific post-translational modification sites of C1QBP and inhibit its degradation. For example, the transcriptional coactivator p300 interacts with Smad7 by acetylating two lysine residues in its N-terminus, which stabilize Smad7 and protect it from TGFβ-induced degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grönroos et al., 2002</xref>). Overall, the specific mechanism involved in the interaction between PA28γ and C1QBP still needs further exploration.</p><p>Considering that C1QBP is a vital protein for maintaining mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tian et al., 2023</xref>), we further investigated the function underlying the malignant progression of OSCC through the interaction between PA28γ and C1QBP in vitro and in vivo. PA28γ and C1QBP colocalized in the mitochondria, and the stabilization of C1QBP by PA28γ enhanced mitochondrial function and OXPHOS. This enhancement is crucial for ATP production, and ATP is the primary energy currency of cellular metabolism. Therefore, PA28γ’s regulation of OXPHOS may impact cellular energy metabolism. PA28γ has been reported to activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells to promote glycolysis and inhibit OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). These findings contrast with our study, potentially due to organ heterogeneity or the complexity of metabolic reprogramming.</p><p>In the tissue microenvironment of oral lichen planus, a potentially malignant oral disorder, PA28γ in epithelial cells can regulate T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2024</xref>), while PA28γ in CAFs is involved in the crosstalk between stromal cells and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2024</xref>). This suggests that PA28γ may interact with the tumor immune microenvironment. Our phenotypically similar OSCC xenograft tumor models in both immunocompetent and nude mice indicate that the regulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS by PA28γ localized in tumor cell mitochondria does not entirely depend on the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, our study reveals that PA28γ can regulate C1QBP and influence mitochondrial morphology and function by enhancing the expression of OPA1, MFN1, MFN2, and the mitochondrial respiratory complex. Mitochondrial fusion, crucial for oxidative metabolism and cell proliferation, is regulated by MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1. The first two fuse with the outer mitochondrial membrane, while the last fuses with the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Westermann, 2010</xref>). OPA1 is an essential inner mitochondrial membrane protein with multiple functions, including regulating mitochondrial fusion, cristae morphology, mtDNA stability, and interacting with the mitochondrial respiratory chain to regulate OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Del Dotto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the expression patterns and significance of PA28γ and C1QBP in a clinical cohort. PA28γ and C1QBP were negatively correlated with prognosis in the OSCC clinical cohort. Notably, some studies have shown that OXPHOS is upregulated in various tumors, with some advanced tumors preferring OXPHOS metabolically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohshima and Morii, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qiu et al., 2023</xref>). OXPHOS activity is associated with the recurrence of OSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Noh et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, the enhancement of OXPHOS and ATP production by ROS proto-oncogene 1, which localizes to mitochondria in OSCC, promotes the OSCC invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Noh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grimm et al., 2014</xref>). These findings are consistent with our results. Our study not only explains the mechanisms and signaling networks underlying the oncogenic potential of PA28γ but also contributes to understanding the possible mechanisms involved in OSCC metabolic reprogramming.</p><p>In summary, we found that PA28γ could interact with C1QBP and stabilize C1QBP. This enhances the function of OXPHOS, leading to increased production of ATP and ROS by increasing the expression and function of OPA1, MNF1, MFN2, and the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. This process promotes mitochondrial fusion and malignant tumor progression. The expression of PA28γ and C1QBP was increased and positively correlated in OSCC. High expression of PA28γ and C1QBP was correlated with poor prognosis in OSCC patients, indicating that both proteins, in particular their molecular interactions, could serve as potential targets for the treatment and prognosis of OSCC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and follow-up</title><p>Our study included four cohorts.

The third cohort, comprising 518 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>). The last cohort, comprising 458 patients with skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), was obtained from TCGA database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Laboratory experiments</title><p>All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee for the State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases (Approval number: WCHSIRB-D-2022–032) in compliance with the Guide for the updated Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) 2.0 guidelines. The sample size for animal experiments is estimated based on existing research and empirical data, minimizing animal use while ensuring experimental validity. Other methods are detailed in the Appendix, including cell culture and cell-related experiments, animal models, mitochondrial function detection, western blot/immunoprecipitation assays, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, and immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software version 8.0. The statistical data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Chi-square and Fisher exact tests, Spearman correlation tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, one-way ANOVA, and Student’s t-tests were used to analyze the data. The Kaplan‒Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate the prognostic value of C1QBP in OSCC patients. The data are shown as the mean ± standard error, and a value of p&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance: p&lt;0.05*, p&lt;0.01**, p&lt;0.001***, and p&lt;0.0001****. Each experiment was repeated three times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The protocol of this study was approved by the ethics committee of the West China Hospital of Stomatology (Approval number: WCHSIRB-D-2020-046).

They hypothesized it may act through metabolic reprogramming in the mitochondria.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>They found that the genes of PA28g and C1QBP are in an overlapping interaction network after an analysis of a genome database. They also found that the two proteins interact in coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays using the lysate from OSCC cells with or without expression of the exogenous genes. They used truncated C1QBP proteins to map the interaction site to the N-terminal 167 residues of C1QBP protein. They observed the levels of the two proteins are positively correlated in the cells. They provided evidence for the colocalization of the two proteins in the mitochondria and the effect on mitochondrial form and function in vitro and in vivo OSCC models, and the correlation of the protein expression with the prognosis of cancer patients.</p><p>Comments on revision:</p><p>The third revision added data from two point mutations of C1QBP that would disrupt a hydrogen bond network with PA28g protein. As one would expect from the structural models obtained with AlphaFold, the interaction between the two proteins as detected by co-immunoprecipitation of cell lysate was reduced by both mutations. Therefore, the theoretical models for the interaction were supported by the experimental data. Moving forward, the home run experiments would be to test the C1QBP mutants in functional assays to determine whether the mutations can decrease the protein stability afforded by the interaction with PA28g, which in turn decrease the effect of PA28g on mitochondria and tumor cells via C1QBP. Success of these experiments will conclude this manuscript that presents a novel finding for tumor cell biology which could be a launch pad for therapeutic intervention of tumor development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101244.5.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiongke</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yingqiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Huan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Silu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yimei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xikun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qianming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript determines how PA28g, a proteasome regulator that is overexpressed in tumors, and C1QBP, a mitochondrial protein for maintaining oxidative phosphorylation that plays a role in tumor progression, interact in tumor cells to promote their growth, migration and invasion. Evidence for the interaction and its impact on mitochondrial form and function was provided although it is not particularly strong.</p><p>The revised manuscript corrected mislabeled data in figures and provides more details in figure legends. Misleading sentences and typos were corrected. However, key experiments that were suggested in previous reviews were not done, such as making point mutations to disrupt the protein interactions and assess the consequence on protein stability and function. Results from these experiments are critical to determine whether the major conclusions are fully supported by the data.</p><p>The second revision of the manuscript included the proximity ligation data to support the PA28g-C1QBP interaction in cells. However, the method and data were not described in sufficient detail for readers to understand. The revision also includes the structural models of the PA28g-C1QBP complex predicted by AlphaFold. However, the method and data were not described with details for readers to understand how this structural modeling was done, what is the quality of the resulting models, and the physical nature of the protein-protein interaction such as what kind of the non-covalent interactions exist in the interface of the protein complexes. Furthermore, while the interactions mediated by the protein fragments were tested by pull-down experiments, the interactions mediated by the three residues were not tested by mutagenesis and pull-down experiments. In summary, the revision was improved, but further improvement is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments.</p><p>(1) Based on your suggestion, we predicted the possible interaction sites using AlphaFold 3 and found that mutations in amino acids 76 and 78 of C1QBP affect the interaction with PA28γ (Revised Appendix Figure 1J). Subsequently, pulldown experiment also found that after mutating the amino acids at the two aforementioned sites (T76A, G78N), C1QBP that could bind to PA28γ decreased (Revised Figure 1J). The above results confirm that PA28γ could interacts with C1QBP, in a manner dependent on the N-terminus of C1QBP. These findings are now included in the revised manuscript “In addition, we employed AlphaFold 3 to perform energy minimization and predict hydrogen bonds between the C1QBP N-terminus (amino acids 1-167) and the PA28γ protein interaction region. The results suggest that the T76 and G78 residues of C1QBP may be key contributors to the interaction. Consistently, coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that mutations at these sites (C1QBPT76A and C1QBPG78N) significantly reduced the binding ability to PA28γ (Fig. 1J and Appendix Fig. 1J)”, specifically in results section. We believe this additional validation strengthens the robustness of our findings.</p><p>(2) According to your suggestion, we have added a description of the results of PLA in the figure legend (Revised Figure 1C) and the method of PLA in the appendix file (Revised Appendix file, Part “Proximity Ligation Assay”). The revised text reads as follows: (C) PLA image of UM1 cells shows the interaction between C1QBP and PA28γ in both cytoplasm and nucleus (red fluorescence).</p><p>(3) In the light of your suggestion, we have enriched the description of AlphaFold 3 analysis in the appendix file (Revised Appendix file, Page 10-11). The revised text reads as follows:</p><p>“Prediction and Analysis of Protein Interactions</p><p>Protein Sequence Retrieval and Structure Prediction</p><p>The protein sequences of C1QBP and PA28γ were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. Structural predictions of the protein-protein interaction between C1QBP and PA28γ were conducted using AlphaFold 3. The plDDT (predicted local distance difference test) values were utilized to assess the confidence of the predicted models. Models with a plDDT score above 70 were considered confident, while those with a score above 90 were categorized as very high confidence. These values were annotated in the figures to indicate the reliability of the structural predictions.”</p><p>“Protein Preparation and Structure Optimization</p><p>The best-scored model for the C1QBP-PA28γ interaction predicted by AlphaFold 3 was selected for further analysis. The model was imported into MOE 2022 (Molecular Operating Environment) software for protein preparation. This process included the removal of water molecules and other heteroatoms, followed by the addition of hydrogen atoms to the structure. This step was essential for optimizing the protein’s 3D conformation and ensuring the correctness of the protonation states at physiological pH.”</p><p>“Energy Minimization and Hydrogen Bond Prediction</p><p>The protein structure was subjected to energy minimization using the Amber10: EHT (Effective Hamiltonian Theory) force field, with R-field 1: 80 settings to refine the model’s geometry. The minimization process was performed to optimize the protein’s internal energy and ensure stable conformation, followed by calculation of hydrogen bond interactions. The interaction energies and hydrogen bonds were analyzed to identify potential binding sites and stabilize the predicted protein-protein complex.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
