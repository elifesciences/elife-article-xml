cells of our body. However, their impact on circadian physiology is still under debate. Mortality by endotoxic (LPS) shock is highly time-of-day dependent and local circadian immune function such as the cytokine burst after LPS challenge has been assumed to be causal for the large differences in survival. Here, we investigate the roles of light and myeloid clocks on mortality by endotoxic shock. Strikingly, mice in constant darkness (DD) show a threefold increased susceptibility to LPS as compared to mice in light-dark conditions. Mortality by endotoxic shock as a function of circadian time is independent of light-dark cycles as well as myeloid CLOCK or BMAL1 as demonstrated in conditional knockout mice. Unexpectedly, despite the lack of a myeloid clock these mice still show rhythmic patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, MCP-1, IL-18, and IL-10 in peripheral blood as well as time-of-day and site-dependent traffic of myeloid cells. We speculate that systemic time-cues are sufficient to orchestrate innate immune response to LPS by driving immune functions such as cell trafficking and cytokine expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA 5108/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AN 1553-2/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ananthasubramaniam</surname><given-names>Bharath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circadian clocks in murine myeloid cells are dispensable for circadian cytokine function, trafficking and endotoxic shock in response to LPS in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Timing of immune-functions is crucial for initiating, establishing, maintaining, and resolving immune-responses. The temporal organization of the immune system also applies for daily recurring tasks and may even help to anticipate times of environmental challenges. In humans, many parameters and functions of the immune system display diurnal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheiermann et al., 2013</xref>), which impact on disease severity and symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Druzd et al., 2014</xref>). While the concepts of chronobiology are increasingly acknowledged in life-science and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaway and Ledford, 2017</xref>), a deep comprehension of how time-of-day modulates our physiology in health and disease is still lacking.</p><p>The fundamental system behind the time-of-day-dependent regulation of an organism, its behavior, physiology and disease is called the circadian clock. In mammals, this clock is organized in a hierarchical manner: a central pacemaker in the brain synchronized to environmental light-dark cycles via the eyes and peripheral clocks receiving and integrating central as well as peripheral (e.g. metabolic) time information. Both central and peripheral clocks are essentially identical in their molecular makeup: Core transcription factors form a negative feedback loop consisting of the activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, and the repressors, PERs and CRYs. Additional feedback loops and regulatory factors amplify, stabilize and fine-tune the cell intrinsic molecular oscillator to achieve an about 24 hr (circadian) periodicity of cell- and tissue-specific clock output functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass and Lazar, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Circadian patterns of various immune-functions have been reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheiermann et al., 2013</xref>) and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haus and Smolensky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Edery, 2008</xref>) including cytokine response to bacterial endotoxin and pathogens, white blood cell traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheiermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casanova-Acebes et al., 2013</xref>) and natural killer cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arjona and Sarkar, 2006</xref>). Cell-intrinsic clocks have been described for many leukocyte subsets of lymphoid as well as myeloid origin, including monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, immune-cell intrinsic clocks have been connected to cell-type specific output function such as the TNFα response to LPS in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Sepsis is a severe life threatening condition with more than 31 million incidences per year worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleischmann et al., 2016</xref>). Mouse models of sepsis show a strong time-of-day dependency in mortality rate when challenged at different times of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halberg et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feigin et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feigin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hrushesky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2018</xref>). Most studies agree about the times of highest (around <italic>Zeitgeber time</italic> [ZT]8 - that is, 8 hr past lights on) or lowest (around ZT20) mortality across different animal models and investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halberg et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hrushesky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feigin et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feigin et al., 1972</xref>). The fatal cascade in the pathomechanism of endotoxic shock is initiated by critical doses of LPS recognized by CD14/TLR4-bearing cells, mainly monocytes and macrophages as well as the activation of the complement system. This activation of the innate immune system triggers a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and feeds into a self amplifying loop involving the cytokine release of not only newly recruited leukocytes but also endothelial and other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotchkiss et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence, activation of the coagulation system in endothelial cells, platelets, and plasma as well as increasing endothelial barrier dysfunction promote disseminated intra-vascular coagulation, blood pressure decompensation and final multi-organ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McConnell and Coopersmith, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotchkiss et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the impact of light-dark cycles and local myeloid clocks on time-of-day-dependent survival rates in endotoxic shock using conditional clock-knockout mouse models. We show that peripheral blood cytokine levels as well as mortality triggered by bacterial endotoxin depend on time-of-day despite a functional clock knockout in myeloid cells. Our work thus challenges current models of local regulation of immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Time-of-day-dependent survival in endotoxic shock</title><p>Diurnal patterns of LPS-induced mortality (endotoxic shock) have been reported numerous times in different laboratory mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halberg et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marpegan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheiermann et al., 2012</xref>). To address the question, whether time-of-day-dependent susceptibility to LPS is under control of the circadian system rather than being directly or indirectly driven by light, we challenged mice kept either under light-dark conditions (LD 12:12) or in constant darkness (DD) at four different times during the cycles. As expected from previous reports, survival of mice housed in LD was dependent on the time of LPS injection, being highest during the light phase and lowest at night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time-of-day-dependent mortality in LPS-treated mice is controlled by the circadian system and light conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LPS (30 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>) induced mortality in C57Bl/6 mice (n=10 per time point) kept either in LD 12:12 (yellow) or in DD (gray).

Furthermore, time-of-day-dependent differences in mortality were much less pronounced under these conditions.</p><p>To discriminate, whether constant darkness alters overall susceptibility to LPS leading to a ceiling effect rather than eliminating time-dependent effects, we systematically reduced LPS dosage in DD conditions. By challenging the mice at four times across the day, we determined the half-lethal dose of LPS in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As suspected, mice in DD showed a threefold increased susceptibility to LPS as similar doses of LPS result in largely different mortality rates in LD vs. DD (e.g. LD, 15 mg/kg LPS, 9% mortality vs DD, 13 mg/kg LPS, 67% mortality). For circadian rhythm analysis, we extended the number of time points at approximately half-lethal doses both in LD and DD groups, respectively. This revealed diurnal/circadian patterns in mortality rate in LD (p-value=0.06) as well as in DD conditions (p-value=0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) demonstrating that the circadian system controls susceptibility to LPS. In addition, this susceptibility is overall increased in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Circadian cytokine response upon LPS challenge in mice</title><p>We and others have recently found that cells in the immune system harbor self-sustained circadian oscillators, which shape immune functions in a circadian manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>). Pro-inflammatory responses in murine ex vivo macrophage culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellet et al., 2013</xref>) are controlled by cell-intrinsic clocks and are most prominent during the day and lowest during the activity phase. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1α/β, IL-6, IL-18 as well as MCP-1 have been linked to the pathomechanism of endotoxic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xing et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marino et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we hypothesized that the cytokine response in LPS-challenged mice has a time-of-day dependent profile, which might govern mortality rate in the endotoxic shock model. Indeed, plasma of mice collected 2 hr after administration of half-lethal doses of LPS (either in LD [30 mg/kg] or DD [13 mg/kg] conditions at various times during the day), exhibited an up to twofold time-of-day difference in absolute cytokine concentrations. In animals kept in LD, TNFα showed highest levels around ZT8, IL-18 levels peaked at ZT18 and IL-12p40 as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 had their peak-time around ZT14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; for amplitude and phase information as determined by sine fit see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, cytokine profiles from DD mice differed substantially from LD profiles: the peak-times of IL-12p40 was phase-advanced by 6 hr, CXCL5 completely reversed its phase, whereas IL-18 remained expressed predominantly in the night. Taken together, cytokine profiles of LPS-challenged mice parallel endotoxic shock-induced mortality patterns, although most circadian cytokines show variable phase relations between free-running and entrained conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated, whether the increased overall mortality in DD was correlated with an increased pro-inflammatory cytokine response. We thus injected mice at either ZT8 (mice kept in LD) or circadian time (CT) 8 (mice kept in DD) with the same dose of LPS (13 mg/kg) and took blood samples 2 hr later. IFNγ, MCP-1, IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 showed significantly altered levels between mice kept in LD or DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that in DD conditions the sensitivity to endotoxin is increased leading to enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and subsequently increased mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dispensable role of myeloid clocks in circadian endotoxin reactivity</title><p>Local clocks are thought to play important roles in mediating circadian modulation of cell- and tissue-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stratmann and Schibler, 2006</xref>). In fact, depletion of local immune clocks has been shown to disrupt circadian patterns of tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curtis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibbs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Druzd et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether local clocks in cells of the innate immune system are responsible for circadian time dependency in the response to bacterial endotoxin, we challenged myeloid lineage <italic>Bmal1</italic>-knockout mice (<italic>Lyz2 <sup>cre/cre</sup></italic> x <italic>Bmal1 <sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, hereafter called myBmal-KO) kept in DD with half-lethal doses of LPS at various times across the circadian cycle. These mice lack physiological levels of Bmal1 mRNA and protein in cells of myeloid origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) and have been characterized in more detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs et al., 2012</xref>). To our surprise, mortality of these mice was still dependent on circadian time of LPS administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) indicating that a functional circadian clock in myeloid cells is not required for time-of-day-dependent LPS-sensitivity. However, the overall susceptibility to LPS decreased twofold compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) suggesting that BMAL1 levels in myeloid cells directly or indirectly modulate susceptibility toward LPS. The latter effect could only in part be attributed to genetic background (note decreased susceptibility to LPS in <italic>Lyz2 <sup>cre/cre</sup></italic>) (hereafter called LysM-Cre) control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) together arguing for a tonic rather than temporal role of myeloid BMAL1 in regulating LPS sensitivity.

However, we suspected that this result may be caused by a ceiling effect induced by constant darkness, since mortality rates at both time points were close to 100 percent. Indeed, when we compared susceptibility of mice challenged with a similar dose of LPS in light-dark versus constant darkness, we observed a marked increase of overall mortality. Similarly, depletion/mutation of <italic>Per2</italic> rendered mice insensitive to experimental time dependency in endotoxic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we found that depletion of either CLOCK or BMAL1 in myeloid lineage derived cells both did not abolish time-of-day dependency in mortality to endotoxic shock, which led us to reject our initial hypothesis.</p><p>Our data also exclude light as a stimulus driving mortality: First, data from Halberg, Marpegan, Scheiermann as well as our own lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halberg et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marpegan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheiermann et al., 2012</xref>) suggest that mice are more susceptible to endotoxic shock during the light phase compared to dark phase - whereas switching light schedules from light-dark to constant darkness led to an increase in overall mortality. Second, irrespective of the genetic clock-gene depletion tested, our data unequivocally demonstrate circadian mortality rhythms upon LPS challenge even under DD conditions. Strikingly, peripheral blood cytokine levels showed - though altered - circadian time dependency in the myClock-KO strain.</p><p>A burst of cytokines, following a lethal dose of LPS is generally thought to be an indispensable factor causing multi-organ dysfunction and leading to death. However, the contribution of single cytokines has been difficult to tease apart due to complex nature of interconnected feedback systems. By adding time-of-day as an independent variable in a number of different mouse models, we were able to correlate individual cytokines’ contribution to mortality in the context of the complex response to LPS. While the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα was confirmed to act detrimentally, IL-18 surprisingly turned out to likely be protective. This interpretation is not only supported by the negative correlation of IL-18 levels in blood and mortality risk, but also by an anti-phasic oscillation of IL-18 levels paralleling those of the known protective cytokine IL-10. In addition, a protective role for IL-18 has been previously reported in a colitis model in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dinarello et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While circadian regulation of trafficking lymphocytes by cell intrinsic clockworks have been demonstrated to impact the pathophysiology of an autoimmune disease model such as EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Druzd et al., 2017</xref>), our data on distribution patterns of immune cells at two circadian time points draw a more complex picture. In spleen, absolute numbers of macrophages, but not neutrophils and monocytes, are independent of their local clocks. In contrast, patterns of macrophages and neutrophils in peripheral blood and bone marrow (respectively) change upon local myeloid clock depletion. Thus, it appears that myeloid cell traffic is regulated at multiple levels including cell-intrinsic, endothelial and site specific factors. However, our data do not support the hypothesis of myeloid cell distribution being a main factor for time-of-day-dependent mortality risk in endotoxic shock. Hence, what remains as the source of these rhythms?</p><p>Following the pathophysiology of endotoxic shock on its path from cause to effect, it is important to note that the bio-availability of bacterial endotoxin injected intraperitoneally depends on multiple factors (i.e. pharmaco-kinetics), many of which themselves might underlie circadian regulation. As a consequence, same doses of LPS administered <italic>i.p.</italic> at different times-of-day might result in highly diverging concentrations at the site of action.</p><p>Sensing of LPS by TLR4 is not restricted to myeloid lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotchkiss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bès-Houtmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kato et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequent to <italic>i.p.</italic> injection, peritoneal mesothelial cells, adipocytes and adjacent organs might directly react to LPS and shape the complex response not only of cytokine release, but also in changing their metabolic states and tissue functions. Indeed, a recent study performed in a humanized mouse model identified non-hematopoetic derived cells as major source of many plasma cytokines after cecal ligation and puncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skirecki et al., 2019</xref>). Local circadian clocks of these cells may therefore contribute to the time-of-day dependent cytokine patterns and survival observed in myeloid clock knockout mice.</p><p>Along this path, rhythmic feeding behavior driven by the central pacemaker was suggested to alter immune-responses directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luna-Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laermans et al., 2014</xref>) and a recent study showed that day-time restricted feeding can reverse time-of-day dependent mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>). Also, nutrition-related factors could drive immune cells to respond differently to stimuli independent or dependent of local clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the ability of cells and organs to resist all sorts of noxa might as well be regulated in a time-of-day-dependent manner. In this case, rather than same doses of toxin leading to time-dependent cytokine responses (noxa) resulting in diverging rates of multi organ failure, same amount of noxa would cause time-dependent rates of multi organ dysfunction and death. Indeed, work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hrushesky et al., 1994</xref> showed that mice challenged with same doses of TNFα at various times throughout the day exhibited time-dependent survival paralleling phenomena in endotoxic shock. However, our data showing fluctuating cytokine levels in myClock-KO mice challenged with LPS in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) question the mechanism of organ vulnerability as the only source of circadian regulation.</p><p>While our work suggests that local myeloid clocks do not account for time-of-day dependent mortality in endotoxic shock it unequivocally argues for a strong enhancing effect of myeloid CLOCK and BMAL1 on overall susceptibility, which adds on the effect of light conditions. However, it is important to note that our data do stay in conflict with findings from other labs which rather reported attenuating effects of BMAL1 on inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curtis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2018</xref>) but align well with a report on clock mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellet et al., 2013</xref>). Differences in genetic background of mouse strains, animal-facility-dependent microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanz and Moya-Pérez, 2014</xref>) or animal care procedures might account for this but remain unsatisfying explanations.</p><p>One of the most striking findings of our work is the large increase in susceptibility to endotoxic shock when mice were housed under DD as compared to LD conditions. This relative increase when shifting from LD to DD was observed in wild-type as well as in myBmal-KO mice and appears therefore independent of a functional clock in myeloid cells. Interestingly, Carlson and Chiu reported similar effects in a cecal ligation and puncture model in rats upon transfer to LL (constant light) or DD conditions, where they found decreased survival as compared to rats remaining in LD conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlson and Chiu, 2008</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that rhythmic light conditions, rather than light itself promote survival in endotoxemia. In either case, it will be important to further investigate these phenomena not only in respect to animal housing conditions, which need to be tightly light controlled in immunological, physiological, and behavioral experiments but also for their apparent implications on health-care in intensive care units.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Normality was tested using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. When data were normally distributed and two parameters were compared, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison as a post hoc test was applied. When comparing more than two groups and two parameters a two-way ANOVA with Bonferonni's post hoc test was applied. Two sample comparison was performed with two-sided students t-test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data. Time-of-day dependent mortality experiments: Mortality data were transformed to probability of death (between 0 and 1) in order to compute sine fit using alogistic regression. The confidence interval was derived from sine fit estimation. After statistical analysis, the mortality data was transformed back to the initial percentages. Cross-correlation analysis of morality and cytokine data: To correlate mortality rates and cytokine levels across all animal models, a permutation of sine fit of the mortality data and plasma cytokine data was used. This bootstrapping (randomization) procedure gives rise to the empirical distribution of correlations. The p-value is the fraction of randomizations that gave a correlation with the opposite denominator, meaning that a p=0.05 means that only 5% of correlations crossed zero correlation threshold. For linear regression analysis of the summary of cytokine and mortality data, the estimated mortality rate determined by sine fit of mortality data was correlated to mean value of plasma cytokine concentration using Spearman’s rank correlation. Bioluminescence recordings were analysed using in-house written software ChronoStar 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maier et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, raw bioluminescence counts were transformed to log-space and trends removed by subtracting the 24 hr running average. Circadian rhythm parameters were estimated by fitting a damped sine wave to these data. Finally, data were reversely transformed into linear space. Circadian rhythmicity of cytokine time-series was tested using our in-house written software ChronoLyse. In brief, a 24 hr sine wave was fitted the beforehand log-transformed data and parameters of fit were used to estimate amplitude, phase and mean levels. Rhythmicity was tested by testing against a flat line using F-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Grants AN 1553-2/1, MA 5108/1–1, HE2168/11-1, SPP 2041).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: All procedures were authorized by and performed in strict accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the German animal protection law (Deutsches Tierschutzgesetz).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript has novelty in its approach. The authors investigate and document the role of myeloid-endogenous circadian cycling on the host response to and progression of endotoxemia in the mouse LPS-model. As a principal finding, Lang et al., report how disruption of the cell-intrinsic myeloid circadian clock by myeloid-specific knockdown of either CLOCK or BMAL1 does not prevent circadian patterns of morbidity and mortality in endotoxemic mice. As a consequence of these and other findings from endotoxemia experiments in mice kept in the dark or the observation of circadian cytokine production in CLOCK KO animals, the authors conclude that myeloid responses critical to endotoxemia are not governed by their local cell-intrinsic clock. Moreover they conclude that the source of circadian timing and pace giving that is critical for the host response to endotoxemia must lie outside the myeloid compartment. Finally, the authors also report a general (non-circadian) reduced susceptibility of mice devoid of myeloid CLOCK or BMAL1, which they take as a proof that myeloid circadian cycling is important in the host response to endotoxemia, yet does not dictate the circadian pattern in mortality and cytokine responses.</p><p>The paper is well conceived, experiments are very elegant and well carried out, statistics and ethics statements are appropriate. The conclusions of this study, as summarized above, are important and will be of much interest to readers from the circadian field and beyond, also to sepsis and inflammation researchers. There is one major flaw in the argumentative line of this story, as the study relies on the assumption that the systemic cytokine response provided by myeloid cells is paramount and central to the course and intensity of endotoxemia. While this is assumed, rigorous proof of this connection and its causality is still lacking (most evidence is of correlative nature). This is important, since there is an increasing body of more recent experimental evidence that argues against a prominent role of myeloid cells in the cytokine storm. While the intriguing findings are interesting, the study remains mainly descriptive and frustratingly without mechanistic explanation. At least, the following revisions are strongly recommended.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The investigators show that mice shift from LD to DD become more lethal to LPS. If this is due to abolishment of the circadian rhythm, similar lethality should appear with the challenge of the KO mice. The opposite was found. Please explain.</p><p>2. LPS is acting through TLR4 binding. Can the author provide evidence that TLR4 expression is down-regulated in transition from LD to DD? Does the same apply for the expression of SOCS3?</p><p>3. As mentioned, a central weakness of this paper is that it assumes systemic cytokine levels as produced by myeloid cells are center stage in endotoxemic shock (e.g. see line 164). However, recent evidence has shown that over 90% of most of systemically released cytokines in sepsis can be produced by non-myeloid cells (as shown e.g. by use of humanized mice), which allows discrimination between (human) cytokines produced by blood cells from (murine) cytokines produced by parenchyma (see e.g. PMID: 31297113). (Interestingly, there is a one major exception to that rule, and that is TNFa). Considering this, it is not surprising that circadian cytokine levels do not change in myeloid CLOCK/BMAl1 KO mice. Also, assuming that myeloid-produced cytokines are not critical drivers, the same applies to the observation that circadian mortality pattern is preserved in those mice. The authors should more critically discuss this alternative explanation. In fact, this line of arguing would be in line with the concept that the source for the circadian susceptibility /mortality in endotoxemia resides in a non-myeloid cell compartment, which is essentially the major finding of this manuscript.</p><p>4. Intro (lines 51-54): the authors describe one scenario as the mechanism of sepsis-associated organ failure. This appears too one-sided and absolute, since many more hypothesis and models exist. It would be good to mention that and/or tone down the wording.</p><p>5. Very analogous to Light/Darkness cycles, ambient temperature has been shown to have a strong impact on mortality from endotoxemia (e.g. PMID: 31016449). Did the authors keep their animals in thermostated ambient conditions? Please describe and discuss in the text.</p><p>6. Figure 2C; The large difference in mortality in the control lys-MCre line looks somewhat worrying. Could this be a consequence of well-known Cre off-target activities? Did the authors check this by e.g. sequencing myeloid cells of or using control mouse strains?</p><p>7. Line 320: Bmal1flox/flox (Bmal-flox) [48] or Clockflox/flox (Clock-flox) [38] were bred with LysM-Cre to target Bmal1. Please show a prototypical genotyping result, perhaps as supplemental figure.</p><p>8. Line 365: the authors state that mice that did not show signs of disease were sorted out. What proportion of mice (%) did not react to LPS? It would be useful to state this number in the methods section.</p><p>9. It is not fully clear if male or female or both were used for the principal experiments, please specify. If female were used, please describe how estrous cycle was taken into account.</p><p>10. Please revise the result section and the legends (for example legends of Figures 3 and 5) to explicitly mention whether experiments with conditional knockouts were performed with LD or DD mice.</p><p>11. Specific issues:</p><p>a. Line 15 and 80. Saying that DD mice show a &quot;three-fold increased susceptibility to LPS&quot; is true for very specific conditions only, and should not be used as a general statement.</p><p>b. Line 99-. Please be more precise in describing cytokine levels (for example, in LD, TNF peaks at ZT10, IL-18 at ZT14 or ZT22 but not ZT18, and IL-10 but not IL-12 peaks at ZT14).</p><p>c. Line 105-106. Referring to Figure 1E, it is not straightforward for the reader to understand what is meant by &quot;free-running and entrained&quot; conditions.</p><p>d. Figure 5 and Sup Figure 5. They are huge differences in leukocytes counts between LysM-Cre+/+ and WT mice. Without being exhaustive, LysM-Cre+/+ display much more macrophages in bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes, DCs in lymph nodes, NK cells in spleen and lymph nodes at both CT8 and CT20. This is very puzzling and questions about the pertinence of these &quot;control&quot; mice. Additionally, one might expect from these observations that LysM-Cre+/+ mice are more sensitive to endotoxemia, which is not the case (point 5).</p><p>e. Line 257. The effect of IL-18 is not totally surprising, since both detrimental and protective effects of the cytokine have been reported in the literature. This could be briefly mentioned.</p><p>f. Sup Figure 5A. The gating strategy has to be shown for each organ, separately.</p><p>g. Sup Figure 5D. The peritoneal cavity contains not only different macrophage populations with different inflammatory properties, but also different B cell populations including anti-inflammatory B-1a cells (plus NK cells, DCs…). Considering that LPS is injected i.p., more thorough analyses of the peritoneal cavity should performed to properly interpret results of cytokine and mortality.</p><p>h. It is not clear whether endotoxemia was addressed with BMAL1 and CLOCK myeloid conditional knockout mice kept LD. Since time-of-day dependent differences in mortality were much less in DD mice (line 74), we probably expect only marginal differences in DD mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62469.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Since both, TLR4 and SOCS3 are mainly regulated on transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (Yan, 2006; Yoshimura et al., 2007) we expected to see potentially regulated expression on mRNA level. We thus performed an experiment investigating peritoneal cavity cells from mice housed either in LD or after transition from LD to DD at two time points (ZT/CT8 and ZT/CT20). We chose these time points since we expected to observe highest levels of regulation of TLR4/SOCS3 then, in case these genes were regulated in a time of day dependent manner.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62469-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While in both light treatment groups <italic>Nr1d1</italic> showed the expected time of day dependent differences in expression (p-values: a = 0.09 , b = 0.04 ), <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression levels remained unaltered between time points (not tested) and light treatment (p-values: c = 0.63 , d = 0.59 ). For Socs3 a trend towards differences between time points (p-values: g = 0.20 , h = 0.33 ) but not between light treatment groups (p-values: e = 0.62, f = 0.91 ) could be observed. All error bars represent SEM, n=3 (ZT8) or n=5 (other conditions). Thus, these data provide no evidence that Tlr4 of Socs3 are differentially regulated upon transition from LD to DD and therefore cannot explain the higher lethality of LPS in mice after transfer to DD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We added and changed a passage in the introduction for a more detailed description of the mechanisms leading to endotoxic shock (lines 55ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, recent evidence has shown that over 90% of most of systemically released cytokines in sepsis can be produced by non-myeloid cells (as shown e.g. by use of humanized mice), which allows discrimination between (human) cytokines produced by blood cells from (murine) cytokines produced by parenchyma (see e.g. PMID: 31297113).

However, there is broad consensus in the field that cells of the myeloid lineage are among the first sensors of LPS and therefore may be critical in determining the avalanche-like cytokine reaction including other cell types such as endothelial cells.</p><p>The reviewer mentions an interesting work (Skirecki et al., 2019), which investigates the early outcome-dependent inflammatory response in a humanized mouse model after cecal ligation and puncture induced sepsis. The findings of this study provide first numbers for the contribution of different cellular sources of cytokines in plasma before and after sepsis induction. However, the humanized mouse model does not allow to discriminate between first and second order cytokine responses and therefore has limited implications on current models, which assigns myeloid lineage cells and the complement system a central role in LPS sensing (Hotchkiss et al., 2016; Laudanski, 2021).</p><p>We also consider it as a strength of our paper that we challenged a circulating hypothesis based on a circadian mortality pattern upon LPS challenge in mice. While the results of our work cannot uncover the origin of this pattern, it clearly can rule out a pivotal role for myeloid clocks in its generation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should more critically discuss this alternative explanation.

However, we would like to emphasize that there is no statistical significant difference despite a rather large number of tested animals between the WT and the lysM-cre control mice.</p><p>Cre-lines are known to display a variety of hardly predictable side effects, namely cre-toxicity, target gene efficiency (Abram et al., 2015) and off-target gene activity (infidelity, Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007). In case of the LysM-cre mice, the two latter have been investigated by Clausen (Clausen et al., 1999). The authors conclude that the cre-activity is highly specific for myeloid cells and has an efficiency of about 80 % for monocytes / macrophages and more than 90 % for granulocytes. Similar values have been found by Abram et al. Cre-toxicity as the enzymatic attacking of so-called genomic pseudo-loxP sites has not been described so far for the LysM-cre mice. However, we cannot rule out such a possibility and there exist only few measures to control for such effects (Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky, 2007): 1. high level Cre expression for long time spans should be avoided – and this seems to be the case in the LysM-cre mice according to Claussen et al. 2. A LysM-cre control should be included in the analysis of conditional knock-out mice and this is exactly what we did in figure 2C. 3. The utilization of two different floxed mouse lines targeting the same transcription factor complex (Clock/Bmal1) further controls for circadian clock specific effects in our conditional knock-out experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Saying that DD mice show a &quot;three-fold increased susceptibility to LPS&quot; is true for very specific conditions only, and should not be used as a general statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We now see that the phrase &quot;susceptibility to LPS-induced mortality&quot; can be misleading. We therefore rephrased it to &quot;susceptibility to LPS&quot; (line 87), which should allow to not only compare the endpoints (i.e. mortality levels) but rather the sensitivity of the system at various levels of LPS dosing. In addition, we specified the interpretation of our data as being valid for the investigated conditions (lines 86ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Line 99-. Please be more precise in describing cytokine levels (for example, in LD, TNF peaks at ZT10, IL-18 at ZT14 or ZT22 but not ZT18, and IL-10 but not IL-12 peaks at ZT14).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to this ambiguous description of our data. When we thought about how to describe these data, we felt that the phases (peak times, Figure 1F) obtained by sinusoidal fitting might be better suited to provide general patterns than the actual values (Figure 1 E). Thus, instead of describing the true measured peak-times, we used the values, which have been determined by interpolation based on a sinusoidal -fit. We still believe that our way to describe these cytokine data is scientifically sound. To avoid reader confusion we have modified the relevant text and added some words to clarify the context (lines 108 + 109).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Line 105-106. Referring to Figure 1E, it is not straightforward for the reader to understand what is meant by &quot;free-running and entrained&quot; conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to this wording, which we apologize that it is written in &quot;chronobiology&quot; jargon. Since we clearly want to appeal to a broader readership with this work, we have added the information about the applied light conditions (lines 114 + 115).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Figure 5 and Sup Figure 5. They are huge differences in leukocytes counts between LysM-Cre+/+ and WT mice. Without being exhaustive, LysM-Cre+/+ display much more macrophages in bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes, DCs in lymph nodes, NK cells in spleen and lymph nodes at both CT8 and CT20. This is very puzzling and questions about the pertinence of these &quot;control&quot; mice. Additionally, one might expect from these observations that LysM-Cre+/+ mice are more sensitive to endotoxemia, which is not the case (point 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer, that the differences between the two control mouse strains in the two time-point experiments presented in figure 5 are huge, puzzling and contradicted our expectations. In part, these differences are diminished after we thoroughly reanalysed the FACS data as a consequence of errors in our previous gating settings. Still, large differences between LysM-Cre and WT mice of leukocyte subtype counts in various tissues remain (e.g. macrophages in spleen and lymphnodes, neutrophils in lymphnodes, CD4 T-cells in spleen).</p><p>Nevertheless, we consider the LysM-Cre mice to the most appropriate controls for the myeloid clock knock-out mouse strains (see also response to point 5). In our opinion, there is one point, which could be improved in a similar experiment – but we decided to not implement it for logistical and ethical reasons: If we had bred the knockout strains of the myeloid clock on a heterozygous genetic background for both floxed and cre alleles, it would have been possible for us to use littermate controls and thus also control genetic drift and the exact breeding conditions.</p><p>We would also like to mention that for one specific experimental aspect, namely the time-of-day dependent traffic of myeloid cell types, relative numbers between circadian time points and not between mouse strains are important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Line 257. The effect of IL-18 is not totally surprising, since both detrimental and protective effects of the cytokine have been reported in the literature. This could be briefly mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, that the protective role of IL-18 has been described previously (for a review see Dinarello et al., 2013). However, to our knowledge, these reports are based ona colitis model in mice, and we could not find reports about a protective role for IL-18 in sepsis.</p><p>We now mention this in the discussion in lines 271+272</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Sup Figure 5A. The gating strategy has to be shown for each organ, separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and added the gating strategies for every organ separately in the new Figure 5—figure supplements 1-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. Sup Figure 5D. The peritoneal cavity contains not only different macrophage populations with different inflammatory properties, but also different B cell populations including anti-inflammatory B-1a cells (plus NK cells, DCs…). Considering that LPS is injected i.p., more thorough analyses of the peritoneal cavity should performed to properly interpret results of cytokine and mortality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree with his or her assessment about the cellular composition of peritoneal cavity cells. Unfortunately, our lymphoid antibody panels used to analyze B, T, and NK cell populations did not allow finer differentiation for sub-B cell populations because of our preference for subpopulations of myeloid origin. We hope that the results shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 9 and 10 are nevertheless a sufficient representation of the major cell types in the peritoneal cavity to allow a thorough interpretation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. It is not clear whether endotoxemia was addressed with BMAL1 and CLOCK myeloid conditional knockout mice kept LD. Since time-of-day dependent differences in mortality were much less in DD mice (line 74), we probably expect only marginal differences in DD mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The point raised by the reviewer is related to point 8, as we failed to explicitly describe the light conditions for each experiment at the required locations. The endotoxemia experiments using myBmal-KO (Figure 2 A ) or myClock-KO mice (Figure 3 F) were performed in constant darkness (DD).</p><p>One of the main conclusions of our work presented in this manuscript is, that time-of-day dependent differences are equally pronounced in mice housed in LD and in DD. The reduction of these differences observed in Figure 1 A is due to a &quot;ceiling&quot; effect i.e. increased susceptibility in mice housed in DD.</p><p>We have added the information on the light conditions for each experiment unless this has been done explicitly before (see also comment on point 9).</p></body></sub-article></article>
