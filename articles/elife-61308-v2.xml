Langerhans is hypothesized to facilitate synchronized insulin secretion among β cells, yet testing this in vivo in the intact pancreas is challenging. Robo βKO mice, in which the genes <italic>Robo1</italic> and <italic>Robo2</italic> are deleted selectively in β cells, provide a unique model of altered islet spatial architecture without loss of β cell differentiation or islet damage from diabetes. Combining Robo βKO mice with intravital microscopy, we show here that Robo βKO islets have reduced synchronized intra-islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations among β cells in vivo. We provide evidence that this loss is not due to a β cell-intrinsic function of Robo, mis-expression or mis-localization of Cx36 gap junctions, or changes in islet vascularization or innervation, suggesting that the islet architecture itself is required for synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. These results have implications for understanding structure-function relationships in the islets during progression to diabetes as well as engineering islets from stem cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group

pancreas, are highly organized microorgans responsible for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. Islets are composed of five endocrine cell types (α, β, δ, PP, and ε), which, in adult rodents, are arranged such that the β cells cluster in the core of the islet, while other non-β endocrine cells populate the islet periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orci and Unger, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeifer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erlandsen et al., 1976</xref>). This configuration heavily prioritizes homotypic over heterotypic contacts between endocrine cells. Mature human islet architecture is more complex, and, though its exact organization pattern is still debated, it appears to follow a non-random distribution of the different endocrine cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonner-Weir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bosco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brissova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cabrera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dybala and Hara, 2019</xref>) and prioritize homotypic over heterotypic interactions between endocrine cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kilimnik et al., 2012</xref>). Though islet architecture is thought to be fairly static in healthy adult humans and rodents, it is quite dynamic during development, pregnancy, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dolenšek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nair and Hebrok, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sharon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sznurkowska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bocian-Sobkowska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kharouta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rieck and Kaestner, 2010</xref>). In diabetes, rodent and human islet architecture is disrupted, resulting in endocrine cell intermixing and a reduction in the ratios of homotypic versus heterotypic cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brereton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilimnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Striegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). How islet architecture and endocrine cell-type sorting within the islet affect islet function remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steiner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Homotypic interactions between β cells are important for synchronous glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In GSIS, glucose from the blood enters β cells through glucose transporters and is metabolized, causing an increase in the ratio of intracellular ATP/ADP. This increase in ATP/ADP triggers closure of ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels, resulting in membrane depolarization and the opening of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, triggering an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell, which in turn promotes exocytosis of insulin granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ammälä et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertram et al., 2010</xref>). This process is cyclical and thus oscillatory. In dispersed islets, which have no cell-cell contacts, β cells display heterogenous uncoordinated oscillations in membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at both basal and elevated glucose, which results in high basal insulin secretion and low uncoordinated GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halban et al., 1982</xref>). In intact islets, where homotypic interactions between β cells are present, the oscillations in membrane potential, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), and insulin secretion that underlie GSIS are respectively synchronous at elevated glucose and relatively silent at low glucose. This synchronous or ‘pulsatile’ pattern of insulin secretion from islets is thought to underlie pulsatile insulin levels in circulating blood, a quality important for keeping the peripheral tissues insulin sensitive, for robust liver response to insulin signaling, and for allowing time for replenishment of the readily releasable pool of insulin granules in β cells. Thus, perturbations in pulsatility are thought to contribute to diabetes pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matveyenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pedersen and Sherman, 2009</xref>). Indeed, pulsatile insulin levels in circulating blood of mouse models of diabetes and patients with diabetes, pre-diabetes, and non-diabetic family members of diabetic patients are often disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Rahilly et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>One mechanism through which homotypic β cell-β cell contacts can synchronize GSIS is through electrical coupling. Within an islet, β cells are electrically coupled to their homotypic neighbors via varying levels of Connexin36 (Cx36) gap junctions that allow for exchange of cations between neighboring β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farnsworth et al., 2014</xref>). β cells coupled by these gap junctions display varying levels of excitability and metabolic rates, aspects which themselves are thought to display a non-random spatial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hraha et al., 2014</xref>). This coupling of spatially organized heterogenous β cells populations creates an electrical syncytium that responds homogenously to glucose such that, at low glucose levels, insulin secretion is inhibited through repression of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations across the islet, but at high glucose levels, pulsatile insulin secretion occurs through synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations that spread in fast waves across the islet from distinct initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farnsworth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hraha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skelin Klemen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benninger and Piston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Westacott et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benninger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kravets, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ravier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Speier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Head et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, in silico modeling experiments showed that decreasing the ratio of homotypic β cell-β cell nearest neighbors is predicted to result in perturbation to synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Head et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nittala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoang et al., 2016</xref>). A highly functionally connected subpopulation of β cells, termed ‘hub’ or ‘leader’ cells, may also direct synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, oscillations by harboring a disproportionate amount of functional connections to other β cells, a property allowed for by a high frequency of homotypic interactions between β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salem et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is thus hypothesized that disrupting proper endocrine cell type sorting in the islet in a way that distorts the relative amount of homotypic β cell-β cell contacts, even without affecting any other property of the cell, would be sufficient to disrupt synchronized oscillatory behavior among β cells. However, direct empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. This is because of the fact that while most genetic mouse models that show abnormally disorganized islet architecture also display defects in glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brereton et al., 2015</xref>), the disrupted islet architecture is usually linked to either developmental defects in β cell differentiation or maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gannon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahlgren et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Borden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doyle and Sussel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sinagoga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jimenez-Caliani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastidas-Ponce et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crawford et al., 2009</xref>) or to pathologies related to β cell damage in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilimnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Szabat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brissova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baetens et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Starich et al., 1991</xref>). This introduces a strong confounding factor for studying the role of islet architecture in islet function. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle the relative effect of β cell-intrinsic defects and whole-islet architectural defects, such as reduced ratio of homotypic β cell-β cell contacts, on perturbation of synchronous oscillations that underlie normal GSIS.</p><p>Recently, we have described a mouse model in which the cell-surface receptors <italic>Robo1</italic> and <italic>Robo2</italic> are deleted specifically in β cells (Robo βKO), resulting in disruption of canonical endocrine cell-type sorting within the islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike other models of disrupted islet architecture and endocrine cell-type sorting in the islet, the β cells in the islets of Robo βKO express normal levels of markers for β cell differentiation, functional maturity, and regulation of GSIS, and show normal β cell-intrinsic response to glucose. We reasoned that this model would allow us to test the role of islet architecture and endocrine cell-type sorting in regulating synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in response to glucose among β cells in a fully differentiated, non-diabetic islet setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robo βKO islets have a decreased ratio of homotypic β cell-β cell contacts but their β cells are functionally mature</title><p>In silico simulations where the degree of β cell-β cell coupling is changed through a decrease in homotypic nearest neighbors predict that disruption of islet architecture will disrupt synchronous intra-islet [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations and pulsatile hormone secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nittala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoang et al., 2016</xref>).

Quantification of this asynchronous behavior through correlation analysis of GCaMP6s activity within individual Robo βKO islets revealed significant reduction in areas of intra-islet correlated oscillations compared to controls that could not be attributed to differences in the proportion of GCaMP6s-positive cells with elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activity between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, this difference in synchroneity could not be attributed to islet size as there was no correlation between size of synchronous area and islet size in either control or Robo βKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>). Further, some asynchronous Robo βKO islets showed spatially distinct areas that oscillated synchronously with immediate β cell neighbors but not with more distant regions of the islet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4,</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>).

To assess whether the amount of innervation within the islets of Robo βKO differs from that of control islets, we stained pancreatic sections for the pan-neuronal marker Tubb3 and quantified the area of nerves normalized to islet area, and saw no difference in innervation between control and Robo βKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if there were changes in the amount of intra-islet vasculature in Robo βKO mice, we quantified the amount of matrix components secreted by vessels as a surrogate for vasculature (laminin and collagen IV) in Robo βKO and control islets. We observed no significant difference in area of vessel matrix components between Robo βKO and control islets for either of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Despite the similar amount of vasculature in Robo βKO islets, it is possible that the pattern of vascularization may differ in such a way that delivery of glucose to certain regions of the islet is perturbed or delayed due to insufficient vascular coverage throughout the islet. To test whether glucose perfusion from the blood vessels was similar across the islet in Robo βKO compared to controls, we performed intravital imaging of islets during intravenous injection of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Videos 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">9</xref>).

We show that in Robo βKO islets, which possess disorganized islets architecture that results in a lower frequency of homotypic β cell-β cell interaction, synchronized [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in the islet are disrupted. This disruption of synchronized [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations is not due to loss of functional β cell maturation and identity, altered Robo-mediated β cell-intrinsic defects in glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, loss of Cx36 expression or localization to the β cell membrane, loss of innervation, or change in amount or pattern of islet vascularization, suggesting that endocrine cell-type sorting within the islet is, by itself, important for islet function, at least in the aspect of coordinated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations among β cells.</p><p>Robo, and its ligand Slit, have been previously shown to affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in β cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). However, Robo-mediated β cell-intrinsic effects are likely not the cause of asynchronous in vivo [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in Robo βKO islets. This is supported by two independent observations: (1) single-cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in dissociated β cells triggered by glucose stimulus in vitro are similar between Robo βKO and control, and (2) a subset of Robo βKO islets analyzed in vivo still show synchronized whole-islet [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations despite the absence of Robo. Further, this phenotypic heterogeneity is likely not due to an incomplete deletion of <italic>Robo</italic> because during Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments all islets were detected by the fluorescent labeling of β cells with the H2B-mCherry lineage-tracing reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2018</xref>), which uses the same Cre deriver that is used to delete <italic>Robo</italic> in those β cells. Thus, high expression of H2B-mCherry suggests efficient recombination of the <italic>Robo</italic> floxed allele. All this together support the conclusion that loss of synchronized [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations is caused by a β cell-extrinsic mechanism, such as the reduction in frequency of homotypic interactions between β cells observed in Robo βKO islets.</p><p>Robo receptors have known roles in angiogenesis and axon guidance, and thus could affect precisely how the islet is innervated and vascularized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blockus and Chédotal, 2016</xref>). However, we found that the amount of innervation and vascularization between Robo βKO islets and controls is similar, suggesting that abnormal vascularization or innervation are likely not the cause of disruption in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations found in Robo βKO islets. Additionally, our intravital imaging experiments show that the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NDBG delivered intravenously reaches all portions of Robo βKO islets within the same time frame as control islets. Thus, incomplete or delayed glucose perfusion across the islet due to improper islet vascularization is likely not the cause of asynchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in Robo βKO islets.</p><p>One possible cause for asynchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in Robo βKO islets is through disrupted coupling between β cells. Interestingly, the observed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillation phenotype in Robo βKO islets is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in heterozygous Cx36 mutants where the level of synchroneity in whole-islet [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is highly variable from islet to islet. This suggested that Cx36-mediated gap junction coupling may be reduced in Robo βKO islets, possibly through reduction or mis-localization of Cx36. However, we found that the area of Cx36 was not different between Robo βKO and controls, and that Cx36 gap junctions still localized to the correct intracellular domain at β cell borders in Robo βKO islets. Thus, we hypothesized that coupling may be reduced instead by a reduction in the number of homotypic β cell-β cell interactions across the islet, which could reduce the overall functional connectivity. In line with this hypothesis, we found a significant reduction in β cell homotypic interactions in Robo βKO islets compared to controls, and a significant reduction in islet connectivity as determined by network analysis. We also observed a significant increase in the standard deviation of average islet connectivity in our network analysis, which indicates that cells within Robo βKO islets show more variability in their level of functional connections than controls. We further hypothesized that if homotypic β cell coupling is disrupted across the islet by a decrease in frequency of homotypic β cell interactions, it could possibly affect the number of hub cells within Robo βKO islets. Since hub cells are thought to direct synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations among β cells within an islet, it is conceivable that disruption of this subpopulation would affect synchronous GSIS. Indeed, our network analysis revealed a trend towards a lower percent of hub cells found in Robo βKO islets compared to controls that reached statistical significance after outlier analysis. Further, we found that the average clustering coefficient (C<sub>avg</sub>) and global efficiency (E<sub>glob</sub>) of the networks in Robo βKO islets trended towards being lower than controls (p=0.05 for both), which is indicative of a reduction in small world properties of the network. Taken together, these results suggest that reduction in frequency of homotypic interactions reduces overall coupling and increases the variability of coupling between β cells in the islet, thus disrupting synchronous [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations, possibly in part due to a reduction in hub cells and loss of small world network properties. However, a direct comparison between amount of homotypic interactions and the degree of gap junction coupling or synchroneity in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations within the same islet remains to be tested as this task is beyond the reach of the intravital imaging system used in our experiments. With the advent of the acute pancreatic slice method, this should be feasible as live measurements like [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis to test gap junction coupling, and <italic>post hoc</italic> staining of fixed slices for architectural analysis of the same slice are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marciniak et al., 2014</xref>). An important future experiment would thus be to test the level of gap junction coupling and synchroneity of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations, along with the frequency of homotypic interactions within the same islet to directly correlate frequency of β cell homotypic contacts to the level of coupling and synchronous oscillatory behavior using this method.</p><p>Another possible factor that contributes to the aberrant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in Robo βKO islets is disruption of paracrine and autocrine signaling between endocrine cells, caused by the increased heterotypic and decreased homotypic β cell interactions in these islets. The spatial islet architecture dictates the types and amounts of paracrine and autocrine interactions among the different cell types, and these interactions are thought to regulate synchronous GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benninger and Hodson, 2018</xref>). For example, α cells and δ cells, which secrete glucagon and somatostatin respectively, were shown to affect cAMP oscillations in β cells, which are important for synchronizing β cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations during the second phase of insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hodson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grapengiesser et al., 2003</xref>). β cells may also be able to electrically couple to neighboring δ cells, and depolarization of β cells may thus trigger secretion of somatostatin from connected δ cells, which in turn could affect islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> and electrical dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Briant et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, ATP, which is co-secreted with insulin from β cells, has an autocrine effect such that it binds purinergic receptors on β cells to help synchronize electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hellman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tudurí et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, receptor-ligand interactions occurring between neighboring β cell have also been shown to affect GSIS independent of electrical coupling. This is demonstrated by the fact that dissociated wildtype β cells have worse GSIS than intact islets lacking Cx36 gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benninger et al., 2011</xref>). EphA-ephrinA binding between β cells has been identified as a mechanism that can govern this coupling-independent enhancement of GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Konstantinova et al., 2007</xref>). These interactions rely on β cell-β cell contact and thus could be disrupted if the ratio of homotypic interactions in the islet were reduced; however, this particular effect is likely downstream of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations and thus less likely to contribute to the oscillation phenotype observed in Robo βKO islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benninger et al., 2011</xref>). Ultimately, the spatial arrangement of endocrine cell types within the islet dictates the extent to which these paracrine, autocrine, and cell surface receptor-ligand interactions occur within the microenvironment, and thus changing this architecture would likely affect emergent electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics to some degree. Thus, while we propose that defects in synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in response to glucose in Robo βKO islets are largely due to inefficient β cell coupling as a result of decreased homotypic β cell interactions in these islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farnsworth et al., 2014</xref>), it is also possible that changes in paracrine and autocrine signaling, as well as cell surface receptor-ligand interactions, contribute to this phenomenon.</p><p>Several patterns of [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations have been described in islets in vitro, in both isolated islets and acute pancreas tissue slices: slow oscillations with a period between ~3 and 5 min, fast oscillations with periods &lt;1 min, and mixed oscillations consisting of fast oscillations superimposed on the plateau fraction of slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ravier et al., 2002</xref>). The Dual Oscillator Model proposes that these slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are controlled by intrinsic glycolytic oscillations and set the period for pulsatile insulin secretion, whereas the fast oscillations result from feedback of ions on their respective channels and control the amount of insulin secreted by dictating the plateau fraction of the slow oscillations. Thus it is of interest if these same oscillation patterns observed in vitro in wildtype islets also occur in vivo. We observed fast, slow, and mixed oscillations in vivo in control islets, with the most common pattern being mixed and the least common being fast alone, demonstrating that these patterns are not an artifact of in vitro Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging but occur in vivo in response to IP glucose injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Slow oscillations in control islets with &gt;80% correlated area had periods ranging from ~1 min to as long as ~10.3 min. For fast oscillations, periods ranged from ~4 s to at least ~20 s and possibly as slow as ~31 s though this high end of the range may be inflated due to possible undersampling from islets imaged at ~0.1 Hz. However, we chose to include islets imaged at ~0.1 Hz in this table because the slow oscillation speed is accurately measured and this imaging speed still confirms the presence of fast oscillations and thus provides information about oscillation pattern (i.e., mixed vs. slow). Interestingly, islets coming from the same mouse tended to have more similar oscillation periods, a property which has been observed in vitro as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nunemaker et al., 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, due to the restraints imposed by our current intravital imaging protocol, we cannot know the exact duration of and/or concentration of glucose exposure within the islet during imaging.</p><p>Though the unsynchronized phenotype in Robo βKO islets is clear from the videos we captured at approximately 1 Hz, 0.2 Hz, 0.1 Hz, and 0.03 Hz, we note that other recent experiments that analyzed network dynamics in islets were performed at an imaging speed of 1 Hz or faster. That said, we believe that it is important to capture [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics in 3D in order to ensure we are not biased by examining certain ‘synchronized regions’ that would not be representative of the islet dynamics as a whole. We would further argue that the slow oscillations we observe are on a ~1–10 min time scale, and therefore sampling these oscillations even at a frequency of 1 frame per 10s of seconds is sufficient for capturing synchronicity. Additionally, when we imaged at 1 Hz, we observed the same pattern of oscillations in Robo βKO islets and controls as was observed in slower imaging speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, our analyses of network dynamics in simulated islets showed that functional connections and phase lag can still be accurately measured with time resolution as low as 0.1 Hz (the slowest we simulated), with only a modest loss in sensitivity (data not shown). Thus, though our imaging speeds may cause underestimation of loss in coordinated area or functional connections, it is still sensitive enough to observe the robust difference in network dynamics between Robo βKO islets and controls at these imaging speeds.</p><p>We also note that the mosaic GCaMP6s expression, which results from infection of AAV8-RIP-GCaMP6s, is variable between islets and does not allow monitoring of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in all β cells across the islet. However, the distribution of GCaMP6s in these islets is similar if not broader than what is achievable with incubation of commonly used Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes that have proven successful in measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the islet. Specifically, the AAV8 we used penetrates into the core of the islets instead of just the superficial layers as is often seen with Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye incubation, allowing for equal if not greater representation of the islet in imaging. Thus, though GCaMP6s expression is mosaic and variable between islets, the expression is comparable to other common methods that have been useful in assessing Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. However, future experiments would benefit from using the genetically encoded GCaMP6s floxed allele combined with a β cell-specific Cre driver to increase whole-islet resolution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data thus supports the hypothesis that disrupting proper endocrine cell-type sorting in the islet in a way that distorts the relative amount of homotypic β cell-β cell contacts, without affecting β cell-intrinsic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics, is sufficient to disrupt synchronized [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations among β cells. These results lend evidence to the idea that correct spatial islet architecture is important for islet function, and may have an important impact on understanding islet dysfunction in diabetes, and on approaches to generate functionally better islets from stem cells in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Islets were defined as all mCherry+ cells that were direct neighbors with multiple other mCherry+ cells within a cluster. Islets were initially selected as showing activity through blinded selection by two separate researchers who are knowledgeable about islet [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics and who did not perform the imaging. If either researcher determined any islet to be inactive, the islet was not used for analysis. From this assessment, 16 out of 22 control islets and 18 out of 23 Robo βKO islets were determined to be active. Subsequent analysis was also performed blinded to genotype. For activity analysis, images were smoothed using a 5 × 5 pixel averaging filter. Areas without significant fluorescence were removed. Saturated areas were also removed by limiting the area to intensity below the maximum value. Photobleaching was low, and as such could be approximated as a linear decline. Thus any linear trend was removed to correct for minimal photobleaching. Any islets with significant motion artifacts were removed or time courses were shortened to the time over which no significant movement occurred (displacement of &lt;0.5 cell width). For the time course of each pixel in the image with significant fluorescence, a peak detection algorithm was used to determine if the areas had peak amplitudes significantly above background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Westacott et al., 2017b</xref>). A region was considered ‘active’ if the corresponding time course for each pixel had a peak amplitude &gt;1.5× background. The fraction of active area was calculated as the number of pixels detected as ‘active’ across all z-planes, normalized to the total number of pixels that showed significant fluorescence across all z-planes that were not saturated. Coordination was determined based on coincident timing of identified peaks, where areas were segmented by identified peaks occurring at similar time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Westacott et al., 2017b</xref>). The cross-correlation of the time courses for two 5 × 5 pixel subregion was taken. If the correlation coefficient was &gt;0.7, then the two subregions were considered highly coordinated and merged into a larger region. The coordinated area was calculated as the number of pixels in the largest area of coordination across all z-planes normalized to the total number of pixels of the islet that were determined to be ‘active’ for all planes. This analysis is based on previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Westacott et al., 2017b</xref>), but adjusted for three-dimensional data.</p><p>Phase lag and wave propagation speed was determined, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>. For every 5 × 5 region, the phase lag was calculated from a Fourier transform of each time course. Only regions with a correlation coefficient of &gt;0.7 when compared to the islet average were used. First, the peak frequency was identified from the power spectrum, as generated from a Fourier transform of the islet average time course. The phase lag was only calculated for the peak frequency. The phase lag was calculated from the difference in phase between the maximum phase region and the minimum phase region and converted into a time lag according to (<italic>dt </italic>= (1/<italic>f</italic>) * tan^(−1)(ϕ1 − ϕ2)), where φ1−φ2 is the phase difference, and <italic>f</italic> is the sampling frequency of the time courses analyzed. Speed was calculated by dividing the distance between the maximum phase lag and minimum phase lag regions by the time lag. For phase and speed analysis, only islets with &gt;80% coordinated area was used. If the islets did not show a clear phase transition across the islet, they were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>All statistical analysis was performed in Prism (GraphPad) or MATLAB. If the data were determined to follow a normal distribution, an F-test was used to determine if variances were equal, then a Student’s t-test or Welch t-test (for unequal variance) were utilized. If a normal distribution could not be verified for the data, a Mann–Whitney test was utilized for determining significance. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Network and hub analysis</title><p>The network analysis is based upon that previously applied to study islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stožer et al., 2013</xref>). First, a single plane in the z-stack was chosen that showed the greatest coverage of GCaMP6s signal. Visible cells were manually identified and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> time courses for each cell were derived. To remove bias, an equal number of islets from each temporal resolution were used for both the control and knockout. There was no difference in results between islets imaged at a speed of 0.1, 0.2, and 1 Hz. Adjacency matrices for an islet were created using the corr() function in MATLAB to compare the entire time course between each cell and calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient between cells in a pairwise manner. Diagonals were set to 0 as cells are not considered synchronized with themselves. The control group was used to set the R_th threshold (as set forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stožer et al., 2013</xref>). All control time courses showed a power law with R_th = 0.98. However, the threshold for analysis was set to 0.95 because most Robo βKO islets did not show any connectivity with R_th at 0.98, which thus prevented comparisons. This threshold was statistically significant for p&lt;0.001 for all islets.</p><p>To identify β cell hubs, a probability distribution was created by counting the number of cells that had X number of links, for all values of X. Cells with zero links were not plotted in the histogram but were considered in the subsequent analysis. Hubs were identified based on the percent of cells that are synchronized (linked) being more than 25% of the islet. This allows for size invariance and consistency for comparison between control and KO groups. In contrast in the methods set forth in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>, hubs are considered cells with more than 60% of the islet’s connections. The number of hubs was then normalized by islet size. This is dependent on the individual islet probability distribution function, and inter-islet comparison is contingent on the fact that the islets follow the same network distribution. This is not necessarily the case when comparing control and Robo βKO islets.</p><p>The clustering coefficient was calculated as the number of connections for cell(i) divided by the number of possible connections. Because no constraints were placed on possible connections, this was the total number of cells in the islet – 1. The average clustering coefficient presents the mean of C for all cells.</p><p>Global efficiency was calculated as follows. First, shortest path length was calculated with MATLAB function graphallshortestpaths(). This function uses the Johnston et al. algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>) to find the shortest path between every pair of cell in the islet. For example, the path length between cell(i) and cell(j) is 1 if they are directly synchronized, or 2 if cell(i) is not synchronized with cell(j), but each is synchronized with cell(k). Cells without any path connecting them were not considered. Finally, the characteristic path length (L) was calculated by summing up all nonzero path lengths normalized to total possible connections (size * (size-1)). The global efficiency is related to the inverse of global path length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Latora and Marchiori, 2001</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="}" open="{" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vitro single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>Islets were isolated according to standard protocol from adult Robo βKO and control mice. For islet dispersion, 12 mm round No. 1.5 coverslips contained in a 24-well plate were pre-coated overnight with 50 μL 1:15000 PEI (Sigma P3143) overnight. Groups of 50–100 mouse islets were dispersed into single cells in 3 mL Accutase (Thermo Fisher A1110501) at 37°C for 10 min. During the incubation, PEI was replaced with 100 μL Geltrex (Thermo Fisher A1413302) and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C, followed by removal of excess Geltrex. The cells were washed once with islet culture medium (RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS [v/v], 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin [Invitrogen]) and resuspended in 1 mL medium before plating 500 μL per coverslip. The plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g and cultured overnight before imaging. For measurements of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, dispersed islet cells were pre-incubated in 5 µM Fura2-AM (Thermo Fisher F1201) in islet media containing 11.1 mM glucose for 45 min at 37°C, followed by 15 min incubation in islet media containing 2.7 mM glucose. Coverslips were transferred to a RC-48LP imaging chamber (Warner Instruments) mounted on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope equipped with a 20×/0.75N.A. SuperFluor objective and PerfectFocus (Nikon Instruments). The chamber was perfused with a standard external solution containing 135 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, and glucose as indicated (pH 7.35). The flow rate was set to 0.4 mL/min (Fluigent MCFS-EZ) and temperature was maintained at 33°C using solution and chamber heaters (Warner Instruments). Excitation was provided by a SOLA SE II 365 (Lumencor) set to 10% output and an inline neutral density filter (Nikon ND4). Fluorescence emission was collected with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 V2 Digital CMOS camera at 0.1 Hz. Excitation (x) and emission (m) filters were used in combination with a ET FURA2/GFP C164605 dichroic (Chroma): Fura2, ET365/20x, ET535/30m; mCherry ET572/35x, and ET632/60m. β cells were identified by the expression of mCherry.

all appreciated your efforts to deal with the concerns raised, and recognised the importance of this work and the insights it provides both on the function of Robo in the β cell and to the development of a sophisticated in vivo imaging technology. They also recognised your further refinements and elaboration of calcium imaging within the islet in the living animal but understood that further improvements to this approach, notably to increase the speed of data capture, would be best suited to a future study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of synchronized β cell response to glucose in Robo deficient islets of Langerhans in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David James as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andras Stozer (Reviewer #1); Marjan Slak Rupnik (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The authors have used an elegant approach to image pancreatic islet calcium dynamics in vivo (whose feasibility was demonstrated recently by the Linnemann laboratory; https://pmlegacy.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186447 ) to assess the impact of Robo1 and Robo2 deletion, posited to have an effect on the islet only to change the distribution of endocrine cells within the micro-organ and therefore, conceivably, to affect calcium waves and connectivity via altered gap junction connectivity. The authors argue that the impact of Robo1/2 deletion on islet stability is so drastic that islets fall apart upon isolation, precluding in vitro studies.</p><p>Although of interest, the manuscript is quite preliminary in many respects, and new work is required to make a compelling case for publication. As detailed below, essential revisions will therefore involve: assessment of the impact of Robo1/2 deletion on Connexin distribution; the impact of deletion on gap junction coupling using dyes; and assessment of the possibility that heterogeneity in calcium wave conduction between islets reflects differences in the extent of disruption of islet architecture (degree of inter-mingling of endocrine cell types). More careful and extensive description of the literature, particularly around intercellular coupling, network behaviour etc is also.</p><p>1. The authors infer that preserved calcium waves in a proportion of Robo KO islets likely reflects preserved architecture. This needs to be checked post facto by appropriate staining of the different cell types</p><p>2. On the same theme, some ROBO islets show synchronous intra-islet regions. Moreover, some ROBO islets such as the one shown in Movie 6 are indistinguishable from WT in terms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Are the regions/islets, which show synchronous oscillations indeed the ones with preserved architecture i.e. normal homotypic interactions of the β-cells? This can be examined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging followed by IHC analysis of the islets (as in Figure 1) – provided that the same islet can be monitored using imaging and then processed for IHC.</p><p>3. Acquisition speeds are very low (max 0.2 Hz) so that – as the authors accept – only very low speed Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves can be detected. I am not full persuaded that imaging throughout the islet in 3D is justified. This limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the study, and comparisons to many recent reports (see 3/) where acquisition times &gt;1 Hz are used. Surprisingly, recent and earlier reports from the laboratories of Stozer, Rupnik (see below), Hodson, JCI, 2013; Rutter, Cell Metab, 2016; Ninov, Nat Metab, 2019 on network dynamics and hub/follower behaviour are missing. The authors are rightly cautious about discussing the possibility that Robo deletion impacts these behaviours given the limitations of the data acquisition (low speed), but this work still needs to be properly cited and put into context.</p><p>Moreover, if a higher sampling reduces the measured coordination even further, than this coordination is likely not physiologically relevant. The images as collected a 512x512, but smoothed 5x5 for analysis. Would it not be better to collect 100x100 images directly and image 25x faster to check the physiological significance of coordination of oscillations? Discussion and comparisons required.</p><p>4. Limited expression of GCamP6 across the islet e.g. Supp. Figure 2 poses a problem in terms of accurately reporting Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave transduction. Fuller description of this limitation and its impact are needed</p><p>5.The assessment of Cx36 expression is Figure 6 is not wholly compelling: is the protein actually localised at the plasma membrane or some other (intracellular?) site. Higher resolution light or electron microscopy are needed. The authors provide a hypothesis that preferential homotypic contact allows for a necessary amount of gap junctions to form. Observed reduction of homotypic contacts between the β cells is not associated with the reduction of Cx36 expression, and it is therefore not clear what is meant by the missing necessary amount of gap junctions? Furthermore, colocalization of Cx36 should not be considered equal to functional gap junctions, and smaller fraction of homotypic nearest neighbors in Robo betaKO β cells does not necessarily equal limited capacity to electrically couple. The question is how is the junctional conductance distributed within an islet? The published data describes a complex temporal pattern of fluctuations in junctional conductance between the β cell pairs, but overall islet junctional conductance is conserved (Jusup et al., 2020, Biophys J).</p><p>6. The claim that Gap junctions are properly formed in ROBO KO islets needs substantiation using a functional assay. For example, the authors should apply fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to assess GJ function, as described before by Farnsworth et al. (PMID: 25172942), or other means to monitor GJ permeability.</p><p>7. In the Introduction, the view that mouse/rodent islets are of the classical mantle-core type may be a bit too simplified. I suggest that the authors consider/point out the possibility that at least some of the islets, at least during some normal/pathological developmental stages may display other architectures, of which some may be close to the more complex human architecture. I strongly believe that the study could benefit from this addition, since the authors strongly argue for the importance of structure in determining function. In other words, architectural patterns deviating from the textbook core-mantle paradigm may indicate important adaptations to normal (pregnancy, age) or pathological (hyperglycemia) stimuli. For sure, this is something that adds to the importance of their study. Some of the additional useful references are for example:</p><p>Dolensek et al., Islets 2015.</p><p>Steiner et al., Islets 2010.</p><p>Orci, Lancet 1975.</p><p>Pfeifer, Struct Biol 2015.</p><p>Erlandsen, Histochem Cytochem 1976.</p><p>Kharouta, Diab Res Clin Pract 2009.</p><p>8. In the introduction, gap-junctional coupling is pointed out as the only important synchronizing mechanism affected by homotypical interactions/cell-cell contacts. A number of other structural and functional coupling mechanism have been proposed to operate in islets and practically all of them could also be disrupted by changes in β cell clustering within islets. I think that these additional coupling mechanisms deserve to be mentioned in the introduction and be briefly touched upon in the discussion. In fact, since Cx36 expression/distribution pattern does not seem to be affected in this model, these other modes of communication may account for at least a part of the explanation for all possible putative mechanisms, not only diffusible factors. Some of the additional useful references in this regard are:</p><p>Eberhard and Lammert, Curr Opin Gen Develop 2009.</p><p>Skelin et al., Islets 2017.</p><p>Benninger et al., J Physiol 2011.</p><p>Benninger and Hodson, Diabetes 2018.</p><p>Rutter and Hodson, Mol Endo 2014.</p><p>Benninger and Piston, Trend Endocrinol Metab 2014.</p><p>9. In Results, the authors support their choice of intravital islet imaging by the fact that during isolation, islets of Robo betaKO mice dissociate, rendering them unsuitable for in vitro analyses of whole-islet Ca oscillations. However, the acute tissue slice method (Speier and Rupnik, Eur J Physiol 2005) has been developed to enable in vitro studies in genetic models with (even more) strongly disrupted architecture. This method was successfully coupled with multicellular confocal Ca imaging (Stozer et al., PLoS One 2013) and is suitable for highest spatial and temporal resolution Ca recordings and I believe that it should be at least briefly mentioned as an option for future studies of Ca imaging in this genetic model. Another experimental solution for cases like this are islets transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye (Speier et al., Nat Protocol 2008). Both the tissue slice and ACE transplantation method are closer to the in vivo situation in terms of architecture than isolated islets. Of course, in vivo recordings are a step even further, but may not be required in all cases in the future. Moreover, the limits of temporal resolution in an in vivo setup (0.2 Hz in your case) may not allow for analyses of more detailed aspects of intra-islet Ca signalling, such as speed waves, pacemaker location, network analyses etc.</p><p>10. To account for the possibility of intrinsic effects of Robo KO on the ability of β cells to respond with Ca oscillations, the authors resorted to imaging Ca oscillations in dissociated β cells. It should be pointed out that this process may per se influence the ability of any β cell to produce Ca oscillations and the nature of the oscillations in isolated and coupled cells may differ importantly (fast vs. slow). Whilst this experiment is important, the fact that some islets or some parts of islets in KO mice showed well synchronized activity in vivo is a much stronger indicator that KO β cells are not intrinsically unable to respond with normal Ca oscillations, given that the Robo gene is truly knocked-out (evidence for this is provided in the Discussion)! My suggestion would be to put the in vitro experiments first, and then the in vivo observations as the more convincing second argument/line of evidence.</p><p>Also, a short discussion on the nature of observed Ca oscillations is warranted. Are the in vivo observed oscillations fast or slow or mixed? Sometimes, fast oscillations are superimposed on slower ones. The fast may have periods as low as 2-3 seconds. Therefore, some may have been missed. Therefore, a recording speed of 2 frames per 10 seconds may not be sufficient in all cases.</p><p>11. Some of the presented traces seem to provide enough spatiotemporal detail to quantify cells that responded first during a given Ca oscillation and the ones that followed. Also, the speed of Ca »waves« could be assessed, quantified, and compared between CTRLs and KOs. Please comment briefly.</p><p>12. Functional connectivity patterns would also be interesting to assess to provide an additional rough idea on the degree of coupling and changes to it (Stozer et al., PLoS Comput Biol 2013, Hodson et al., JCI 2013). Are your data able to support such analyses, at least in the future? Since you have calculated R values, this seems to be a realistic option.</p><p>13. The authors should examine the innervation of the ROBO KO islets and make sure that innervation is normal. An aberrant innervation can explain the Ca<sup>2+</sup> phenotype of ROBO KO islets and it would argue against the central claim that defects in homotypic interactions are responsible for the reduced synchronicity (and not an external factor such as aberrant innervation).</p><p>14. In terms of vascularization of ROBO KO islets, a functional test should be performed in order to check for proper vascular delivery of glucose using the 2-NBDG uptake-assay, as described previously by Jacob et al., (PMID: 31914664).</p><p>15. The title is misleading since 36% of Robo betaKO are fully synchronized. Additionally, synchronization between the β cells in a normal islet is not a universal and required feature of β cell activity. At physiological glucose concentrations and at the beginning of the recording, the networks of β cells in an islet are preferentially segregated and they only integrate, leading to fully synchronized activity, only at unphysiologically high glucose and prolonged stimulations (Stožer et al., 2013 PLOS One, Markovic et al., 2015, Sci Rep, Stožer et al., 2019, Front Physiol).</p><p>16. It is a pity the KCl traces are not shown. The question is, why should KCl stimulus trigger an improved response and glucose not? All steps distal to membrane depolarization should actually be the same.</p><p>17. Statistics presented are slightly redundant (text, figure, figure legend) and inconsistent. For example, p-value significance is different in the text referring to Figure 1D, as it is in the figure 1D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61308.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although of interest, the manuscript is quite preliminary in many respects, and new work is required to make a compelling case for publication.

As discussed in our correspondence with the Editors, Robo β-KO islets are difficult to study in vitro because they fall apart during isolation. We have attempted to visualize coordinated calcium oscillations in acute pancreatic slices in collaboration with the labs of Matt Merrins (Wisconsin), Richard Benninger (Colorado), and Joana Almaca (Miami). Unfortunately, using the slice approach, none of our collaborators observe slow β cell calcium oscillations we see in our intravital experiments, making it difficult to compare between approaches. To the best of our knowledge, the only report of oscillatory activity observed in pancreatic slices is from a bioRxiv preprint by the Stozer and Rupnik labs (DOI: 10.1101/2020.03.11.986893v1), and in this case the calcium waves are fast oscillations (and examined without post-imaging immunofluorescence). We agree that post-facto staining of Robo β-KO would add a strong support of our argument that loss of synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in our model is directly related to the changes in islet architecture, and in a normal situation we would have asked Stozer and Rupnik to collaborate with us. However this is not an option here as both are Reviewers on our manuscript. As requested by the Editors in our correspondence regarding this point, we now acknowledge these caveats and suggest that future experiments will be needed to address this in lines 354-364 of the revised PDF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In response, we now discuss this limitation details in the text and suggest future experiments in which this may be possible in lines 354-364 (see also response to Reviewers’ comment 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Acquisition speeds are very low (max 0.2 Hz) so that – as the authors accept – only very low speed Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves can be detected. I am not full persuaded that imaging throughout the islet in 3D is justified. This limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the study, and comparisons to many recent reports (see 3/) where acquisition times &gt;1 Hz are used. Surprisingly, recent and earlier reports from the laboratories of Stozer and Rupnik (see below), Hodson, JCI, 2013; Rutter, Cell Metab, 2016; Ninov, Nat Metab, 2019 on network dynamics and hub/follower behaviour are missing. The authors are rightly cautious about discussing the possibility that Robo deletion impacts these behaviours given the limitations of the data acquisition (low speed), but this work still needs to be properly cited and put into context.</p><p>Moreover, if a higher sampling reduces the measured coordination even further, than this coordination is likely not physiologically relevant. The images as collected a 512x512, but smoothed 5x5 for analysis. Would it not be better to collect 100x100 images directly and image 25x faster to check the physiological significance of coordination of oscillations? Discussion and comparisons required.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. To address the point regarding the speed of acquisition, we have performed an analysis on simulated islets at a range of sampling speeds from 10Hz to 0.1Hz to see if identification of intrinsic frequency or functional populations is altered at slower imaging speed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This analysis showed that intrinsic frequencies identified at 10Hz were virtually unchanged at 0.1Hz, and that only a modest loss in retainment of cells identified at 10Hz occurred at sampling of 0.1Hz, though most were retained at 1Hz and 0.2Hz. Thus, though our imaging speed may be modestly less sensitive than 10Hz, the quality of the intrinsic frequency measured remains similar. Further, we measured functional connections between cells at this range of sampling speeds and saw that the quality of these measurements did not change dramatically from 10Hz to 0.1Hz and that retainment of functional connection measurements was only modestly decreased from 10Hz to 0.1Hz. We have added detailed discussion on the limits of our imaging speed with reference to this simulation analysis in lines 416-431. In addition, we performed a set of intravital experiments in which we imaged a single islet plane at 1Hz. We observed the same patterns of oscillations compared to islets imaged at slower imaging speeds (now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Thus, we would like to argue that our slower imaging speeds accurately measures general qualities of the islet that are visible at 10Hz with only a modest loss in sensitivity. To strengthen this argument further, we performed a network analysis as was done by Stozer et al., (PLoS Comp. Biol., 2013) on calcium videos imaged from 0.1-1Hz to compare these network properties between Robo β-KO and control islets. These analyses are now included in the Results section as two completely new figure (Figure 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 2), and discussed in lines 206-242 in Results and lines 337-354 in Discussion. We have also included detailed reference to hub cells in the introduction in lines 81-84, and a discussion of the results in lines 341-347.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61308-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Higher resolution light or electron microscopy are needed. The authors provide a hypothesis that preferential homotypic contact allows for a necessary amount of gap junctions to form. Observed reduction of homotypic contacts between the β cells is not associated with the reduction of Cx36 expression, and it is therefore not clear what is meant by the missing necessary amount of gap junctions? Furthermore, colocalization of Cx36 should not be considered equal to functional gap junctions, and smaller fraction of homotypic nearest neighbors in Robo betaKO β cells does not necessarily equal limited capacity to electrically couple. The question is how is the junctional conductance distributed within an islet? The published data describes a complex temporal pattern of fluctuations in junctional conductance between the β cell pairs, but overall islet junctional conductance is conserved (Jusup et al., 2020, Biophys J).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers on this important point. Accordingly, we have now performed higher resolution confocal imaging for Cx36 to ensure that localization of gap junctions was indeed between β cells. This new data is now included in updated Figure 7. We have also removed the confusing language mentioned above and toned-down claims that loss of gap junction conductance per se is the cause of disrupted calcium oscillations in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The claim that Gap junctions are properly formed in ROBO KO islets needs substantiation using a functional assay. For example, the authors should apply fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to assess GJ function, as described before by Farnsworth et al. (PMID: 25172942), or other means to monitor GJ permeability.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this comment. However, as mentioned above, Robo βKO islets are fragile in culture and thus not suited to FRAP in that context, and unfortunately our in vivo imaging platform does not support FRAP at this time. We would argue however that the subset of Robo βKO islets that show high synchronicity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations suggests that gap junctions are likely able to form between β cells when Robo is deleted. We have now toned-down language surrounding gap junction conductance and noted in lines 354-364 that FRAP in acute tissue slices would be an important future experiment to test gap junction functionality directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In the Introduction, the view that mouse/rodent islets are of the classical mantle-core type may be a bit too simplified. I suggest that the authors consider/point out the possibility that at least some of the islets, at least during some normal/pathological developmental stages may display other architectures, of which some may be close to the more complex human architecture. I strongly believe that the study could benefit from this addition, since the authors strongly argue for the importance of structure in determining function. In other words, architectural patterns deviating from the textbook core-mantle paradigm may indicate important adaptations to normal (pregnancy, age) or pathological (hyperglycemia) stimuli. For sure, this is something that adds to the importance of their study.

We have now added detailed review on this to the introduction to discuss the ways in which islet architecture can deviate from the norm in both mice and humans, and how this may be important for islet function in the face of changing energy demands, citing all the above references (now refs. number 11, 24, 1, 2, 3, and 17, respectively; see lines 44-49).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In the introduction, gap-junctional coupling is pointed out as the only important synchronizing mechanism affected by homotypical interactions/cell-cell contacts. A number of other structural and functional coupling mechanism have been proposed to operate in islets and practically all of them could also be disrupted by changes in β cell clustering within islets. I think that these additional coupling mechanisms deserve to be mentioned in the introduction and be briefly touched upon in the discussion. In fact, since Cx36 expression/distribution pattern does not seem to be affected in this model, these other modes of communication may account for at least a part of the explanation for all possible putative mechanisms, not only diffusible factors.

We have also added Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (referred to in text in lines 245-251) which examines and discusses innervation in Robo βKO and control islets.

In Results, the authors support their choice of intravital islet imaging by the fact that during isolation, islets of Robo betaKO mice dissociate, rendering them unsuitable for in vitro analyses of whole-islet Ca oscillations. However, the acute tissue slice method (Speier and Rupnik, Eur J Physiol 2005) has been developed to enable in vitro studies in genetic models with (even more) strongly disrupted architecture. This method was successfully coupled with multicellular confocal Ca imaging (Stozer et al., PLoS One 2013) and is suitable for highest spatial and temporal resolution Ca recordings and I believe that it should be at least briefly mentioned as an option for future studies of Ca imaging in this genetic model. Another experimental solution for cases like this are islets transplanted into the anterior chamber of the eye (Speier et al., Nat Protocol 2008). Both the tissue slice and ACE transplantation method are closer to the in vivo situation in terms of architecture than isolated islets. Of course, in vivo recordings are a step even further, but may not be required in all cases in the future. Moreover, the limits of temporal resolution in an in vivo setup (0.2 Hz in your case) may not allow for analyses of more detailed aspects of intra-islet Ca signalling, such as speed waves, pacemaker location, network analyses etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a discussion on the use of acute pancreas slices for future experiments in lines 354-364. Further, we have performed analysis of the effect of slower imaging speed on ability to quantify calcium dynamics using simulated islets and found that our imaging speeds only have a modest loss in sensitivity compared to imaging at speeds as fast as 10Hz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). A detailed discussion of these simulations has been added to lines 426-431.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. To account for the possibility of intrinsic effects of Robo KO on the ability of β cells to respond with Ca oscillations, the authors resorted to imaging Ca oscillations in dissociated β cells. It should be pointed out that this process may per se influence the ability of any β cell to produce Ca oscillations and the nature of the oscillations in isolated and coupled cells may differ importantly (fast vs. slow). Whilst this experiment is important, the fact that some islets or some parts of islets in KO mice showed well synchronized activity in vivo is a much stronger indicator that KO β cells are not intrinsically unable to respond with normal Ca oscillations, given that the Robo gene is truly knocked-out (evidence for this is provided in the Discussion)! My suggestion would be to put the in vitro experiments first, and then the in vivo observations as the more convincing second argument/line of evidence.</p><p>Also, a short discussion on the nature of observed Ca oscillations is warranted. Are the in vivo observed oscillations fast or slow or mixed? Sometimes, fast oscillations are superimposed on slower ones. The fast may have periods as low as 2-3 seconds. Therefore, some may have been missed. Therefore, a recording speed of 2 frames per 10 seconds may not be sufficient in all cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. Accordingly, we have now changed the order such that the in vitro experiments precede the in vivo experiments. We have also now added a detailed discussion on the nature of the oscillations we have observed in vivo (lines 393-415), and in Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

The authors should examine the innervation of the ROBO KO islets and make sure that innervation is normal.

The title is misleading since 36% of Robo betaKO are fully synchronized. Additionally, synchronization between the β cells in a normal islet is not a universal and required feature of β cell activity. At physiological glucose concentrations and at the beginning of the recording, the networks of β cells in an islet are preferentially segregated and they only integrate, leading to fully synchronized activity, only at unphysiologically high glucose and prolonged stimulations (Stožer et al., 2013 PLOS One, Markovic et al., 2015, Sci Rep, Stožer et al., 2019, Front Physiol).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment.

It is a pity the KCl traces are not shown. The question is, why should KCl stimulus trigger an improved response and glucose not? All steps distal to membrane depolarization should actually be the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers on this point. Accordingly, we have now added KCl traces to Figure 2. Additionally, upon re-evaluation of our data, we saw that one KO mouse in particular had quite a disproportionate KCL response compared to its matched control while the other 3 out of 4 pairs showed no difference. We thus repeated the experiment with an additional pair of mice to increase our n and get a better picture of the real biological effect of Robo KO on KCL AUC. After adding this pair, KCL AUC is no longer significantly different between pooled control and KO β cells. This is more in line with what we see in each individual experiment, namely that in 4 out of 5 mouse pairs that we assayed, there was no significant difference observed in the KCL response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17.
