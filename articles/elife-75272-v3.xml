Mutations in several human P4-ATPase genes are associated with severe diseases, for example in <italic>ATP8B1</italic> causing progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, a rare inherited disorder progressing toward liver failure. ATP8B1 forms a binary complex with CDC50A and displays a broad specificity to glycerophospholipids, but regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report functional studies and the cryo-EM structure of the human lipid flippase ATP8B1-CDC50A at 3.1 Å resolution. We find that ATP8B1 is autoinhibited by its N- and C-terminal tails, which form extensive interactions with the catalytic sites and flexible domain interfaces. Consistently, ATP hydrolysis is unleashed by truncation of the C-terminus, but also requires phosphoinositides, most markedly phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>), and removal of both N- and C-termini results in full activation. Restored inhibition of ATP8B1 truncation constructs with a synthetic peptide mimicking the C-terminal segment further suggests molecular communication between N- and C-termini in the autoinhibition and demonstrates that the regulatory mechanism can be interfered with by exogenous compounds. A recurring (G/A)(Y/F)AFS motif of the C-terminal segment suggests that this mechanism is employed widely across P4-ATPase lipid flippases in plasma membrane and endomembranes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipid flippase</kwd><kwd>autoinhibition</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositides</kwd><kwd>P4-ATPases</kwd><kwd>progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Short-term fellowship 7881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dieudonné</surname><given-names>Thibaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011658</institution-id><institution>French Infrastructure for Integrated Structural Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRISBI ANR-10-INSB-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaxel</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Montigny</surname><given-names>Cédric</given-names></name><name><surname>Lenoir</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>French Ministry for Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dieudonné</surname><given-names>Thibaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Sklodowska-Curie individual fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dieudonné</surname><given-names>Thibaud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young investigator grant ANR-14-CE09-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenoir</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Professorship grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nissen</surname><given-names>Poul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GU 1133/11-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pomorski</surname><given-names>Thomas Günther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001825</institution-id><institution>Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5072-00025B -

In most cell types choline-containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) are chiefly located in the exoplasmic leaflet while the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), as well as phosphoinositides (PPIns), mostly occupy the cytoplasmic leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bretscher, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murate et al., 2015</xref>). Phospholipid asymmetry plays an important role in eukaryotic cell function. A well-studied example is the asymmetric distribution of PS in membranes of the late secretory/endocytic pathways, where it confers a high surface charge to these membranes, thereby facilitating the recruitment of polybasic motif-containing protein effectors such as the small G proteins K-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hancock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yeung et al., 2009</xref>), Cdc42 and ROP6, as well as other proteins like protein kinase C (PKC), synaptotagmin, and the membrane fission protein EHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohdanowicz and Grinstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemmon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventis and Grinstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Platre et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there is a direct link between PS sidedness and regulation of cell polarity, cell signaling and vesicular trafficking. Phospholipid asymmetry is maintained by flippases and floppases, which use ATP for inward and outward movement of lipids across membranes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López-Marqués et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Montigny et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, scramblases comprise a third category that passively equilibrates lipids across the bilayer, often controlled by gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pomorski and Menon, 2016</xref>). Although floppases belong to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, most flippases characterized thus far are from the type 4 subfamily of P-type ATPases, hereafter referred to as P4-ATPases. The human genome encodes 14 P4-ATPases. Using NBD-lipids as fluorescent derivatives of native lipids, ATP8A1, ATP8A2, ATP11A, ATP11B and ATP11C were shown to transport the aminophospholipids NBD-PS and NBD-PE, both in cell-based assays and upon reconstitution in proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coleman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Segawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, ATP8B1, ATP8B2, and ATP10A were shown to transport NBD-PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Naito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takatsu et al., 2014</xref>) and ATP10A and ATP10D catalyze the transport of NBD-glucosylceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roland et al., 2019</xref>). Mutations in ATP8A2 and ATP11A have been reported to cause severe neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Onat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Segawa et al., 2021</xref>), and mutations in ATP8B1 are associated with intrahepatic cholestatic disorders, such as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC1), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP1), and the more severe progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1). PFIC1 is a rare inherited liver disorder characterized by impaired bile flow, fat malabsorption and progressive cirrhosis and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacquemin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van der Mark et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Similar to many ion-transporting P-type ATPases, P4-ATPases consist of a transmembrane domain containing ten membrane-spanning α-helical segments, as well as three cytosolic domains, the actuator (A), nucleotide-binding (N), and phosphorylation (P) domains involved in catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, most P4-ATPases form obligatory binary complexes with members of the CDC50 protein family, which are essential for correct targeting of the flippase complex to its final destination and for its transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coleman and Molday, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lenoir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poulsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Segawa et al., 2018</xref>). Conformational changes in the membrane domain, required to facilitate lipid transport, are coupled to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events in the cytosolic ATPase domains, thereby allowing efficient lipid transport against concentration gradients. The different steps of the transport cycle are collectively described as the Post-Albers scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albers, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Post et al., 1972</xref>), where the P-type ATPase cycles between different conformations, E1, E1P, E2P, and E2 (P for phosphorylated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The transport substrate, a lipid for P4-ATPases, is recognized in the E2P conformation, and its binding triggers dephosphorylation leading to E2 and eventually release of the lipid in the opposing leaflet. The subcellular localization, heteromeric interactions with CDC50 proteins and lipid transport activity of ATP8B1 have been thoroughly investigated using cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bryde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van der Velden et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, ATP8B1 remains poorly studied at the molecular mechanistic level. In particular, while several other P4-ATPases, and P-type ATPases in general, are tightly regulated by lipid co-factors, protein partners, or by their terminal extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azouaoui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chalat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holemans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saffioti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>), the way ATP8B1 activity is regulated remains unknown. Recent high-resolution structures of the yeast Drs2-Cdc50, Dnf1,2-Lem3 and the human ATP8A1-CDC50A and ATP11C-CDC50A flippase complexes have illuminated the molecular mechanism of lipid transport, providing a framework for understanding how these transporters are able to move lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiraizumi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakanishi et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Timcenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Timcenko et al., 2021</xref>).

In keeping with an observed, tight interaction of the C-terminal tail of ATP8B1 with the cytosolic domains, the ATP8B1-CDC50A complex displayed ATPase activity only after removal of its C-terminus. Using protease cleavage sites within the N-terminus or, for the C-terminus, immediately after the last transmembrane segment of ATP8B1, we demonstrate that ATP8B1 is primarily autoinhibited by its C-terminal extension, but that the N-terminal extension is involved in a synergistic manner.

To ascertain functionality of the purified complex, we investigated its ability to undergo phosphorylation from [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP on its catalytic aspartate.

Interestingly, the N-terminal region (Q16-D27) was found to interact tightly with the P-, A- and the N-domain of ATP8B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Regarding the interaction of the N-terminal tail with the P-domain, residues D26 and D27 are involved in electrostatic interactions with side chains of N807 and T869, respectively. The interaction is further enhanced by hydrophobic interactions between P17 and W805. The N-terminal tail interacts with the A-domain through hydrogen bonds between S25 and R271 and is further reinforced by hydrophobic interaction between Y24 and L272. Finally, the interaction of the N-terminal tail with the N-domain is mediated by a hydrogen bond between E20 and S598 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, the C-terminal tail of ATP8B1 engages in hydrogen bonds as well as several salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions with the three cytosolic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Noteworthily, F1211 in the conserved AYAFS motif interacts via π-π interactions with F596 in the N-domain, which normally interacts with the adenosine ring of ATP in P-type ATPases, thereby preventing ATP binding. Hydrogen bonds between T1204-Q640, R1206-A647, S1207-D622, and S1212-S552 pairs further promote tight interaction between the C-terminal tail and the N-domain. Interactions of the C-terminal tail with the A- and P-domains are mediated by salt bridges (between R1228 and E219 and between R1194 and E751) or via hydrogen bonding between the side chains of Y1217 and R1193 with the backbone carbonyl groups of L237 and A745, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Detailed interaction of the N- and C-terminal tails with the cytosolic A-, N-, and P-domains of ATP8B1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall view of the cytosolic A-, N-, and P-domains colored in yellow, red and blue, respectively.

The various 3 C protease constructs were purified by streptavidin affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), with yields ranging from half (for ΔN42), to one fourth (for ΔC1174 and ΔN42/C1174) of that obtained for the wild-type (WT) complex.

Removal of the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus was not sufficient to stimulate ATP8B1-CDC50A ATPase activity in the presence of its transport substrate PC, suggesting an additional regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). PI(4)P has been shown to be essential to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Drs2, a yeast homolog of ATP8B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azouaoui et al., 2017</xref>).

While PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> proved unable to stimulate the intact WT ATP8B1-CDC50A complex, limited proteolysis of the complex with trypsin dramatically increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis, consistent with autoinhibition of the intact ATP8B1-CDC50A complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Interestingly, removal of both termini resulted in additional activation of ATP8B1 suggesting that, although the sole removal of the N-terminus has seemingly no effect on autoinhibition relief, the N-terminus cooperates with the C-terminus for full autoinhibition of the ATP8B1-CDC50A complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

All PPIn species were tested at the same molar concentration and at a fixed concentration of PC, and differed in the number and positions of phosphorylations on the inositol headgroup. Phosphorylation of the headgroup appeared to be essential for stimulating ATP8B1 ATPase activity, as no activity could be detected above background using phosphatidylinositol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Monophosphorylated PPIn species, namely PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P, were equally efficient in stimulating ATP hydrolysis by ATP8B1. When the inositol ring was phosphorylated twice, the ATPase activity was increased about 2-fold compared to that observed with monophosphorylated PPIns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), with no dramatic difference in activity between PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Tri-phosphorylated PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> increased further the activity of ATP8B1 by about 1.5-fold. Thus, although the number of phosphorylations on the inositol ring matters, the positions do not and ATP8B1-CDC50A can be activated by a wide variety of PPIns with increasing efficiency linked to the number of phosphorylations. The differential activation by PPIns observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> could either be the result of a variation in the maximal velocity of ATP hydrolysis, the apparent affinity for PPIns, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ATP8B1 in relation to the PPIn/detergent ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), taking PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> as representative examples of singly, doubly and triply phosphorylated PPIns, respectively. Whereas double-reciprocal plots indicated comparable maximum ATP hydrolysis rates in the presence of PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, the apparent affinity of ATP8B1 for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> was found much higher than for PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, we report that PPIns are essential activators of ATP8B1 activity and identify in vitro a preference for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in the activation of ATP8B1. Truncation of the C- and N-termini of ATP8B1 allows switching ATP8B1 from a fully inhibited to an activated form, provided lipid transport substrate and PPIns are present. Addition of a C-terminal peptide rescues inhibition, and inhibition is subject to regulation by phosphorylation at S1223 of the C-terminal extension.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Autoinhibition of P4-ATPase flippases by their terminal tails: An evolutionarily conserved mechanism?</title><p>The autoinhibition of plasma membrane-localized ATP8B1 by its C-terminus is reminiscent of that observed for the yeast endomembrane homolog Drs2. While an intact Drs2-Cdc50 complex exhibits hardly any lipid-induced ATPase activity, once the C-terminus has been trimmed off by proteases, the complex becomes competent for ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azouaoui et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of Drs2 to hydrolyze ATP requires not only displacement of its C-terminus but also the binding of PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azouaoui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Timcenko et al., 2019</xref>). Cryo-EM structures show that the C-terminus of Drs2 binds in a cleft between the P-domain and the N-domain, thus providing a structural explanation for autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Timcenko et al., 2019</xref>). The C-terminus also appears to play a role in autoinhibition of ATP8A2, although this enzyme does not seem to be regulated by PPIns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chalat et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, the C-terminus of ATP8A1, a close relative of ATP8A2, was recently shown to extend through its cytosolic catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiraizumi et al., 2019</xref>). This raises the question as to whether such autoregulatory mechanism is a conserved feature among P4-ATPases. By comparing the sequences of P4-ATPase termini from various organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for a full alignment), it appears that although the C-termini of P4-ATPases are in general poorly conserved, one exception to this rule is the ATP8B1 AYAFS motif which occupies the ATP-binding site. Furthermore, in the autoinhibited Drs2 and ATP8A1 structures, their C-termini overlap extensively despite a rather low sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Noteworthy, the C-terminal peptide of ATP8B1 did not exhibit an inhibitory effect on Drs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that autoinhibition per se is mainly driven by the region downstream the conserved motif, the latter mediating the interaction between the A and N domain. Thus, we predict that any P4-ATPase containing the (G/A)(Y/F)AFS motif is likely to be autoinhibited by its C-terminus. We further propose that autoinhibition might be occurring in a conformation-dependent manner. Indeed, previous structural work from Hiraizumi and colleagues, capturing an almost complete catalytic cycle of full-length ATP8A1-CDC50A, showed that the inhibitory C-terminus is observed only in the BeF<sub>x</sub>-stabilized E2P form and is completely disordered in other conformations, suggesting that autoinhibition specifically occurs in the E2P state. We also show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> that full-length ATP8B1 may be phosphorylated from [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, indicating that in the E1 state, the presence of the C-terminal tail does not prevent accessibility of the nucleotide-binding site. As such, we foresee that the C-terminal tail is in equilibrium between a state bound to the ATP8B1 cytosolic domains and an unbound state, this equilibrium being poised toward the bound state in the E2P conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for autoinhibition and regulation by phosphoinositides of the ATP8B1-CDC50A complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of select P4-ATPases C-termini, including ATP8B1, ATP8A1 and Drs2, which are all known to be autoinhibited.

Although the precise mechanism is so far uncertain, our data indicate that the N-terminal tail of ATP8B1 has a strong synergistic effect on the autoinhibition by its C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B–D</xref>). Owing to numerous interactions observed in our structure of ATP8B1, the N-terminal tail might restrain the flexibility of the A-, N-, and P-domains necessary for nucleotide binding to the N-domain and catalysis, even in the absence of the C-terminal tail. Another non-exclusive possibility could be that the N-terminal tail prevents dissociation of the C-terminus by locking down the N-domain through electrostatic interaction with S598. A functional cooperation between N- and C-termini has previously been described for the plant H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, a P-type ATPase from the P3 subfamily, where modifications in the N-terminus result in kinase-mediated phosphorylation in the C-terminus, eventually leading to activation of the pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ekberg et al., 2010</xref>).

Consistent with this hypothesis, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been shown to phosphorylate a serine residue, S1138, in the autoinhibitory C-terminus of bovine ATP8A2. Substitution of S1138 to alanine resulted in a 33% loss of the PS-dependent ATPase activity of ATP8A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chalat et al., 2017</xref>).

It must be pointed out that the activity of the intact full-length ATP8B1 is not stimulated by addition of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and that the C-terminus of ATP8B1 must be removed for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to exert its stimulatory effect. While it remains possible that phosphoinositides participate in autoinhibition relief, as proposed for the yeast Drs2-Cdc50 flippase complex, this suggests that phosphoinositides mediate their activatory effect through a distinct mechanism that does not involve the tails, for example by promoting conformational changes in the membrane domain that could for instance regulate access to the substrate-binding site. Whereas all PPIns showed the ability to stimulate ATP8B1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> displayed a much higher affinity for ATP8B1 than other PPIns. The <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value for activation of ATP8B1 by PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is about 1.4.10<sup>–3</sup> mol PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>/mol DDM. Based on our own estimation of the number of DDM molecules surrounding the transmembrane domain of Drs2-Cdc50 using size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled DDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), we estimate that the detergent micelle around the transmembrane region of ATP8B1-CDC50A is composed of ~270 ± 56 molecules of DDM. Taking into account the additional presence of two transmembrane helices contributed by Cdc50, this is the same order of magnitude as the amount of DDM bound to purified SERCA1a (155 ± 27 mol DDM/mol SERCA1a), a P-type ATPase from the P2 subfamily, as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaptal et al., 2017</xref>). A <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of 1.4 × 10<sup>–3</sup> mol PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>/mol DDM corresponds to ~0.38 mol of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> per 270 mol of DDM (or 0.14 mol%) in the immediate environment of ATP8B1-CDC50A, emphasizing the strong affinity of ATP8B1 for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. This is consistent with PPIns being activators rather than substrates as is the case for PI(4)P towards the yeast Drs2-Cdc50 complex. PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is primarily localized at the plasma membrane, and one of the least abundant PPIns in mammalian cells, being virtually undetectable in quiescent cells. The tight control of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> concentration stems from its critical role in key signalling pathways such as cell proliferation, survival and membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marat and Haucke, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a recent report provided quantitative analysis of phosphoinositides, including PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, in the plasma membrane of MT-4 cells, a T-lymphocyte cell line. In these cells, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> represents 0.00025% of total plasma membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mücksch et al., 2019</xref>). However, upon activation of cell-surface receptors and recruitment of class I PI3-kinases, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels may rise up to 100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that its concentration may rise up to 0.025 mol% in the PM. Although comparison must be made with care, due to the fact that activation of ATP8B1 by PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> may be different in lipid bilayers and solubilized systems, it is worth noting that 0.025 mol% of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in the PM is in the same range as 0.14 mol%, the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> concentration required to reach half-maximal activity of ATP8B1 in detergent micelles.</p><p>The lower <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of ATP8B1 for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> than for other PPIns suggests that the cavity where PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> binds is specifically adjusted to this PPIn, whereas other PPIns can fit as well, but less efficiently. To our knowledge, direct regulation of integral membrane proteins by PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> has not previously been shown. Intriguingly, despite addition of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> during sample preparation for cryo-EM studies, no clear density could be observed for this lipid. However, the cavity lined by TM7, TM8, and TM10 on the structure of ATP8B1, which corresponds to the PI(4)P binding site in Drs2, consists of a large number of basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) strongly hinting at a similar site in both Drs2 and ATP8B1. On the other hand, the role of PPIns on the activation of ATP8B1 with C-terminal or double N- and C-terminal truncation could be interpreted as supporting a model where regulatory PPIns bind to the N-terminal tail of ATP8B1. Interestingly, the N-terminal tail of ATP8B1 contains a patch of positively charged residues between P42 and D70 (including R46, R49, R55, R59 and K60), a region which is not visible in our structure. This would be reminiscent of the proposed model for the P5-ATPase ATP13A2, where binding of the negatively charged lipids phosphatidic acid and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the N-terminal domain stimulates catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holemans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tomita et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Irrespective of this, the physiologically relevant regulatory PPIn is still unknown.

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of mammalian P4-ATPases will be instrumental for the subsequent design of molecules that would enforce/mimic or stimulate the release of the autoinhibitory C-terminus. We propose that the regulatory mechanism uncovered in this study may be a feature shared by other P4-ATPases, and that phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of ATP8B1 is likely to be involved in the regulation of ATP8B1 activity. Moreover, these studies will pave the way towards detailed functional assessment of disease-associated ATP8B1 mutations found in PFIC1 patients and towards the design of both activating and inhibiting compounds of P4-ATPases, based on regulatory mechanisms in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, MATα)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">W303.1b/<italic>Δpep4</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">López-Marqués laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain deficient for the main vacuolar protease</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, MATα)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">W303.1b/<italic>GAL4-2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pompon Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Additional copy of the <italic>GAL4</italic> gene in the yeast chromosome</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FIC1 (H-91) rabbit polyclonal anti-ATP8B1 antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa-Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#sc-134967</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1:10000)This product has been discontinued</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat anti-rabbit HRP-coupled polyclonal IgG antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biorad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#1706515</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATP8B1 cDNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Joost Holthuis laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: O43520</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CDC50 cDNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Joost Holthuis laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: Q9NV96</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATP8B1 C-terminal peptide</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biomatik Company</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATP8B1 phosphorylated C-terminal peptide</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biomatik Company</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phosphorylated on S1223</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HRV 3 C protease</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expressed (pGEX-4T-2) and purified in Lenoir laboratory.

The tagged genes were cloned in a unique co-expression pYeDP60 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacquot et al., 2012</xref>). In this vector, hATP8B1 and hCDC50A are both placed under the control of a strong galactose-inducible promoter, <italic>GAL10/CYC1</italic>. The D454N mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent technologies). An overlap extension PCR strategy was used to insert the 3 C protease site (LEVLFQGP) between Pro42 and Glu43 and/or between Glu1174 and Ser1175.

Fractions of interest were diluted threefold in buffer M (50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) and loaded to a SP Sepharose Fast-Flow HiTrap column pre-equilibrated in buffer N (50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer N. The protein of interest was eluted with a gradient of buffer O (50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 8, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). Fractions containing the protein of interest were loaded on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated in buffer P (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl). Elution fractions containing the TEV protease were pooled, supplemented with 30% glycerol (v/v), concentrated to 1 mg ml<sup>–1</sup>, aliquoted, snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis, curve fitting and equations used in this tudy</title><p>Statistical analysis and curve fitting was carried out with the GraphPad Prism 9 software, and statistical significance was assigned to differences with a p value of &lt; 0.05.</p><p>GraphPad Prism log (inhibitor) vs response-variable slope (four parameters) non-linear regression analysis was used to fit data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Autoinhibition and regulation by phosphoinositides of ATP8B1, a human lipid flippase associated with intrahepatic cholestatic disorders&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kazuhiro Abe (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Looking at the structure files, Glu20 in the N-term makes a hydrogen bond with Ser598 in the N-domain. Because the C-terminal tail is covered by this part of N-domain that seems to prevent C-terminal dissociation, this interaction between N-terminal tail and the N-domain may be important to describe its synergy effect on autoinhibition. The figure panel to show that interaction, together with the relative orientations of N-term, C-term and N-domain may be helpful for reader to follow its synergy effect. Please consider to make such a figure in the main text.</p><p>2) Please show the detailed molecular interactions between C-term and cytoplasmic domains. Although EM density and side chains are shown in Figure 3, the number of amino acids, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions with surroundings are not readily understood from this figure. This is not necessarily as a ribbon-stick models. For example, 2D-diagram may also be useful to follow which residue(s) of C-term peptide binds to the A, P domains and the N domain, holding them together like glue.</p><p>3) Does the binding of C-terminal tail occur conformational dependent? The EM structure clearly visualizes the C-terminal tail bound in between the cytoplasmic domains arranged in the E2P state. Does this mean the autoinhibition always occur in the E2P state?</p><p>4) Is it possible to explain mechanistically how autoinhibition by the C-term is removed upon PIPs binding to the TM binding pocket? It is feasible that the negatively-charged phosphate group of PIPs could bind to the positively-charged pocket. But what kind of conformational change or other molecular event could be expected to remove the autoinhibition?</p><p>5) Sequence comparison of the C-terminal tail is extensively discussed, but less described for the N-terminal tail. Is it because N-terminal sequence is specific for ATP8B1?</p><p>6) Concerning the activation by in vitro truncation of the C-terminus: do the authors believe the C-terminus is proteolytic degraded during activation in vivo? If so, the activation would be irreversible? However, studies on the yeast homolog Drs2p seem to suggest the activation/inhibition is reversible.</p><p>7) Concerning the conclusion of phosphoinositides being an activator. Very high concentration phosphoinositides were used, which raises some doubt. Have the authors considered the possibility that phosphoinositides are a substrate rather than an activator, as suggested by a similar study posted in BioRxiv [https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.07.467649]. On the other hand, the authors' inability to observe the PI(3,4,5)P3 density does seem to implicate an activation role, as the compound may diffuse away after activation, in a manner similar to the PI4P activation of the yeast Drs2 flippase. Please discuss all the possibilities.</p><p>8) Related to point 7: Adding a section discussing on physiologically relevant big picture of this study will develop a good story. For example, a discussion on the comparison of physiological concentrations of phospholipid with the concentrations needed to stimulate ATPase activity of ATP8B1 will be useful. Kinetic parameters (Km, Vm) could inform this discussion, and sections on regulation by phosphorylation and phosphoinositides are surely useful. In addition, there are a number of experiments that could strengthen the conclusions including transfecting ATP8B1 and CDC50 in HEK cells and artificially increasing PIP2 levels in the cells, expected to release the auto inhibition by disengaging C-terminal and increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, will be useful. Measurements of intracellular ATP levels will confirm the regulation phenomenon and support its physiological relevance. Similarly, adding the disease perspective by modulating functional levels of ATP8B1 would be important to complete the story. While we recognize that the suggested experiments may be outside the scope of the current manuscript, we would like to see a discussion of the issues.</p><p>9) Figure 1 – gel in panel C shows the purification of ATP8B1-CDC50A according to the legend, however it does not indicate the corresponding band/s for CDC50A. Multiple bands of CDC50 were confirmed by immunoblotting by His probe in supplemental figure 1C. Please indicate CDC50 on the gel in panel C of Figure 1. Please mention in the legend if the amount of Lane Mb and Lane Estrep is same.</p><p>10) Figure 1 —figure supplement 1. As a suggestion, the purification procedure in panel B could have included eluting the complex with addition of DesBiotin, instead of eluting it with TEV cleavage. In panel C, the band for ATP8B1 is really diffused. Clear and distinct band as shown in panel D is better. The treatment of EndoH also resulted in consolidation of bands for ATP8B1 near 140kD. Please mention in the text. Panel D does not show EndoH cleavage of 1.5ug protein sample, which is shown in the original source gel file. Please explain it in the legend. Mean values are included for panel E in the source file, please include original data points for densitometry in the source file.</p><p>11) Results section does not describe interactions between ATP8B1 and CDC50A while describing the architecture of ATP8B1 (on page 7) and the structural role of CDC50A in ATP8B1 function.</p><p>12) Figure 3: please show how interactions (electrostatic vs hydrophobic) are mediated between N- and C- terminal regions and specific residues in A/P/N domain. Also describe these interactions in the text.</p><p>13) The gel for eluted purified samples in Figure 4A are smeary for mutant ATP8B1-CDC50 complexes and do not indicate CDC50. Assuming that these mutant complexes were further purified by gel filtration chromatography and then used for ATPase assays in Figure 4B, please show the gel for purified complexes after gel filtration. The purity of mutant ATP8B1-CDC50 complexes shown in Figure 4A may not be sufficient enough to perform ATPase assays in Figure 4B. It will be good to show a gel as shown in panel D of Figure1—figure supplement 1 for these mutant complexes. Please mention the yield of these mutants in comparison to wild type in the text.</p><p>14) Figure 4B: Please include controls with just lipids and no protein and control without lipids. Please explain baseline corrections in the legend. The legend includes that data is mean of 3 replicate experiments (technical). Please include the information regarding biological (N) repeats.</p><p>15) Figure 5: The order of panels can be changed. Panel C can be panel A. Panel A can be panel B. Panel D can be Panel C and Panel B can be Panel D. Please show interaction of peptide with other residues in N- and A- domain. Please include control with just peptide in panel A. Please provide a table for IC50 values for panel B. Legend for panel B mentions &quot;33 to 47 data points&quot;. Source file has 33 and 35 data points for C-ter and phosphorylated C-ter peptide respectively. Please correct. The legend also mentions that &quot;mean and sd of 3-4 replicates&quot;. Providing source data files is sincerely appreciated, however, source data files are missing a few data points for Figure 5A, 5D. Many of these data points in source data file have single points. And the transparency statement mentions &quot;no data was excluded&quot;. So, the question is why these data points are missing in these files. Please explain any technical details in this regard. Source data file is included for Figure S5C, but the figure is not included.</p><p>16) In general, please detail out baseline corrections and normalizing data in the legend for Figure 4, S4, 5, 6. Also mention IC50 values with 95% confidence interval in the legend.</p><p>17) Figure 6: Source data files are missing a few data points for Figure 6C. Many of these data points in source data file have single points. Please explain.</p><p>18) Line 301: &quot;ATP8B1-CDC50A required PC and PI(4,5)P2 for enzyme turnover&quot;. Is it essentially required? Result in Figure 4B can be simply interpreted as a stimulation of basal ATPase activity in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 and in the absence of N- and C-terminal regions. A control for basal ATPase activity of ATP8B1-CDC50A in the absence of lipid (mentioned above) would be important to add in Figure 4B as well as in Figure 6A.</p><p>19) For Figure 8, mutations can be classified and colored differently according to different diseases (PFIC1, BRIC1 or ICP1) or based on their location. D554N and H535L are proposed to affect ATP binding. Ideally, the authors would consider testing mutants in the ATPase assay. Similarly, Line 457 mentions about basic residues predicted to bind phospholipid. Mutagenesis experiments to confirm the location of the lipid binding site and to evaluate how changes in the lipid translocation pathway affect stimulation of ATPase activity by phospholipid could be of value. These suggested experiments would provide possible explanation for structural basis of these effects and would make the reading more interesting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75272.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Looking at the structure files, Glu20 in the N-term makes a hydrogen bond with Ser598 in the N-domain.

The EM structure clearly visualizes the C-terminal tail bound in between the cytoplasmic domains arranged in the E2P state. Does this mean the autoinhibition always occur in the E2P state?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting issue. Although we cannot precisely answer this question with our own structural data – we only obtained the structure of ATP8B1 in the E2P state – we may provide elements that argue in favor of autoinhibition occurring in a conformation-dependent manner. First, for all P4-ATPases which structure has been determined so far, the C-terminal tail has been found in its autoinhibitory position (i.e. in a cleft between the three cytosolic domains) only in the E2P state. In this regard, previous work from Hiraizumi and colleagues is very informative, as they obtained structures of the full-length flippase complex ATP8A1-CDC50A in a number of different conformations, capturing an almost complete catalytic cycle of the P4-ATPase (Hiraizumi et al., (2019) <italic>Science</italic>, 365:1149). In ATP8A1-CDC50A, which is also subject to regulation by its C-terminus, the inhibitory C-terminus is observed only in the BeFx-stabilized E2P form and is completely disordered in other conformations, suggesting that autoinhibition specifically occurs in the E2P state. Second, we show in Figure 1D that full-length ATP8B1 may be phosphorylated from [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, indicating that in the E1 state, the presence of the C-terminal tail does not prevent accessibility of the nucleotide-binding site. As such, we envision the C-terminal tail in equilibrium between a state bound to the ATP8B1 cytosolic domains and an unbound state, this equilibrium being poised toward the bound state in the E2P conformation. The possibility that autoinhibition occurs in a conformation-dependent manner is now alluded to in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is it possible to explain mechanistically how autoinhibition by the C-term is removed upon PIPs binding to the TM binding pocket? It is feasible that the negatively-charged phosphate group of PIPs could bind to the positively-charged pocket. But what kind of conformational change or other molecular event could be expected to remove the autoinhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We actually believe our data do not allow us to conclude that autoinhibition by the C-terminal tail is removed upon phosphoinositide binding to the TM binding pocket. As can be seen in Figure 4B, the activity of the intact full-length ATP8B1 (‘WT’) is not stimulated by addition of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (compare blue and open bars). The C-terminus of ATP8B1 must be removed for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to exert its stimulatory effect. This result rather suggests that phosphoinositides mediate their activatory effect through a distinct mechanism that does not involve the tails, e.g. by promoting conformational changes in the membrane domain that could for instance regulate access to the substrate-binding site. A non-exclusive possibility could be that phosphoinositides participate in autoinhibition relief, as proposed in the case of the yeast Drs2-Cdc50 flippase complex (Timcenko et al., (2019) <italic>Nature</italic>, 571:366). However, binding of PI(4)P to Drs2 is concurrent with the ordering of an amphipathic helix just after TM10 (the amphipathic helix is not formed in the absence of PI(4)P), resulting in a mechanical destabilization of the autoinhibitory domain interactions with the cytosolic domains. For ATP8B1, the corresponding amphipathic helix is already present in the absence of any phosphoinositide bound, raising the possibility that the mechanism involved for autoinhibition relief is different from that of Drs2. Along those lines, the role of PPIns on the activation of ATP8B1 with C-terminal or double N- and C-terminal truncation could be interpreted as supporting a model where regulatory PPIns bind to the N-terminal tail of ATP8B1. We note with interest that the N-terminal tail contains a cluster of positively charged residues between P42 and D70 (including R46, R49, R55, R59 and K60) perhaps mediating activation of ATP8B1 by phosphoinositides. To make it clearer, this aspect of the mechanism by which phosphoinositides regulate ATP8B1-CDC50A activity is now mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Sequence comparison of the C-terminal tail is extensively discussed, but less described for the N-terminal tail. Is it because N-terminal sequence is specific for ATP8B1?</p></disp-quote><p>The N-terminus sequence of ATP8B1 is indeed poorly conserved, even among other class 1 P4-ATPases (ATP8B2, ATP8B3, ATP8B4, ATP8A1, and ATP8A2) or other flippases known to be regulated by their termini (ATP8A1, ATP8A2, Drs2), and is therefore specific for ATP8B1. In contrast, the C-terminus is partially conserved as discussed in the article. Interestingly, Drs2 is also known to be regulated by its N-terminus (Azouaoui et al., (2017) <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 292:7954) but no unassigned density could be observed in the published cryo-EM map of full-length and autoinhibited Drs2-Cdc50 complex (EMDB: EMD-20468). Therefore, it remains unclear whether this interaction is specific to this flippase or if other flippase N-termini could interact similarly with the cytosolic domains of P4-ATPases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Concerning the activation by in vitro truncation of the C-terminus: do the authors believe the C-terminus is proteolytic degraded during activation in vivo? If so, the activation would be irreversible? However, studies on the yeast homolog Drs2p seem to suggest the activation/inhibition is reversible.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, proteolytic degradation would result in an irreversible activation of ATP8B1. One example of such regulatory proteolytic degradation has been previously described for a P4-ATPase, ATP11C, but in contrast to the regulatory mechanism discussed here for ATP8B1, it was inactivating proteolysis that occurred in the context of apoptosis (Segawa et al., (2014) <italic>Science</italic>, 344:1164). For ATP8B1, we do not suggest such a mechanism. Instead, activation could be mediated by the recruitment of protein partners to the N- and/or C-terminal tail which would sequester the tails to prevent autoinhibition, as previously suggested for the yeast Drs2-Cdc50 flippase (Timcenko et al., (2019) <italic>Nature</italic>, 571:366). In addition, the inhibitory properties of a peptide derived from the C-terminus of ATP8B1 suggest that phosphorylation of residue S1223 may provide additional regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Concerning the conclusion of phosphoinositides being an activator. Very high concentration phosphoinositides were used, which raises some doubt. Have the authors considered the possibility that phosphoinositides are a substrate rather than an activator, as suggested by a similar study posted in BioRxiv [https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.07.467649]. On the other hand, the authors' inability to observe the PI(3,4,5)P3 density does seem to implicate an activation role, as the compound may diffuse away after activation, in a manner similar to the PI4P activation of the yeast Drs2 flippase. Please discuss all the possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We checked the manuscript posted on BioRxiv but could not find any reference to the role of phosphoinositides in the study conducted by Cheng and colleagues. As to the concerns of reviewers regarding the concentration of phosphoinositides required to elicit ATP8B1 activity, it should be noted that in Figure 6C, the concentration of lipid is in fact expressed as the molar ratio of phosphoinositide over detergent (here, DDM). Indeed, the most relevant parameter to describe the effect of a particular lipid concentration in the presence of a given concentration of detergent is the lipid/detergent ratio, which reflects the local lipid concentration within the detergent micellar phase, rather than the lipid concentration in the aqueous volume. In other words, the concentration of detergent used in the ATPase assay is a parameter of critical importance, as it will largely influence the concentration of lipid available (Montigny et al., (2017) <italic>PLoS One</italic>, 12:e0170481). Along those lines, we previously showed, for the yeast Drs2-Cdc50 complex, that apparent affinities measured at low DDM concentrations (0.75-2 mg/ml) and those obtained at significantly higher DDM concentrations (3-5 mg/ml) are essentially similar if lipid concentrations are expressed as lipid/DDM ratios (Figure 5B, Azouaoui et al., (2017) <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 292:7954).</p><p>With this in mind, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value for activation of ATP8B1 by PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (PIP3) is about 1.4x10<sup>-3</sup> mol PIP3/mol DDM. Based on our own estimation of the number of DDM molecules surrounding the transmembrane domain of Drs2-Cdc50 using size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled DDM, we estimate that the detergent belt around the transmembrane region of ATP8B1-CDC50A is composed of ~ 270 molecules of DDM. Taking into account the additional presence of two transmembrane helices contributed by Cdc50, this is in the same range as the amount of DDM bound to purified SERCA1a, a P-type ATPase from the P2 subfamily, as determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Chaptal et al., (2017) <italic>Sci Rep</italic>, 7:41751).</p><p>A <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of 1.4x10<sup>-3</sup> mol PIP3/mol DDM corresponds to ~0.38 mol of PIP3 per 270 mol of DDM (or 0.14 mol%) in the immediate environment of ATP8B1-CDC50A, emphasizing the strong affinity of ATP8B1 for PIP3. The apparent affinity of ATP8B1 for PIP3 is actually stronger than that of Drs2 for PI4P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Given that PI4P has clearly been identified as a regulator of Drs2, and not as a transport substrate (Azouaoui et al (2017) <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 292:7954; Timcenko et al (2021) <italic>J Mol Biol</italic>, 433:167062), we think it is unlikely that phosphoinositides are transport substrates for ATP8B1. Comparison of physiological PIP3 concentrations with PIP3 concentrations required to activate ATP8B1-CDC50A in detergent micelles is now included in the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of ATP8B1-CDC50A and Drs2-Cdc50 affinities for phosphoinositides.</title><p>The results displayed for ATP8B1-CDC50A correspond to those shown in Figure 6C while the results displayed for Drs2 are adapted from Figure 5B published in Azouaoui et al., (2017) <italic>J Biol Chem</italic> 292:7954.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75272-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Related to point 7: Adding a section discussing on physiologically relevant big picture of this study will develop a good story. For example, a discussion on the comparison of physiological concentrations of phospholipid with the concentrations needed to stimulate ATPase activity of ATP8B1 will be useful. Kinetic parameters (Km, Vm) could inform this discussion, and sections on regulation by phosphorylation and phosphoinositides are surely useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this comment of the reviewers in our answer to comment #7 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, there are a number of experiments that could strengthen the conclusions including transfecting ATP8B1 and CDC50 in HEK cells and artificially increasing PIP2 levels in the cells, expected to release the auto inhibition by disengaging C-terminal and increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, will be useful. Measurements of intracellular ATP levels will confirm the regulation phenomenon and support its physiological relevance. Similarly, adding the disease perspective by modulating functional levels of ATP8B1 would be important to complete the story. While we recognize that the suggested experiments may be outside the scope of the current manuscript, we would like to see a discussion of the issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this very interesting set of experiments. As previously mentioned in response to comment #4, PPIns are actually not sufficient to trigger ATPase activity in vitro: the tails also need to be removed. As we don’t know yet the conditions for the activation of ATP8B1 in vivo, e.g. how phosphorylation of S1223 in ATP8B1 is regulated, there is little chance that only raising the levels of PPIns will allow disengagement of the C-terminus and an increase of the ATPase activity. Besides, the suggested experiment would only work provided ATP8B1 uses a substantial and significant amount of ATP among all other ATP-consuming systems in the cell, which is likely not the case not least because other P-type ATPases (from the P2 subfamily for instance) are more abundant and have a higher turnover rate than ATP8B1, thereby limiting the chances of success. We mentioned in the discussion that modulating PPIn levels would certainly be of great interest, but subject for future studies. Therefore, although the suggested experiments are certainly of great interest to investigate in cellulo the role of PPIns in ATP8B1 activation, we feel this is outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 1 – gel in panel C shows the purification of ATP8B1-CDC50A according to the legend, however it does not indicate the corresponding band/s for CDC50A.

Elution with desthiobiotin, commonly used for Strep-tagged proteins binding to streptactin resin, did not prove successful when we optimized the purification protocol for other targets than ATP8B1. Additionally, in the presence of desthiobiotin, we would also elute endogenously biotinylated yeast proteins, resulting in a less pure sample. Finally, adding a TEV cleavage site allows to get rid of the 10 kDa biotin acceptor domain. For those reasons, we chose to insert a TEV-cleavable biotin acceptor domain.</p><p>In Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C, the band for ATP8B1 is diffuse upon treatment with EndoH (last lane). This is because as part of EndoH treatment, the purified ATP8B1-CDC50A complex is boiled before loading onto SDS-PAGE, which leads to aggregation of ATP8B1. This technical point is now mentioned in the legend to Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C. Additionally, ATP8B1 may appear more focused in panel D because in that case, precast 4-15% gels were used instead of our regular 8% acrylamide gels. Residual interaction of ATP8B1 with DDM during SDS-PAGE could also add to the diffuse electrophoretic mobility of ATP8B1. Such a behavior for DDM-purified proteins has already been observed, and this goes in line with the fact that ATP8B1 runs as a more focused band in panel D, where the proteins are precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (and hence the detergent removed) before loading onto gradient SDS-PAGE.</p><p>As to consolidation of ATP8B1 bands upon EndoH treatment, we believe the reviewers have been misled by the fact that boiling of ATP8B1 sample leads to some aggregation.</p><p>We now included lanes corresponding to EndoH cleavage of 1.5 µg protein, for consistency.

The text of the revised manuscript was amended accordingly. Moreover, the structure of CDC50A is highly similar to what has already been described for other human flippase complexes in which it is present. To highlight this point, we included a structural alignment of CDC50A from the ATP8B1-CDC50A (this study), ATP8A1-CDC50A (PDB: 6K7L, Hiraizumi et al., 2019), ATP11C-CDC50A (PDB: 7BSU, Nakanishi et al., 2020) flippase complexes (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). The contribution of the CDC50 subunit in P4-ATPase function, apart from its role in subcellular trafficking of the mature complex, is still elusive. Unfortunately, our data do not bring more information on this aspect than previous studies and we therefore preferred not to speculate on this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 3: please show how interactions (electrostatic vs hydrophobic) are mediated between N- and C- terminal regions and specific residues in A/P/N domain.

Assuming that these mutant complexes were further purified by gel filtration chromatography and then used for ATPase assays in Figure 4B, please show the gel for purified complexes after gel filtration. The purity of mutant ATP8B1-CDC50 complexes shown in Figure 4A may not be sufficient enough to perform ATPase assays in Figure 4B. It will be good to show a gel as shown in panel D of Figure1—figure supplement 1 for these mutant complexes. Please mention the yield of these mutants in comparison to wild type in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The gel for eluted purified samples in Figure 4A looks smeary for different reasons. First, proteolysis with 3C protease, meant to release the N-terminal tail (ΔN42) or the C-terminal tail (ΔC1174), or both (ΔN42/C1174), is not 100% complete. Therefore, the residual presence of full-length ATP8B1 for the mutants, in close proximity of truncated forms for ΔN42 and ΔC1174, makes the ATP8B1 band diffuse. Second, despite four consecutive purification steps (IMAC, glutathione sepharose, cation exchange and size-exclusion chromatography), the purified 3C protease is not pure to homogeneity. As we need substantial amounts for truncation of 3C constructs, addition of 3C protease in fact contaminates our purified ATP8B1-CDC50A sample. Third, it seems that destaining of the Coomassie blue stained gel is not homogenous. As requested, we included a legend to CDC50A in Figure 4A.</p><p>Note that the mutants, as well as the WT, were not purified by gel filtration before ATPase measurements. Indeed, the purification yield of ATP8B1-CDC50A is too scarce to envision systematic purification by gel filtration of streptavidin-purified samples. We will make this clearer in the text by providing the information in the legend to Figure 4A.</p><p>The reviewers are concerned by the fact that the lack of purity of the samples could prevent us to detect activity for the WT and ΔN42, for instance in the presence of PC and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Our rationale is the following. While we cannot exclude that the activity of the WT and ΔN42 species is indeed overlooked because it is not significantly higher than the background noise, our point here is to highlight the importance of the N-terminal and C-terminal tails in autoinhibition. This remains true, even if we miss a minor activity of the WT and ΔN42. Moreover, rather than using end-point assay, we monitor the variations in NADH absorption (and therefore ATP consumption) continuously, improving the accuracy of the measurement of the ATP hydrolysis rate given by the slope of the various traces. Given the fact that the lack of purity of samples displayed in Figure 4B is mainly due to contamination by proteins present in the purified 3C sample, we may also argue that activity measurements of the intact WT ATP8B1-CDC50A complex that has not been treated with 3C do not reveal any stimulation by PC and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. In this case, the ATPase activity of ATP8B1-CDC50A is revealed thanks to limited proteolysis with trypsin in the ATPase assay cuvette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), in order to remove the autoinhibitory tails, and following a procedure devised for the yeast Drs2-Cdc50 complex (Azouaoui et al., (2017) <italic>J Biol Chem</italic>, 292:7954). This strongly suggests that if no activity can be revealed for WT and ΔN42 in Figure 4B, this is not because of their lack of purity.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>ATPase activity measurements of streptavidin-purified WT ATP8B1-CDC50A.</title><p>(A) ATPase activity of the purified ATP8B1-CDC50A complex determined in DDM/CHS at 30°C, using an enzyme-coupled assay, where the kinetics of NADH oxidation is monitored continuously.

Please explain baseline corrections in the legend. The legend includes that data is mean of 3 replicate experiments (technical). Please include the information regarding biological (N) repeats.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we added to Figure 4B ATPase activity measurements performed when the protein is present, but in the absence of lipids (light grey bars in Figure 4B). In the data displayed in Figure 4B, there is no baseline correction. On the contrary, to avoid missing any useful information associated with these experiments, we chose to plot data that have not been treated beforehand. The background NADH oxidation, measured before adding the purified ATP8B1-CDC50A complex and the various lipids, is symbolized by the presence of the dotted line in Figure 4B (see the legend to Figure 4B). When monitoring continuously at 340 nm the rate of ATP hydrolysis, via its coupling to NADH oxidation, we observe for all experiments photobleaching of NADH, resulting in the ‘background NADH oxidation’ mentioned above. We reduce this photobleaching of NADH by inserting an MTO J310A filter that eliminates the short wavelength UV-exciting light of our diode-array spectrophotometer lamp, as excitation of the 260-nm absorption band of NADH is much more deleterious for light stability of NADH than excitation of its 340-nm band. Furthermore, we are not completely sure why the reviewers are asking for a control with just lipids and no protein. We assume it is because the reviewers want to see the contribution of the various lipids added to the assay cuvette on the NADH oxidation rate. If so, Figure 4B already addresses this point as the addition of lipids to the WT complex, for instance, does not have any significant effect on the NADH oxidation rate. Incidentally, Figure 4B also shows that adding solely the purified complexes to the assay cuvette does not either promote NADH oxidation further than that corresponding to photobleaching. Therefore, this methodology allows to unambiguously conclude that the rate of ATP hydrolysis measured for the WT or ΔN42 in the absence or presence of lipids does not correspond to basal activity. In any case, we apologize for any confusion or misunderstanding of data displayed in this figure. To improve this, we suggest to add as Figure 4 —figure supplement 3 the raw absorption traces highlighting the various additions to the WT and catalytic D454N mutant of ATP8B1. The data plotted in Figure 4B are from one experiment, with technical replicates. However, we obtained similar results from two independent batches of purified ΔN42/C1174 and ΔC1174. Results from Figure 4B and Figure 5 reflect two independent (biological) replicates of purified ΔN42/C1174 and ΔC1174. We chose to plot data in Figure 4B from a single experiment because it allowed us to display values for specific activity while should we have combined results from two independent experiments, we would have needed to plot as % of max because of the non-negligible error associated with ATP8B1 quantification from SDS-PAGE. To mention clearly the reproducibility of the above-mentioned experiments, we stated in the Methods section that ΔN42/C1174 and ΔC1174 come from two independent batches. Furthermore, those two batches are referred to as ‘purification 1’ in the legend to Figure 4 and ‘purification 2’ in the legend to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Figure 5: The order of panels can be changed.

To address this issue, we monitored absorbance at 340 nm of a cuvette containing the ATPase activity medium, in the absence or in the presence of the C-terminal peptide at 70 µM, a concentration that inhibits ATP8B1-CDC50A. Repeated additions of ADP at a final concentration of 10 µM led to the expected oxidation of 10 µM NADH, resulting in a fast OD change of ~0.06 AU at 340 nm. We conclude that the ATP8B1 C-terminal peptide has no adverse effect on the ability of the enzyme-coupled assay to regenerate ATP.

Similarly, Line 457 mentions about basic residues predicted to bind phospholipid. Mutagenesis experiments to confirm the location of the lipid binding site and to evaluate how changes in the lipid translocation pathway affect stimulation of ATPase activity by phospholipid could be of value. These suggested experiments would provide possible explanation for structural basis of these effects and would make the reading more interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that Figure 8 would be more attractive if mutations were classified and colored according to the nature of the disease and we did so in the new version of Figure 8.</p><p>The suggested mutagenesis experiments are certainly of very high interest but in practice, it’s not going to be possible to do that in a reasonable amount of time. The yield of purification of ATP8B1, although sufficient to conduct cryo-EM experiments, remains limiting for biochemical experiments. Purifying mutants requires several liters of culture for each mutant and we are actually working at the moment on improving yield and purity of ATP8B1 for the purpose of characterizing mutations found in PFIC1 and BRIC1 patients. This is currently the project of a PhD student in our lab. Unfortunately, the project is not mature enough to envision this can be done sufficiently quickly. Finally, the primary purpose of the manuscript we submit to <italic>eLife</italic> concerns the regulatory mechanism of ATP8B1-CDC50A, including autoinhibition by its terminal tails and activation by phosphoinositides, and we kindly ask for structure-function studies of the mutants to be kept for a follow-up article.</p></body></sub-article></article>
