Prior acute e-cigarette studies have demonstrated inflammatory and cardiopulmonary physiology changes while chronic studies have demonstrated extra-pulmonary effects, including neurotransmitter alterations in reward pathways. In this study we investigated the impact of inhalation of aerosols produced from pod-based, flavored e-cigarettes (JUUL) aerosols three times daily for 3 months on inflammatory markers in the brain, lung, heart, and colon. JUUL aerosol exposure induced upregulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens in the central nervous system. Inflammatory gene expression increased in the colon, while gene expression was more broadly altered by e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in the lung. Cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with lipopolysaccharide were exacerbated in the heart. Flavor-specific findings were detected across these studies. Our findings suggest that daily e-cigarette use may cause neuroinflammation, which may contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders. In addition, e-cigarette use may cause gut inflammation, which has been tied to poor systemic health, and cardiac inflammation, which leads to cardiovascular disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The use of e-cigarettes or ‘vaping’ has become widespread, particularly among young people and smokers trying to quit. One of the most popular e-cigarette brands is JUUL, which offers appealing flavors and a discrete design. Many e-cigarette users believe these products are healthier than traditional tobacco products. And while the harms of conventional tobacco products have been extensively researched, the short- and long-term health effects of e-cigarettes have not been well studied. There is even less information about the health impacts of newer products like JUUL.</p><p>E-cigarettes made by JUUL are different relative to prior generations of e-cigarettes. The JUUL device uses disposable pods filled with nicotinic salts instead of nicotine. One JUUL pod contains as much nicotine as an entire pack of cigarettes (41.3 mg). These differences make studying the health effects of this product particularly important.</p><p>Moshensky, Brand, Alhaddad et al. show that daily exposure to JUUL aerosols increases the expression of genes encoding inflammatory molecules in the brain, lung, heart and colon of mice. In the experiments, mice were exposed to JUUL mint and JUUL mango flavored aerosols for 20 minutes, 3 times a day, and for 4 and 12 weeks. The changes in inflammatory gene expression varied depending on the flavor. This suggests that the flavorings themselves contribute to the observed changes.</p><p>The findings suggest that daily use of pod-based e-cigarettes or e-cigarettes containing high levels of nicotinic salts over months to years, may cause inflammation in various organs, increasing the risk of disease and poor health. This information may help individuals, clinicians and policymakers make more informed decisions about e-cigarettes. Further studies assessing the impact of these changes on long-term physical and mental health in humans are desperately needed. These should assess health effects across different e-cigarette types, flavors and duration of use.</p></abstract><kwd-group

smoke is known to damage multiple cell types and cause a wide range of diseases throughout the body. In particular, many pulmonary inflammatory diseases are caused and affected by conventional tobacco use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin and Crotty Alexander, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crotty Alexander et al., 2015a</xref>). It is also known that nicotine affects brain development and alters responses to addictive substances. Nicotine activates carcinogenic pathways, putting users at an increased risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Services USDoHaH, 2014</xref>). With unproven claims to be a safer alternative to cigarette smoking, modern electronic (e)-cigarette devices were introduced in 2003 as a novel nicotine delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cahn and Siegel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crotty Alexander et al., 2015b</xref>). The JUUL, a device that gained popularity due to its sleek and concealable design, has utilized pods containing e-liquids with enticing flavors such as Mango, Mint, and Crème Brulee (now discontinued) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). However, the health effects of chronic inhalation of aerosols generated from pod devices remain largely unknown.</p><p>While the data on health effects of conventional tobacco are extensive, the data on e-cigarettes and vaping devices are less established due to their recent entry to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozier et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, research in this area is impeded by the rapid evolution of vaping devices. The vape pens and cig-a-likes were the first e-cigarettes studied from 2007 to 2014, whereas the box Mods became highly popular and research on these devices began around 2015. Pod devices, including the JUUL, were invented in 2016 and rapidly dominated the market by 2017–2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craver, 2019</xref>). These pod-based devices produce aerosols with a different chemical composition than prior devices, including often significant higher concentrations of nicotine than Mod devices. Studies of JUUL to date have been predominantly subacute and acute exposures with a focus on in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Further studies into the overlap of induced neuroinflammatory pathways between drugs of abuse and JUUL is required to better understand these relationships. This includes studies in human subjects to assess the incidence of anxiety and depression in JUUL users. Indeed, neuroinflammatory effects caused by chronic, daily JUUL exposure may lead to adaptations in neural circuitry that promote addictive behaviors and drug dependence, providing a neurophysiological explanation for the observation that e-cigarette use does not help with smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alasmari et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that high concentrations of nicotine inhalation are toxic to the human body in a variety of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mishra et al., 2015</xref>).

Previous studies utilizing continuous systemic delivery of nicotine via implanted pumps concluded that nicotine did not contribute to the development of neuroinflammation. The differences in findings between this study and previous work could be explained by differences in the mode of nicotine delivery, type of nicotine (free-base nicotine and nicotinic salts), inhalant device or other chemicals contained in the vaping aerosols, including vehicle components. Notably, because Mint and Mango effects differed, several of our findings point to a ‘non-nicotine’ chemical flavorant component of the JUUL device that may be driving inflammatory changes in the brain. Recent study into the effects of vaping on the blood brain barrier lends further support to this theory, as pro-inflammatory changes were observed, partly independent of nicotine content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heldt et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pulmonary</title><p>As the entry point to the body for inhalants, the lungs get a high level of exposure to the chemicals within e-cigarette aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grana et al., 2014</xref>).

While it may take decades for us to fully understand the pathologic effects of e-cigarette aerosols on the lungs, animal models can provide some insight as to what physiologic, inflammatory, and even carcinogenic effects may occur. While prior studies using earlier generations of e-devices and e-liquids have found numerous changes in the lungs, we found that 1-month and 3-month JUUL Mint and Mango exposures did not induce airway hyperreactivity, emphysematous changes, or overt inflammation. However, the gene expression changes detected within the lung parenchyma raise concern for an altered phenotypic state. These changes are most ominous for their likelihood of altering the lungs responses to challenges, such as bacteria, viruses, smoke and pollution. The association of JUUL Mint exposure with a unique set of gene expression changes in the setting of inhaled LPS challenge further supports this theory, demonstrating that e-cigarette exposed lung tissue responds differently to an inflammatory challenge. And as we have learned time and time again in the immune and inflammatory fields, any tipping of the balance will lead to pathology and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>E-cigarette flavors</title><p>While the nicotine concentration in JUUL pods is quite high, it does not vary with the JUUL flavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Omaiye et al., 2019</xref>).

We observed significantly different inflammatory gene alterations in cardiac and colonic tissue in response to exposure to Mint and Mango JUUL aerosols for 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Similarly, Omaiye et al reported a variety of different flavoring chemical across JUUL flavors and demonstrated that aerosols generated from different JUUL flavors induced different levels of cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells in vitro, in a flavor-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Omaiye et al., 2019</xref>).

As a result, we surmise that the flavoring compound menthol in ‘Cool Mint’ could be a factor in the differences seen in the effects of Mint vs Mango. Overall, these findings suggest that components other than nicotine may contribute to the observed neuroinflammatory changes. Further research is needed to better understand how specific, non-nicotine JUUL components contribute to inflammatory and neuronal effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Fibrosis</title><p>Collagen expression is a hallmark of fibrosis and has previously been observed in studies involving combustible cigarette smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond et al., 2016</xref>). However, compared to our prior study with Vape pens (using the nose-only InExpose system by SciReq) where profound increases in collagen deposition were observed across cardiac, hepatic and renal issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crotty Alexander et al., 2018</xref>), we did not find increased fibrosis in these same organs in JUUL exposed mice. This raises questions about the role of different e-cigarette devices, e-liquids and experimental approaches for aerosol exposures and suggests differences in the chemical composition of aerosol and its delivery as potential causes of different biological outcomes. Research in this area is thus complex, as many teams are using a variety of devices and liquids, which may produce different effects on mammalian systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Colon</title><p>Intensive research has been done on the effect of cigarette smoke on inflammation and the pathogenesis of diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease, however there are mixed, somewhat inconclusive results when it comes to whether this exposure leads to long-term activation or suppression of inflammatory pathways, and their relation to the likelihood of developing these gastrointestinal afflictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Verschuere et al., 2012</xref>). Nicotine specifically has been previously found to decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Dijk et al., 1995</xref>). Here, we saw an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon after 1 month of exposure, whereas these same signals were significantly decreased after 3 months of exposure when compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, over the course of the 3 months, the body may adapt to these changes and downregulate these markers significantly through some yet unidentified mechanism, pathway, or interaction with the specific components in the JUUL device. Whether this inflammatory adaption is beneficial or detrimental to the overall health of the colon remains to be defined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Cardiac</title><p>Bacterial pneumonia and acute lung injury are known to cause inflammation systemically and in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morris, 2014</xref>). Indeed, effects of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, while originating in the lung, appear to also signal to the heart, where pathological inflammation and cardiac dysfunction are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishiga et al., 2020</xref>). The importance of cardiac inflammation in development of heart failure following viral infection, myocardial infarction and non-ischemic cardiac injury has been increasingly appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamo et al., 2020</xref>). For example, <italic>Il1b</italic> blockade has been shown to diminish adverse cardiac events and heart failure progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Everett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbate et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrate here that the hearts of mice subject to chronic JUUL exposure are more sensitive to the effects of LPS delivered to the lung than are Air control mice, as evidenced by enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including <italic>Il1b</italic>. The observation that there were no significant changes in vagal tone (assessed by heart rate variability) and that the pro-inflammatory enhancement by JUUL exposure was largely confined to JUUL Mint, suggests that this is not due to signals generated by direct nicotine action. While the mechanism by which chronic JUUL exposure predisposes to LPS-induced cardiac inflammation remains to be determined, these findings suggest that chronic JUUL inhalation could lead to systemic changes which sensitize maladaptive inflammatory responses that affect cardiac function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>Contrary to our initial expectations, we did not find significant changes in autonomic tone or pulmonary function with daily, long-term JUUL aerosol exposure. Our model is limited in that mice are primarily nose breathers and we used whole-body exposure, so it is possible that the extent of e-cigarette aerosol exposure at the level of the alveoli may be lower than in humans due to aerosol deposition within the nasal cavity. Alternatively, our study may be underpowered to detect subtle differences induced by JUUL vaping. Furthermore, our study only assessed the impact of daily JUUL aerosol inhalation for 1 and 3 month-long exposures and thus cannot ensure that other effects may be seen with more chronic, 6–12 month, exposures.</p><p>Our study also used a 5 day per week exposure model, which is common practice in many exposure labs due to the difficulty and onerous nature of 7-day exposure models for months on end, but is a limitation in that the 2 day breaks over weekends may have allowed for inflammatory and physiologic recovery. These studies were conducted in female mice, such that findings may not be applicable in males. While humans use e-cigarettes throughout the day, pulling out their e-device and vaping numerous times, this use pattern was not accurately mimicked in this study where the exposures were run three times daily. However, this limit to 20 min three times daily was necessary to allow mice access to food and water, and to keep their stress level minimal.A limitation to any future studies is that the Mint and Mango JUUL flavors can no longer be studied since they have been discontinued. While these two flavors are no longer available they were composed of chemicals commonly found in other flavors, such that these data are likely relevant to other vapes. In particular, JUUL Mint shares chemical features with JUUL Menthol, which took its place as one of the most popular JUUL flavors.</p><p>It is important to mention that this is the first study to assess JUUL devices and flavorants in a multiorgan fashion. We found effects of JUUL aerosols on inflammatory responses in organs other than the lungs, demonstrating that the effects of e-cigarette exposure may be far-reaching across the body, as are those of cigarette smoke. While this study identified inflammation within brain regions, raising concern for both behavioral and psychological effects in human vapers, dedicated studies of the effects of e-cigarette use on behavior and mood states are needed. While the majority of changes in cytokine levels induced by e-cigarette exposure across organ systems were relatively small, the fact that multiple cytokines changed in concert indicates a significant shift in immunophenotyping across organs. We are most concerned about how these shifts in the inflammatory state will alter an e-cigarette users response to common clinical challenges. For example, Madison et al. exposed mice to e-cigarette aerosols with and without nicotine and found that both exposures increased susceptibility to acute lung injury in the setting of viral pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Madison et al., 2019</xref>). In our work, we utilized the LPS model of acute lung injury to take a first look at the potential impact of JUUL inhalation in particular on susceptibility to lung inflammation. Further work is needed to truly define how the subtle, broad shifts in the cytokine milieu across organs will impact the health of e-cigarette vapers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that chronic inhalation of chemicals within e-cigarette aerosols can lead to inflammatory changes across multiple organ systems. JUUL users may unwittingly expose themselves to increased neurologic, colonic and cardiac risk. Further research isgreatlyneeded to better understand the long-lasting effects of vaping.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>JUUL exposures</title><p>Six to eight week old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Envigo. After 2 days to allow mice to equilibrate with their environment, all mice were placed into a large enclosure to allow mixing of the microbiome for one hour. Mice were placed three per cage and each cage was randomly assigned to the type of exposure ( ≥ 2 cages per exposure). Mice were placed in individual sections of a full-body exposure chamber (Scireq) for 20 min three times daily, for a total of 60 min per day, for 4–12 weeks. Mice were exposed to either e-cigarette aerosol created from Mango JUUL pods or Mint JUUL pods containing 5% nicotinic salts (59 mg/ml) using the InExpose system (Scireq). Air control mice were placed in an identical chamber for the same amount of time but inhaled room air only. A 3-D printed adapter was created to produce a tight fit for the JUUL device (designed and produced by Vitorino Scientific LLC). A negative pressure of 2 L/s was used to activate the e-cigarette for 4 s followed by 16 s of room air at 2 L/s. The final exposure was done 30 min prior to harvest. All experiments were conducted with approval of the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol S16021).

Measurements of lung physiology via mechanic scans were obtained at baseline, followed by assessment of physiologic responses to methacholine (MCH) challenge at 0, 6, 12, and 24 mg/ml, including Respiratory Resistance (Rrs) and Elastance (Ers). Pressure Volume (PV) loops were also obtained.

Lung slices were stained with H&amp;E. Mean Linear Intercept (MLI) was assessed by sampling a single sagittal tissue section containing large, medium and small airways from each lung specimen. The lung sections were digitally scanned at ×10 magnification, yielding an effective isotropicpixel size of 0.441 μm. The digitally scanned lung sections were analyzed using FIJI ImageJ. MLI was estimated using the intersection counting method. A two-dimensional square grid, of side length 200 μm, was superimposed on the lung image at full resolution. A random offset was applied to the grid independently for each image and grid fields that did not fall completely within the lung parenchymawere excluded from analysis. A subset of the eligible grid fields (~30 per lung) was chosen using the principles of systemic uniform random sampling (SURS) to optimize unbiased sampling. The total number of lung fields in the section were counted from the top left edge of the image, progressing back and forth until all sections were identified.

The gene expression data acquired by qPCR was analyzed using the comparative 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method, with GAPDH (brain) and 18 S rRNA (colon) expression levels used as the internal control.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con26"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

This paper is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> and should be published. I have some major comments which are listed below.</p><p>I am concerned that a lot of these studies had relatively low n numbers (n=5 in some cases) and that some of the studies may have been underpowered. Given the variability with in vivo studies, some endpoints may have been significant with more numbers. Along these lines, what is the justification for using the (parametric) ANOVA test. I'm not a statistician but I thought that the rule of thumb was that non-parametric tests should be used if n&lt;12 since you cannot verify that the data is normally distributed. In this case, I would recommend having a statistician look at it and/or increasing some of the N's, or using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Indeed, in some cases, the variation the variation is quite large (ie Figure 6, 7). Whilst I do not think that the low N's change the ultimate conclusions, but more rigor (ie more N's) would help solidify the paper given that it will likely be of great interest and scrutinized by the scientific community.</p><p>Figure S3. For the lung histology, please quantify the mean linear intercept per ATS guidelines and show representative BAL images.</p><p>One of the must novel conclusions from this paper is increased inflammation in the brain which the authors speculate could lead to altered moods and or change the addiction threshold. I would tend to agree with this conclusion, but could the authors perform additional mouse psychological tests to confirm this? Also, were there observable physiological responses in the vaped mice that could be reported which may correlate this conclusion, ie changes in grooming, fur ruffling or other behavioral changes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Under homeostasis conditions, the authors observed sign of inflammatory responses in the brain, the heart and the colon, while no inflammation was detected in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of the mice following exposures to JUUL aerosols. Also, JUUL aerosol exposures mediated airway inflammatory responses in the acute lung injury model (LPS). Further, this infection affected the inflammatory responses in the cardiac tissue. Most of the biological adverse effects induced by JUUL aerosols were flavor-specific.</p><p>Strengths include evaluating inflammation in multiple organs, as well as assessing the physiological responses in the lungs (lung function) and cardiovascular system (heart rate, blood pressure), following exposures to JUUL aerosols. Weaknesses include the fact that only female mice were used in this study. Further, the daily exposures to either air or to the JUUL aerosols lasted only 20 min per day. It is unclear how a 20-min exposure is representative of human vaping product use. Also, although daily exposures were conducted for a duration of both 1 and 3 months, time-course effects associated with JUUL aerosols are barely addressed.</p><p>Although there are a few limitations related to this study, which should be included in the manuscript, overall, the authors' claims and conclusions are based on the data that is presented through multiple figures.</p><p>– The title should include the 2 JUUL flavors that were investigated in this study.</p><p>– In the introduction and Discussion sections, the authors should consider including all in vitro and in vivo studies that have been conducted on JUUL aerosols, since there are very few of those already published articles. This would also allow to compare and contrast the results described in this manuscript.</p><p>– The authors should add a limitation paragraph at the end of the manuscript, describing the limiting factors that make the results presented here specific to this study; e.g., daily exposure duration (20 min), use of female mice only, exposures being conducted 5 days a week, etc.</p><p>– It is unclear why the authors did not evaluate the gene expression of various cytokines in the lung tissue.</p><p>– The authors should state the rationale for using only female mice in this study.</p><p>– It is unclear why the authors do not present their gene expression data in the form of a heatmap instead of 24 small individual graphs (one graph per gene) (e.g., Figures 3 and 6).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Alex Moshensky et al., investigated effects of chronic aerosol inhalation of flavored JUUL on inflammatory markers in several organs, including brain, lung, heart, and colon in a mouse model. They found that JUUL inhalation upregulated a number of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens. Inflammatory gene expression increased in colon, and cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with LPS were exacerbated in the heart. They also found flavor-dependent changes in several responses.</p><p>Overall, it is a descriptive study and the conclusions was not clearly supported by the data.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Due to the rapid evolution of vaping devices, the data on health effects of Pod devices are scarce. This study provides useful information on the inflammatory change caused by chronic JUUL aerosol inhalation.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. The authors observed neuroinflammation in brain regions responsible for behavior modification, drug reward and formation of anxious or depressive behaviors after exposure to JUUL. The importance of the neuroinflammation is still unclear. It would help demonstrate the pathogenic role of the neuroinflammation by testing animal behaviors. Similar issue for other organ inflammation.</p><p>2. Majority of the data are inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression. Other methods would be needed to confirm their expression.</p><p>3. The author seemed to assume the difference between JUUL Mango and JUUL Mint is flavor and then came up with the conclusion regarding flavor-dependent changes in several inflammatory responses. Evidence is needed to approve the assumption.</p><p>4. In most cases, the change of inflammatory cytokines is mild ~2 fold. The author should demonstrate how these marginal change could affect pathophysiology.</p><p>5. To fully evaluate the health impact of evolving cigarette, it would be informative to included other tobacco or vaping device as control.</p><p>6. The longest exposure in the study is 3 months. It is not convicting to come up with conclusions regarding chronic exposure. Some organ showing no difference may be due to the timing.</p><p>7. It would help reader to see the dynamic change of inflammation by combining 1 month with 3 month data into one graph for individual cytokines.</p><p>8. ELISA or western blot should be included to measure cytokine for two reasons – the fold-change is mild for most cytokines and difference in mRNA level does not necessarily mean difference in protein.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67621.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a potentially important paper that aimed to investigate the effects of vaping on multiple organs.

Based on the reviewer comments outlined in detail below, please revise the manuscript to avoid overstatements and include a limitations paragraph within the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have gone through the manuscript in detail and have altered the verbiage in multiple places to try to ensure that our findings are not overstated. Also, we have separated out our existing limitations within the discussion as a distinct section to identify the limitations of our study more readily, and have included additional points to more comprehensively discuss the limitations of our study, leading to this section being 3 full paragraphs (see pages 18 to 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The current data are based on (mild induction of) cytokine mRNA expression. Other methods are required to confirm their expression on protein and significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Of note, in the original submission, we included protein quantification data for both the brain (Figure 2) and the lung (Figure 7). We have taken the reviewers comments to heart and have conducted protein-level assays on the cardiac tissues as well, yielding additional data (<italic>new Figure 4</italic>) that has been added to the methods, results, figures and discussion. Unfortunately, we do not have any additional colonic tissue for protein-level assessments, as all of the tissue was used for the gene transcription (Figure 5) and histologic studies. But to take a step back, these studies were originally intended to examine the broad reaching impact of e-cigarette aerosols across the body. This work, and thus this manuscript, was designed to highlight changes at the gene expression level, to demonstrate that e-cigarette use is not benign and does have broad-reaching effects on gene expression. We agree that more work is needed to fully define the impact of e-cigarette use at the protein, cellular, and organ level, but the majority of that work is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To bring the focus back to gene expression, we have conducted RNAseq on the lungs of JUUL exposed mice, and have included those data herein (<italic>new Figure 6</italic>) to highlight the effects of e-cigarette aerosols on gene expression in the lung, with a particular focus on differences between Mint and Mango flavors (the most popular JUUL flavors at the time of this study). Methods, results, and discussion related to the RNAseq results have been added to the manuscript. These data support the hypothesis that e-cigarette aerosol inhalation fundamentally alters the lung, which raises the specter of downstream health effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have added further discussion regarding the potential consequences of inflammation in each of the organs (pages 13-18), with an emphasis on the effects of neuroinflammation on behavior and psychology. We have subdivided the Discussion section to highlight potential effects on each distinct organ. It is clear that further studies are needed to best assess potential psychological and behavioral changes induced by e-cigarette aerosol inhalation. Of note, we did not observe any overt behavioral changes – we closely observe the mice both during and after exposures and make notes regarding grouping, fur, and activity level – none of which were changed by the different vaping exposures. We have added the lack of dedicated behavioral and psychological evaluations as a limitation of this work and as an opportunity for discovery in future studies (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Of note, the MLI data matches our original physiologic assessments of lung function (Appendix 1 – Figure 2A-2J), including elastance and compliance, which are known to change in the setting of emphysema. MLI, lung elastance and compliance were no different across inhalant groups and controls.

To obtain the most broad and detailed data possible, we assessed gene transcription across the lung via RNAseq (<italic>new Figure 6</italic>).

We set the target number of mice (n) at that time, such that these studies would be powered to detect a 25% change in cytokine expression. Based on discussions with our biostatisticians, we came to the conclusion that it would not be statistically appropriate to run more mice to increase the n when our primary outcome remains the same. In addition, and most relevant to this specific recommendation, JUUL Mint and JUUL Mango flavors are no longer on the market, such that extensive further studies are not feasible. While these two flavors are not available anymore, they were composed of an array of chemicals commonly found in other flavors (but in different combinations), such that we believe that these data are most likely relevant to other vapes. In particular, JUUL Mint shares chemical features with JUUL Menthol, which took its place as one of the most popular JUUL flavors. The discontinuation of these flavors has been added as a limitation within the Discussion (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a very interesting and potentially very important paper that shows multi-organ effects of JUUL exposure in mice.

Given the variability with in vivo studies, some endpoints may have been significant with more numbers. Along these lines, what is the justification for using the (parametric) ANOVA test. I'm not a statistician but I thought that the rule of thumb was that non-parametric tests should be used if n&lt;12 since you cannot verify that the data is normally distributed. In this case, I would recommend having a statistician look at it and/or increasing some of the N's, or using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Indeed, in some cases, the variation the variation is quite large (ie Figure 6, 7). Whilst I do not think that the low N's change the ultimate conclusions, but more rigor (ie more N's) would help solidify the paper given that it will likely be of great interest and scrutinized by the scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted power analyses prior to the start of the studies to identify the number of animals per group to use, based on our past studies of inflammatory changes induced by inhalants, infections and asthma.

Also, JUUL aerosol exposures mediated airway inflammatory responses in the acute lung injury model (LPS). Further, this infection affected the inflammatory responses in the cardiac tissue. Most of the biological adverse effects induced by JUUL aerosols were flavor-specific.</p><p>Strengths include evaluating inflammation in multiple organs, as well as assessing the physiological responses in the lungs (lung function) and cardiovascular system (heart rate, blood pressure), following exposures to JUUL aerosols. Weaknesses include the fact that only female mice were used in this study. Further, the daily exposures to either air or to the JUUL aerosols lasted only 20 min per day. It is unclear how a 20-min exposure is representative of human vaping product use. Also, although daily exposures were conducted for a duration of both 1 and 3 months, time-course effects associated with JUUL aerosols are barely addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their positive comments on our manuscript. We apologize for our error; in reality we exposed mice for 20 minutes three times daily, so one hour in total per day. We have corrected this error within our Methods. We designed the exposures this way to better mimic human e-cigarette use throughout the day (instead in one intense vaping session per day, which is not the norm). We agree that there is a limitation in using only female mice in the study in case that there are sex-dependent effects, which is definitely an interesting question. We typically start with one sex of mice and then run repeat experiments with the other sex. Unfortunately, this study faced problems beyond our control that prevented us from performing further experiments. In late 2019 the FDA was moving to ban specific flavors for pod devices, which include those for Mint and Mango. In anticipation of the new regulations, JUUL ultimately decided to discontinue JUUL Mint and Mango, and soon they were out of the market. The same process occurred with the other popular JUUL flavors such as Crème Brûlée and Cucumber. We have expanded the limitation section within the Discussion, and have pointed out that because these studies were conducted in female mice alone, the results may not represent effects in males.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although there are a few limitations related to this study, which should be included in the manuscript, overall, the authors' claims and conclusions are based on the data that is presented through multiple figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewers comments and have added limitations about the study size, power, lack of male subjects, etc. to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The title should include the 2 JUUL flavors that were investigated in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the 2 flavors to the title of the study.

The following key words were inserted into PubMed: “in vitro and JUUL aerosol”, “in vivo and JUUL aerosol”, and “JUUL aerosol”. The first search, “in vitro and JUUL aerosol”, had 7 results of which 4 were relevant. The second search “in vivo and JUUL aerosol” had in 1 result; however, the same study was already included within the former search. The final broad search “JUUL aerosol” had 45 results, of which 9 (not including duplicates from the previous searches) were relevant. 1 article had already been cited. The literature review found a total of 13 articles all of which have been cited in the revised manuscript, primarily via the following paragraph added to the Introduction:</p><p>Introduction: “Studies of JUUL to date have been predominantly subacute and acute exposures with a focus on in vitro and in vivo experiments. A majority of the current literature examined the cytotoxic effects of varying JUUL flavors (Crème Brulee, Cool Mint, Fruit Medley, Tobacco, Menthol, etc.) on cells of the respiratory system (10-17). Most in vitro studies concluded that JUUL aerosols are cytotoxic and impair cell function (10, 12-16). Additional studies defined the chemical profiles of JUUL flavored cartridges (11) or examined aerosol emission and oxidant yields from flavored JUUL pods (18, 19). These studies concluded that while JUUL pods had significantly lower oxidant yields in comparison to combustible cigarettes, the nicotine concentrations were substantially greater (18-20). Another study assessed whether exposure to JUUL aerosol (in comparison to aerosol containing Vitamin E Acetate) played a causal role in EVALI patients (21). While the study revealed that 15 days of exposure to JUUL aerosol did not cause direct lung injury, the authors cautioned that chronic exposure to nicotine may still have a disruptive effect on lung physiology (21). While these studies have laid the groundwork for assessing the acute impact of JUUL use on the respiratory system, much work remains to be done on the effects across the body.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should add a limitation paragraph at the end of the manuscript, describing the limiting factors that make the results presented here specific to this study; e.g., daily exposure duration (20 min), use of female mice only, exposures being conducted 5 days a week, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our error; in reality we exposed mice for 20 minutes three times daily, so one hour in total per day.

We have added further discussion regarding this limitation into the discussion.

The author seemed to assume the difference between JUUL Mango and JUUL Mint is flavor and then came up with the conclusion regarding flavor-dependent changes in several inflammatory responses. Evidence is needed to approve the assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the formulation of JUUL e-liquids is proprietary, their website claims simplicity (https://www.juul.com/learn/pods) in that they use pharmaceutical grade propylene glycol and glycerol (which makes up the majority of their e-liquids), in order to form an aerosol which carries pharmaceutical grade nicotine and benzoic acid (when combined, create a nicotine salt), and flavors (which can be can be a mixture of natural and artificial ingredients). Thus, according to their website the only difference among the different JUUL pods would be the flavoring components. Hence, we concluded that differences observed in our study between Mint vs Mango should be most likely due to flavor-dependent effects, since base components should be the same. To support this flavor-dependent effect, a study from Omaiye et al., in 2019 (PMID: 30896936) showed the variety of different flavoring chemical in all JUUL flavors and how the different JUUL vapors induce different level of cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells in vitro based their flavor.

We are most concerned about how these shifts in the inflammatory state will alter an e-cigarette vapers response to common clinical challenges. In Dr. Kheradmand’s recent work, mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols with and without nicotine were much more susceptible to acute lung injury in the setting of viral pneumonia. In our work, we utilized the LPS model of acute lung injury to take a first look at the potential impact of JUUL inhalation in particular on susceptibility to lung inflammation.

To fully evaluate the health impact of evolving cigarette, it would be informative to included other tobacco or vaping device as control.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such comparisons are likely to provide insight into the differences between devices and formulations and versus cigarette smoke, and thus will be incredibly important for the field. However, these comparisons were beyond the scope of this study, whose main goal was to assess the inflammatory and physiological aspects of JUUL in particular. We believe this to be important because JUUL e-cigarettes are the most popular of all e-cigarette devices, and many young users do not use other e-devices or conventional tobacco. Thus, our primary objective of this work was to specifically assess the safety or risk of this device in particular (versus not using any inhalant at all). However, because we have run parallel studies in the past with vape pens, box mods, and conventional tobacco, we are hopeful to start combining data to look for trends and differences across inhalant exposures. For example, we recently published our work on differences in metabolites in the circulation of mice exposed to a wide variety of e-cigarette based inhalants (Moshensky et al., Vaping induced metabolomic signatures in the circulation of mice are driven by device type, eliquid, exposure duration and sex).</p><p>ERJ Open. July 2021 PMID: 34262972.

The longest exposure in the study is 3 months. It is not convicting to come up with conclusions regarding chronic exposure.

We have also removed many instances of the descriptive terms acute, sub-acute and chronic across the manuscript, as focused on using the absolute duration of exposure instead, to avoid accidental extrapolation to longer exposures. Because we utilized cellular and molecular based assays, we were not relying on identifying organ level pathology such as fibrosis, emphysema, and organ dysfunction, all of which would require longer exposures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In the original manuscript we did include protein-based quantification data for the brain and lung. We have now run protein-based assays for the cardiac tissue (<italic>new Figure 4</italic>). However, we did not have enough tissue to conduct protein-based studies on colon tissue. Although we were unable to include protein based quantification for all organs, we do feel that our original intention of demonstrating broad reaching effects of e-cigarette aerosols across the body was still achieved. But we absolutely agree that more work is needed to fully define the impact of e-cigarette use at the protein, cellular, and organ level.</p></body></sub-article></article>
