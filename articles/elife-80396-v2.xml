Although mtDNA mutations occur at high frequency, they are inherited infrequently, indicating that germline mechanisms limit their accumulation. To determine how germline mtDNA is regulated, we examined the control of mtDNA quantity and quality in <italic>C. elegans</italic> primordial germ cells (PGCs). We show that PGCs combine strategies to generate a low point in mtDNA number by segregating mitochondria into lobe-like protrusions that are cannibalized by adjacent cells, and by concurrently eliminating mitochondria through autophagy, reducing overall mtDNA content twofold. As PGCs exit quiescence and divide, mtDNAs replicate to maintain a set point of ~200 mtDNAs per germline stem cell. Whereas cannibalism and autophagy eliminate mtDNAs stochastically, we show that the kinase PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), operating independently of Parkin and autophagy, preferentially reduces the fraction of mutant mtDNAs. Thus, PGCs employ parallel mechanisms to control both the quantity and quality of the founding population of germline mtDNAs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are the powerhouses of every cell in our bodies. These tiny structures convert energy from the food we eat into a form that cells are able to use. As well as being a separate organ-like structure within our cells, mitochondria even have their own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA contains genes for a small number of special enzymes that allow it to extract energy from food. In contrast, the rest of our cells’ DNA is stored in another structure called the nucleus.</p><p>Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are also inherited differently. We inherit nuclear DNA from both our mother and father, but mitochondrial DNA is only passed down from our mothers. During reproduction, maternal DNA (including mitochondrial DNA) comes from the egg cell, which combines with sperm to produce offspring.</p><p>Defects, or mutations, in mitochondrial genes often lead to mitochondrial diseases. These have a severe impact on health, especially during the very first stages of life. The lineage of precursor cells that gives rise to egg cells is thought to protect itself from mitochondrial mutations, but how it does this is still unclear. Schwartz et al. therefore set out to determine what molecular mechanisms preserve the integrity of mitochondrial DNA from one generation to the next.</p><p>To address this question, <italic>C. elegans</italic> roundworms were used, as they are easy to manipulate genetically, and since they are small and transparent, their cells – as well as their mitochondria – are also easily viewed under a microscope. Tracking mitochondria in the worms’ egg precursor cells (also called primordial germ cells, or PGCs) revealed that PGCs actively removed excess mitochondria. The PGCs did this either by internally breaking down mitochondria themselves, or by moving them into protruding lobe-like structures which surrounding cells then engulfed and ‘digested’.</p><p>Further genetic studies revealed that the PGCs also directly regulated the quality of mitochondrial DNA via a mechanism dependent on the protein PINK1. In worms lacking PINK1, mutant mitochondrial DNA remained in the PGCs at high levels, whereas normal worms successfully reduced the mutant DNA. Thus, the PGCs used parallel mechanisms to control both the quantity and quality of mitochondria passed to the next generation.</p><p>These results contribute to our understanding of how organisms safeguard their offspring from inheriting mutant mitochondrial DNA. In the future, Schwartz et al. hope that this knowledge will help us treat inherited mitochondrial diseases in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primordial germ cells</kwd><kwd>bottleneck</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>PINK1</kwd><kwd>purifying selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C32560GG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Aaron ZA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HD102161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Aaron ZA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nance</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM123260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Maulik R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR170792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Maulik R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> utilize multiple strategies to optimize germline mitochondrial genome integrity at the foundational stage of gonad development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria contain multiple copies of a small genome called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which includes several genes essential for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to nuclear DNA, mtDNA has a high mutation rate and is repaired inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). The mtDNAs with deleterious mutations are found together with complementing wild-type mtDNAs in a state called heteroplasmy. Deleterious mtDNA mutations can lead to mitochondrial disease if present at sufficiently high heteroplasmy – a condition that is estimated to affect ~1 in 5000 individuals and has no known cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial DNA replicates independently from nuclear DNA and has a distinct mode of inheritance. During cell division in most cell types, each daughter inherits a stochastic subset of mitochondria and their mtDNAs. However, embryos inherit their mtDNAs exclusively from the pool present within the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palozzi et al., 2018</xref>). The strict maternal inheritance and high mutation rate of mtDNA raise a potential problem: mtDNA mutations could accumulate over generations, leading to mutational meltdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Muller, 1964</xref>). However, relatively few deleterious mutations are transmitted over generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nachman, 1998</xref>), indicating that mtDNA mutations are selected against within the germ line.</p><p>Two mechanisms have been proposed to regulate germline mtDNA inheritance. In one mechanism – the mitochondrial bottleneck – mtDNAs are reduced in number within the germline lineage to create a small founding population, which is passed on to the next generation. In theory, genetic bottlenecks allow for the stochastic enrichment or depletion of variant mtDNAs in germ cells, potentially enabling selection against detrimental mtDNA mutations in subsequent generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palozzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hauswirth and Laipis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olivo et al., 1983</xref>). In vertebrates, a bottleneck occurs in embryonic primordial germ cells (PGCs) due to the dilution of maternally provided mtDNAs by reductive embryonic cell divisions, or via the replication of a subset of mtDNA genomes in PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cree et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenuth et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wai et al., 2008</xref>). It is not known whether germline mtDNA bottlenecks could form through other means.</p><p>Alternatively, mitochondria containing high levels of mutant mtDNAs can be eliminated directly from germ cells – a process called purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palozzi et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanistic basis for germline purifying selection has been studied most intensively in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, where mtDNA mutations are eliminated both by autophagy and selective mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Although there is genetic evidence for purifying selection in many species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floros et al., 2018</xref>), it is unknown whether it occurs through the mechanisms identified in flies or if alternative mechanisms for purging mutant germline mtDNAs exist.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PGCs eliminate mitochondria through intercellular cannibalism</title><p>To identify additional mechanisms of germline mtDNA control, we investigated how mtDNA quantity and quality are regulated in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> PGCs. The entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line descends from two PGCs, which are born early in embryogenesis and remain quiescent until early larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukuyama et al., 2006</xref>). Although embryonic PGCs do not divide, they undergo a non-mitotic cellular remodeling process, discarding much of their cell mass and content. Remodeling occurs when PGCs form organelle-filled lobe-like protrusions, which adjacent endodermal cells cannibalize and digest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). Previously, we showed that PGCs lose much of their mitochondrial mass in the process of lobe cannibalism, suggesting that one role of this remodeling event could be to eliminate PGC mitochondria in bulk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdu et al., 2016</xref>). As such, lobe cannibalism might provide a novel mechanism for PGCs to adjust their mtDNA quantity and/or quality at the initial stages of germline development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Primordial germ cell (PGC) lobe mitochondria and mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) are cannibalized and digested.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of PGC lobe formation and cannibalism.

The volume of each embryonic PGC in vivo (275 ± 7.2 µm<sup>3</sup>) is 1.2% of the volume of whole embryos (23,949 ± 175 µm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that embryonic PGCs inherit their mtDNAs from the pool present at fertilization through reductive embryonic cell divisions. By contrast, late embryonic PGCs, which lacked lobes, contained only 272 ± 8.1 mtDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Sorted L1 larval PGCs contained even fewer mtDNAs (220 ± 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that PGC lobe cannibalism could eliminate a third of the mtDNA molecules that each PGC inherits at its birth, and that an additional mechanism further reduces mtDNA numbers between late embryogenesis and the L1 larval stage. Thus, each PGC in the larval germ line contains roughly half the number that they inherit during embryogenesis.</p><p>To directly test whether lobe cannibalism contributes to the loss of mtDNAs in PGCs, we examined PGC mtDNA number in <italic>nop-1</italic> mutants, in which most PGCs fail to form lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maniscalco et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>nop-1</italic> mutant L1 PGCs retained a significantly higher proportion of embryonic PGC mtDNAs compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). This finding implicates lobe cannibalism in the reduction in mtDNA that occurs as PGCs transition from embryogenesis to the L1 stage.</p><p>Autophagy is an additional mechanism by which cells can remove cellular components and organelles, including mitochondria. During autophagy, an autophagosome membrane encapsulates organelles and cytoplasm, subsequently fusing with a lysosome to degrade its contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dikic and Elazar, 2018</xref>). To test if autophagy could be the source of lobe-independent mtDNA reduction in PGCs, we used the pH-discriminating Mito-mCh<sup>PGC</sup> and Mito-Dendra<sup>PGC</sup> reporters to observe whether any PGC mitochondria become acidified before lobe cannibalism occurs. We observed one or more large, distinct foci of acidified mitochondria [mCherry(+) Dendra(-)] within many PGCs prior to lobe cannibalism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), and foci were absent in autophagy-defective <italic>atg-18/WD repeat domain phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2)</italic> mutants (see Figure 5F–G; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palmisano and Meléndez, 2019</xref>), suggesting that autophagy may be responsible for lobe-independent degradation of mtDNA in PGCs.</p><p>To directly test whether autophagy and lobe cannibalism fully account for mtDNA reduction in PGCs, we sorted embryonic and L1 PGCs from <italic>nop-1; atg-18</italic> double mutants, which are deficient in both lobe cannibalism and autophagy. Notably, mtDNA reduction was entirely prevented in <italic>nop-1; atg-18</italic> L1 PGCs, which inherited a larger proportion of embryonic PGC mtDNAs than <italic>nop-1</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that late embryonic PGCs contain slightly more mtDNAs than L1 PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together, these results (and data below; see Figure 5A–B) suggest that lobe cannibalism and autophagy are both required for complete mtDNA copy number reduction in PGCs, and indicate that if any mtDNA replication occurs in late embryonic or L1 PGCs, it is insufficient to outpace autophagy-mediated mitochondrial destruction at this stage.</p><p>Lobe cannibalism and autophagy could reduce the number of mtDNAs to a fixed number, or alternatively, eliminate a fixed proportion of the mtDNAs present within PGCs regardless of how many are present. To distinguish between these possibilities, we took advantage of the fact that changing TFAM activity can alter mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larsson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumitani et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we found that whole embryos from the <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic> knock-in strain contained significantly fewer mtDNAs (8450 ± 768) than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), indicating that the GFP tag partially interferes with TFAM function. Using the <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic> strain, we asked how many mtDNAs PGCs eliminate if they are born with a reduced number. The <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic> embryonic PGCs contained 89 ± 3 mtDNAs and <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic> L1 PGCs contained 54 ± 2 mtDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, despite the presence of markedly fewer mtDNAs in the <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic> strain, L1 PGCs still inherit a comparable percentage of the mtDNAs contained within embryonic PGCs (wild-type: 55% and <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic>: 60%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Conversely, when embryonic PGCs contained ~25% excess mtDNAs (in the <italic>mptDf2</italic> mtDNA mutant strain), we still observed a twofold reduction in mtDNAs by the L1 stage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). Together, these data indicate that lobe cannibalism and autophagy do not subtract the number of PGC mtDNAs to a defined number, but rather divide the population of PGC mtDNAs present by a fixed proportion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lobe cannibalism and autophagy generate an mtDNA low point and set point in germline stem cells</title><p>Our results so far suggest that lobe cannibalism and autophagy could contribute to a germline mtDNA bottleneck by halving the number of PGC mtDNAs. However, if the initial cycles of larval germline proliferation proceed in the absence of bulk mtDNA replication, the number of mtDNAs per germ cell would continue to drop and an mtDNA low point (per cell) would occur at a later stage of germline development. When L1 larvae first encounter food, PGCs exit from quiescence and begin to proliferate, forming a population of undifferentiated germline stem cells (GSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubbard and Schedl, 2019</xref>). It is not known whether germline mtDNA replication has begun at this stage. Previous quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments on whole worms first revealed a significant expansion of germline mtDNAs after the L3 larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bratic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsang and Lemire, 2002a</xref>). However, these experiments might have lacked the resolution to detect an increase in mtDNAs were it to occur within the relatively small number of GSCs present in whole L1 larvae.</p><p>To determine if mtDNAs replicate as L1 PGCs exit quiescence and divide to produce GSCs, we quantified TFAM foci as PGCs in fed L1s began to proliferate as GSCs. To circumvent the mtDNA replication defects that we noted in <italic>TFAM-GFP</italic> worms, we utilized split GFP, a form of bimolecular fluorescence complementation that brings together the GFP<sub>1-10</sub> and GFP<sub>11</sub> fragments of GFP, which are non-fluorescent until reunited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabantous et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamiyama et al., 2016</xref>); this approach allowed us to tag <italic>TFAM</italic> (<italic>hmg-5</italic>) endogenously with the much smaller <italic>GFP<sub>11</sub></italic> tag. To visualize TFAM-GFP<sub>11</sub>, we expressed a mitochondrial matrix-targeted, PGC-specific, GFP<sub>1-10</sub> [Mito-GFP<sub>1-10</sub><sup>(PGC)</sup>]. The GFP<sub>1-10</sub> alone was minimally fluorescent, but upon binding to GFP<sub>11</sub> formed a functional fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Within PGCs, TFAM-GFP<sub>11</sub> detected with Mito-GFP<sub>1-10</sub><sup>(PGC)</sup> showed an identical localization pattern to TFAM-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), and did not cause significant defects in mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The cannibalism of PGC lobes, combined with non-selective general autophagy, generates a germ cell mtDNA low point and set point, whereas PINK-1 selectively reduces mutant mtDNA heteroplasmy. We propose that this combined regulation optimizes the founding population of mitochondria before the germ line expands and differentiates in larvae.</p><p>What is the purpose of reducing the number of mtDNAs in PGCs? We postulate that embryonic PGCs inherit excess maternal mtDNAs, as they are born from relatively few embryonic cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>), and together lobe cannibalism and autophagy halve PGC mtDNA copy number to establish a level that is maintained in GSCs as bulk mtDNA replication ensues. Having ~200 mtDNAs per PGC appears to be important, as even when L1 PGCs inherit an excess of mtDNAs in <italic>nop-1</italic> mutants, mtDNA copy number quickly resets to ~200 shortly after PGCs differentiate into proliferating GSCs. These findings indicate that GSCs balance mtDNA replication with cell division to reach an mtDNA set point of ~200 that is actively maintained. It is possible that this number of mtDNAs is optimal for balancing mitochondrial function with germ cell size and physiology. Whether attaining ~200 mtDNA per PGC functions as a genetic bottleneck remains unknown. However, it is worth noting that several studies have detected a comparable number of mtDNAs in early mouse and zebrafish PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenuth et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wai et al., 2008</xref>), and that this stage has been proposed as an mtDNA genetic bottleneck in mammals based on simulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cree et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Whereas PGC lobe cannibalism and autophagy produce a stochastic reduction in mtDNA number, we found that PINK-1 specifically reduces the fraction of mutant mtDNAs in PGCs. While the effect of PINK-1-mediated selection against <italic>uaDf5</italic> is modest, even small decreases in heteroplasmy could have important evolutionary consequences. For example, individual selection events against de novo mtDNA mutations could eliminate them from the germ line permanently. In other systems, PINK-1 can eliminate poorly functioning mitochondria by recruiting Parkin and inducing mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palikaras et al., 2018</xref>). However, we find no role for Parkin or autophagy in PGC mtDNA purifying selection, although autophagy is partially required for reducing PGC mtDNA number. It is possible that autophagy serves a separate quality control function in PGCs, perhaps by removing mitochondria with high levels of oxidative stress, as previous work suggests that PGC mitochondria are highly oxidized compared to those in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Alternative mechanisms of PINK1-mediated mitochondrial elimination have been described in cultured mammalian cells, such as direct targeting of endolysosomes, formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles, and extracellular secretory release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammerling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLelland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2022</xref>).

It is worth noting that <italic>uaDf5</italic> heteroplasmy in embryonic PGCs is higher in <italic>pink-1</italic>, <italic>pdr-1</italic>, and autophagy mutants, suggesting that these pathways have roles in purifying selection during other stages of germ line development, as they do in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bess et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kandul et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Purifying selection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> PGCs differs from mechanisms described in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, where mutant mtDNAs are eliminated through mitochondrial fission followed by BNIP3L-mediated autophagy, and mutant mtDNA replication is selectively inhibited by PINK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of mtDNA replication occur in <italic>C. elegans</italic> PGCs, though we do not observe robust mtDNA expansion until PGCs differentiate into GSCs in fed L1 larvae. This finding is also supported by our observation that <italic>uaDf5</italic> heteroplasmy decreases in PGCs, whereas <italic>uaDf5</italic> is known to selfishly expand through preferential mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2022</xref>).

It will be interesting to determine if these different means of achieving purifying selection are stage-specific (ovary versus PGC), or reveal that multiple mechanisms can be used toward the common goal of eliminating mutant mtDNA genomes from the germ line.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>C. elegans</italic> wild isolate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>atg-18(gk378</italic>) V</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VC893</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>atg-13(bp414</italic>) III</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HZ1688</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>pdr-1(gk448</italic>) III</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VC1024</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>xnSi1 [mex-5p::GFP-PH::nos-2 3’UTR, unc-119(+)]</italic> II<italic>;

Sample size, <italic>t</italic>-test type, and p-value ranges are reported in figure legends. Where applicable, no corrections for multiple comparisons were made to avoid type II errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong, 2014</xref>). For live imaging, embryos and larvae were selected based on orientation on the slide and on health. For all datasets, at least three biologically independent experiments were performed and the arithmetic means of biological replicates were used for statistical analysis. Combined source data for all ddPCR experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplemental sequences.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80396-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Combined ddPCR source data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80396-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80396-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

polymerase). It is widely appreciated that there are quality control mechanisms such that functional mitochondria are passed from one generation to the next. This manuscript presents important progress in the field, describing how the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline may remove mitochondria by creating bottlenecks as well as selectively removing non-functional mitochondria. Building upon the authors' previous finding that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> primordial germ cells (PGCs) shed much of their cytoplasm during embryogenesis through 'cannibalism', they now describe that a bulk of mitochondria are removed from PGCs through this process. Although some of the phenotypes described in the manuscript are relatively mild, the evidence is compelling, supporting their conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80396.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04vqm6w82</institution-id><institution>Whitehead Institute/MIT</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04vqm6w82</institution-id><institution>Whitehead Institute/MIT</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.06.490954">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.06.490954v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

As proposed, we attempted to do this by EdU labeling newly hatched L1 larvae. As a positive control to see if we could detect replicated mtDNAs in germ cells, we incubated L1 larvae with EdU and fed for 6 hours, which our experiments imaging TFAM-GFP<sub>11</sub> showed is a sufficient time for mtDNA number to significantly increase in the germ line due to replication. While a few replicating nuclei within fed larva were labeled with EdU, we saw no convincing EdU signal outside of nuclei (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Because of these disappointing results, and the significant time investment potentially involved in increasing the sensitivity of this approach to detect mtDNA replication in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for the first time, we addressed PGC mtDNA replication in other quantitative ways.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80396-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We performed two additional experiments on FACs-sorted PGCs to quantify mtDNAs and look for evidence of mtDNA replication. First, we sorted and analyzed PGCs from late embryos, which were six hours older than the pre-cannibalism population of embryonic PGCs we analyzed previously. Since these PGCs have just recently completed lobe cannibalism, but are significantly younger than those we purified from L1 larvae, ongoing mtDNA replication should result in lower levels of mtDNA in late embryo PGCs compared to L1 PGCs. Interestingly, we found that while late embryo PGC mtDNAs were reduced relative to our previously analyzed pre-cannibalism embryo PGCs as expected, mtDNA levels per PGC were slightly but significantly <italic>higher</italic> than in L1 PGCs, even though lobe cannibalism was fully completed at this stage as assessed by analysis of the volume of sorted cells (data added to Figure 2B as “late emb”; FACS gating strategy and cell volume data included in Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2). Because we showed previously that autophagy operates in PGCs and is responsible for eliminating some mtDNAs, we suspect that the lower number of mtDNAs in L1 PGCs versus late embryonic PGCs is the result of ongoing bulk autophagy (see Figure 5). This new experiment suggests either that mtDNA replication does not occur in embryonic PGCs, or that it is minimal in its extent and more than offset by concurrent autophagy.To directly test this, in a second experiment, we sorted embryonic and L1 PGCs in <italic>nop-1; atg-18</italic> double mutants. Because these mutants lack both lobe cannibalism and autophagy, the number of mtDNAs in L1 PGCs should be the same as in embryonic PGCs unless it is increased by mtDNA replication. We found that the number of mtDNAs in <italic>nop-1; atg-18</italic> L1 PGCs was not statistically higher than that in <italic>nop-1; atg-18</italic> embryonic PGCs, but these mutants inherited a significantly higher proportion of embryonic PGC mtDNAs than <italic>nop-1</italic> single mutants (data added to Figure 2E,G), suggesting that autophagy and lobe cannibalism are both required for the complete reduction of mtDNA in PGCs. Together with our existing data, these two additional experiments support the conclusion that robust mtDNA replication does not occur in PGCs until L1 larvae begin to feed; if mtDNA replication does occur in PGCs prior to this stage, it is very minimal and below our ability to detect by ddPCR.</p><p>Because neither of these experiments completely rules out the possibility of selective replication of a small subset of mtDNAs in embryonic PGCs, we altered the language in the text to leave this possibility open. Specifically, rather than refer to the initiation of <italic>“mtDNA replication”</italic> occurring during the PGC-to-GSC transition, we now refer to this as the initiation of <italic>“mtDNA expansion”</italic> as this is the first point in development that we see total germline mtDNA numbers increase after lobe cannibalism and autophagy reduces them (see for example pg. 10, lines 251-254). Also, based on these new findings, we felt that introducing autophagy earlier in the paper – in this section rather than waiting until the section on purifying selection – would be more logical. These textual rearrangements are reflected in the version of the manuscript with changes tracked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be informative to show the L1/2 stage data for the nop1 mutant in Figure 3j and l.

We sorted <italic>nop-1</italic> mutant germ cells at the mid-L1 stage to see if germline mtDNA numbers had already begun to normalize back to ~200 per GSC. Mid-L1 <italic>nop-1</italic> mutants contained on average four GSCs. We found that even at this early timepoint, the number of mtDNAs had already reset to ~200, indicating that the adjustment occurs within one cell cycle (data added to Figure 3K,L as “mid-L1”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– line 177: 'gfp(11)' it took a while for me to realize this is a part of GFP used for BiFC – just because I couldn't tell what '(11)' was referring to (I even thought (11) was referring to reference…).

Although the consistent reduction in <italic>uaDf5</italic> heteroplasmy we observe in PGCs is modest within one generation, the effect over several generations could be substantial (see Discussion; pg.14 lines 342-345). Unfortunately, this is difficult to test, as <italic>uaDf5</italic> also has a selfish replication advantage (Yang et al., 2022, NCB 24: 181-193), which overcomes <italic>pink-1</italic>-mediated purifying selection in the PGCs and adult germ line since the mutant is inherited at a stable heteroplasmy over many generations (Tsang and Lemire, 2002; Biochem Cell Biol. 80: 645-654). Because of the precedent in the literature, we have opted to keep the term ‘purifying selection’ in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have the following recommendations:</p><p>1.

This limits the spatial resolution of TFAM-GFP live, and could be the cause of diffuse TFAM signal. In order to get a relative measure of TFAM-GFP signal, we defined ‘foci’ as local signal maxima that colocalized with mito-mCherry signal using the ImageJ 3D maxima plugin.
