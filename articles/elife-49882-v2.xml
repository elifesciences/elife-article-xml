pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49882.001</object-id><p>Recent studies have identified a genetic variant rs641738 near two genes encoding membrane bound <italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (<italic>MBOAT7</italic>) and transmembrane channel-like 4 (<italic>TMC4</italic>) that associate with increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol-related cirrhosis, and liver fibrosis in those infected with viral hepatitis (Buch et al., 2015; Mancina et al., 2016; Luukkonen et al., 2016; Thabet et al., 2016; Viitasalo et al., 2016; Krawczyk et al., 2017; Thabet et al., 2017). Based on hepatic expression quantitative trait loci analysis, it has been suggested that <italic>MBOAT7</italic> loss of function promotes liver disease progression (Buch et al., 2015; Mancina et al., 2016; Luukkonen et al., 2016; Thabet et al., 2016; Viitasalo et al., 2016; Krawczyk et al., 2017; Thabet et al., 2017), but this has never been formally tested. Here we show that <italic>Mboat7</italic> loss, but not <italic>Tmc4</italic>, in mice is sufficient to promote the progression of NAFLD in the setting of high fat diet. <italic>Mboat7</italic> loss of function is associated with accumulation of its substrate lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) lipids, and direct administration of LPI promotes hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic transcriptional changes in an <italic>Mboat7</italic>-dependent manner. These studies reveal a novel role for MBOAT7-driven acylation of LPI lipids in suppressing the progression of NAFLD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49882.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD for short, is a medical condition that develops when the liver accumulates excess fat. It can lead to complications such as diabetes and liver scarring. In humans, mutations that inactivate a protein called MBOAT7 increase the risk of fat accumulating in the liver.</p><p>Genetic studies suggest that low levels of MBOAT7 in a human’s liver cells increase the severity of NAFLD. Yet the links between MBOAT7, NAFLD and obesity are not well understood. Helsley et al. used data from humans and from obese mice that had been fed a high-fat diet to investigate the relationship between NAFLD and MBOAT7. This revealed that people who are obese have lower levels of MBOAT7 in their livers. Next, obese mice were genetically manipulated to produce less MBOAT7, which led them to develop more severe NAFLD.</p><p>Helsley et al. then grew human liver cells in the laboratory and lowered their levels of MBOAT7, which led to excess fat accumulating in the cells. This increase in fat accumulation was, at least in part, due to how these cells metabolize fats when MBOAT7 is reduced: they start making more new fats and consume fewer lipids to produce energy.</p><p>These findings provide a link between obesity and liver damage in both humans and mice, and show how a decrease in MBOAT7 levels causes changes in fat metabolism that could lead to NAFLD. The results could drive new approaches to treating liver damage in patients with mutations in the gene that codes for MBOAT7.</p></abstract><kwd-group

increasingly common condition that affects roughly one-third of adults in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machado and

The expansion of adipose tissue in obese individuals is strongly associated with the development of NAFLD, yet mechanisms linking obesity to NAFLD and more advanced forms of liver disease such as NASH and cirrhosis are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machado and Diehl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rinella and Sanyal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wree et al., 2013</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful unbiased tool to identify new genes and pathways that are involved in human disease, allowing for pinpoint accuracy in identification of new drug targets. This is exemplified by the recent success story of human genetic studies leading to rapid development of monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) for hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hess et al., 2018</xref>). Within the last two years, several independent GWAS studies have identified a liver disease susceptibility locus (rs641738) within a linkage-disequilibrium block that contains genes encoding <italic>MBOAT7</italic> and <italic>TMC4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luukkonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Liver Disease Genetics Consortium et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Viitasalo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krawczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thabet et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, the rs641738 variant is associated with all major forms of liver injury including NAFLD, alcoholic-liver disease (ALD), and viral hepatitis-induced fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luukkonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Liver Disease Genetics Consortium et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Viitasalo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krawczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thabet et al., 2017</xref>). The rs641738 variant is associated with a C &gt; T missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the first exon the <italic>TMC4</italic> gene, yet available data suggest that <italic>TMC4</italic> is not abundantly expressed in human liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>). Based on eQTL studies in the liver it has been suggested that instead reduced expression and activity of <italic>MBOAT7</italic> may be mechanistically linked to liver disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luukkonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Liver Disease Genetics Consortium et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Viitasalo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krawczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thabet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>MBOAT7</italic> gene encodes an acyltransferase enzyme that specifically esterifies arachidonyl-CoA to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) to generate the predominant molecular species of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in cell membranes (38:4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gijón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zarini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). Given this biochemical activity, MBOAT7 is a unique contributor to the Lands’ cycle, which is a series of phospholipase-driven deacylation and lysophospholipid acyltransferase-driven reacylation reactions that synergize to alter phospholipid fatty acid composition, creating membrane asymmetry and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shindou and Shimizu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shindou et al., 2009</xref>). It is important to note that MBOAT7, unlike other lysophospholipid acyltransferases, only diversifies the fatty acid composition of membrane PI species and not phospholipids with other head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gijón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zarini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). Despite recent progress in characterizing the selective biochemistry of MBOAT7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gijón et al., 2008</xref>), and the clear genetic links to liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luukkonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Liver Disease Genetics Consortium et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Viitasalo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krawczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thabet et al., 2017</xref>), there is no information regarding how MBOAT7 activity or its substrate (LPI) or product (PI) lipids impact liver disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that MBOAT7 expression is suppressed in obese humans and rodents. Furthermore, we show that <italic>Mboat7</italic>, but not <italic>Tmc4</italic>, loss of function in mice is sufficient to drive NAFLD progression, and show that <italic>Mboat7</italic> substrate lipids (LPIs) may be critical mediators of obesity-linked liver disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression is suppressed in obese humans and rodents</title><p>NAFLD progression is commonly associated with obesity, and it has even been suggested that obesity is a causative factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Younossi et al., 2018</xref>). Although, there is now strong support that the common <italic>MBOAT7</italic> SNP (rs641738) is associated with NAFLD, it is not known whether <italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression is significantly altered in obese people. To investigate this, we obtained wedge liver biopsies from sequentially consenting obese bariatric surgery patients and normal weight controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schugar et al., 2017</xref>), and examined the expression levels of <italic>MBOAT7</italic> mRNA. We found that hepatic <italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression was dramatically reduced in obese people, when compared to normal weight controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is important to note that this striking reduction in <italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression was not due to presence of the rs641738 <italic>MBOAT7</italic> SNP, as we found the minor allele frequency was quite similar in lean, obese, and severely obese subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To follow up on our findings in human obesity, we also examined hepatic expression levels of <italic>Mboat7</italic> in obese leptin-deficient mice and high fat diet-fed rats. <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression was reduced in ob/ob mice compared to lean WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In agreement, we found that high fat diet-induced obesity in Sprague-Dawley rats was also associated with significant reductions in hepatic <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To induce obesity, all HMDP mouse strains were fed an obesity-promoting high fat and high sucrose diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parks et al., 2013</xref>).

Collectively, these data suggest that MBOAT7 may be mechanistically linked to the well-known association between obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Mboat7</italic> loss of function in mice is sufficient to promote NAFLD progression</title><p>To test whether MBOAT7 impacts obesity-linked NAFLD progression we utilized an in vivo knockdown approach in high fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice. Metabolic phenotyping of global <italic>Mboat7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice has been limited due to the fact that these mice are only viable for several weeks after birth due to the critical role <italic>Mboat7</italic> plays in cortical lamination and neuronal migration in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). To overcome this barrier, we have generated second-generation antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which predominately target liver, adipose tissue, and cells within the reticuloendothelial system to selectively knock down <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression in adult mice using methods we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schugar et al., 2017</xref>). This ASO approach allows us to circumvent the postnatal lethality of global <italic>Mboat7</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>), and permits investigation into obesity-linked liver disease progression with near complete loss of function of <italic>Mboat7</italic> in the liver. <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO treatment resulted in significant reductions of <italic>Mboat7</italic> mRNA and protein in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), without altering <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression in the brain, spleen, heart, or skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In support of this concept, direct injection of exogenous 18 carbon LPIs can rapidly (24 hr) increase the expression of genes characteristic of hepatic inflammation (<italic>Cd11c, Tnfa, IL1b</italic>) and early fibrosis (<italic>Desmin, Col1A1, Col1A2</italic>, and <italic>Acta2</italic>) in mice with <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that 18 carbon LPI lipids can acutely induce hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression programs, but only when MBOAT7 function is compromised, as is seen in obesity or with loss of function variants like rs641738. It is important to note that 18 carbon LPI lipids can only significantly elicit such pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in high fat fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), as we did not see this same effect in chow fed cohorts (not shown). Although direct administration of 18 carbon LPI lipids in chow fed mice did not significantly alter the same pro-inflammatory or pro-fibrotic genes as we found with <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we did find that a small subset of acute phase response genes (serum amyloid A genes, <italic>Saa1</italic> and <italic>Saa2</italic>) and other immunomodulatory genes (Gdf15, Ly6d, Lcn2, Socs2, etc.) were altered by 18:0 LPI treatment in a <italic>Mboat7</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, when liver triacylglycerol levels were examined in this LPI injection experiment, we only found significantly elevation in the saline and 18:1 LPI injection groups, but not in the 16:0 LPI injection group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that 18 carbon LPI lipids can alter hepatic inflammatory transcriptional programs, but this is highly reliant on both diminished <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression/activity and high fat diet feeding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49882.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) lipids stimulate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene expression in a <italic>Mboat7</italic>-dependent manner.</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with either a non-targeting control ASO or <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO while being fed a high fat diet for 11 weeks.

We therefore examined several potential mechanisms driving the mixed hepatic steatosis in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice. First, we examined the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol sensing and export under both fed and fasted conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Unlike many other models of hepatic steatosis, there were no significant alterations in lipogenic gene expression either in the fed or fasted state with <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Unexpectedly, the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (Cpt1) was significantly elevated with <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), but this would not be expected to promote the accumulation of neutral lipids. The expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (<italic>Hmgcr</italic> and <italic>Hmcgs1</italic>) were modestly reduced in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice, but only in the fasted state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In addition, expression of the cholesterol efflux regulator <italic>Abca1</italic> was elevated in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice, but only in the fasted state. Altogether, these minor differences in hepatic gene expression are unlikely to be driving the lipid accumulation in Mboat7 ASO treated mice. Next, we evaluated whether <italic>Mboat7</italic> may influence the export of neutral lipids via packaging on nascent very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). However, <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice did not have significant differences in VLDL-TG secretion during a detergent block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Furthermore, steady state plasma levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol were not significantly altered in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice other than a minor reduction in cholesterol content in both low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) only in chow-fed cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Another common cause of fatty liver is increased delivery of adipose-derived fatty acids to the liver, as is commonly seen with prolonged fasting and certain types of lipodystrophies. However, <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown did not alter basal or catecholamine-stimulated adipocyte lipolysis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), ruling out a role for altered adipose lipolysis as a contributing factor. Finally, we examined the possibility that MBOAT7 may be a determinate of metabolism locally at the surface of cytosolic lipid droplets to regulate hepatic steatosis, given that one recent study reported that MBOAT7 can localize to cytosolic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed that MBOAT7 can indeed be found in lipid droplets isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), and plays a regulatory role in both the lipidome and proteome of cytosolic lipid droplets. Cytosolic lipid droplets isolated from <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice showed marked accumulation of 18:0 LPI and 20:4 LPI, but not 16:0 LPI or 18:1 LPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). This is in stark contrast to what is seen in the whole liver, where <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown instead promotes accumulation of 16:0 LPI and 18:1 LPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Also, lipid droplets isolated from <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice have a reduced level of 38:4 PI but a reciprocal increase in 36:3 and 38:3 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), which is quite different when to compared to effects in whole liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition to alterations in the lipid droplet lipidome, <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown is associated with accumulation of several proteins involved in lipid synthesis and storage on isolated lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Both perilipin 2 and 3 (PLIN2 and PLIN3) were much more abundant on lipid droplets isolated from <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice, as were the critical lipid synthetic enzymes CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) and glycerol-3-phosphate 4 (GPAT4). Given that recent reports have shown that lipid droplet targeting of CCTα and GPAT4 are critical regulators of the overall size and triglyceride storage capacity of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>), these proteomic alterations at the lipid droplet surface may to contribute to the hepatic steatosis seen in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice. In order to understand cell autonomous effects of MBOAT7 lipid metabolism we generated MBOAT7-deficient cells via CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. Huh7 lacking MBOAT7 have increased lipid droplets upon fatty acid loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). This lipid accumulation was due in part to increases in de novo lipogenesis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), and reciprocal decreases in fatty acid oxidation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). However, MBOAT-deficient Huh7 cells did not have altered turnover of stored triacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>) or cholesterol ester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49882.026</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Mboat7 knockdown promotes hepatic steatosis by altering the lipidome and proteome of the cytosolic lipid droplets.</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either chow or a HFD for 12–20 weeks along with receiving a control non-targeting ASO or an ASO targeting the knockdown of <italic>Mboat7</italic>.

Instead, selective loss of function of the neighboring gene <italic>Mboat7</italic> is sufficient to sensitize mice to high fat diet-driven liver disease progression. The major findings of the current study include the following: (1) Genetic deletion of <italic>Tmc4</italic> does not alter hepatic lipid storage, (2) Hepatic expression of <italic>MBOAT7</italic> is reduced in obese humans and rodents, independent of rs641738 status, (3) <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression in mouse liver and adipose tissue is negatively correlated with obesity and insulin sensitivity across the strains represented in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, (4) <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown promotes hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte death, inflammation, and early gene expression profiles consistent with fibrosis, but this only happens when mice are challenged with a high fat diet, (5) <italic>Mboat7</italic> loss of function promotes striking hyperinsulinemia and hepatic insulin resistance, (6) <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown results in tissue-specific reorganization of its substrates (LPI) and product (PI) lipids, (7) LPI lipids can rapidly induce hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression programs in an <italic>Mboat7</italic>-dependent manner in mice, and (8) the hepatic steatosis seen with <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown is not related to differences in lipogenic gene expression, VLDL secretion, or tissue lipolysis, but instead may be related to alterations in hepatic lipid droplet accumulation of lipogenic enzymes (CCTα and GPAT4) that allow for expansion of large lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>), and increased rates of de novo lipogenesis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Collectively, these data support a role for <italic>Mboat7</italic>-driven acylation of LPI lipids as a key protective mechanism against obesity-linked NAFLD progression.</p><p>The MBOAT family of enzymes are critical players in determining the composition of fatty acids in cellular membranes, and are emerging as key players in cardiometabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harayama et al., 2014</xref>). It is important to note that several other lysophospholipid acyltransferase enzymes have been linked to inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harayama et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases (LPCAT1, LPCAT2, and LPCAT3) are known to regulate tissue inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress by altering arachidonic acid availability as well as determining membrane phosphatidylcholine saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harayama et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, the lysophospholipid acyltransferase family sits at a critical signaling nexus, given that they can play key roles in the generation of arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators as well as regulating the levels of lysophospholipid signaling lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shindou and Shimizu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shindou et al., 2009</xref>). Given the fact that MBOAT7 preferentially generates PUFA-enriched PIs it also has the unique potential to also impact phosphorylated PI species (PtdInsP, PtdInsP2, and PtdInsP3, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with our findings with PI lipids (<bold>Fil</bold>) in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice, global genetic deletion of <italic>Mboat7</italic> selectively lowers the 38:4 molecular species of PIPs, while increasing more saturated species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we cannot rule out that alterations in PIP-dependent signal transduction may also play a role in MBOAT7 loss of function-driven liver disease progression.</p><p>Unexpectedly, <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown did not significantly alter hepatic lipid storage or inflammation in chow-fed mice. Instead there is a clear unmasking of <italic>Mboat7</italic>-dependent fatty liver phenotypes only when mice are fed with a high fat diet. This could potentially indicate that unknown dietary factors play a regulatory role and limit hepatic LPIAT activity via unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Our data also support the idea that when mice, rats, and humans become obese <italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression is reduced to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), indicating regulation either at the transcriptional of post-transcriptional level. Future work should focus on understanding how dietary factors and adiposity itself impacts <italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression and activity, and under what dietary and BMI conditions are <italic>MBOAT7</italic> polymorphisms predicted to be most deleterious. In humans, the rs641738 variant has been clearly linked to end stage fibrotic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mancina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luukkonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Liver Disease Genetics Consortium et al., 2016</xref>). However, an important limitation of our studies is that high fat diet feeding in mice is not sufficient to drive bridging fibrosis. In future studies, it will be important to examine how <italic>Mboat7</italic> loss of function impacts the development of fibrosis in appropriate fibrosis-prone animal models, and whether <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression in hepatic stellate cells plays a regulatory role in the progression from NASH to cirrhosis. From this study it is clear that MBOAT7 can diversify the inositol-containing phospholipids and the associated proteome on cytosolic lipid droplets, and this could in part explain the large lipid droplets that accumulate in <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO-treated mice. It is interesting to note that the well-known PNPLA3 variant associated with fatty liver disease (I148M) accumulates on lipid droplets, and similarly reorganizes the lipidome and proteome to promote liver disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BasuRay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitsche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BasuRay et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings here with MBOAT7-driven restructuring of the lipid droplet surface, and those recently published with PNPLA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BasuRay et al., 2019</xref>), suggest that alterations in lipid modifying enzyme access to the surface of cytosolic lipid droplets may be a common mechanism by which human fatty liver develops. Furthermore, we show that genetic deletion of <italic>MBOAT7</italic> in Huh7 hepatoma cells can promote cell autonomous increases in cytosolic lipid droplets, and this enhanced lipid storage is associated with augmented lipogenesis rates and reduced fatty acid oxidation rates. Our studies provide new clues into new therapeutic leads for advanced liver diseases.</p><p>Another particularly striking finding from the current study is that <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown promotes severe hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Based on our results examining both insulin and C-peptide release during a glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that <italic>Mboat7</italic> knockdown is enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β cells. However, it is important to note that <italic>Mboat7</italic> ASO treatment did not alter <italic>Mboat7</italic> expression (data not shown) or LPI/PI lipids in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that ASO-mediated knockdown of <italic>Mboat7</italic> facilitates the production of an endocrine signaling lipid (possibly LPI) that may impact β cell GSIS. Interestingly, there are reports demonstrating that LPI lipids can stimulate β cell GSIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metz, 1988</xref>). It is interesting to note that expression of <italic>Mboat7</italic> in white adipose tissue is modestly negatively correlated with HOMA-IR in the hybrid mouse diversity panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), yet ASO-mediated knockdown of <italic>Mboat7</italic> did not alter insulin signaling in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data suggest that additional studies are needed to clarify a potential role for Mboat7 in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Collectively, our data suggest that under conditions where MBOAT7 activity is suppressed (obesity or with the rs641738 variant) inefficient acylation of LPI substrate allows for these lipids to accumulate and initiate autocrine, paracrine, and potentially endocrine signaling that impact the progression of NAFLD and insulin resistance. Therefore, further investigation into the receptor system(s) that sense LPI lipids could hold therapeutic promise in liver disease and other associated metabolic diseases. Collectively, these studies identify MBOAT7-driven acylation of LPI lipids as an important modulator of both liver disease progression and associated type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

expression levels in lean and obese subjects</title><p>The majority of subjects recruited to examine MBOAT7 expression levels were morbidly obese bariatric surgery patients, but we were able to obtain liver biopsies from 10 subjects with a BMI under 30 as normal weight controls. For recruitment, adult patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery at Wake Forest School of Medicine were consented via written consent and enrolled by a member of the study staff following institutionally approved IRB protocols as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shores et al., 2011</xref>). Exclusion criteria included: positive hepatitis C antibody, positive hepatitis B surface antigen, history of liver disease other than NAFLD, Childs A, B, or C cirrhosis, past or present diagnosis/treatment of malignancy other than non-melanocytic skin cancer, INR greater than 1.8 at baseline or need for chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin products, use of immunomodulation for or history of inflammatory diseases including but not limited to malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, and greater or equal to seven alcohol drinks per week or three alcoholic drinks in a given day each week. In addition to bariatric surgery patients, a small number of non-obese subjects (body mass index &lt;30.0) consented to liver biopsy during elective gall bladder removal surgery (n = 10). Each subject was assigned a unique identifier which was used throughout the study and did not include any identifiable information about the patient such as name, address, telephone number, social security number, medical record number or any of the identifiers outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations. Only the principal investigator had access to the code linking the unique identifier to the study subject. Basic clinical information was obtained via self-reporting and a 15 ml baseline blood sample was obtained at the time of enrollment. A subset of this cohort has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schugar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shores et al., 2011</xref>). At the time of surgery, the surgeon collected a roughly 1-gram sample from the lateral left lobe. Wedge biopsies were rinsed with saline and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen in the operating room before subsequent storage at −80°C. For data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> showing levels of MBOAT7 substrate and product lipids, de-identified patient samples from the Cleveland Clinic hepatology clinic (IRB # 10–947) were analyzed. These patients had biopsy proven Ishak fibrosis scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishak et al., 1995</xref>) of 0 (normal) or 4 (advanced fibrosis). For analysis of hepatic <italic>MBOAT7</italic> expression, RNA isolated from liver biopsies were used for quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Rat studies of diet-induced obesity</title><p>Sprague Dawley Rats were received at 12 weeks of age and were housed in individual cages, kept at a constant temperature and ambient humidity in a 12-h light/dark cycle.

id="fn1"><p>Human subjects: Human MBOAT7 Expression Levels in Lean and Obese Subjects The majority of subjects recruited to examine MBOAT7 expression levels were morbidly obese bariatric surgery patients, but we were able to obtain liver biopsies from 10 subjects with a BMI under 30 as normal weight controls. For recruitment, adult patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery at Wake Forest School of Medicine were consented via written consent and enrolled by a member of the study staff following institutionally approved IRB protocols as previously described41. Exclusion criteria included: positive hepatitis C antibody, positive hepatitis B surface antigen, history of liver disease other than NAFLD, Childs A, B, or C cirrhosis, past or present diagnosis/treatment of malignancy other than non-melanocytic skin cancer, INR greater than 1.8 at baseline or need for chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin products, use of immunomodulation for or history of inflammatory diseases including but not limited to malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, and greater or equal to 7 alcohol drinks per week or 3 alcoholic drinks in a given day each week. In addition to bariatric surgery patients, a small number of non-obese subjects (body mass index &lt;30.0) consented to liver biopsy during elective gall bladder removal surgery (n=10). Each subject was assigned a unique identifier which was used throughout the study and did not include any identifiable information about the patient such as name, address, telephone number, social security number, medical record number or any of the identifiers outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations. Only the principal investigator had access to the code linking the unique identifier to the study subject. Basic clinical information was obtained via self-reporting and a 15 ml baseline blood sample was obtained at the time of enrollment. A subset of this cohort has been previously described20,41. At the time of surgery, the surgeon collected a roughly 1-gram sample from the lateral left lobe. Wedge biopsies were rinsed with saline and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen in the operating room before subsequent storage at -80°C. For data shown in Figure 7 showing levels of MBOAT7 substrate and product lipids, de-identified patient samples from the Cleveland Clinic hepatology clinic (IRB # 10-947) were analyzed. These patients had biopsy proven Ishak fibrosis scores42 of 0 (normal) or 4 (advanced fibrosis). For analysis of hepatic MBOAT7 expression, RNA isolated from liver biopsies were used for quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) as described below.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2"><p>Animal experimentation: Rat Studies of Diet-Induced Obesity Sprague Dawley Rats were received at 12 weeks of age and were housed in individual cages, kept at a constant temperature and ambient humidity in a 12-hlight/dark cycle. Animals were then randomly assigned to either a standard chow diet or a high-fat diet (D12492, 60% fat, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) ad libitum to establish diet-induced obesity as previously described20. After 6 months of HFD-feeding, livers were excised for standard qPCR analysis of Mboat7 expression. Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel 92 inbred strains of 8-week-old male mice (180 individual mice) were fed a high fat, high sucrose diet (D12266B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) for 8 weeks before tissue collection44. Gene expression of Mboat7 in white adipose tissue and liver were measured and correlated with obesity related traits using biweight midcorrelation analysis as previously described4. Mouse Studies of Mboat7 Loss of Function To explore the role of Mboat7 in diet-induced obesity, NAFLD progression, and insulin resistance, we utilized an in vivo knockdown approach in 8-week old adult mice. Selective knockdown of Mboat7 was accomplished using 2'-O-ethyl (cET) modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). All ASOs used in this work were synthesized, screened, and purified as described previously45 by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Carlsbad, CA). For Mboat7 knockdown studies, adult (8 week old) male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME USA), and maintained on either a standard rodent chow diet or a high fat diet (HFD, D12492 from Research Diets Inc) and injected intraperitoneally biweekly with 12.5 mg/kg of either non-targeting control ASO or one of two independent ASOs directed against murine Mboat7 for a period of 20 weeks. Similar results were seen with two independent ASOs targeting different regions of the Mboat7 mRNA, hence key data using one Mboat7 ASO are shown. All rodents were maintained in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International-approved animal facility, and all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic (IACUC protocols # 2015-1519 and # 2018-2053).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6"

In this report, Helsley provide evidence that reduced Mboat7 activity drives the development of obesity-induced NAFLD in mouse models. They knocked down Mboat7 expression with an ASO in high-fat diet fed mice and found that Mboat7 deficient mice developed steatosis and inflammation in mouse liver, and insulin resistance. With respect to the mechanism involved, they showed that the levels of several LPIs and PIs were changed by Mboat7 knockdown. Finally, they showed that LPI treatment increased the expression of inflammatory genes in the livers of Mboat7-deficient mice, but not in control mice. Although the studies are of interest and obvious clinical relevance, the mechanistic insight into how Mboat7 affects hepatic lipid metabolism is limited at this stage.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Using more than one Mboat7 ASO would increase the strength of the conclusions.</p><p>2) What is the mechanism causing lipid accumulation in the livers of ASO-treated mice? Is the expression of Srebp1c and lipogenic genes increased? The authors showed cholesterol in plasma lipoprotein particles was not altered, how about the TG profile in plasma lipoprotein particles? Is there any defect in VLDL secretion?</p><p>3) The diet regimen employed does not typically lead to fibrosis in mice. The authors showed increased expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes, but to establish fibrosis they need to show Trichrome or Sirius staining. Similarly, they claim that stellate cells were activated, but need more direct data to support this.</p><p>4) The authors report that 16:0 and 18:1 LPI was increased upon Mboat7 suppression, but the levels of these two LPIs (~0.05 pmol/mg) are very low compared to 18:0 LPI (~5 pmol/mg). It is difficult to see how this change could be driving the phenotype. Is the total LPI level significantly increased? Is there any change in total PI levels? Why did the authors inject mice with 18:0 LPI, which was not altered by Mboat7 suppression, but not 16:0 or 18:1 LPI that was increased by Mboat7 knockdown? Do different LPI species have different effects?</p><p>5) For LPI treatment experiment, did the authors inject HFD fed mice or chow diet fed mice? Will an increase in LPI in chow diet fed mice induce a phenotype similar to HFD fed mice?</p><p>6) Does LPI treatment also affect other genes identified by RNA seq in figure 3?

In my view, it's a quite interesting paper but is fundamentally flawed, as the ASO targeting MBOAT7 in murine liver also reduces expression of TMC4, the other candidate gene. Given this, it's not possible to determine which effects are due to MBOAT7 depletion, which is the focus of the paper.</p><p>Figure 1A-D; need more controls (positive and negative).

The ASO used targets liver, adipose and reticuloendothelial system. Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 only show mRNA data for liver, brain, spleen, heart, skeletal muscle. It would be good to include data in adipose. All this should be in main figures. Also, given the main thrust of the study is NAFLD/NASH, the authors should show collagen staining and fibrosis pathology scores.</p><p>Figure 3E presents a major problem as the MBOAT7 ASO lowers mRNA for TMC4, making the rest of the experiments (most of the rest of the paper) not possible to interpret for MBOAT7 depletion. If the point of the paper is that both genes are coordinately regulated and somehow both function in these phenotypes, then more work needs to be done to understand this. However, the current paper is about MBOAT7.</p><p>Figure 5; results for other phospholipids and lysophospholipids should be shown.

The characterization is good and complete with interesting findings. There are several important weaknesses- they don't actually establish whether MBOAT7 or TMC4 are independently or cooperatively involved in the resulting phenotype. I don't think with the experiments presented they have firmly established with the alterations in lipid species found are responsible for the inflammation and stellate cell activation. It is important they address my third major point prior to any publication as it has important implication if true. Finally, they don't address why TGs accumulate in liver. The latter seem pretty basic given this is how the region was identified in the first place. Overall, I think this is marginal for acceptance, but certainly more experiments would be required.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The effect of the ASO on FAT Mboat7 expression should be included.</p><p>2) Regarding the experimental design of Figure 6. It is not clear whether the amount of 18:0 LPI injected resulted in a 2-fold increase in the total LPI concentration or in the amount of 18:0. The later would be appropriate for these experiments. It seems to directly link the LPI and the function of MBOAT7, only the species that were altered should induce the inflammation and stellate cell activation. There is a lack of controls in this important experiment, which should include species that were not altered by MBOAT7 knockdown.</p><p>3) What is the mechanism by which the MBOAT7 knockdown results in TG, CE and FC accumulation in liver?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Obesity-linked suppression of membrane-bound <italic>O</italic>-Acyltransferase 7 (<italic>MBOAT7</italic>) drives non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, the mechanism underlying the steatosis is still unclear. The new data regarding alterations to the liver lipid droplet proteome are interesting but do not establish whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of steatosis. Given that steatosis is the focus of the paper, the consensus is that this issue must be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Direct evidence of how TG, CE and free cholesterol accumulates in Mboat7-deficient livers is not provided. A higher abundance of GPAT4 in the lipid droplet fraction was observed, but it is unclear where the acyl-CoA substrates for GPAT are coming from if there is no increase in de novo lipogenesis or uptake from circulation. The abundance of PLIN2, PLIN3, GPAT4, and CCTα on lipid droplets may merely reflect the presence of more lipid droplets. Increased abundance of GPAT4 and CCTα on lipid droplets does not explain why the livers of MBOAT7-deficient mice contain more CE and free cholesterol. mRNAs linked to lipogenesis were not measured in conditions that stimulate lipogenesis (i.e. re-feeding) but were instead measured after fasting or at the start of the light cycle.</p><p>The following experiments could be performed in the given time frame to address this central issue:</p><p>- Measure lipogenic mRNAs in re-fed conditions (see papers by Horton and colleagues on SREBP1-dependent lipogenesis).</p><p>- The rate of liver lipid synthesis can be assessed by i.p injection of radiolabeled glycerol and measurement of glycerol incorporation into lipid classes after separation by TLC as in Miyazaki et al., 2001 or Millar et al., 2006.</p><p>- Alternatively, if they believe their data is consistent with an impairment in TG mobilization from LDs, then the rate of liver LD lipolysis can be assessed as in Schweiger et al., 2014. These measurements could be done in primary hepatocytes/cell culture models if that is easier to achieve.</p><p>- de novo lipogenesis as a contributor to fat accumulation could be assessed by injecting mice with 14C-acetate (after they had been fasted O/N and re-fed for 6 hours) as in Lian et al., 2018.</p><p>2) In the experiment in which LPI species were administered to mice, only mRNAs related to inflammation were assessed. Analysis of hepatic lipid metabolism should be included in this experiment, especially since the focus of the manuscript has shifted from fibrosis/inflammation to hepatic steatosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49882.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Mboat7 is a lysoPI acyltransferase that has been identified as a candidate gene in GWAS studies for NAFLD.

Is the expression of Srebp1c and lipogenic genes increased? The authors showed cholesterol in plasma lipoprotein particles was not altered, how about the TG profile in plasma lipoprotein particles? Is there any defect in VLDL secretion?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have completed a number of additional experiments to understand the mechanism by which MBOAT7 loss of function promotes hepatic steatosis. First, we have repeatedly seen that Mboat7 knockdown does not significantly alter Srebp1c or lipogenic gene expression. We have also consistently seen no alterations in steady state plasma triglyceride levels or VLDL secretion rates. These new data for lipogenic gene expression and VLDL secretion are now included in a new main figure (Figure 9). After ruling out these common causes of hepatic steatosis, we instead focused our attention on whether MBOAT7 knockdown could drive steatosis by locally altering the lipid and proteome composition of cytosolic lipid droplets (i.e. impacting lipid storage at the lipid droplet interface). The rationale for pursuing this possibility was that a recent manuscript (Mancina et al., 2016) suggested that MBOAT7 can co-purify with cytosolic lipid droplets in subcellular fractionation experiments. Using sucrose gradient lipid droplet fractionation protocols, we have now confirmed that MBOAT7 can be found on cytosolic lipid droplets in control mice but is essentially absent on lipid droplets from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice (Figure 9F). In parallel with MBOAT7 localization to lipid droplets, we found the lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice show striking increases in MBOAT7 substrates (18:0 LPI and 20:4 LPI) and reduction in MBOAT7 products (38:4 PI). In fact, the differences seen in LPI and PI lipids are much more apparent in isolated lipid droplets (Figure 9) than what is seen in whole liver homogenates (Figure 6). Aligned with alterations in LPI and PI lipids, lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 knockdown livers had a clear rearrangement of lipid droplet-associated proteins. Lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated livers have increased abundance of several lipid droplet-associated proteins including perilipin 2, perilipin 3, as well as the lipid synthesizing enzymes CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 4 (GPAT4) (Figure 9F). Aligned with these new findings we have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Steatosis Seen with Mboat7 Knockdown is Associated With Reorganization of the Hepatic Lipid Droplet Lipidome and Proteome. Mboat7 loss of function results in a striking accumulation of neutral lipids including triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (Figure 2e-2l), yet the mechanism(s) behind this are poorly understood. We therefore examined several potential mechanisms driving the mixed hepatic steatosis in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. First, we examined the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol sensing and export under both fed and fasted conditions (Figure 9). Unlike many other models of hepatic steatosis, there were no significant alterations in lipogenic gene expression either in the fed or fasted state with Mboat7 knockdown (Figure 9a). Unexpectedly, the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (Cpt1) was significantly elevated with Mboat7 knockdown (Figure 9a), but this would not be expected to promote the accumulation of neutral lipids. The expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (Hmgcr and Hmcgs1) were modestly reduced in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, but only in the fasted state (Figure 9a). In addition, expression of the cholesterol efflux regulator Abca1 was elevated in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, but only in the fasted state. Altogether, these minor differences in hepatic gene expression are unlikely to be driving the lipid accumulation in Mboat7 ASO treated mice. Next, we evaluated whether Mboat7 may influence the export of neutral lipids via packaging on nascent very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). However, Mboat7 ASO-treated mice did not have significant differences in VLDL-TG secretion during a detergent block (Figure 9b). Another common cause of fatty liver is increased delivery of adipose-derived fatty acids to the liver, as is commonly seen with prolonged fasting and certain types of lipodystrophies. However, Mboat7 knockdown did not alter basal or catecholamine-stimulated adipocyte lipolysis in vivo (Figure 9c), ruling out a role for altered adipose lipolysis as a contributing factor. Finally, we examined the possibility that MBOAT7 may be a determinate of metabolism locally at the surface of cytosolic lipid droplets to regulate hepatic steatosis, given that one recent study reported that MBOAT7 can localize to cytosolic lipid droplets<sup>2</sup>. We confirmed that MBOAT7 can indeed be found in lipid droplets isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation (Figure 9f), and plays a regulatory role in both the lipidome and proteome of cytosolic lipid droplets. Cytosolic lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice showed marked accumulation of 18:0 LPI and 20:4 LPI, but not 16:0 LPI or 18:1 LPI (Figure 9d). This is in stark contrast to what is seen in the whole liver, where Mboat7 knockdown instead promotes accumulation of 16:0 LPI and 18:1 LPI (Figure 6d). Also, lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice have a reduced level of 38:4 PI but a reciprocal increase in 36:3 and 38:3 PI (Figure 9e), which is quite different when to compared to effects in whole liver (Figure 6e). In addition to alterations in the lipid droplet lipidome, Mboat7 knockdown is associated with accumulation of several proteins involved in lipid synthesis and storage on isolated lipid droplets (Figure 9f). Both perilipin 2 and 3 (PLIN2 and PLIN3) were much more abundant on lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, as were the critical lipid synthetic enzymes CTP:phosphcholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) and glycerol-3-phosphate 4 (GPAT4). Given that recent reports have shown that lipid droplet targeting of CCTα and GPAT4 are critical regulators of the overall size and triglyceride storage capacity of lipid droplets<sup>30-32</sup>, these proteomic alterations at the lipid droplet surface are likely to contribute to the hepatic steatosis seen in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The diet regimen employed does not typically lead to fibrosis in mice. The authors showed increased expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes, but to establish fibrosis they need to show Trichrome or Sirius staining. Similarly, they claim that stellate cells were activated, but need more direct data to support this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point that high fat diet feeding does not typically lead to measurable fibrosis in mice. Since our original submission we have done a number of experiments to test whether MBOAT7 knockdown indeed stimulates bridging fibrosis as is seen in advanced human liver disease, but as brought forth by this astute reviewer we failed to find pathological or biochemical support of fibrosis in this mouse model. First, we had a board-certified liver pathologist (Dr. Daniela Allende, Cleveland Clinic) blindly score H&amp;E-, pirosirius Red, and trichrome-stained liver sections from HFD-fed control and Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, and in all cases there was no measureable fibrosis scoring above background. To indirectly quantitate fibrosis potential in a complimentary way we analyzed liver hydroxyproline content biochemically, and again found no indication that hydroxyproline levels were altered in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. Finally, we performed some preliminary studies in primary stellate cells treating with MBOAT7 substrate lipids (LPIs) and did not see any obvious signs of pro-fibrotic responses in primary stellate cells. Given that we do not see any signs of even early stage fibrosis in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, we have removed any discussion regarding effects on fibrosis and instead focus the discussion on the striking hepatic lipid accumulation seen with MBOAT7 loss of function in high fat fed mice. Although beyond the scope of the current study, we are now generating in parallel either hepatocyte, macrophage, or stellate cell specific Mboat7 knockout mice and will subject them to models of fibrosis induction (carbon tetrachloride, methionine/choline-deficient diet, bile duct ligation, etc.) to understand the cell autonomous effect of Mboat7 in pro-fibrotic responses.</p><p>To make this issue clear for the reader we have removed any claims that fibrosis was found in our studies, and have added the following sentences to the Discussion section:</p><p>“However, an important limitation of our studies is that high fat diet feeding in mice is not sufficient to drive bridging fibrosis. In future studies it will be important to examine how Mboat7 loss of function impacts the development of fibrosis in appropriate fibrosis-prone animal models, and whether Mboat7 expression in hepatic stellate cells plays a regulatory role in the progression from NASH to cirrhosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors report that 16:0 and 18:1 LPI was increased upon Mboat7 suppression, but the levels of these two LPIs (~0.05 pmol/mg) are very low compared to 18:0 LPI (~5 pmol/mg). It is difficult to see how this change could be driving the phenotype. Is the total LPI level significantly increased? Is there any change in total PI levels? Why did the authors inject mice with 18:0 LPI, which was not altered by Mboat7 suppression, but not 16:0 or 18:1 LPI that was increased by Mboat7 knockdown? Do different LPI species have different effects?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very insightful comment that was generally shared by all three reviewers, so we felt it was important to perform additional experiments to address the concern. We originally injected mice with 18:0 LPI because it by far is the most abundant LPI in the circulation, and we followed a similar logic as this astute reviewer that the most abundant species is the most likely culprit as a signaling lipid. We also knew from the literature that 18:0 LPI was previously described as a bona fide MBOAT7 substrate in biochemical assays from the Voelker laboratory (Gijón et al., 2008). We also now show that the acylation of 18:0 LPI is lower in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice (Figure 6A), particularly when challenged with a high fat diet. However, we agree that the primary changes seen with Mboat7 ASO treatment in the liver is instead the more minor species 16:0 and 18:1. To better understand how these more minor species of LPI (16:0 and 18:1) could impact liver disease in the context of Mboat7 loss of function, we performed new experiments examining whether direct injection of 16:0 or 18:1 LPI could induce liver injury in control or Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. Results from these new experiments are now included as a new main figure (Figure 8), and the results from the 18:0 LPI injections are included as an online supplemental figure to provide a comprehensive look at LPI subspecies effects (Figure 8—figure supplement 4). Interestingly, both 18:1 and 18:0 LPI induced expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrosis marker genes in a MBOAT7-dependent manner, but this was not apparent with 16:0 LPI administration. These new data provide additional evidence in support of substrate-specific effects in vivo, and highlight the importance of 18 carbon LPIs as potential proinflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling lipids when MBOAT7 activity is compromised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For LPI treatment experiment, did the authors inject HFD fed mice or chow diet fed mice? Will an increase in LPI in chow diet fed mice induce a phenotype similar to HFD fed mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To help get at this question, we have now performed LPI injection experiments in either chow-fed or HFD-fed cohorts of mice, and these new experiments are described in the revised manuscript. We have found that the ability of 18 carbon LPIs to induce pro-inflammatory and fibrosis related gene expression in Mboat7 ASO treated mice really only occurs when mice are fed a high fat diet and not seen in chow-fed mice. We have included a new supplementary figure to show the modest transcriptional changes following 18:0 LPI administration in chow-fed mice, but also show that some of these same genes are altered with Mboat7 knockdown and high fat diet feeding (Figure 8—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does LPI treatment also affect other genes identified by RNA seq in figure 3? In other words, does LPI contribute to other phenotypes including steatosis and insulin resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>In parallel experiments described in question 5 above, we have injected LPI into control and Mboat7 ASO-treated mice maintained on a chow diet, and performed metabolic phenotyping including hepatic lipid quantification and unbiased RNA sequencing to address this question. In chow-fed mice we did not find that LPI injection promoted steatosis in either control or Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. We have included a new supplementary figure to show the modest transcriptional changes following 18:0 LPI administration in chow-fed mice, but also show that some of these same genes are altered with Mboat7 knockdown and high fat diet feeding (Figure 8—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The main focus of this paper is that reduced expression of MBOAT7 in the liver drives NAFLD (per the title) and NAFLD consequences.

The units for panels D-F were relative quantitation of mRNA abundance from a previously performed microarray analysis (Affymetrix HT_MG-430A) on tissue isolated from the hybrid mouse diversity panel by the Lusis laboratory (Parks et al., 2015). As requested, we have now fixed these issues with this figure, and have included the rs641738 genotypes within each group as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A; pertinent negative controls should be shown. The ASO used targets liver, adipose and reticuloendothelial system. Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 only show mRNA data for liver, brain, spleen, heart, skeletal muscle. It would be good to include data in adipose. All this should be in main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have seen that our control ASO behaves very similar to a saline control group, and have now included a supplemental figure showing that two distinct ASO targeting different regions of the Mboat7 mRNA have similar effects on hepatic steatosis (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). To be more comprehensive in showing the reader where the ASOs target knockdown, we have now included figures showing the knockdown efficiency of Mboat7 ASO in liver (Figure 2), adipose (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and other tissue including brain, spleen, heart, and skeletal muscle (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). It is important to note that despite significant knockdown of Mboat7 in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, there are no differences in adiposity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), basal and catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis (Figure 9c), energy expenditure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), and only very minor differences in adipose tissue gene expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Therefore, our data do not support a strong role for adipose tissue function per se in the observed fatty liver phenotype in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, given the main thrust of the study is NAFLD/NASH, the authors should show collagen staining and fibrosis pathology scores.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in response to reviewer # 1, we have tested a number of approaches to identify fibrosis in our mice, but under the high fat diet conditions we used we simply do not see fibrosis. In full disclosure we have made this clear to the reader. Since our original submission we have performed a number of experiments to test whether MBOAT7 knockdown indeed stimulates bridging fibrosis as is seen in advanced human liver disease, but as brought forth by this astute reviewer we failed to find pathological or biochemical support of fibrosis in this mouse model. First, we had a board-certified liver pathologist (Dr. Daniela Allende, Cleveland Clinic) blindly score H&amp;E-, pirosirius Red, and trichrome-stained liver sections from HFD-fed control and Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, and in all cases there was no measureable fibrosis scoring above background. To indirectly quantitate fibrosis potential in a complimentary way we analyzed liver hydroxyproline content biochemically, and again found no indication that hydroxyproline levels were altered in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. Finally, we performed some preliminary studies in primary stellate cells treating with MBOAT7 substrate lipids (LPIs) and did not see any obvious signs of pro-fibrotic responses in primary stellate cells. Given that we do not see any signs of even early stage fibrosis in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, we have removed any discussion regarding effects on fibrosis and instead focus the discussion on the striking hepatic lipid accumulation seen with MBOAT7 loss of function in high fat fed mice. Although beyond the scope of the current study, we are now generating in parallel either hepatocyte, macrophage, or stellate cell specific Mboat7 knockout mice and will subject them to models of fibrosis induction (carbon tetrachloride, methionine/choline-deficient diet, bile duct ligation, etc.) to understand the cell autonomous effect of Mboat7 in pro-fibrotic responses.</p><p>To make this issue clear for the reader we have removed any claims that fibrosis was found in our studies, and have added the following sentences to the Discussion section:</p><p>“However, an important limitation of our studies is that high fat diet feeding in mice is not sufficient to drive bridging fibrosis. In future studies it will be important to examine how Mboat7 loss of function impacts the development of fibrosis in appropriate fibrosis-prone animal models, and whether Mboat7 expression in hepatic stellate cells plays a regulatory role the progression from NASH to cirrhosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3E presents a major problem as the MBOAT7 ASO lowers mRNA for TMC4, making the rest of the experiments (most of the rest of the paper) not possible to interpret for MBOAT7 depletion. If the point of the paper is that both genes are coordinately regulated and somehow both function in these phenotypes, then more work needs to be done to understand this. However, the current paper is about MBOAT7.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this reviewer concern, and this was shared by several reviewers. Therefore, we felt it was imperative to address the issue with additional studies in Tmc4 deficient mice. We generated a global Tmc4 knockout mice using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing and examined hepatic lipid levels under high fat feeding conditions (Figure 4). Global Tmc4 knockout mice have marked reductions in hepatic Tmc4 mRNA (Figure 4A) and protein (Figure 4B), yet importantly Mboat7 expression is unaltered (Figure 4A). In contrast to the striking hepatic steatosis seen with Mboat7 loss of function (Figure 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 4), Tmc4 null mice show similar levels of hepatic lipids when fed a high fat diet (Figure 4). These data strongly implicate Mboat7, but not Tmc4, as the primary mediator of hepatic steatosis seen with the rs641738 variant or in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5; results for other phospholipids and lysophospholipids should be shown. Is this defect specific for PI/LPI?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have quantified levels of most major species of phospholipids and lysophospholipids in the liver or Mboat7 ASO-treated mice, and have included these data in a new supplementary figure. Mboat7 knockdown did not significantly alter the hepatic levels of other major phospholipids including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, or phosphatidic acids (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). This is consistent with previously published findings from global Mboat7<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Lee et al., 2012). Collectively, our data suggest that ASO-mediated knockdown of Mboat7 primarily alters LPI and PI levels in the liver and white adipose tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6; it's not clear exactly how LPI is given, how much, and whether it is &quot;physiological&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary Figure 13 shows that with our dosing regime we were able to see a rapid transient ~2-fold increase in either 18:0 LPI or 18:1 LPI. We feel that this is well within the physiological range of these lipids, given that we have found human plasma levels to be much higher than what is found in mice (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is the first characterization of MBOAT7 knockdown mice. The characterization is good and complete with interesting findings. There are several important weaknesses- they don't actually establish whether MBOAT7 or TMC4 are independently or cooperatively involved in the resulting phenotype. I don't think with the experiments presented they have firmly established with the alterations in lipid species found are responsible for the inflammation and stellate cell activation. It is important they address my third major point prior to any publication as it has important implication if true. Finally, they don't address why TGs accumulate in liver. The latter seem pretty basic given this is how the region was identified in the first place. Overall, I think this is marginal for acceptance, but certainly more experiments would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in responses to reviewers 1 and 2, we have now added data to directly address the role of Mboat7, but not Tmc4 in hepatic steatosis. We also provide new data showing that the hepatic steatosis seen in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice is driven in part by reorganization of the proteome of cytosolic lipid droplets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The effect of the ASO on FAT Mboat7 expression should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Given this is a shared concern by all 3 reviewers, we have now included several additional experiments examining the effects of Mboat7 ASO treatment on adipose tissue biology. Our revised manuscript shows that despite significant knockdown of Mboat7 in adipose tissue, there are no difference in adiposity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), basal and catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis (Figure 9c), energy expenditure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), and only very minor differences in adipose tissue gene expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Therefore, our data do not support a strong role for adipose tissue function in the observed fatty liver phenotype in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the experimental design of Figure 6. It is not clear whether the amount of 18:0 LPI injected resulted in a 2-fold increase in the total LPI concentration or in the amount of 18:0. The later would be appropriate for these experiments. It seems to directly link the LPI and the function of MBOAT7, only the species that were altered should induce the inflammation and stellate cell activation. There is a lack of controls in this important experiment, which should include species that were not altered by MBOAT7 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern was shared by reviewer # 1, so we performed additional experiments and now show data with all three potential LPI substrates (16:0, 18:0, and 18:1). Since our original submission, we have now directly injected LPI species that are altered by Mboat7 ASO treatment (18:1 LPI and 16:0) and ones that are not altered by Mboat7 ASO treatment (18:0 LPI). It is important to consider that although only 16:0 and 18:1 LPI accumulate in the liver of Mboat7 ASO-treated mice (Figure 6D), we did find reduced hepatic LPIAT activity with all three potential substrates (Figure 6A). Furthermore, cytosolic lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice showed marked accumulation of 18:0 LPI, but not 16:0 LPI or 18:1 LPI (Figure 9D). This is in stark contrast to what is seen in the whole liver, where Mboat7 knockdown instead promotes accumulation of 16:0 LPI and 18:1 LPI (Figure 6D). Functionally, we found that injection of either 18 carbon LPI (18:0 or 18:1), but not 16:0 LPI, was able to increase pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene expression, but only in the Mboat7 ASO-treated group. These new data are shown in main Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the mechanism by which the MBOAT7 knockdown results in TG, CE and FC accumulation in liver?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in response to reviewer 1, we have performed a number of additional experiments to understand the mechanism(s) by which Mboat7 knockdown promotes hepatic steatosis. First, we have repeatedly seen that Mboat7 knockdown does not significantly alter Srebp1c or lipogenic gene expression, either under fed or fasted conditions (Figure 9A). We have also consistently seen no alterations in steady state plasma triglyceride levels (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) or VLDL triglyceride secretion rates (Figure 9B). After ruling out these common causes of hepatic steatosis, we instead focused our attention on whether MBOAT7 knockdown could drive steatosis by locally altering the lipid and proteome composition of cytosolic lipid droplets (i.e. impacting lipid storage at the lipid droplet interface). The rationale for pursuing this possibility was that a recent manuscript (Mancina et al., 2016) suggested that MBOAT7 can co-purify with cytosolic lipid droplets in subcellular fractionation experiments. Using sucrose gradient lipid droplet fractionation protocols, we have now confirmed that MBOAT7 can be found on cytosolic lipid droplets in control mice but is essentially absent on lipid droplets from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice (Figure 9F). In parallel with MBOAT7 localization to lipid droplets, we found the lipid droplets isolated from Mboat7 ASO-treated mice show striking increases in MBOAT7 substrates (18:0 LPI and 20:4 LPI) and reduction in MBOAT7 products (38:4 PI). In fact, the differences seen in LPI and PI lipids are much more apparent in isolated lipid droplets (Figure 9) than what is seen in whole liver homogenates (Figure 6). Collectively, our results support a role for MBOAT7 in regulating local LPI acylation at the lipid droplet surface, which is associated with marked accumulation of lipogenic enzymes (CCTα and GPAT4) on lipid droplets, which may contribute to the large lipid droplets seen Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. These new data are discussed in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“From this study it is clear that MBOAT7 can diversify the inositol-containing phospholipids and the associated proteome on cytosolic lipid droplets, and this could in part explain the large lipid droplets that accumulate in Mboat7 ASO-treated mice. It is interesting to note that the well known PNPLA3 variant associated with fatty liver disease (I148M) accumulates on lipid droplets, and similarly reorganizes the lipidome and proteome to promote liver disease progression<sup>35-38</sup>. Our findings here with MBOAT7-driven restructuring of the lipid droplet surface, and those recently published with PNPLA3<sup>35-38</sup>, suggest that alterations in lipid modifying enzyme access to the surface of cytosolic lipid droplets may be a common mechanism by which human fatty liver develops. Therefore, rigorous studies of the lipid droplet lipidome and proteome in freshly isolated human liver specimens may provide clues into new therapeutic leads for advanced liver diseases.”</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and editors agree that the manuscript has been improved since the original submission and several issues have been clarified. However, the mechanism underlying the steatosis is still unclear. The new data regarding alterations to the liver lipid droplet proteome are interesting but do not establish whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of steatosis. Given that steatosis is the focus of the paper, the consensus is that this issue must be addressed prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the mechanism underlying steatosis associated with MBOAT7 loss of function we have generated MBOAT7 deficient human hepatoma cells and performed several new metabolic tracer studies to further clarify the mechanism. MBOAT7-deficient Huh7 cells showed no significant difference in triacylglycerol hydrolysis rates, but instead showed modest increases in de novo lipogenesis (<sup>14</sup>C-acetate incorporation into <sup>14</sup>C-triacylglycerol) and marked reductions in fatty acid oxidation (<sup>14</sup>C-palmitate incorporation into <sup>14</sup>C-CO<sub>2</sub>). These new data are included in new Figure 10, and provide new information by which MBOAT7 control fatty acid metabolism and triacylglycerol storage in a cell autonomous manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Direct evidence of how TG, CE and free cholesterol accumulates in Mboat7-deficient livers is not provided. A higher abundance of GPAT4 in the lipid droplet fraction was observed, but it is unclear where the acyl-CoA substrates for GPAT are coming from if there is no increase in de novo lipogenesis or uptake from circulation. The abundance of PLIN2, PLIN3, GPAT4, and CCTα on lipid droplets may merely reflect the presence of more lipid droplets. Increased abundance of GPAT4 and CCTα on lipid droplets does not explain why the livers of MBOAT7-deficient mice contain more CE and free cholesterol. mRNAs linked to lipogenesis were not measured in conditions that stimulate lipogenesis (i.e. re-feeding) but were instead measured after fasting or at the start of the light cycle.</p><p>The following experiments could be performed in the given time frame to address this central issue:</p><p>- Measure lipogenic mRNAs in re-fed conditions (see papers by Horton and colleagues on SREBP1-dependent lipogenesis).</p></disp-quote><p>When we received this original comment, we ascertained from our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that in fact this study would take us roughly 4 months to complete. For us to do the in vivo ASO studies looking at fasting/re-feeding along with radioisotope (<sup>14</sup>C-acetate and <sup>3</sup>H-glycerol) we would need to amend our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol to include radiotracers that would take about 1.5 months before we could even get approval to start the experiments. In typical experiments we treat with ASO for 8 weeks to achieve good knockdown, which would put us another 2 months out. Therefore, any in vivo experiments would require about 4 months of time. To be responsive within the time frame, we instead focused our efforts on measuring rates of de novo lipogenesis rather than gene expression in hepatoma cell lines that we genetically deleted MBOAT7 (see comments below). Although the in vivo fasted and re-feeding experiments would provide another layer of information, we felt it is likely to be incremental in nature to the data we already show. It is our experience that if de novo lipogenic gene expression is different between groups of mice, this can be easily seen under the conditions we collected tissues (fasted vs. fed at the start of the light cycle).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The rate of liver lipid synthesis can be assessed by i.p injection of radiolabeled glycerol and measurement of glycerol incorporation into lipid classes after separation by TLC as in Miyazaki et al., 2001 or Millar et al., 2006.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, to be responsive within the time frame, we instead focused our efforts on measuring rates of de novo lipogenesis in hepatoma cell lines where we genetically deleted MBOAT7. To address this in cultured cells we generated Huh7 cells genetically lacking MBOAT7 using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. These cells accumulate large lipid droplets much like those seen in mouse liver in vivo, so we feel this is an appropriate model system to understand cell autonomous mechanisms by which MBOAT7 alters storage of triglyceride and cholesterol. MBOAT7-deficient Huh7 cells in fact showed modest increases in de novo lipogenesis (<sup>14</sup>C-acetate incorporation into <sup>14</sup>Ctriacylglycerol) and marked reductions in fatty acid oxidation (<sup>14</sup>C-palmitate incorporation into <sup>14</sup>C-CO<sub>2</sub>).

These measurements could be done in primary hepatocytes/cell culture models if that is easier to achieve.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, to test whether MBOAT7 loss-of-function is associated with impairment in triacylglycerol or cholesteryl ester mobilization, we performed pulse-chase studies in wild type or MBOAT7-deficient Huh7 cells using both <sup>14</sup>C-oleic acid and <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol to label triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester pools to steady state. Thereafter, cells were chased in the presence of the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C (effectively blocking re-esterifcation of hydrolysis products). Using this method, we found that the turnover/mobilization of both triacylglycerol and cholesteryl esters was not altered in MBOAT7-deficient cells. These data are included in new Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- de novo lipogenesis as a contributor to fat accumulation could be assessed by injecting mice with 14C-acetate (after they had been fasted O/N and re-fed for 6 hours) as in Lian et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we were unable to assess the effects of Mboat7 knockdown on de novo lipogenesis in vivo in the time frame, our studies clearly show that acetate incorporation into cellular triacylglycerol is increased in MBOAT7-deficient Huh7 cells compared to wild type Huh7 cells (see new Figure 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the experiment in which LPI species were administered to mice, only mRNAs related to inflammation were assessed.
