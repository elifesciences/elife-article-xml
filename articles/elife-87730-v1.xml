Several rAAV vectored therapies have achieved regulatory approval, but production of sufficient rAAV quantities remains difficult. The AAV Rep proteins, which are essential for genome replication and packaging, represent a promising engineering target for improvement of rAAV production but remain underexplored. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Rep proteins and their mutational landscape, we assayed the effects of all 39,297 possible single-codon mutations to the AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> gene on AAV2 production. Most beneficial variants are not observed in nature, indicating that improved production may require synthetic mutations. Additionally, the effects of AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> mutations were largely consistent across capsid serotypes, suggesting that production benefits are capsid independent. Our results provide a detailed sequence-to-function map that enhances our understanding of Rep protein function and lays the groundwork for Rep engineering and enhancement of large-scale gene therapy production.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adeno-associated virus</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>rep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wyss Institute Synthetic Biology Platform</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Church</surname><given-names>George M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Measurement of the effect of all single-codon variants of the AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> gene on recombinant adeno-associated virus production identifies novel beneficial variants, which may facilitate improvement of gene therapy production.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are a popular tool for the delivery of gene therapies as wild-type AAV is not pathogenic. Wild-type AAV consists of a 4.7 kb single-stranded DNA genome, which is packaged into an approximately 26 nm icosahedral capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Srivastava et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xie et al., 2002</xref>). The AAV genome is flanked on either end by 145-nucleotide inverted terminal repeats, which form hairpins, serve as the origins of viral replication, and are the only sequences required in <italic>cis</italic> for packaging of DNA into the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiao et al., 1997</xref>). As such, the remainder of the AAV genome can be replaced with a gene of interest to generate rAAV vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Samulski and Muzyczka, 2014</xref>). The wild-type AAV genome consists of two genes, <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>cap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Srivastava et al., 1983</xref>). During rAAV production, these genes are supplied in <italic>trans</italic> to the inverted terminal repeat plasmid. The <italic>cap</italic> gene encodes three structural proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3, which assemble in an approximately 1:1:10 ratio to form the 60-mer capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cassinotti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wörner et al., 2021</xref>). Engineering of the <italic>cap</italic> gene has enabled targeting of AAV vectors to specific tissues and cell populations. The <italic>rep</italic> gene encodes four proteins, Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, and Rep40, which are generated through the use of two promoters, p5 and p19, and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The larger Rep proteins, Rep78 and Rep68, are required for genome replication while the smaller Rep proteins, Rep52 and Rep40, facilitate genome packaging. Notably, Rep78 and Rep68 alone are each sufficient for rAAV vector production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hölscher et al., 1995</xref>). However, the presence of Rep52/40 enhances genome packaging and therefore rAAV titer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chejanovsky and Carter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 2001</xref>). The <italic>rep</italic> gene encodes three protein domains: an origin-binding domain, a helicase domain, and a zinc-finger domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Pasquale and Stacey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Im and Muzyczka, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith and Kotin, 1998</xref>). All four Rep proteins contain the helicase domain as well as a nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cassell and Weitzman, 2004</xref>). Only Rep78 and Rep68 contain the origin-binding domain and only Rep78 and Rep52 contain the zinc-finger domain. Additionally, residues in the linker domain between the origin-binding and helicase domains cooperate with residues at the N-terminus of the helicase domain to facilitate oligomerization of the larger Rep proteins, which is required for AAV production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zarate-Perez et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive mutagenesis library design and production assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Organization of the AAV2 genome and Rep protein domains.

Firstly, the origin-binding domain recognizes the Rep-binding site, which consists of GCTC repeats present in the double-stranded region of the inverted terminal repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musayev et al., 2015a</xref>). Unwinding of this double-stranded DNA by the helicase domain enables the origin-binding domain to interact with single-stranded DNA at its second motif, the active site pocket. Here, the origin-binding domain nicks the single-stranded DNA at the terminal resolution site, an essential step in viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Im and Muzyczka, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Snyder et al., 1990</xref>). Finally, the origin-binding domain contains a single-stranded DNA hairpin-binding site, which interacts with one of the inverted terminal repeat hairpins. Hairpin binding, however, is not required for terminal resolution site nicking or genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). The origin-binding domain can also recognize GCTC repeats present in the p5 promoter; in the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus, the Rep proteins activate transcription from the endogenous promoters and in the absence of helper virus the Rep proteins repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Labow et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The helicase domain plays a definitive role in all steps of AAV production while the zinc-finger domain is likely dispensable for production. The helicase domain unwinds the double-stranded inverted terminal repeats during genome replication and its activity has been shown to facilitate genome packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brister and Muzyczka, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 2001</xref>). There is also evidence that residues within the helicase domain mediate capsid interactions. Mutations to the helicase domain of Rep52/40, as well as mutations near the fivefold axis of symmetry in the capsid, reduced the interaction between the Rep proteins and capsid and resulted in lower rAAV titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bleker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 2001</xref>). The third Rep domain, the zinc-finger domain, has not been shown to bind DNA but is involved in binding to various host cell proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Pasquale and Stacey, 1998</xref>). Previous work indicated that premature stop codons introduced into the zinc-finger domain-encoding region of <italic>rep</italic> do not affect rAAV titers, suggesting that this domain is not required for rAAV production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mietzsch et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As more rAAV vectored therapies are approved, manufacturing sufficient rAAV quantities to meet patient need is an increasingly important issue. Engineering the Rep proteins is a promising avenue for improving AAV production. The Rep proteins are involved in all steps of viral production, including regulation of VP expression, genome replication, and genome packaging. However, the Rep proteins are not a structural component of the final vector. As such, the Rep proteins can be designed to optimize viral production without affecting downstream processes, such as cell targeting, which are driven by the capsid. The sequence of the <italic>rep</italic> genes in naturally occurring serotypes is relatively well conserved (average of 78% amino acid sequence identity between AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> and AAV1–13 <italic>rep</italic>). While previous mutational studies of the Rep proteins have been conducted, these studies have focused primarily on identifying non-functional Rep variants to identify the location of key motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gavin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hörer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 1992</xref>). As such, Rep engineering efforts may benefit from the exploration of additional sequence diversity.</p><p>Toward this end, we generated a library of all possible single-codon mutations of the AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> gene, the <italic>rep</italic> gene most commonly used for AAV production. We assayed the effect of these mutations on AAV2 production and generated a detailed sequence-to-function map of the AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comprehensive mutagenesis assays the effect of all single-codon mutations in the AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> gene on AAV2 production</title><p>To better understand how mutations to <italic>rep</italic> affect AAV production, we generated two <italic>rep</italic> libraries. The first library, referred to as pCMV-Rep78/68, consisted of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter followed by the <italic>rep</italic> open-reading frame with an M225G mutation introduced to prevent expression of the smaller Rep proteins. This library allowed us to assay the effect of mutating only Rep78 and Rep68. The second library, referred to as WT AAV2, was analogous to the sequence of the wild-type virus and contained the p5 promoter and <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>cap</italic> open-reading frames. Use of the endogenous promoters in the WT AAV2 library allowed us to capture the effect of <italic>rep</italic> mutations on Rep and VP expression. This library also enabled simultaneous mutation of all four Rep proteins. For each library, we generated all 39,297 possible single-codon substitution and deletion variants spanning from the Rep78/68 start codon to the Rep78/52 stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All variants contained unique 20 bp barcodes at the 3′ end of the <italic>rep</italic> gene (pCMV-Rep78/68 library) or <italic>cap</italic> gene (WT AAV2 library), and each codon variant was represented by a minimum of two barcode sequences. To assess the diversity of the plasmid libraries, we amplified and sequenced the barcodes from each of the plasmid pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Production fitness values for each variant were calculated and normalized to internal wild-type controls as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. For each library, we performed transfections in duplicate and compared the production fitness values calculated from each replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For both libraries, production fitness values were well correlated across replicates, indicating that the genotype–phenotype linkage was maintained during viral production. After examining the correlation between biological replicates, we next looked at the distribution of fitness values for the wild-type and premature stop codon controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Additionally, we calculated the ‘mutability’ of each residue by averaging the normalized production fitness values at each position across all substitutions. We mapped the mutability of each residue onto structures of the origin-binding domain in complex with the Rep-binding site (PDB: 4ZQ9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), the origin-binding domain in complex with single-stranded DNA from the inverted terminal repeat hairpin (PDB: 6XB8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the origin-binding domain alone (PDB: 5D6X, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the helicase domain (PDB: 1S9H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">James et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musayev et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Musayev et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santosh et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, we used the production fitness values calculated for individual barcodes to determine which amino acid changes resulted in production fitness values significantly different from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). We observed that the origin-binding and zinc-finger domains were more tolerant of mutation than the helicase domain. Interestingly, a stark boundary between amino acids D212 and A213 was observed; at residue A213, the larger Rep proteins become much less tolerant of mutation. This boundary is adjacent to linker domain residues P214-Y224, which were previously reported to be important for Rep78/68 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musayev et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zarate-Perez et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of all single amino acid substitutions and deletions in the Rep78/68 proteins on AAV2 production.</title><p>Amino acid level production fitness values from the pCMV-Rep78/68 production assay were calculated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> by summing barcode counts for synonymous mutations.

In particular, substitutions between residues V11 and D62 of the origin-binding domain enhanced AAV2 production relative to wild-type. These residues are involved in recognition of the inverted terminal repeat hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musayev et al., 2015a</xref>). Origin-binding domain–hairpin interactions have been shown to enhance terminal resolution site nicking but are not required for nicking to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). The majority of Rep-binding site-interacting residues, on the other hand, were intolerant of mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The origin-binding domain–Rep-binding site interaction is important in mediating Rep–genome interactions during both genome replication and promoter regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Labow et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Musayev et al., 2015b</xref>). Interestingly, there are a handful of Rep-binding site-interacting residues that were somewhat mutable, including S110 and N139, which form contacts with the phosphate backbone, and A141, which forms contacts with bases in the Rep-binding site. Mutation of S110, N139, and A141, as well as G144 and V147, to positively charged residues had a beneficial effect on AAV2 production. Residues N139, A141, G144, and V147 are part of the loop that connects β-strand 4 to α-helix E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Musayev et al., 2015b</xref>). The sequence of this loop is highly variable across serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musayev et al., 2015a</xref>). Notably, the asparagine at position 139 is positively charged in AAV5 (K139). However, no serotypes contain positively charged amino acids at positions 141, 144, or 147. Our data indicate that substitution of DNA-interacting residues in the origin-binding domain can enhance AAV production and identifies beneficial substitutions not observed in nature.</p><p>A clear pattern in the location of mutable residues in the origin-binding domain active site can also be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This active site is responsible for cleaving single-stranded DNA and is formed by the origin-binding domain beta sheet and Y156, the active site nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hickman et al., 2004</xref>). Residues with side chains directed toward the active site are less mutable than adjacent residues with their side chains directed away from the active site. It is more difficult to discern positional trends in mutability within the helicase domain as it is less tolerant of mutation than the origin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). No structures of the ZFD are available. However, the majority of variants in this domain do not have production fitness values that are significantly different from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Generation of all single-codon variants enables interrogation of nucleotide-level effects</title><p>As our libraries contain all possible single-codon mutations, we were able to search for variants with nucleotide-level effects on production by comparing differences in production fitness values between synonymous codon variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>).

Multiplexed assay of this library allowed us to generate a sequence-to-function map, linking all variants to their effect on AAV production.</p><p>Many of the previous AAV mutagenesis studies have focused on the AAV <italic>cap</italic> gene. Previous work in our lab generated a library containing all possible single-codon substitutions, deletions, and insertions of the AAV2 <italic>cap</italic> gene and assayed their effect on AAV2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ogden et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, we observed a smaller range of fitness values in our production assay with the <italic>rep</italic> library than with the previously reported <italic>cap</italic> library. This observation aligns with our knowledge of Rep and capsid biology. The Rep proteins’ primary function is to facilitate AAV production, while the capsid has evolved to not only enable assembly and genome packaging, but also to facilitate cell targeting, entry, and nuclear trafficking. Additionally, the Rep proteins possess multiple enzymatic activities that require the proteins to adopt specific and dynamic conformations. The capsid, in contrast, is not known to possess enzymatic activity outside of the phospholipase domain located at the N-terminus of VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stahnke et al., 2011</xref>). It follows that there are greater mutational constraints on <italic>rep</italic> than on <italic>cap</italic> in the context of AAV2 production.</p><p>Despite the smaller range of fitness values observed here, we identified numerous Rep variants with production fitness values greater than or equal to that of wild-type AAV2 Rep that are not observed in naturally occurring AAV serotypes. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that optimal rAAV production may not equate to optimal fitness of AAV in the endogenous host. Wild-type AAV has both a lytic and a latent cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu, 2014</xref>). The latent cycle occurs when no helper virus is present. Rep and VP expression are repressed and the AAV genome is integrated into the host cell genome in a process that also involves Rep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pereira et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Surosky et al., 1997</xref>). In the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus, the lytic cycle proceeds. In this instance, Rep78/68 activate transcription from the AAV promoters and genome replication and packaging occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pereira et al., 1997</xref>). rAAV production is somewhat analogous to the lytic cycle. However, naturally occurring AAV must balance the effect of any mutations on fitness in both the lytic and latent contexts. An additional explanation for this finding is the relatively small number of AAV serotypes, for which rep sequences are available. In our analysis, we compared the beneficial variants identified in our library to the <italic>rep</italic> sequences from 12 different AAV serotypes (AAV1–13, no sequence for AAV9 <italic>rep</italic>). This is a small number of naturally occurring <italic>rep</italic> sequences when compared to the size of our library. While there have been efforts to identify additional naturally occurring <italic>cap</italic> sequences, there has been relatively little effort to expand the number of naturally occurring <italic>rep</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We expect that such work may identify <italic>rep</italic> sequences containing many of the beneficial variants identified in our library.</p><p>We observed that substitutions in the origin-binding and zinc-finger domains were better tolerated than substitutions in the linker and helicase domains. A sharp drop in mutability was observed between residues D212 and A213. Previous work has identified residues V215 through Y224 as the minimal linker sequence required to facilitate Rep78/68 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zarate-Perez et al., 2012</xref>). In a separate study, it was reported that mutation of P214 reduced the ability of Rep to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Musayev et al., 2015a</xref>). Our data indicate that residue A213 is intolerant of mutation. A213 likely plays an important role in AAV production and, given its position, may be involved in Rep78/68 oligomerization. Additional work is needed to confirm that mutations to A213 affect AAV production by interfering with Rep78/68 oligomerization. In both library formats, the zinc-finger domain was relatively tolerant of mutation and few substitutions in this domain resulted in production fitness values that were significantly different from wild-type. At some positions, even introduction of a premature stop codon was not deleterious. It was recently reported that premature stop codons introduced at positions 522 and 553 of Rep did not affect AAV2 production when supplied in a pRepCap plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mietzsch et al., 2021</xref>). Our results provide further evidence that the zinc-finger domain is dispensable for AAV production and identify A213 as a potential linker domain residue.</p><p>The majority of beneficial substitutions clustered in the origin-binding domain. In a recent investigation of <italic>rep</italic> hybrids, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mietzsch et al., 2021</xref> reported that replacement of the entire AAV2 origin-binding domain with that of AAV1 or AAV8 improved the proportion of full capsids. Our data supports the importance of the origin-binding domain for AAV production and identifies specific origin-binding domain regions where beneficial mutations cluster. Most substitutions of inverted terminal repeat-hairpin-interacting residues and substitutions of residues in the Rep-binding site-interacting loop to positively charged amino acids were beneficial. Previous studies have demonstrated that Rep binding to the inverted terminal repeat-hairpin improves the efficiency of terminal resolution site nicking but is not required for the nicking reaction to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). The Rep-binding site-interacting loop, on the other hand, is important for the recognition of double-stranded DNA during genome replication and promoter binding. Interestingly, further characterization of the S110R variant, which falls in the Rep-binding site-interacting region, indicated that it increases viral genome and transducing particle titer relative to wild-type Rep but did not increase the ratio of viral genome: capsids, a proxy for the proportion of full capsids. Additional work is needed to understand which, if any, of the beneficial OBD variants identified here also improve the proportion of full capsids. Taken together, our results indicate that enhancement of Rep–DNA interactions may be a fruitful avenue for further improvement of AAV production.</p><p>Inclusion of all single-codon variants in our libraries allowed us to investigate the effect of synonymous mutations on AAV production. Interestingly, we observed that introduction of a c.849C&gt;G mutation resulted in lower production fitness values compared to synonymous variants. Interestingly, this position is located downstream of the p5 and p19 promoters. Additionally, this mutation had a negative effect on production even when the <italic>cap</italic> gene was supplied in <italic>trans</italic>, making the activity of the p40 promoter irrelevant for AAV production. The c.849C&gt;G mutation also does not fall near any known AAV2 splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stutika et al., 2016</xref>). While the mechanism by which this mutation affects production remains unclear, our results emphasize that the <italic>rep</italic> gene is optimized for AAV production at both the amino acid and nucleotide levels.</p><p>While we were able to discern a trend in the effect of synonymous variants at nucleotide position 849 of <italic>rep</italic>, the selection values for synonymous codon variants in general were relatively closely distributed. This precluded further investigation of the effect of synonymous codons on AAV production. Synonymous variants likely have an effect on aspects of AAV production, such as genome replication, transcriptional regulation, mRNA stability, and protein expression. However, our assay measures the aggregate effect of <italic>rep</italic> variants on all steps in the AAV production process and is likely unable to detect the effects of synonymous variants on specific steps in this process if those steps are not rate-limiting.</p><p>In an attempt to identify Rep substitutions with a beneficial effect on the production of specific capsid serotypes, we repeated the pCMV-Rep78/68 library assay using AAV5 and AAV9 <italic>cap</italic> genes in place of AAV2 <italic>cap</italic>. Surprisingly, the correlation in fitness values across experiments was similar to the correlation between biological replicates, suggesting that the majority of AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> mutations have a similar effect on the production of AAV2, AAV5, and AAV9 capsids. These results suggest that either <italic>rep</italic> mutations have a similar effect on Rep78/68–capsid interaction across serotypes, the effect of perturbing Rep78/68–capsid interactions is obscured by the deleterious effects of the same mutations on other Rep activities, or Rep78/68–capsid interactions are not a limiting factor in AAV production.</p><p>We have generated a comprehensive sequence-to-function map of the effect of all single-codon AAV2 <italic>rep</italic> mutations on AAV2, AAV5, and AAV9 production. Our experiments identified thousands of functional Rep variants, laying the groundwork for further engineering of these proteins and enhancement of large-scale gene therapy production.</p></sec><sec

(Twist Biosciences) and subsequent Golden Gate Assembly using methods previously developed in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ogden et al., 2019</xref>). To begin, we generated two wild-type backbone plasmids, containing either the Rep78/68 open-reading frame or the <italic>rep</italic> and <italic>cap</italic> open-reading frames, and removed all BsaI, BbsI, EcoRV, SphI, and XbaI sites. Within the <italic>rep</italic> open-reading frame, we introduced a synonymous mutation at G339 (c.1017G&gt;C). Within the VP open-reading frame, we introduced a synonymous mutation at V118 (c.354C&gt;G) and a coding mutation F370Y (c.1109T&gt;A). The <italic>rep</italic> gene was divided into 11 tiles and cloning for each tile was carried out separately. We designed 300-mer oligos to include 207 nucleotides of <italic>rep</italic>-coding sequence immediately followed by a BbsI site, an EcoRV site, another BbsI site, and a unique 20-nucleotide barcode sequence. All of these elements were flanked by BsaI and primer binding sites on either end of the synthesized sequence. Unique primer-binding sites were used for each tile. To enable cloning of both the Rep78/68 and WT AAV2 format libraries, oligos containing the Rep52/40 start codon (M225) were synthesized with and without the M225G mutation. All possible single-codon substitutions and deletions, including synonymous variants, were included in the library. All positions from the Rep78/68 start codon to the Rep78/52 stop codon (622 codons) were mutated. We did not include the eight codons at the end of the Rep68/40 open-reading frame in our mutagenesis as these positions overlap with the VP1 open-reading frame. Each codon variant was represented by at least two unique barcodes. For each tile, a minimum of 10 uniquely barcoded wild-type controls were included. The Rep78/68 and WT AAV2 libraries each had a total of 81,116 uniquely barcoded variants.</p><p>Following synthesis, we amplified the oligos for each tile (Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, NEB). In parallel, we amplified the backbone vector using primers that introduced BsaI sites. Vector PCR products were digested with BsaI-HF v2, DpnI, and recombinant shrimp alkaline phosphatase (rSAP, NEB) overnight and PCR purified (QIAGEN QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit) the following day. We then performed Golden Gate Assembly with the amplified oligos and vector PCR digest products (NEBridge Golden Gate Assembly Kit, BsaI-HF v2). Golden Gate Assembly reactions were cycled 100× (16°C for 5 minutes, 37°C for 5 minutes) and then heat inactivated. Golden Gate Assembly products were PCR-purified and eluted into 25 uL of Buffer EB (QIAGEN). Eluates were drop-dialyzed against 30 mL of water for 1 hr and transformed (Lucigen E. cloni 10G ELITE electrocompetent cells). Transformed cells were recovered in 1 mL Lucigen recovery media at 37°C for 1 hr and the entire volume of outgrowth was used to inoculate 50 mL LB + kanamycin cultures, which we grew at 30°C overnight. The following day, we midi-prepped these cultures via alkaline lysis (QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Midi-Prep Kit). This first cloning step enabled generation of intermediate products, which contained any wild-type <italic>rep</italic> sequence upstream of the mutated oligo followed by the mutant oligo. In this step, all wild-type sequences downstream of the mutant oligo were removed.</p><p>To reintroduce these missing wild-type sequences, we used a second round of Golden Gate Assembly and the internal BbsI sites present in each oligo. Before performing Golden Gate Assembly, we ran rolling circle amplification on our intermediate cloning products. Then, 10 ng of the intermediate plasmid products were incubated with 10 uM random hexamer primers and 1× phi29 DNA polymerase buffer (NEB) at 95°C for 3 min and then cooled to room temperature. We then mixed these samples with rolling circle amplification solution (10 uM random hexamers, 1× phi29 DNA polymerase buffer, 5 U phi29 DNA polymerase, 1 mM dNTPs, 2 mg/mL recombinant albumin, 0.02 U inorganic pyrophosphatase) at a 1:1 ratio and incubated them at 30°C overnight. The resulting rolling circle amplification products were directly digested with BbsI-HF, DpnI, and recombinant shrimp alkaline phosphatase (all NEB) at 37°C overnight. The following day, we ran the digest products on 1% Tris-acetate EDTA gels and extracted and purified the correctly sized products (QIAGEN QIAQuick Gel Extraction Kit). In parallel, we PCR-amplified the missing downstream wild-type sequences for each tile from the backbone vectors; the primers used here also added BbsI sites. We ran Golden Gate Assembly with the rolling circle amplification digest products and vector PCR products, BbsI-HF (NEB), and T4 DNA Ligase (NEB), cycling as described above. Golden Gate Assembly products were transformed and midi-prepped as above. This second cloning step resulted in plasmids containing a full-length <italic>rep</italic> gene with a single-codon mutation followed by a 20-nucleotide barcode. WT AAV2 library plasmids also contained a wild-type copy of the AAV2 <italic>cap</italic> gene between the variant <italic>rep</italic> genes and barcodes.</p><p>To enable packaging of variant <italic>rep</italic> sequences into AAV capsids, the step 2 cloning products were moved into inverted terminal repeat-containing vectors. Step 2 cloning products were subject to rolling circle amplification as above and digested with XbaI, SphI-HF, and EcoRV-HF. The <italic>rep</italic> and/or <italic>cap</italic> open-reading frames in the backbone vectors were flanked by XbaI and SphI sites. EcoRV sites were part of the synthesized oligos and should only be present in step 1 cloning products. Digest products were gel extracted and ligated into inverted terminal repeat-containing vectors. In the case of the WT AAV2 format library, the inverted terminal repeat vector contained the p5 promoter and endogenous AAV2 polyA sequence. In the case of the Rep78/68 and Rep52/40 libraries, the inverted terminal repeat vector contained a CMV promoter, WPRE, and bGH polyA sequence. The integrity of the inverted terminal repeat destination plasmids was confirmed by SmaI digest and complete plasmid sequencing (MGH DNA Core).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viral library production assay</title><p>HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and seeded in five-layer cell culture multi-flasks (Corning 353144) at 8 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/flask 2 d prior to transfection.

The following day, any precipitate was removed by pipetting and the remaining volume was passed through a sterile 0.22 um PES filter.

The following day, we centrifuged samples at 3000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to pellet the PEG-precipitated virus. Supernatants were discarded and pellets resuspended in 8 mL of DPBS. We then digested samples with a 1:10,000 dilution benzonase (MilliporeSigma 1.101695.0001) at 37°C for 45 min and subjected them to iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ogden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zolotukhin et al., 1999</xref>).

Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBST for 1 hr at 4°C. Blots were then incubated with a 1:250 dilution of B1 anti-VP antibody or a 1:100 dilution of anti-Rep 303.9 antibody (both American Research Products) in blocking buffer overnight. Both primary antibody mixtures also included a 1:20,000 dilution of anti-β-actin antibody (Abcam). The following day, blots were washed 3× with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr in blocking buffer with 0.01% SDS. Goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (LI-COR) and donkey anti-rabbit IRDye 680RD (LI-COR) secondary antibodies were used.

The key experiment involved the creation of all possible single codon mutations of the AAV2 rep gene in a barcoded format, transfection of the library into HEK293T cells for production of AAV, and sequencing to see which rep variants were enriched in the viral particles produced from the library. As the library rep variants were flanked by inverted terminal repeats for packaging into viral particles, the authors could use high-throughput sequencing of the barcodes to determine how much each rep variant supported the production of AAV. The rep gene libraries were cleverly made through a cloning process that ensured each mutant was attached to an exactly known 20nt barcode included in each mutagenic oligo (and subsequently moved to the end of the library genes by another cloning step). This allowed the authors to confidently observe nearly all rep variants in their experiments, resulting in a comprehensive map between Rep protein variants and AAV production. The overall map should act as a useful guide for AAV engineering. Not only did certain variants improve AAV production by ~2-fold and show generality across AAV capsid serotypes, the map might be used to predict greater effects through combinations of mutations, especially if augmented by natural evolutionary datasets and statistical learning.</p><p>In interpreting the results of this study, the reader should bear in mind that what has been measured and validated in high throughput is the production of intact genome-containing AAVs. The authors also successfully show transduction for selected high production variants. This is important as the efficiency by which an AAV preparations transduce cells is most relevant property for gene therapy.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-executed and well-analyzed study. The results support the conclusions and claims of the work. I see this work as a useful resource for engineering recombinant AAVs to increase their production, which should have broad impact as the use of AAVs in gene therapy grows.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87730.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The study by Jain et al. on recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) represents a valuable contribution to the fields of virus genetics and gene therapy. As non-pathogenic vectors, rAAVs have become a popular choice for delivering gene therapies. The authors have previously investigated the effects of all possible single codon substitutions, deletions, and insertions in the AAV2 cap gene on AAV production. In this study, they extend their analysis to the AAV2 rep gene and rep genes in two additional capsid serotypes, establishing a genotype-phenotype landscape that enhances our understanding of Rep protein function and offers potential strategies for improving Rep function in gene therapy applications. The experimental design is rigorous, the analyses well-executed, and the interpretations of the data are convincing. While I have a few suggestions to further refine the study, I believe it is overall an excellent piece of research.</p><p>One aspect that may warrant further consideration is the assumption, as mentioned in Figure 2's legend, that synonymous mutations are neutral and can serve as controls for normalizing the production rate. However, Figures S5-6 and Figures S11-12 suggest that synonymous mutations are not necessarily neutral, as their distribution is similar to that of nonsynonymous mutations. Thus, it may be beneficial to more thoroughly examine the potential effects of synonymous mutations on the genotype-phenotype landscape.</p><p>Additionally, previous research by Jeff Collar and others has reported that synonymous mutations can affect mRNA levels through mRNA degradation rate. It would be interesting to determine if the 20-bp barcodes located at the 3' end are positioned within the untranslated regions and could thus be employed to quantify the mRNA levels of individual variants. This information could offer insight into another potential mechanism by which single codon mutations impact the production rate of rAAV.</p><p>The authors discovered several novel mutations that enhance AAV production yet are absent in natural occurrences. This intriguing finding could benefit from further elaboration, particularly with regard to the distribution of these mutations within the protein structure and the nature of the amino acid transitions involved. It would also be informative if the authors could provide a brief discussion as to why these mutations have not been observed in nature. For instance, could it be that optimal viral fitness necessitates an intermediate production rate rather than an excessively rapid one? Expanding on these points may further enrich the paper and offer valuable insights for readers.</p><p>The authors have taken commendable steps to address the concerns I raised in my previous evaluation. They have provided comprehensive clarifications, performed necessary revisions, and expanded upon certain key points in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87730.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Nina K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston, MA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ogden</surname><given-names>Pierce J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston, MA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Church</surname><given-names>George M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston, MA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Thank you for overseeing the assessment of our manuscript, “Comprehensive mutagenesis maps the effect of all single codon mutations in the AAV2 rep gene on AAV production&quot;. We would also like to thank the reviewers for their feedback. We have carried out the suggested experiments that we feel are most central to our conclusions and summarized the revisions to the manuscript below.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion with regards to testing different rAAV genomes. We have measured the effect of Rep variants on the production of rAAV containing three additional genomes: a 4.4 kb single-stranded genome, a 3.9 kb single-stranded genome, and a 2.1 kb self-complementary genome (Figures 5C and 5D). The DNase-resistant particles titers - reported as a percent of wild-type Rep titers - are relatively consistent across these three constructs as well as the 5.0 kb single-stranded genome previously tested.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that measurement of the relative transduction efficiency of rAAV produced with different Rep variants is an important experiment to conduct. To address this, we transduced HEK293T cells with rAAVs, containing a luciferase genome, which were produced using two different Rep variants. When a constant volume of purified rAAV was used for transduction, we observed that the rAAV produced with the S110R Rep variant resulted in higher transduction than rAAV produced with wild-type Rep (as measured by luciferase signal). While we tested only a small number of variants, these results indicate that at least one of the Rep variants we identified can increase not only the viral genome titer but also the titer of transducing particles.</p><p>To generate this transduction data, we produced additional rAAV preps using S110R and Q439T Rep variants. In the previous version of this manuscript, we used the Q439T variant to produce rAAV and noted a 10% increase in the ratio of viral genomes: capsids as determined by comparison of qPCR and capsid ELISA titers. However, a similar increase was not observed in the more recent experiment discussed above. We attribute this discrepancy to changes in the plasmid quantification methods used for transfection. Previously, we quantified plasmids using a fluorometric assay (Qubit); in our more recent experiments, we used qPCR to quantify plasmids for transfection. qPCR provides a more accurate measurement of plasmid concentration due to the specific nature of the primers and probes used, which may account for the subtle shift in quantification. While outside the scope of the current work, it will also be interesting to further investigate the proportion of full capsids using additional Rep variants and more direct methods, such as cryoEM or analytical ultracentrifugation.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ observation that there are differences in the production fitness values for synonymous variants. However, the variation in production fitness values between synonymous variants is smaller than that between non-synonymous variants. We conducted the following analysis to clarify this point. We calculated two mean centered fitness values for each codon variant in the WT AAV2 library. The “positional mean centered fitness value” was determined using the production fitness values of all variants at a given amino acid position and describes how far a given fitness value diverges from the mean fitness value for that position. The “synonymous codon mean centered fitness value” was determined using the production fitness values of all synonymous variants at a given position and describes how far a given fitness value diverges from the mean fitness value for all its synonymous codon variants. We then plotted both mean centered fitness values versus amino acid position (Figure S8).</p><p>The distribution of mean centered selection values is narrower when calculated at the synonymous codon level as opposed to the position level. This indicates that, in general, synonymous variants have more tightly distributed production fitness values than non-synonymous variants. This observation precludes us from conducting a more thorough analysis of the effects of synonymous codons on AAV production. (Although, there is at least one instance where clear differences between synonymous codons can be observed (Figure S9C and Figure S9D).) We agree with the reviewers that synonymous variants almost certainly influence aspects of AAV production, such as genome replication, transcriptional regulation, mRNA stability, and protein expression. However, our assay measures the aggregate effect of rep variants on all steps in the AAV production process and is likely unable to detect the effects of synonymous variants on specific steps in this process if those steps are not rate-limiting. We have updated the discussion section to include an explanation of the above.</p><p>The X-axes in Figures 5B and 5D have been updated to plot s’ instead of percent WT titer. We have also added asterisks to indicate significance in Figures 5A and 5C. Thank you for these suggestions.</p><p>We agree with Reviewer 3 that it would be interesting to sequence barcodes from the mRNA pool. The 20 bp barcodes are located upstream of the polyA site and should be present in mRNA transcripts. Something to consider is that AAV2 transcripts expressed from all three promoters (p5, p19, and p40) are polyadenylated at the same site (Stutika et al., 2016). As such, in our WT AAV2 library, barcode representation in the mRNA pool would indicate the aggregate effect of a rep variant on the levels of all AAV2 transcripts. In the pCMV-Rep78/68 library, only two AAV2 transcripts are generated - a spliced and unspliced version of the p5 product. Sequencing of barcodes present in the mRNA pool could be informative regarding the effect of rep variants on combined Rep78/68 expression levels. However, we feel that this experiment is outside the scope of the current work.</p><p>We were also surprised at the number of novel functional Rep variants that were identified in our library. As the reviewer pointed out, optimal rAAV production likely does not equate to optimal fitness of naturally occurring AAV in the endogenous host. Naturally occurring AAV has both a latent and a lytic cycle and the Rep proteins play a role in both these processes (Pereira et al., 1997; Surosky et al., 1997). rAAV production, however, is primarily analogous to the lytic cycle of naturally occurring AAV. In their endogenous hosts, AAV must balance the effect of any mutations on fitness in both the lytic and latent contexts while we assay specifically for production fitness. We additionally attribute this finding to the relatively small number of AAV serotypes, for which rep sequences are available. We have added a discussion of the above to the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, in response to feedback from other researchers, we determined which amino acid substitutions resulted in production fitness values that were significantly different from that of wild-type (Figure S4). These results further emphasized the importance of the origin-binding domain; most statistically significant beneficial substitutions clustered here. Additionally, we noted that the majority of substitutions in the zinc-finger domain resulted in production fitness changes that were not significant. This lines up with previous work indicating that the zinc-finger domain is dispensable for rAAV production. We have added a discussion of these results to the main text.</p><p>We again thank the reviewers for their suggestions; we feel that incorporation of their suggestions has strengthened support for our conclusions and enhanced the utility of this work for others in the field.</p><p>ReferencesPereira, D.
