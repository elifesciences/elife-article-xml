However, it is repeatedly reported that being observed by others tends to make people act more riskily. We hypothesized that this discrepancy arises from individuals’ belief that others prefer riskier choices than they do. To examine this hypothesis, we used a gambling task where on some trials, individuals were informed that their choices would be observed by a risk-averse or seeking partner. Most important, individuals were given chances to learn each partner’s preference beforehand. As expected, individuals initially believed that partners would make relatively riskier choices than they would. Against two alternative explanations, we found that individuals simulated partners’ choices and weighed these simulated choices in making their own choices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that decision probabilities adjusted with the simulated partners’ choices were represented in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Moreover, individual differences in the functional connectivity between the TPJ and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) were explained by the interaction between model-estimated social reliance and sensitivity to social cues in the dmPFC. These findings provide a neuromechanistic account of how being observed by others affects individuals’ decision-making, highlighting the roles of the dmPFC and TPJ in simulating social contexts based on individuals’ beliefs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>People, especially adolescents, often act differently around their peers than around their parents, and tend to take more risks when they are with peers. People usually copy the behavior of others and make similar choices. But previous research suggests that humans are also likely to take more risks when others observe them. Scientists think that making decisions could be influenced by what people think they know or believe about other people’s preferences.</p><p>Seon and Chung tested the hypothesis that people are influenced by both the choices of peers and by their beliefs about the preferences of those around them. To examine this, they designed an experiment in which participants made decisions while being observed by one of two different partners. Before the experiment began, participants had the chance to observe each partner’s decisions and thereby learn that one tended to take risks while the other preferred to play it safe. By analyzing both their choices and their brain scan data, they investigated whether people adjusted their decisions depending on the observing partners' preferences.</p><p>Before learning about the preferences of others, participants thought that anonymous observers would choose riskier options than they themselves would. Through repeated observation, however, they discovered which partner tended to take more risks and which tended to play it safe. This led participants to adjust their own choices depending on which partner was watching.</p><p>Computational modeling showed that people were not simply copying the observer’s behavior. Instead, they mentally simulated what the partner would have done in the same situation, based on what they had learned, and let these predictions guide their decisions. Brain scans revealed that two brain regions involved in social cognition – and the strength of the connection between these regions – explained individual differences in how much people relied on these predictions when making choices.</p><p>These regions, the temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, are often referred to as the social brain and are thought to play a key role in the mental simulation of other people’s intentions. People who relied more on their own predictions about observers showed greater sensitivity in these regions. The connection between the regions increased or decreased depending on whether a partner was observing.</p><p>This study suggests that our choices are shaped by what we think an observer would do. These insights help explain everyday behaviors, such as why people post differently on social media when they expect certain reactions, or why opinions change in group settings. Such knowledge can shed light on social pressure and online influence. Still, because real-life situations are much more complex, further research in natural social environments is needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social influence</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>computational modeling</kwd><kwd>belief</kwd><kwd>simulation of others' choices</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2024-00420674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Dongil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018749</institution-id><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24-BR-03-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Dongil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simulating others' preferences underlies riskier choices when being observed, driven by beliefs about observers' risk attitudes and supported by TPJ–dmPFC connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well-known that individuals often make choices differently around social others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Hogg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guassi Moreira et al., 2018</xref>). Although the most commonly observed social influence is to conform with the choices observed from social others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardin and Higgins, 1996</xref>), another line of research has shown that the mere presence of social others biases individuals’ choices to become riskier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardner and Steinberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haddad et al., 2014</xref>). This unidirectional behavioral bias was particularly observed in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ciranka and van den Bos, 2019</xref>), and thus previous studies largely focused on the characteristics observed in adolescents (e.g. heightened social sensitivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert and Steinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foulkes and Blakemore, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lundborg, 2006</xref>) and developmental imbalance between reward sensitive system and cognitive control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Somerville et al., 2010</xref>) to explain why being under this type of social context (presence of social others) affects decision-makers in a seemingly different manner. However, recent studies showed that the unidirectional influence of social others’ presence can also be observed in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otterbring, 2021</xref>), and that the extent of this influence depends on the observer’s identity—specifically, whether the observer is a parent or a peer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Hoorn et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that besides the neurodevelopmental characteristics, there exists an active processing of information about the social context which determines how individuals respond to others’ presence. Expanding this perspective, it can be inferred that the beliefs individuals have about social others, which can be changed and established by learning, may have a crucial role in determining the direction of social influence. Yet, this hypothesis about the impacts of social others’ presence has not been explicitly tested.</p><p>To examine how individuals’ beliefs about social observers affect their decisions about risky options, we used a three-phased gambling task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which 43 healthy participants (male/female = 25/18, age = 21.35 ± 2.42; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) made choices between a safe option (i.e. guaranteed payoff) and a risky option. In the first phase of the task (‘Solo phase’), individuals were asked to make a series of gambling choices alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In the second phase (‘Learning phase’), individuals were asked to predict gamble choices of the two random partners who were introduced as previously participated players whose choices were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and f</xref>). This phase was expected to provide individuals to learn about the two partners where unbeknownst to participants, one partner was set to be risk-averse and the other partner was set to be risk-seeking (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for the partners’ preferences). In the third phase (‘Observed phase’), individuals were given the same set of gamble choices they faced in the Solo phase, each pair of gambles iterated three times in total, but all shuffled in a random order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Critically, on some trials, individuals were told that their choices would be used for one of the partners’ Learning phase. In this way, we implemented two types of trials where the choices would be observed by the partners (Risk- averse and seeking observer trials) and one type of trials where the choices would be made alone (No observer trials). By examining individuals’ choice patterns in the Learning phase, we aimed to examine the impacts of observers on individuals’ risky decision-making.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental paradigm.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The task comprised three phases: Solo, Learning, and Observed phases.

(<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) During the Learning phase, participants were introduced to two random partners and asked to predict their choices. Unbeknownst to participants, one partner had risk-aversive (Risk-averse partner) and the other partner had risk-tolerant (Risk-seeking partner) preferences. To help partner identification, each partner was labeled with an alphabet letter (A or B) and color-coded (counterbalanced). On each trial, an agent identifier that indicates the identity of the predicted partner was presented on the center of the screen. (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>g</bold>) During the Observed phase, participants were asked to make the same type of gamble choices as the Solo phase. Critically, at the beginning of some trials (‘Observer trial’), participants were informed that their choice on the corresponding trial would be later used in the Learning phase for one of the two assigned partners. On these Observer trials, the identity of the designated partner on each trial was presented as an avatar observing through an open door. ‘No observer trials’, the trials at which individuals’ choices will not be presented to any partners, were informed with a vacant open door.

For example, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is known to encode social information not specific to valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amodio and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Overwalle, 2009</xref>), but also known to encode value signals estimated in perspectives of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruff and Fehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wittmann et al., 2016</xref>). Such neural instantiation of social valuation is dissociable from the patterns observed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which is a region known to track both the subjective valuations of non-social monetary rewards and the combined values of their own preferences with their preferences for (or aversion to) social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amodio and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hare et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Overwalle, 2009</xref>). The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is another region known to play an important role in a range of social cognitive functions, including simulating others’ intention and choices, as well as learning about others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boorman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charpentier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Overwalle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Young et al., 2010</xref>). Corroborating these neuroimaging findings, excitatory stimulation of the TPJ improved social cognition involving the control of self-other representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santiesteban et al., 2012</xref>), while TPJ dysfunctions in psychiatric patients (e.g. schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder) were associated with their social impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Barch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lombardo et al., 2011</xref>). Previously, it was shown that when others’ choices were revealed, this network of brain regions is involved in inferring others’ intentions and using the social information in the process of decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang and Gläscher, 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that, even in the absence of explicit information about others’ choices, the mere presence of social others could lead participants to conform to the option they believe others would choose. To do so, participants would need to simulate others’ potential choices, particularly when option values vary across trials. As a result, we propose that the same brain regions involved in simulating others’ decisions would also be engaged during value-based decision-making in the presence of social observers.</p><p>To test our hypotheses, we scanned a subset of 30 participants (male/female = 16/14, age = 21.77 ± 2.16; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) and used a computational modeling approach in conjunction with neuroimaging to investigate the mechanisms via which the presence of social observer affects individuals’ decision processes. Behaviorally, we first tested whether individuals successfully learned partners’ choice preferences and then investigated whether their decisions, made under the belief of being observed by others, could be accounted for by a combination of their own preferences and the simulated choice tendencies of the observers. Neurally, we predicted that the choices made under social observation would be signaled both in the valuation-association regions (vmPFC, dmPFC) and the region associated with social inference (TPJ). Our results provide neural and behavioral evidence for a role of social observers in affecting individuals’ decisions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individuals initially believe that others would make riskier choices than they would</title><p>As the main purpose of the current study, we aimed to investigate the impacts of two different observing partners, each of whom has different risk preferences, on individuals’ risky decision-making.

However, the underlying mechanisms proposed have varied depending on how the social information was presented. For example, when the choices of social others were explicitly revealed, observing the choices added additional utilities on the options chosen by others and swayed individuals to follow others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2020</xref>). On the contrary, when individuals were given the chance to learn about one other player’s risk preference, without being explicitly shown her/his choices, their own preferences tended to shift closer to the learned preferences of the other player, ultimately leading to more similar choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). Here, similar to the latter case, participants did not see what others chose. However, the current study differed from both previous cases in that individuals were informed that their choices would be observed by others whose preferences they had previously learned.</p><p>We hypothesized that if individuals are sensitive to the learned preferences of the observing partner, they would use this information to simulate the partner’s likely choices, rather than simply aligning their own preferences with those of the partner. To test our hypothesis, we constructed a computational model assuming that individuals mix their choice tendencies based on their own preferences and the simulated choice tendencies derived from the perceived (or belief about) preferences of the observing partner. Specifically, we estimated a ‘Social reliance’ parameter (ω) that accounts for the extent to which the simulated choice tendencies of others (Prob<sub>Partner</sub>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) contribute to individuals’ decisions (Prob(risky) = (1 – ω) Prob<sub>Own</sub> + ω Prob<sub>Partner</sub>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>; see Materials and methods for details).

To examine this hypothesis, we conducted another PPI analysis where the TPJ was set as a seed region and the target region was the dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> cluster identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> (see Materials and methods for details).

That is, particularly for individuals who relied strongly on other observers’ preferences, TPJ-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity was significantly stronger under others’ observation than when making choices alone. Consistent with previous findings on the TPJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boorman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charpentier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Young et al., 2010</xref>), our model-based analyses indicate that the TPJ plays a key role in inferring others' behavior and using that information to make individuals’ own decisions.</p><p>Supporting the role of the TPJ-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity in social information processing, the association between individuals’ social reliance and the connectivity was mediated by the extent to which individuals responded to the initial social cue (dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub>-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity, mediation effect: <italic>β</italic>=0.32, p=0.0016; see Materials and methods for the mediation analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This links our model-based and neuroimaging results. Our data suggest that individuals who were predisposed to rely on belief about others’ choices were more sensitive to the social cue, and that individuals who exhibited higher dmPFC sensitivity to social cue showed stronger TPJ-dmPFC connectivity in processing social information. Together, our results suggest that the dmPFC has a critical role in relaying both social and non-social valuation information for final decision-making processes. Given that our sample size is smaller than the recommended threshold for detecting mediation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fritz and MacKinnon, 2007</xref>), this significant indirect effect should be interpreted with caution, particularly with respect to causal inference.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Being around social others is known to affect how individuals behave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Hogg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cikara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guassi Moreira et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we developed a novel experiment where individuals made risky choices under the observation of social others after learning about their risk preferences. Individuals did not always act riskier under social observation, but rather tended to adjust their choices toward the direction they believed the observing partner would prefer. By using a computational model-based approach, we showed that the choice tendencies simulated based on the belief about the observer’s preference contribute to individuals’ decision-making processes. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how the presence of social observers influences individuals’ decision-making processes.</p><p>Observational learning and mimicry of others’ behavior are patterns commonly found in social animals, including nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van de Waal et al., 2013</xref>). Such behaviors are thought to be driven either by a motivation to acquire additional information (‘informational conformity’) or by a motivation to align with group norm (‘normative conformity’), even when doing so does not necessarily lead to better outcomes (e.g. higher accuracy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004</xref>). Given that there are no objectively correct or incorrect answers in the gambling task used in our study, the observed social influence is more consistent with normative conformity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that individuals developed false beliefs about a particular observing partner—namely, that the partner had greater control over or insight into the gambling task. Future studies are needed to directly investigate whether individuals’ beliefs about others modulate informational social influence—that is, their motivation to use social information to gain additional insight by inferring others’ potential choices.</p><p>Regardless of the underlying motivation for social influence, its direction is generally expected to be bidirectional, such that individuals may become either more or less averse to an option they originally preferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to this possibility of bidirectional social influence, the presence of social others has been shown to exert a unidirectional effect on individuals' choices, such that particularly among adolescents, who tend to make riskier choices when they are in the presence or under the observation of peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Powers et al., 2018</xref>). The current study suggests that this seemingly contradicting finding may be accounted for by the beliefs individuals hold about social others. Before learning about others, individuals may perceive themselves as decision-makers who make stable and safe choices, and thus, might attempt to make riskier choices when others are watching. However, after explicitly learning about others' preferences, their initially <italic>misplaced</italic> beliefs about others would be adjusted, which can then be incorporated into decision-making processes under social observation. Our computational framework provides an explanation for why and how social influence on individuals’ choices sometimes manifests as a unidirectional shift of their preferences, while at other times, it results in a bidirectional shift. Future studies may directly examine the beliefs of adolescents about their peers and test whether such biased beliefs (e.g. ‘All the cool kids would not be afraid of jumping off the cliff.’) indeed drive their riskier behaviors around peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardner and Steinberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haddad et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By using a computational modeling approach, we were able to delineate the impact of social influence across various cognitive processes embedded during decision-making (e.g. valuation, action selection). Previously, it was suggested that an observation of explicitly presented others’ choices adds value to the option others chose during the process of valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Under social others’ observation, no explicit choice information was provided, and thus we expected that the same mechanism would not explain the influence of social observation. Our data suggest that, as expected, being under social observation does not alter individuals’ valuation of the choice options, but instead alters their decision-making policies to mimic the behavior of others. This result may seem contradictory to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>, a previous study that examined the impact of another type of implicit social information. In the corresponding study, authors suggested that repeated opportunities to predict others’ choices have an effect of swaying individuals’ risk preferences toward the learned preferences of others, a mechanism that we rejected for the current study. We note that such a mechanistic discrepancy is likely due to the differences in task design between the research and ours. Specifically, our study provided a comparable setting for learning about others (the Learning phase herein), but then implemented an additional layer of social influence (i.e. social observation), which was the main social factor we investigated. Our data suggest that individuals who have previously acquired knowledge about the social observer tend to rely on simulated choices which would be made by the observer, leading to a fine shaping of their decision policy.</p><p>Our modeling results were corroborated with the vmPFC response that tracked individuals’ final decision probabilities under social observation. Various decision-making studies suggested that the vmPFC encodes subjective value signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clithero and Rangel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>), which also encompasses the value of social information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2015</xref>) and the expected value across temporal horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iigaya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Na et al., 2021</xref>). Our result expands this view and suggests that the vmPFC tracks individuals’ decision policies (i.e., final decision probabilities), specifically when their choices are adjusted for the extent to which they rely on what social others would do. Typically, individuals’ decisions are tightly linked to their subjective valuation, making it hardly possible to dissociate the representation pattern of one from the other. In the current study, as shown in our Social reliance model, the decision-making process under others’ observation clearly drifts apart from the form of combining information in value level. By separately testing these two possibilities, our neural results provide evidence for an alternative view, suggesting that the vmPFC sometimes takes part in tracking action policies rather than tracking economic values per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayden and Niv, 2021</xref>). Note that this does not rule out the broadly accepted role of the vmPFC as the subjective value encoder, but instead opens the possibility that the brain region may have a more generalizable capacity. Depending on the context, individuals may make (subjective) value-based choices or follow alternative heuristics (e.g. relying on belief about others’ choices). Independent of such specific cognitive processes, the vmPFC may combine information from multiple sources and track individuals’ behavioral intentions.</p><p>Inference about social others is known to recruit a set of brain regions including TPJ and dmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amodio and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boorman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charpentier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruff and Fehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Overwalle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wittmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Young et al., 2010</xref>). Among the so-called ‘Social brain’ regions, previous studies showed that the TPJ is known to take part in theory-of-mind (TOM), the ability to understand others’ intention and to attribute others’ mental states to oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schurz et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the known functional roles of the brain region, particularly when individuals believed others were observing their choices, the TPJ tracked individuals’ decision policies, indicating that the region plays a key role in simulating others’ choices and using that information to make their own decisions. Furthermore, in line with the known roles of the dmPFC in the valuation process when making choices for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sul et al., 2015</xref>) and in processing information obtained from social others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2020</xref>), our results show that the functional communication between the TPJ and dmPFC is crucial for this social simulation.</p><p>The current study provides a mechanistic account for how the presence of others and others’ observing influence individuals’ risky decision-making. Our Social reliance model provides a way in which individuals adjust their choices around others and may explain why adolescents exhibit well-behaved behavior with their parents but are more likely to act out when with their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Hoorn et al., 2018</xref>). When others’ choices are not explicitly provided but rather presented as a context that individuals must infer, their tendency to rely on social information contributes to changes in their actions than changes in valuation. In the modern world, as much as we have means to obtain information about others, almost every choice we make is seen by others. Under this inevitable social environment, taking perspectives of others is largely adaptive and essential ability to empathize with others’ pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Vignemont and Singer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Decety and Lamm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamm et al., 2007</xref>), make prosocial choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckholtz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nook et al., 2016</xref>), and follow social norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rilling and Sanfey, 2011</xref>).

After exclusion, data from 43 participants (male/female = 25/18, age = 21.35 ± 2.42) were used for behavioral analyses, and a subsample of the data (N=30; male/female = 16/14, age = 21.77 ± 2.16; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) were used for neuroimaging analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental procedures</title><p>We developed a novel three-phase gambling task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Throughout the task, participants were asked to make a series of choices between one certain and one risky gamble option. Each option was presented as a pie chart. The certain option was presented as a whole pie, indicating a 100% probability of earning the payoff written on top of the pie. The risky option was divided into two pie pieces, with the size of each piece indicating the probability of earning high- and low-payoffs written on top of each piece. First, 30 sets of gambles were generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). The gamble set was created with nine unique risky options, combining high-payoffs of 25, 48, and 90 with probabilities of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75, as in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2017</xref>).

In addition, one additional set of gambles was added with the largest expected value difference (EV difference = 38.5). Two sets of gambles were added as ‘catch trials’ (to ensure participants’ attention) where the payoff of the certain option was larger than the high-payoff of the risky option. Second, 30 sets of gambles were additionally generated in the same manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). Nine unique risky options were created by pairing three levels of high-payoffs (15, 34, and 90) and three probabilities of high-payoff (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). Certain payoffs were set as described above, but they were tailored so that the distribution of the expected value differences between the certain and risky options matched the first 30 sets of gambles.

Unbeknown to the participants, one of the two partners was set to be risk-averse (risk preference = 0.43) and the other to be risk-seeking (risk preference = 1.12; see Partners’ choices and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for details). There were 40 prediction trials (20 trials for each partner) that provided feedback, followed by 20 additional prediction trials (10 trials for each partner) without feedback. The order of the partners to be predicted on each trial was randomized. On the last 20 prediction trials, individuals were asked to report their confidence level on a 10-point Likert scale (1: not confident at all, 10: very confident) after making their choices. At the end of the Learning phase, participants answered eight questions about their impressions of each predicted partner. The questions included likability, trustworthiness, riskiness, attractiveness, competence (metacognition, general academic grades), consistency, and preference similarity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I</xref> for the full list of questions).

To track the changes in individuals’ beliefs about the partners’ risk preferences, we binned their predictions about each partner (window size = 6 trials, overlap = 3 trials) and calculated the proportion of risky choices for each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

First, to investigate brain regions that are sensitive to social cues (or context), we used the dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub> from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> as a seed and [Observer trial – No observer trial] as a psychological factor (see DM4). Specifically, individuals’ BOLD responses were extracted from a 6 mm sphere centered on each individual’s local maxima nearest to the group peak voxel of the dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub> cluster active at p&lt;0.005 (x = –3, y=50, z=14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>), and these time-series were then deconvolved and used as a physiological factor. Second, to examine whether the dmPFC and TPJ interacted during individuals’ decision processes under social observation, we used the TPJ from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> as a seed and [Observer trial – No observer trial] as a psychological factor (see DM4). Given that the bilateral TPJ represented Prob(chosen) in the Observed phase, the left and the right TPJ were used for two separate PPI analyses, respectively (rTPJ: [x=63, y = –40, z=17], lTPJ: [x = –54, y = –37, z=14]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). The dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> cluster from the result of the first PPI analysis (x=3, y=50, z=5, <italic>k</italic><sub>E</sub> = 74; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>) was set as the target region. For the second-level regression, we added individuals’ Social reliance parameter as a covariate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Mediation analyses</title><p>To examine whether the positive association between TPJ-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity and individuals’ social reliance (log-transformed Social reliance estimates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>) was mediated by the dmPFC’s sensitivity to social cues (dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub>-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), we conducted mediation analyses using an R package <italic>mediation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tingley et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, each individual’s log-transformed Social reliance parameter was used as a predictor, dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub>-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity was used as a mediator, and TPJ-dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> connectivity was set as an outcome. Two separate mediation models were tested, with the outcome being the functional connectivity between the dmPFC and either the left or the right TPJ. The significance of the effects was assessed using a non-parametric bootstrapping method with 5000 samples, and an alpha level of 0.05 was applied to determine statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants provided written informed consent.

The manuscript is much improved and will make an important contribution to the literature. I have one remaining clarification. My request was for the authors to speculate in the discussion about lifespan differences in susceptibility to social influence, because the paper talks about how observing others' choices makes people riskier. I think it is important to explicitly acknowledge in the discussion that the sample tested was young adults, and it may be that the effects they observe are not the same in adolescents or older adults, as suggested in recent work (e.g. Reiter et al., 2019 Nat Comms, Su et al., 2024, Comms Psych). This is important to qualify general statements about how humans behave when observing others' risky decisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102228.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seon</surname><given-names>HeeYoung</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ulsan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Dongil</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ulsan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Seon and Chung's study investigates the hypothesis that individuals take more risks when observed by others because they perceive others to be riskier than themselves.

First, the term &quot;social inference&quot; is used very loosely. In line 103 the authors mentioned that TPJ has been reported to be involved in inferring other's intentions and learning about others. However, in their task, it is not clear where inference is needed. All participants need to do is recall others' &quot;preferences&quot;, rather than inferring a hidden variable or hidden intention. In addition, in some of the studies that the authors have cited (e.g., Park et al. 2021), the hippocampus is the focus of the inference, which gets no mention here.</p></disp-quote><p>How does solving this task require inference (as defined by the authors: inferring others' intentions)? And why do they choose TPJ while inference is not needed in this task?</p><p>We regret any confusion and would like to take this chance to clarify our hypothesis on social inference. As the reviewer pointed out, participants were indeed instructed to predict their choices, through which we expected them to learn the demonstrators’ preferences. Our computational model suggests that during the main phase of the task, i.e., the Observed phase, participants simulated others’ choices based on these previously learned risk preferences of others. The gamble choices they encountered (payoffs and associated probabilities) did not overlap with those in the Learning phase, and therefore, we expected that the cognitive process triggered by the social context involved active simulation—what we describe as making inference about others—rather than simple ‘recall’ of previously learned information. In line with this reasoning, we hypothesized that the TPJ, a brain region previously implicated in simulating others’ actions and intentions, would play a key role during the Observed phase.</p><p>Regarding the role of the hippocampus, the paper we cited by BoKyung Park et al. (2021), titled “The role of right temporoparietal junction in processing social prediction error across relationship contexts”, highlights the involvement of the rTPJ but does not mention the hippocampus. We are aware of the study by Seongmin A. Park et al. (2021), “Inferences on a multidimensional social hierarchy use a grid-like code”, which shows the involvement of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in making inferences about multidimensional social hierarchies; we believe the reviewer may have mistakenly assumed that we cited this article. As the study showed, the involvement of the hippocampus—and the use of its grid-like representation of social information—is likely tied to the multidimensional nature of task states. In our study, the hippocampus was not included as an ROI because we had no specific rationale to hypothesize that such grid-like representations would be recruited by our task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Social influence can be motivated informationally (to improve accuracy) or normatively (to be aligned with others). To me, it seems that the authors have studied the latter, because, first, there is no objectively correct response in this task and second, because participants changed their risk preference according to the preference of the observing partner. This distinction has not been made throughout the manuscript. This is important because the two process (information and normative) are supported by different neural processes and it is extremely useful to understand neural basis of which process the authors are studying.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify the anticipated role of social influence in our study. As the reviewer pointed out, the gambling task used in our task does not have objectively correct or incorrect answers, and naturally, any social influence present during the task would align with normative social influence. To clarify this point, we have revised the discussion section as follows:</p><p>[Page 9, Line 345]</p><p>Observational learning and mimicry of others’ behavior are patterns commonly found in social animals, including nonhuman primates (Van de Waal et al., 2013). Such behaviors are thought to be driven either by a motivation to acquire additional information (‘informational conformity’) or by a motivation to align with group norm (‘normative conformity’), even when doing so does not necessarily lead to better outcomes (e.g., higher accuracy) (Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004). Given that there are no objectively correct or incorrect answers in the gambling task used in our study, the observed social influence is more consistent with normative conformity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that individuals developed false beliefs about a particular observing partner—namely, that the partner had greater control over or insight into the gambling task. Future studies are needed to directly investigate whether individuals’ beliefs about others modulate informational social influence—that is, their motivation to use social information to gain additional insight by inferring others’ potential choices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) From Line 160 onward, the authors report several findings without providing any effect sizes or statistics. Please add effect size and statistics for each finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now added the corresponding effect sizes and statistical values for the reported findings, beginning from Line 160 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 270: &quot;In particular, bilateral TPJ, brain regions not implicated in the Solo phase, positively tracked trial-by-trial model-estimated decision probabilities&quot;. How can the authors conclude that TPJ is not involved in the solo phase? As far as I understood from the text, TPJ was not included as one of the ROIs for analysis of the Solo phase. If it was included, it should be mentioned in the text and there should be a direct comparison between the effect sizes of the solo and the observer phase. If not, &quot;not implicated in the Solo phase&quot; is not justified and should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, the TPJ was not included among the ROIs in our analysis of the Solo phase data; therefore, its involvement during the Solo phase was never directly assessed using an ROI-based approach.</p><p>To examine brain responses during the Observed phase, we first assessed whether regions that tracked decision probabilities during the Solo phase—vmPFC, vStr, and dACC—were also engaged in the Observed phase. The involvement of the TPJ during the Observed phase was revealed through a subsequent whole-brain analysis. To clarify this point, we now have revised the corresponding part as follows:</p><p>[Page 8, Line 276]</p><p>In particular, bilateral TPJ positively, brain regions not implicated in the Solo phase, tracked trial-by-trial model-estimated decision probabilities</p><p>à Notably, bilateral TPJ showed significant positive tracking of decision probabilities ~</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I am a bit puzzled about the PPI analysis. Is the main finding increased connectivity within mPFC in the observing condition? PPI is often done between two separate brain regions. I am not sure what it means that connectivity within mPFC increases in one condition compared to another. What was the motivation for this analysis? Can you also please explain what it means?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses examine functional connectivity between brain regions as modulated by a psychological factor. To clarify our result, the reported ‘mPFC-mPFC connectivity’ refers to functional connectivity between the mPFC region responsive to the presence of an observing partner and an adjacent, anatomically distinct region within the mPFC. Note that we have revised the manuscript to refer to this region more specifically as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Please see our response to Reviewer 3, Comment 1, for further details.</p><p>During the Observed phase of our task, social information was processed at two distinct time points. First, at the beginning of each decision trial, individuals were cued with the presence (or absence) of an observing partner (‘Partner presentation’). Second, the gamble options, as well as the observing partner’s identity, were revealed (‘Options revealed’). Because participants had previously learned about the observing partner’s risk preferences, we expected them to simulate the choice the partner would likely make. We hypothesized that if individuals indeed simulated the partner’s choice and incorporated this information into their decision-making process, the brain region involved in recognizing the partner’s presence (dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub>) would be functionally connected to the region responsible for integrating social information into the final decision (TPJ). Our results showed that the two regions were functionally connected via an indirect path through an anatomically adjacent cluster within the mPFC (dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub>). Given that the recognition of the partner’s presence and the simulation of their choice occurred at two distinct time points, we interpreted the functional connectivity between the two dmPFC clusters (dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub> and dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub>) as evidence that the dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub> remained engaged during the decision process to support simulation, rather than being involved solely in the passive recognition of the social context (i.e., observed vs not observed). Note that, consistent with this interpretation, functional connectivity was stronger in individuals who showed greater reliance on social information ('Social reliance' parameter in our model).</p><p>To avoid confusion, we have now labeled the two dmPFC clusters as dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub>—the seed region identified at partner presentation—and dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub>—the target region identified in the PPI analysis.</p><p>[Page 8, Line 284]</p><p>This cue was intended to dissociate neural responses to the social context per se (i.e., the presence of an observing partner), which we hypothesized would initiate social processing, from the neural processes involved in incorporating this information during the subsequent decision-making phase.</p><p>[Page 8, Line 291]</p><p>We tested whether the dmPFC was also involved in incorporating social information during the decision process under social observation, particularly among individuals who relied more heavily on simulating others’ behavior.</p><p>[Page 8, Line 297]</p><p>We confirmed that the functional connectivity between the dmPFC<sub>contrast</sub> which is sensitive to cues regarding the presence of an observing partner, and its adjacent, anatomically distinct region within the dmPFC (‘dmPFC<sub>PPI</sub>’ hereafter; x = 3, y = 50, z = 5, k<sub>E</sub> = .74, cluster-level P<sub>FWE, SVC</sub> = 0.011; Fig. 4a, b, Table S5) was positively associated with individuals’ social reliance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Line 107 the authors say &quot;excitatory stimulation of the TPJ improved social cognition&quot;.

I recommend that the authors provide more detailed evidence of model comparisons in the neuroimaging analysis. This should go beyond simply comparing the goodness of fit of neural activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that neuroimaging data alone often do not provide conclusive evidence for specific information processing. In our study, we examined brain regions that track decision probabilities and are associated with social cognition, such as simulating others’ choice tendencies. Because these processes are general and not tied to a specific computational model, neural responses supporting the occurrence of such processes cannot be used to rule out alternative decision models. For this reason, our approach prioritized a rigorous behavioral model comparison as a critical first step before probing the neural substrates underlying the proposed mechanism. Our behavioral model comparisons, including both quantitative fit indices and qualitative pattern predictions, indicated that the proposed model best accounted for participants' decision patterns across task conditions.</p><p>More importantly, to further validate the model, we conducted a model recovery analysis (see Fig. S2b in SI), which confirmed that our model can be reliably distinguished from alternative accounts even when behavioral differences are subtle. This result suggests that our model captures unique and meaningful characteristics of the decision process that are not equally well explained by competing models.</p><p>With this behavioral foundation, our neuroimaging analyses were designed not to serve as independent model arbiters, but rather to examine whether brain activity in regions of interest reflected the computations specified by the best-fitting model. We believe this two-step approach—first establishing behavioral validity, then linking model-derived variables to neural data—offers a principled framework for identifying the cognitive and neural mechanisms of decision-making.</p><p>Nevertheless, per the reviewer’s suggestion, we further examined whether there is neural encoding of both the participant’s own utility and the observer’s utility—serving as potential neural evidence to differentiate our model from the two alternative models. Please see below for our response to Reviewer 2’s Comment (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Specifically, if participants are combining their own and simulated choices at the level of choice probability, we would expect to see neural encoding of both their own utility and the observer's utility. These may be observed in different areas of the mPFC, as demonstrated by Nicolle et al. (Neuron, 2012). In that study, decisions simulating others' choices were associated with activity in the dorsal mPFC, while one's own decisions were encoded in the vmPFC. On the contrary, if the brain encodes decision values based on the shifted risk preference, rather than encoding each decision's value in separate brain areas, this would support the alternative model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. In our Social reliance model, we assumed that the decision probability based on an individual’s own risk preferences, as well as that based on the observing partner’s risk preferences, both contribute to the individual’s final choice. As the reviewer suggested, neural evidence that differentiates our model from the two alternative models—the Risk preference change model and the Other-conferred utility model—would involve demonstrating neural encoding of both the participant’s own utility and the observer’s utility.</p><p>The utility differences between chosen and unchosen options from the two perspectives—self and observer—were highly correlated, preventing us from including both as regressors in the same design matrix. Instead, we defined ROIs along the ventral-to-dorsal axis of the mPFC, and examined whether each ROI more strongly reflected one’s own utility or that of the observer. Based on the meta-analysis by Clithero and Rangel (2014), we defined the most ventral mPFC ROI (ROI1) as a 10 mm-radius sphere centered at coordinate [x=-3, y=41, z=-7], a region previously associated with subjective value. From this ventral seed, we defined four additional spherical ROIs (10 mm radius each) at 12 mm intervals along the ventral-to-dorsal axis, resulting in five ROIs in total: ROI2 [x=-3, y=41, z=5], ROI3 [x=-3, y=41, z=17], ROI4 [x=-3, y=41, z=29], ROI5 [x=-3, y=41, z=41].</p><p>Consistent with Nicolle et al. (2012), the representation of one’s own utility (labelled as ‘Own subjective value’) and that of the observer (‘Observer’s subjective value’) was organized along the ventral-to-dorsal axis of the mPFC. Specifically, utility signals from the participant’s own perspective (SV<sub>chosen, self</sub> – SV<sub>unchosen, self</sub>) were most prominently represented in the ventral-most ROIs (blue), whereas utility signals from the observer’s perspective (SV<sub>chosen, observer</sub> – SV<sub>unchosen, observer</sub>) were most strongly represented in the dorsal-most ROIs (orange).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Additionally, the authors may be able to detect neural signals related to conflict when the decisions of the individual and the observer differ, compared to when the decisions are congruent. These neural signatures would only be present if social influences are integrated at the choice level, as suggested by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>If individuals simulate the choices that others might make, they may compare them with the choices they would have made themselves. To investigate this possibility, we categorized task trials as Conflict or No-conflict trials based on greedy choice predictions derived from a softmax decision rule. Conflict trials were those in which the choice predicted from the participant’s own risk preference differed from that predicted for the observer, whereas No-conflict trials involved the same predicted choice from both perspectives. A contrast between Conflict and No-conflict trials revealed that the dACC and dlPFC—regions previously associated with conflict monitoring and cognitive control (Shenhav et al., 2013)—were sensitive to differences in choice tendencies between the self and observer perspectives.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>dACC and dlPFC are associated with the discrepancy between participants’ own choice tendencies and those of observing partners, as estimated based on prior beliefs about the partners’ risk preferences.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102228-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As the reviewer suggested, these results provide evidence in support of the Social Reliance model, which posits that participants simulate the observer's choice and integrate it with their own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Incorporating these additional analyses would provide stronger evidence for distinguishing between the models.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for these constructive suggestions.

In our original manuscript, we referred to one region as mPFC in line with prior studies highlighting its role in social cognition and contextual processing (Behrens et al., 2008; Sul et al., 2015; Wittmann et al., 2016). However, in response to the reviewer’s comment and to more clearly distinguish this region from the ventral portion of the mPFC (i.e., vmPFC), which is canonically associated with subjective valuation, we have now revised the manuscript to refer to this region as the dmPFC.

To identify the ROIs, we drew upon both prior literature and results from a term-based meta-analysis using Neurosynth. For each meta-map, we applied an FDR-corrected threshold of p &lt; 0.01 and a cluster extent threshold of k ≥ 100 voxels to identify distinct functional clusters. For each cluster, we constructed a spherical ROI (radius = 10 mm) centered on its center of gravity. Note that for each anatomically distinct brain region, only a single center of gravity was identified and used to define the ROI. The resulting ROIs were subsequently used for small volume correction (SVC) in the second-level fMRI analyses.</p><p>For brain regions associated with decision-making processes, we obtained a meta-analytic activation map associated with the term “decision” from Neurosynth. After applying an FDR-corrected threshold of p &lt; 0.001 and a cluster extent threshold of k ≥ 100 voxels, we identified five distinct clusters: vmPFC [x = -3, y = 38, z = -10]; right vStr [x = 12, y = 11, z = -7]; left vStr [x = -12, y = 8, z = -7]; dACC [x = 3, y = 26, z = 44]; and left Insula [x = -30, y = 23, z = -1]. To identify brain regions involved in decision-making under social observation, we used the Neurosynth meta-map associated with the term “social”, applying the same criteria (FDR p &lt; 0.001, k ≥ 100). This analysis revealed several clusters, including bilateral TPJ: right TPJ [x = 51, y = -52, z = 14]; left TPJ [x = -51, y = -58, z = 17]. To isolate brain regions more specifically associated with social processing rather than valuation, we also constructed a conjunction map using the meta-maps for the terms “social” and “value.” We identified clusters present in the “social” map, but not in the “value” map. This analysis yielded, among others, a cluster in the dmPFC [x = 0, y = 50, z = 14].</p><p>To clarify our ROI analysis methods, we have now revised the manuscript to include more detailed information about the procedures used, as follows:</p><p>[Page 19, Line 746]</p><p>Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. To define ROIs for the neural analyses conducted in the Observed phase, we used significant clusters identified during the Solo phase. Specifically, regions showing significant activation for Prob(chosen) in the DM0 (thresholded at P &lt; 0.001) were selected as ROIs. Three ROI clusters were defined: the vStr (peak voxel at [x = 3, y = 14, z = -10], k<sub>E</sub> = 9), vmPFC (peak voxel at [x = –3, y = 62, z = –13], k<sub>E</sub> = 99), and dACC (peak voxel at [x = 12, y = 32, z = 29], k<sub>E</sub> = 118). These ROIs were then applied in the Observed phase analyses to test whether similar neural representations are also engaged in social contexts.</p><p>Term-based meta-analytic maps from Neurosynth for small volume correction. To reduce the likelihood of false positives arising from random significant activations and to enhance sensitivity within regions of theoretical interest, small volume correction (SVC) was applied using term-based meta-analytic maps from Neurosynth. This approach allows for hypothesis-driven correction by restricting statistical testing to anatomically and functionally defined ROI. Specifically, three meta-analytic maps were generated using Neurosynth’s term-based analyses (Yarkoni et al., 2011), with a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P &lt; 0.01 and a cluster size &gt; 100 voxels. For each resulting cluster, we defined a spherical ROI with a 10 mm radius centered on the cluster’s center of gravity. For each anatomically distinct brain region, only a single center of gravity was identified and used to define the corresponding ROI.</p><p>First, to identify regions encoding final decision probabilities during the Solo phase and enhance sensitivity, we used the meta-map associated with the term “decision” to identify neural substrates of value-based decision-making. This yielded three clusters: vmPFC ([x = -3, y = 38, z = -10]), vStr ([x = 12, y = 11, z = -7]), and dACC ([x = 3, y = 26, z = 44]) (Fig. 3a, S7). Second, to examine social processing during the Observed phase, we used the meta-map associated with the term “social” to identify brain regions typically involved in social cognition. This analysis revealed clusters, including the rTPJ ([x = 51, y = -52, z = 14]) and lTPJ ([x = -51, y = -58, z = 17]) (Fig. 3c, S8a). Third, to define an ROI involved in processing social cues independent of valuation, we used a meta-map associated with “social” but excluding “value”, isolating regions specific to non-valuation-related social cognition. This analysis revealed a cluster, including the dmPFC ([x = 0, y = 50, z = 14]) (Fig. 3d, 4a, S8b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) How did the authors ensure there were enough trials to generate a reliable BOLD signal? The scanned part of the study seems relatively short.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the number of trials and the potential implications for the reliability of the resulting BOLD signals. While we did not conduct formal statistical tests to determine the optimal number of trials, our task design, in general, followed well-established principles in functional neuroimaging. Specifically, we employed a jittered event-related design and used both temporal and dispersion derivatives in the GLM analyses. These strategies are widely recognized for enhancing the efficiency of BOLD signal deconvolution and improving model fit by accounting for inter-subject and inter-regional variability in the hemodynamic response function (HRF). Furthermore, the number of trials per condition in our study was comparable to those reported in previous publications (20-30 trials) that employed similar gambling paradigms to examine individual differences in the neural substrates of value-based decision-making (Chung et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would be helpful to add whether any brain areas survived whole-brain correction.</p></disp-quote><p>No brain regions survived whole-brain correction. Nevertheless, as described in the introduction, we had strong a priori hypotheses. Based on these hypotheses, we defined term-based ROIs using Neurosynth, and conducted small volume correction analyses.

(2024). As noted in our manuscript, all participants in the current study were young adults aged between 18 and 29 years. Given this limited age range, our dataset does not provide sufficient variability to directly examine age-related differences across the lifespan. However, we are planning a follow-up study using the same task with older adult participants, which we believe will provide a valuable opportunity to address this important gap in understanding susceptibility to social influence across the lifespan.</p></body></sub-article></article>
