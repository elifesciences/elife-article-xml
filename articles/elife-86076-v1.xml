animals. In insects, optomotor turning causes the animal to turn in the direction of rotating visual stimuli, thereby reducing retinal slip and stabilizing trajectories through the world. This behavior has formed the basis for extensive dissections of motion vision. Here, we report that under certain stimulus conditions, two <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, including the widely studied <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, can suppress and even reverse the optomotor turning response over several seconds. Such ‘anti-directional turning’ is most strongly evoked by long-lasting, high-contrast, slow-moving visual stimuli that are distinct from those that promote syn-directional optomotor turning. Anti-directional turning, like the syn-directional optomotor response, requires the local motion detecting neurons T4 and T5. A subset of lobula plate tangential cells, CH cells, show involvement in these responses. Imaging from a variety of direction-selective cells in the lobula plate shows no evidence of dynamics that match the behavior, suggesting that the observed inversion in turning direction emerges downstream of the lobula plate. Further, anti-directional turning declines with age and exposure to light. These results show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> optomotor turning behaviors contain rich, stimulus-dependent dynamics that are inconsistent with simple reflexive stabilization responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>visual motion</kwd><kwd>optomotor</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>visual circuits</kwd><kwd>motion estimation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY026555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Damon A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY022638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clandinin</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clandinin</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014037</institution-id><institution>National Defense Science &amp; Engineering Graduate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Minseung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Regina Casper Stanford Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Minseung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Takenaka Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Ryosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Creamer</surname><given-names>Matthew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CAPES Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matos</surname><given-names>Natalia CB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shomar</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When walking flies are shown bright, high-contrast rotating visual stimuli, they begin to turn in the direction opposite the rotation, showing that optomotor turning behavior contains rich, stimulus-dependent dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual navigation requires active mechanisms to stabilize locomotor trajectories through the world. Insects exhibit an optomotor turning response, a behavior in which they rotate their bodies in the direction of visual patterns that rotate about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hassenstein and Reichardt, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Götz and Wenking, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>). This behavior is analogous to optomotor turning responses in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark, 1981</xref>) and the optokinetic response in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koerner and Schiller, 1972</xref>). In insects, this response is thought to be a course stabilizing mechanism that minimizes retinal slip, allowing animals to maintain their trajectory in the face of external or unexpected rotational forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Götz and Wenking, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Götz, 1975</xref>). For instance, if an insect attempts to walk in a straight line, it may slip and turn to the right. From the point of view of the insect, this turn is observed as optic flow rotating to the left. By responding to this leftward optic flow with a leftward turn, the insect can recover its original trajectory.</p><p>In fruit flies, the optomotor response relies on well-characterized circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang and Clandinin, 2018</xref>). Photoreceptor signals are split into parallel ON and OFF pathways in the lamina and medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strother et al., 2014</xref>), which are not direction-selective. These signals provide input to T4 and T5 cells, which compute direction-selective responses along four directions at every point in the fly visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bausenwein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Henning et al., 2022</xref>). The outputs of T4 and T5 cells are then summed across visual space by lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joesch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnhart et al., 2018</xref>). Different LPTCs provide distinct signals about the overall pattern of motion surrounding the fly, and have been linked to head and body movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krapp and Hengstenberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haikala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There have been several reports of flies turning in the direction opposite to what is predicted by the optomotor turning response. In some cases, these counter-intuitive behaviors were observed using periodic stimuli with spatial wavelengths smaller than the receptive field of individual ommatidia, and thus can be accounted for by aliasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Götz, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Götz, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>). Work in a tethered flight simulator showed that when a moving pattern is presented in front of the fly, the animal turned in the direction of the stimulus motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>), as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Götz, 1968</xref>). However, if the moving pattern was presented behind the fly, it attempted to turn in the direction opposite to stimulus motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>). In a different experimental preparation, rotational patterns were presented on a dome around freely walking flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williamson et al., 2018</xref>). Under these conditions, flies generally turned in the direction of motion of the stimulus, but these rotations were often punctuated by brief, large-magnitude saccades in the opposite direction. Similarly, experiments using flight simulators have reported spikes in the torque in the direction opposite the stimulus rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolf and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>). Interestingly, zebrafish have also been observed to turn in the opposite direction of optic flow under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bak-Coleman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that rotational stimuli can elicit strong, consistent anti-directional turning behavior in two drosophilid species, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Drosophila yakuba</italic>. We report that flies respond to high-contrast, high-luminance rotational motion stimuli by first turning in the direction of stimulus motion, and then reversing their trajectory after approximately 1 s, depending on the species. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we characterize the dynamics of this behavior and the stimuli that drive it, showing that it is distinct from prior observations of anti-directional turning. The behavior depends critically on adaptation to back-to-front motion. We use the genetic tools available in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to show that this behavior relies on the motion detecting neurons T4 and T5. Silencing horizontal system (HS) neurons and CH neurons, two wide-field neurons downstream of T4 and T5, resulted in small changes in this complex turning behavior. However, the visually evoked responses of these direction-selective neurons could not account for the anti-directional behavior. Thus, the observed reversal must be mediated by downstream circuitry. Overall, these results show that circuits in the fly generate behaviors that oppose the direction of wide-field visual motion, showing that <italic>Drosophila</italic> turning responses are more complex than a simple stabilizing reflex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anti-directional turning responses to high-contrast stimuli</title><p>Optomotor turning responses are central to gaze stabilization, so we sought to examine this response across different conditions. Many studies have investigated this behavior using stimuli with low contrast, low light intensity, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Götz and Wenking, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>), at a variety of different speeds. However, natural scenes can have relatively high contrast and luminance, and such conditions have been poorly explored in the laboratory. In this experiment, we presented flies with rotational stimuli using high contrast and relatively high luminance.</p><p>We tethered individual female <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> above a freely rotating ball to characterize the optomotor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creamer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As expected, low-contrast, slow-moving sinusoidal gratings caused flies to turn in the same direction as the moving gratings via the classical optomotor turning response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hassenstein and Reichardt, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Götz, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salazar-Gatzimas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2018</xref>). However, when we changed the stimulus to high-contrast sinusoidal gratings (nominal 100% Weber contrast), flies turned in the stimulus direction for approximately 1 s, but then reversed course, and turned in the direction opposite to the stimulus motion for the duration of the stimulus presentation. Because this turning response is in the opposite direction of stimulus and the syn-directional optomotor turning response, we refer to it as anti-directional turning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flies turn opposite to the stimulus direction in high-contrast conditions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) We measured fly turning behavior as they walked on an air-suspended ball.

As contrast increased, the flies turned faster during the first half second of stimulus presentation, reaching a plateau at around 0.5 contrast, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCann and MacGinitie, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heisenberg and Buchner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duistermars et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Fly behavior after the first second of stimulation was more complex. At contrasts between 0 and 0.25, flies turned in the same direction as the stimulus, with faster turning as the contrast increased. When the contrast was greater than 0.25, turning decreased, lowering to no net sustained turning at around 0.8 contrast. Above a contrast of 0.8, flies began to turn in the direction opposite the stimulus.</p><p>These initial experiments took place in the lab of author DAC.

We wondered what aspects of our experimental setup could lead to these behavioral differences. In our experiments, anti-directional turning was strongly linked to display brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). When the mean brightness of the screens was reduced from 100 cd/m<sup>2</sup> to 1 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, we saw no anti-directional turning in 5 s trials (though average optomotor behavior did decrease over the course of the stimulus presentation). When we further reduced the mean brightness to 0.1 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, flies persisted in their optomotor behavior throughout the stimulus presentation. We note that in these low-luminance experiments, low levels of ambient light in the nominally dark experimental rig could also reduce the effective contrast of the stimulus.</p><p>We tested a variety of other factors that might affect anti-directional turning. Anti-directional turning occurred when experiments were run both at hot temperatures and at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). We also observed anti-directional behavior when flies were reared in the dark and on different media. We also tested several other experiment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Flies responded with anti-directional turning to high-contrast stimuli presented at both blue and green wavelengths. We glued fly heads to their thorax to ensure stimuli could not be affected by head movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haikala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), but found no difference between head-fixed and head-free flies. We did find a few factors that modulated anti-directional turning behavior. In particular, rearing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> at 25°C instead of 20°C or testing flies that were 2 weeks old instead of 12–60 hr old both reduced overall turning behavior and eliminated anti-directional turning. In these cases, optomotor turning still decreased over the course of the 5 s, high-contrast trials, but did not reverse. As details of rearing temperature and the age at which behavior tests are run often vary across labs, it is possible that these factors, as well as stimulus brightness, account for the differences between our observations and the previous literature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct spatiotemporal tuning of the anti-directional behavioral response</title><p>To further characterize the anti-directional response, we swept the spatial and temporal frequency of the sinusoidal grating stimulus. Using only Weber contrasts of 1, we compared the early response (first quarter second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) to the late response (after 1 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> always turned in the optomotor direction during the early stimulus response. In this early response, flies turned most vigorously to stimuli with short spatial frequencies (~20° wavelength) and fast temporal frequencies (~8 Hz), in agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2018</xref>). However, during the longer-timescale response to high-contrast stimuli, flies only turned in the optomotor direction at very high temporal frequencies (&gt;~16 Hz) and at very low temporal frequencies (&lt;0.5 Hz). At intermediate temporal frequencies, flies showed a sustained anti-directional response. The maximal anti-directional response was achieved at 1 Hz and 45° wavelength, distinct from the conditions for peak classical turning responses. Interestingly, the stimuli that elicit the strongest anti-directional response appear similar to those that maximally activate T4 and T5 neurons when those neurons are measured in head-fixed flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wienecke et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Anti-directional turning behavior has distinct tuning and is driven by adaptation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heatmap of fly turning velocity during the first 0.5 s of sinusoidal grating stimulation under high-contrast conditions and variable temporal and spatial frequencies.

To investigate the dynamics of these changes, we presented a rotating sinusoidal stimulus at contrast 1 for 5 s, and then changed the contrast to 0.25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). After the switch to low contrast, the flies quickly reverted classical, syn-directional optomotor behavior, demonstrating that no long-term switch in directional turning occurs during high-contrast stimulus presentation. This effect did not depend on the periodic nature of these stimuli: a rotating stimulus consisting of 5°-wide vertical bars with randomly chosen, binary contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2014</xref>) yielded similar behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>To further isolate the causes of this switch in behavior, we developed a protocol to adapt the fly to different stimuli before presenting the high-contrast rotational sinusoidal gratings to elicit the anti-directional turning response. This adapting protocol consisted of 5 s presentations of an adaptor stimulus, followed by a high-contrast rotational stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The adaptor stimuli we tested were a uniform gray screen, a stationary high-contrast sinusoid, a closed-loop high-contrast sinusoid, or a high-contrast ‘translational’ sinusoidal stimulus. During the closed-loop adapter, the stimulus position was yoked to the fly’s own turning to better simulate real rotation, a situation we hypothesized might yield less dependence on stimulus contrast (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>). The translational stimulus had both left and right hemifields moving either front-to-back or back-to-front across the fly’s two eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>). These translational stimuli resulted in no net turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>), but specifically adapt motion detectors in both eyes selective for front-to-back or back-to-front motion. We found that adapting with a stationary or closed-loop high-contrast sinusoid had little effect on the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, adapting the fly with front-to-back stimuli did not have a strong effect on the subsequent response to rotational stimuli. However, adapting with back-to-front stimuli generated responses that no longer showed an initial syn-directional turning response, but instead exhibited anti-directional turning immediately after the rotational stimulus began. This result indicates that the anti-directional turning results from slow-timescale changes that depend on strong back-to-front motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Anti-directional turning is elicited when stimuli are presented in front of the fly</title><p>A previous report of anti-directional turning behavior in flying tethered flies showed that flies turn in the opposite direction to stimuli that are presented behind their midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>).

In walking flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williamson et al., 2018</xref>), flies largely turned in syn-directionally, but these turns were sometimes interrupted by brief, high-amplitude saccades in the opposite direction, against the stimulus direction. If such saccades were frequent or high amplitude, the net effect could shift the average turning we measured, creating apparent anti-directional turning. To investigate this possibility, we plotted the turning response on a per-trial basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We then discarded information about the magnitude of the turns and considered only the direction of the turning at each point in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Strikingly, in many trials, flies continued to turn opposite to the stimulus for several seconds, a behavior unlike brief saccades. This prolonged turning against the stimulus was also observable in the distribution of turning over time in all trials over all flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we calculated a turning index for each response timepoint (sampled at 60 Hz). This turning index represents the fraction of trials in which the fly turned in the direction of the stimulus at each timepoint minus the fraction of trials in which the fly turned in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Since this turning index does not include the magnitude of turning, it is strongly affected by sustained low-amplitude turns and discounts any brief high-amplitude saccades. When presented with high-contrast stimuli, flies maintained a negative turning index, indicating that sustained turns, and not high-velocity saccades, underlie this anti-directional turning behavior.

The T4 and T5 neurons responded to sine wave gratings in their preferred direction by increasing their calcium activity for the full duration of the stimulus presentation, reaching a plateau after approximately 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b, c</xref>, middle). As we increased the contrast of the preferred direction stimuli, we found that both T4 and T5 cells had increased calcium activity throughout the contrast range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b, c</xref>, right), consistent with prior measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the responses of T4 and T5 cells do not capture the transition from syn-directional to anti-directional turning behavior.</p><p>Next we examined two LPTCs downstream of T4 and T5 cells. Calcium activity in HS cells followed similar trends to T4 and T5. Calcium signals increased at the start of preferred direction stimuli presentation and stayed high until the end of the presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, middle). Increasing contrast caused stronger calcium responses with a mild saturation effect at high contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, right), consistent with prior voltage measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joesch et al., 2008</xref>). These results indicate that the changes in the time course of optomotor behavior at high contrast are not related to changes in HS neuron activity. Finally, we measured calcium activity in CH cells. CH cells responded to visual stimuli more quickly than HS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, middle), and showed decreased calcium signals in response to null direction stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, right). However, they also showed sustained responses to high-contrast stimuli, as in T4, T5, and HS neurons. These measurements suggest that the switch from syn- to anti-directional turning behavior is driven by cells downstream of or parallel to T4, T5, HS, and CH neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Adult plasticity in anti-directional turning behavior</title><p>In behaving flies, the strength of anti-directional turning was dependent both on rearing temperature, which alters the rate of growth, and on age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This raises the possibility that syn- and anti-directional turning responses might be plastic during the early adult stages of development. To probe this possibility, we presented 1 Hz, high-contrast, rotating sinusoidal grating at various stages during early adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Strikingly, as flies aged from 0.5 to 4 days post eclosion (dpe), the initial syn-directional turning became less transient and more sustained, indicative of a weaker anti-directional turning drive. We then wondered whether this plasticity was intrinsically programmed, or dependent on visual input. To disambiguate these possibilities, we reared flies in darkness to 2 or 4 dpe and measured their turning responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>gray</italic>). Dark-reared flies exhibited a stronger deceleration away from syn-directional turning, similar to that found in more juvenile flies, arguing that visual input may sculpt the balance of syn- and anti-directional turning. Finally, we examined whether optomotor response plasticity could be detected in <italic>D. yakuba</italic>. However, in this species, anti-directional responses were stable across the first 4 days of adulthood, arguing that the role of visual experience in shaping these responses is itself evolutionarily tuned in drosophilids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Maturation of optomotor response in early adulthood.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Adult flies at various ages post eclosion were presented with 5 s, high-contrast, rotating sinusoidal gratings as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>.

Moreover, this anti-directional turning behavior exhibits a degree of experience-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Anti-directional turning is distinct from other against-stimuli behaviors</title><p>The anti-directional turning behavior we have characterized is distinct from previous reports of flies turning in the direction opposite to the stimulus motion. First, some opposite-direction turning behaviors can be explained by stimulus aliasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>). Aliasing cannot explain our results because the stimulus that maximally activates anti-directional behavior has a spatial frequency of 1/60 cycles per degree, well below the Nyquist frequency of the fly eye (~1/10 cycles per degree) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Götz, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchner, 1976</xref>) and below reports of higher acuity vision in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Juusola et al., 2017</xref>). Aliasing would also not explain the dependence on stimulus contrast.</p><p>Second, our observations also cannot be explained by stimuli to the rear of the fly driving it in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>), since we observe anti-directional turning even when stimuli are only presented in only the 90° in front of the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Third, it is also distinct from previous reports of reverse body saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williamson et al., 2018</xref>) since it manifests in prolonged turns in the opposite direction of the stimulus and can be measured even when the magnitude of the turns is discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, the behavior observed here also appears to be distinct from previously observed stimulus-density-dependent behavioral reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Katsov and Clandinin, 2008</xref>). Those previously reported behaviors showed immediate reversals, but it took ~1–2 s for flies in our paradigm to switch between optomotor and anti-directional behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Anti-directional turning is unlikely to be due to adaptation to contrast alone</title><p>In mammalian retina, the direction preference of cells can switch because of upstream circuit adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rivlin-Etzion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vlasits et al., 2014</xref>). However, we do not believe the anti-directional turning we observe has similar causes. In the mammalian retina, direction switching occurs when non-direction-selective neurons adapt to high-contrast stimuli, which distorts the downstream direction-selective computation. Since the adaptation in those experiments occurs in non-direction-selective neurons, it cannot be affected by the direction of the adapter stimulus. However, we see differences in turning behavior depending on whether we adapt with front-to-back or back-to-front stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This observation rules out a mechanism based solely on contrast, since the contrast content of front-to-back and back-to-front stimuli are identical.</p><p>The fly’s visual system, however, adapts its gain to stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drews et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matulis et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, the phenomenology of the anti-directional turning also argues that the contrast adaptation is incomplete or heterogeneous among neurons, since contrast 1 and contrast 0.25 stimuli result in such different behaviors. Contrast adaptation reported in the fly is also faster than the 1–2 s preceding the shift to anti-directional turning in these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Anti-directional turning behavior may require specific experimental and rearing conditions</title><p>Despite these previous reports of anti-directional turning under certain conditions, other labs have measured sustained optomotor turning in response to high-contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Götz and Wenking, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Two major causes of this difference are likely display brightness and rearing conditions. Some experiments employ displays with mean luminances less than 5 cd/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Our screens, with a mean luminance of 100 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, are substantially brighter, but not especially bright when compared to natural scenes. In daytime natural scenes, foliage and the ground have average luminances of 200–500 cd/m<sup>2</sup> and the sky has an average luminance of around 4000 cd/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frazor and Geisler, 2006</xref>). We suspect that as researchers move to using displays that can more accurately depict natural scene luminances, anti-directional turning behaviors will be encountered more frequently.</p><p>Rearing conditions also significantly influenced anti-directional turning behavior. Flies reared at 25°C showed less anti-directional behavior than those reared at 20°C. Temperature has known developmental effects on neural connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiral et al., 2021</xref>). We also found differences based on fly age and fly strain. Notably, all three of these parameters vary significantly across the field, with prior studies varying rearing temperatures from 18–20°C to 25°C (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Juusola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mongeau and Frye, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ketkar et al., 2020</xref>), varying ages from 1 day to 10 days (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>), and varying strain between Canton-S or Oregon-R (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2011</xref>).

Optomotor behavior is tuned to visual stimuli in the range of 8–22 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tuthill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2018</xref>), while anti-directional behavior is tuned to stimuli in the range of 0.5–4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Intriguingly, this slower tuning matches the tuning of T4, T5, and HS neurons, as measured via calcium imaging or electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joesch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiappe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creamer et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that the difference in tuning between behavior and imaging are due to octopamine that is released during behavior but not necessarily released during imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiappe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we demonstrate a motion-related behavior tuned to low frequencies, comparable to those in neural measurements, during behavior that requires T4 and T5 neurons. Overall, this suggests that T4 and T5 are required for behaviors with very different temporal tuning, which in turn suggests that the temporal tuning of behavior is not determined solely by T4 and T5 tuning, but by other, parallel pathways as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Anti-directional turning reveals circuits that turn the fly counter to visual motion</title><p>Experiments that show a decrease of turning over time to high-contrast stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) could plausibly be explained by some kind of gain reduction or adaptation over time. However, the existence of turning in the direction opposite the stimulus motion in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and in <italic>D. yakuba</italic> requires a different explanation. These experiments reveal that over long timescales, a circuit that opposes the syn-directional optomotor turning response can dominate the behavioral response. Thus, this circuit is not simply scaling the magnitude of turning responses, but rather must be implementing an antagonistic, subtractive operation. We have schematized one possible subtractive circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), which shows an influence by regressive motion detectors on long timescales that drives anti-directional turning. Measurements of free walking behavior have shown that the time constant of the autocorrelation of fly turning is around 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katsov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeAngelis et al., 2019</xref>). Opposing syn- and anti-directional turning circuits could be used to balance and tune the strength of turning responses on short timescales, while the anti-directional turning is revealed on longer timescales. This sort of subtractive processing predominates in computing motion signals in the visual systems of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rust et al., 2006</xref>), and could also explain the existence of syn- and anti-directional turning behaviors.</p><p>In summary, we have presented evidence of a transition from syn-directional turning to no turning or to anti-directional turning when high-contrast stimuli are presented to the fly. This persists across laboratory environments and across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and shows plasticity with age. This behavior suggests that turning in response to rotational stimuli is not a simple reflex. Instead, the turning is likely driven by circuits with opposing influences on turning direction. These circuits appear to differentially adapt to the direction and contrast of the stimulus. This complexity makes the optomotor response a model for studying the interactions of circuits as they control the low-dimensional behaviors that change an animal’s orientation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Strains used in these experiments are listed in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Parental stock genotypes.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Genotype</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wildtype</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">+; +; + (IsoD1)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohl et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">T4T5-Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">+; +; R42F06-Gal4 (IsoD1 background)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 41253</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">HS-Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">+; +; R27B03-Gal4 (IsoD1 bg)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seelig et al., 2010</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 49211</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CH-Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w; +; R35A10-Gal4 (Janelia bg)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 49897</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">+; +; UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup> (IsoD1 bg)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Empty Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w; +; pBDPGAL4.1Uw (Janelia bg)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 68384</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCaMP6f</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w; UAS-GCaMP6f; +</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 42747</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">jGCaMP7b</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w; +; UAS-jGCaMP7b</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 79029</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">mtdTomato</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w; +; UAS-mtdTomato</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 30124</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Genotypes of flies used in behavior experiments.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Experimental</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gal4 control</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">UAS control</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Background control</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">T4T5-Gal4 x UAS- Shibire<sup>ts</sup>:<break/>+; +; R42F06-Gal4/UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T4T5-Gal4 x IsoD1: +;+;R42F06-Gal4/+</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IsoD1 x UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup>:<break/>+; +; +/UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IsoD1: +; +; +</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">HS-Gal4 x UAS- Shibire<sup>ts</sup>:<break/>+; +; R27B03-Gal4/UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HS-Gal4 x IsoD1:<break/>+; +; R27B03-Gal4/+</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IsoD1 x UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup>:<break/>+; +; +/UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IsoD1: +; +; +</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CH-Gal4 x UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup>: w/+; +; R35A10-Gal4/UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CH-Gal4 x IsoD1:<break/>w/+; +; R35A10-Gal4/+</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Empty Gal4 x UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup>: +/w; +; pBDPGAL4.1Uw /UAS-Shibire<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Empty Gal4 X IsoD1: +/w; +;<break/>+/ pBDPGAL4.1Uw</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Genotypes of files used in imaging experiments: +; +; HS-Gal4/UAS-jGCaMP7b, +; UAS-GC6f/+; T4T5-Gal4/UAS-mtdTomato, w/+; +; CH-Gal4/UAS-jGCaMP7b.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly rearing (DAC lab)</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, flies were reared at 20°C in Panasonic MIR-154-PA incubators (Panasonic/PHC, Tokyo, Japan).

Flies were then placed above air-suspended polypropylene balls in a dark box maintained at 34–36°C in a room held at ~50% relative humidity (such that the box has relative humidity of 25–30%). These conditions yield robust walking and turning behaviors. These balls were 6 mm in diameter and weighed ~120 mg. The balls were painted with two layers of marker coatings – a base silver layer and a red top layer. The motion of balls was detected by either a Parallax mouse sensor board (Parallax, Rocklin, CA, USA) with an MCS-12086 sensor (Unity Opto Technology, Taipei, Taiwan), or a custom board with an ADNS 2080 sensor (Avago Technologies/Broadcom Inc, San Jose, TX, USA). The data from these sensors were transferred to a custom MATLAB application via an Arduino Uno board. Flies were excluded from analysis if they walked at an average speed of &lt;1 mm/s over the entire experiment, or if the standard deviation of their turning was less than 1.5 times their meaning turning, an indication that they turned strongly and constitutively in one direction. These criteria typically excluded &lt;10% of flies run.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stimulus generation and behavioral turning assays (TRC lab)</title><p>Stimuli were presented using a DLP Lightcrafter (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA) projector. Three coherent optic fibers were used to direct the projected light onto three screens made of back-projection material, surrounding the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2014</xref>). The screens covered the front 270° around the fly, and ~45° in elevation above and below the fly. The projectors were set to monochrome mode, updating at 120 Hz. Stimulus video was generated through Flystim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2023</xref>), a custom Python application developed in the Clandinin Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turner et al., 2022</xref>). Stimuli were mapped onto a virtual cylinder around the fly and Flystim generated a viewpoint-corrected video signal. Stimuli are as described in the text. Stimuli were preceded and succeeded by uniform intensity stimuli with the same mean luminance; in our figures, this is represented by the gray periods. These interleaved uniform intensity stimuli typically lasted 5 s.</p><p>Behavioral experiments were performed 12–48 hr after eclosion, as described in the figures. Flies were cold-anesthetized and fixed to needles using UV-cured adhesive (Bondic, Niagara Falls, NY, USA). Flies were then placed above air-suspended balls made with LAST-A-FOAM FR-4615 polyurethane foam (General Plastics, Tacoma, WA, USA). These balls were 9 mm in diameter and weighed ~91.7 mg. The motion of balls was detected by a Flea3 FL3-U3-13Y3M camera (Teledyne Flir, Wilsonville, OR, USA) and Fictrac software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). The entire apparatus was contained in a light-tight box maintained at 34°C in a room held at ~50% relative humidity (such that the box has relative humidity of 25–30%). These conditions yield robust walking and turning behaviors. There were no exclusion criteria applied to flies in analyzing these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Luminance measurements</title><p>Our experiments revealed that luminance was a critical factor in generating the observed anti-directional turning. In the rigs in the DAC and TRC labs, we measured the luminance by placing a power meter in front of the rear-projection screens. The total power was converted to luminous intensity by dividing by the area of the sensor and by 2π steradians, approximating the scattering by the screen as uniform in all directions. We then converted from watts to candelas by the standard factor and weighting by the photopic luminosity function centered on our mean screen wavelength (~540 nm). Though the human photopic luminosity function is an unusual choice for studying fly visual behavior, cd/m<sup>2</sup> has been a standard unit for measuring screen luminous intensity in the field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging procedures</title><p>Two-photon imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka and Clark, 2022</xref>). Briefly, two-photon images were acquired with a Scientifica microscope at between 6 Hz and 13 Hz using a 930 nm femtosecond laser (SpectraPhysics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using ScanImage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). Visual stimuli were presented on three screens occupying 270° of azimuthal angle about the fly using projectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creamer et al., 2019</xref>). Optical filters on the projector and emission filters prevented the visual stimulus light from leaking into the two-photon images.</p><p>Regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted from image timeseries using a watershed algorithm. Responsive ROIs were included in the analyses. For T4 and T5 neurons, each ROI was identified as a T4-dominant or T5-dominant ROI by its response to light vs. dark edges, following prior procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrochao et al., 2020</xref>). For all neuron types, responses were averaged over ROIs and over trials of each stimulus type to obtain a measurement for each fly; these fly measurements acted as the independent measurements to compute means and standard error bars for the figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Throughout the paper, each fly was considered an independent sample for statistical purposes. Means and standard errors were computed over flies. For imaging experiments, ROIs from a specific neuron type were first averaged within each fly, creating a value for each fly’s response. These values were used to calculate means and standard errors over the tested flies. In the silencing experiments, a two-sample Student’s t-test was used to test for significant differences between the experimental genotype and parental controls.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-86076-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw behavioral and imaging data, along with code to run the analyses and create the plots in this paper, are available on Dryad: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c77">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c77</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Data from: Long timescale anti-directional rotation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> optomotor behavior</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c77</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH R01EY026555 (DAC), R01EY022638 (TRC), and by a Chan-Zuckerberg Investigator Award (TRC).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see below, there was a consensus that the observed anti-directional turning is an interesting behavior that may help understand principles of optomotor behavior. However, it was less clear to the reviewers how this 'non-natural' behavior precisely informs about normal behavior and what the implications may be for a broader audience. An effort by the authors in clarifying these points might improve the paper.</p><p>In addition, the following revisions suggested by reviewer 2 were deemed essential to strengthen the conclusions such as they are:</p><p>1) Given the dynamics of the behavior, it is important to look at the turning dynamics after the stimulus has stopped. If direction-selective adaptation mechanisms are regulating the turning response, one may find long-lasting biases even in the absence of stimulation. If the authors have more data after the stimulus end, it would be good to further expand the time range by a few seconds to show if this is the case or not (for example, in Figure 1b).</p><p>2) Another important set of experiments is to perform closed-loop configuration tests that should allow the motion computing circuitry to adapt to the chosen environmental conditions. Explorations of the changes in turning response dynamics after such treatments should then enable further dissections of the mechanisms of adaptation. Closed-loop experiments under different contrast conditions have already been performed (for example, Leonhardt et al. 2016), which also showed complex response dynamics after stimulus on- and offset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Figure 3, noting that flies could turn with both fast and slow movements, which may be in different directions, and information may be lost in the average trace, the authors show the raw turning traces, as well as a binarized version that shows only turning direction.

In the revised submission, we have expanded the time trace in Figure 1b to show 5 seconds after the stimulus has ended. The dynamics after high and low contrast stimuli are unremarkable, with each trace returning gradually to a baseline of zero net turning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another important set of experiments is to perform closed-loop configuration tests that should allow the motion computing circuitry to adapt to the chosen environmental conditions.

We have performed this experiment, following the more detailed suggestion in Reviewer #2’s comments. As such, we presented high contrast sinusoid gratings in closed-loop for 5 seconds with a gain of 1 (i.e., 90º change in ball orientation yields 90º change in stimulus orientation), following which we presented the standard 5 seconds of high contrast, open-loop rotation. In these experiments, we also included a positive control of a gray screen preceding the open-loop rotation, which should yield anti-directional turning, and a stationary, high-contrast grating that lasts for 5 seconds before the open-loop stimulus. As expected, the positive control worked, and the stationary grating adapter yielded almost identical turning to the mean-gray adapter. We found that the response to the closed-loop stimulus looked virtually identical to the parallel open-loop control cases. The closed-loop measurements were noisier because our rig presents the same stimulus to 5 flies simultaneously; our closed loop conditions place each fly in control of the stimulus for 1/5 of the experiment duration, resulting in fewer closedloop trials per fly.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the results of these experiments are shown in Figure 2 – Supp. Figure 1 and discussed in the results near the Figure 2 adaptation results. We now also mention in our paper that data in Leonhardt shows closed-loop responses under different contrast conditions and use that to motivate our new test of closed-loop adaptation conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In Figure 3, noting that flies could turn with both fast and slow movements, which may be in different directions, and information may be lost in the average trace, the authors show the raw turning traces, as well as a binarized version that shows only turning direction. It is nice to see the raw traces, but I think it could also be helpful to the reader to summarize this data by showing the distribution of angular velocities at different time points.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added a plot showing the rotational velocity distribution in individual trials over time, now shown in Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 1. We are not sure that it particularly illuminates the structure of the turning behavior, though saccadelike behavior is not obviously visible in these distributions. The new plot does give an accurate sense of the variability in individual trials, and shows that the mean seems like a reasonable summary statistic of the distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors may want to cite the following work which describes anti-directional optomotor behavior in fish.</p><p>Bak-Coleman, J., Smith, D., and Coombs, S.

We were unaware of this work, but have now added it to our introduction where we talk about previously reported anti-direction turning phenomenology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
