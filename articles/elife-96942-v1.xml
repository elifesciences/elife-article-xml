multivesicular bodies (MVB) polarization and exosome secretion at an immune synapse (IS) model in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. IS formation was associated with transient recruitment of FMNL1β to the IS, which was independent of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ). Simultaneous RNA interference of all FMNL1 isoforms prevented MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion, which were restored by FMNL1βWT expression. However, expression of the non-phosphorylatable mutant FMNL1βS1086A did not restore neither MTOC/MVB polarization nor exosome secretion to control levels, supporting the crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutant, FMNL1βS1086D, restored MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. Conversely, FMNL1βS1086D mutant did not recover the deficient MTOC/MVB polarization occurring in PKCδ-interfered clones, indicating that S1086 FMNL1β phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. FMNL1 interference inhibited the depletion of F-actin at the central region of the immune synapse (cIS), which is necessary for MTOC/MVB polarization. FMNL1βWT and FMNL1βS1086D, but not FMNL1βS1086A expression, restored F-actin depletion at the cIS. Thus, actin cytoskeleton reorganization at the IS underlies the effects of all these FMNL1β variants on polarized secretory traffic. FMNL1 was found in the IS made by primary T lymphocytes, both in T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-evoked synapses. Taken together, these results point out a crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in FMNL1β activation, leading to cortical actin reorganization and subsequent control of MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>immune synapse</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>FMNL1β</kwd><kwd>secretory traffic</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-114148RB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izquierdo Pastor</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-104941RB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Gonzalo</surname><given-names>Francesc R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2022/BMD-7225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izquierdo Pastor</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FMNL1β is phosphorylated on S1086 in a protein kinase C δ (PKCδ)-dependent manner and S1086-phosphorylated FMNL1β acts downstream of PKCδ to regulate centrosome and multivesicular bodies polarization to the immunological synapse and exosome release.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation by antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC) induces the formation of the immune synapse (IS). The IS is a specialized cell-cell interface contact area that provides a signaling platform for integration of signals leading to intercellular information exchange, in order to ensure efficient TCR signal transduction, T cell activation, and the proper execution of diverse T lymphocyte effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dustin and Choudhuri, 2016</xref>). Comprised among these functions, IS formation triggers the convergence of T lymphocyte secretory vesicles, including multivesicular bodies (MVB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2021</xref>), toward the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and the polarization of MTOC together with secretory vesicles to the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de la Roche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huse, 2012</xref>). The canonical bullseye structure of a mature IS comprises three concentric areas referred to as supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs) that can be discerned based on the specific segregation of TCR, integrins, and co-stimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monks et al., 1998</xref>). The central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) is enriched in ligand-bound TCR and associated signaling molecules, the peripheral SMAC (pSMAC) in adhesion molecules such as LFA-1, and the outer distal SMAC (dSMAC) in filamentous actin (F-actin) and CD45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blumenthal and Burkhardt, 2020</xref>). IS assembly and subsequent secretory responses are coordinated by both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, whose interplay regulates the polarized secretory response toward the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). IS formation is associated with an initial increase in cortical actin at the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billadeau et al., 2007</xref>), followed by a decrease in cortical actin density at the central region of the immune synapse (cIS) including the cSMAC, that contains the secretory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffiths et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ritter et al., 2015</xref>). The partial depletion of F-actin at the cIS has been proposed, apart from allowing the focusing and docking of secretory vesicles for secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billadeau et al., 2007</xref>), to initiate key subsequent events leading to MTOC polarization and delivery of secretory vesicles, such as lytic granules in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ritter et al., 2015</xref>) and cytokine-containing secretory vesicles in T-helper (Th) lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chemin et al., 2012</xref>), to the secretory domain of the IS. The CTL degranulation of diverse secretory lytic granules with MVB structure results in the secretion to the synaptic cleft of Fas ligand (FasL)-containing exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peters et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martínez-Lorenzo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mazzeo et al., 2016</xref>). These exosomes, along with perforin and granzymes, which are secreted in both soluble and nanoparticulate form in the so-called supramolecular attack particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bálint et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cassioli and Baldari, 2022</xref>), lead to the induction of target cell apoptosis. In addition, FasL-containing exosomes have been involved in autocrine FasL/Fas-dependent, activation-induced cell death (AICD) produced upon TCR triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martínez-Lorenzo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monleón et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2020</xref>), an important immunoregulatory event involved in the downregulation of T cell immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krammer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagata and Suda, 1995</xref>).</p><p>We have previously described that cortical actin reorganization at the IS plays an important role in MVB polarized traffic leading to exosome secretion in Th lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2021</xref>). With respect to the molecular cues controlling this process, we have shown that TCR-stimulated protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) regulates cortical actin reorganization at the IS, thereby controlling MTOC/MVB polarization and ultimately leading to exosome secretion at the IS and AICD in Th lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, PKCδ is necessary for the polarization of lytic granules and the induction of cytotoxicity by mouse CTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2007</xref>), which supports a general role of PKCδ in secretory traffic leading to apoptosis in T lymphocytes. Besides PKCδ, several actin cytoskeleton regulators, including the formin FMNL1 and Diaphanous-1 (Dia1), also regulate MTOC polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kühn and Geyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumari et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, we have shown both PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of FMNL1 at the IS and PKCδ-dependent F-actin clearing at the cIS, which participate in MTOC/MVB polarization leading to exosome secretion in CD4<sup>+</sup> Jurkat T lymphocytes forming IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2021</xref>). However, a formal connection between FMNL1 phosphorylation, F-actin regulation, and MVB polarization/exosome secretion at the IS has not been established yet.</p><p>Regarding potential formin regulatory pathways, we have shown that FMNL1, but not Dia1, is strongly phosphorylated in T lymphocytes by PKCδ activators such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but also upon TCR stimulation via an anti-TCR agonist as well as IS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). FMNL1 phosphorylation was inhibited in PKCδ-interfered T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), which is associated with a deficient MTOC polarization toward the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>), supporting a PKCδ role in both FMNL1 phosphorylation and MTOC polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, FMNL2, a related formin which exhibits a high homology with FMNL1, is phosphorylated by PKCα and, to a lower extent, by PKCδ, at S1072 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This phosphorylation reverses FMNL2 autoinhibition mediated by interaction of N-terminal Diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) with the C-terminal Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD), resulting in increased F-actin assembly, β1-integrin endocytosis, invasive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and filopodia elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzen et al., 2023</xref>). In this regard, recent evidence suggests that the mutation of a particular residue in FMNL2 impacting the DID-DAD interaction may result in functional implications for the characteristic actin-regulating activity of FMNL2, specifically in the context of podosome formation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trefzer et al., 2021</xref>). Out of the three FMNL1 isoforms (α, β, and γ) present in T lymphocytes and Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colón-Franco et al., 2011</xref>), S1086 in FMNL1β is surrounded by a sequence displaying high homology to the one surrounding S1072 in FMNL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, we have shown that FMNL1β is the only FMNL1 isoform phosphorylated upon IS formation and capable of recovering MTOC polarization when it was re-expressed in cells simultaneously interfered for the three FMNL1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that IS-induced, PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation at S1086, a residue located within FMNL1β DAD, may release the autoinhibition mediated by DID/DAD interaction, thereby leading to the activation of FMNL1β. Consequently, this activation would mediate the F-actin reorganization at the IS and the MTOC/MVB polarization, thereby enabling the subsequent exosome secretion. Here, we report that FMNL1β phosphorylation at S1086 regulates F-actin reorganization leading to MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>C-terminal alignment of FMNL1 isoforms.</title><p>S1086 of FMNL1β shows a high degree of homology with protein kinase C (PKC)-phosphorylated S1072 in FMNL2.

Moreover, we have also shown that FMNL1β is strongly phosphorylated in T lymphocytes by PKCδ activators such as PMA, as well as by TCR stimulation and upon IS formation, which could potentially be related to FMNL1β activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). As previously stated, FMNL2 becomes active upon PKCα phosphorylation at S1072, enhancing F-actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzen et al., 2023</xref>). In FMNL1β, S1086 in arginine-rich DAD (labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is surrounded by a sequence displaying high similarity to that around S1072 in FMNL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of FMNL1β at S1086 may release DID-DAD autoinhibition, thereby activating FMNL1β and regulating MTOC polarization. To address this point, we introduced S1086A and S1086D mutations in the shFMNL1-HA-YFP-FMNL1β construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colón-Franco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), which act as non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These resulting bi-cistronic vectors produce both FMNL1 interference and the corresponding YFP-FMNL1β variant expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colón-Franco et al., 2011</xref>), acting as useful tools to analyze the role of FMNL1β in IS formation during transient expression experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm the previously described efficacy of these vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), we first analyzed endogenous FMNL1 interference and YFP-FMNL1β variants expression in C3 Jurkat clone transfected with the different vectors at the single cell level by immunofluorescence, using an anti-FMNL1 antibody that recognizes all its isoforms. This analysis was performed in transfected Jurkat cells forming synapses, to rule out any potential effect of IS formation and subsequent T lymphocyte activation on both endogenous FMNL1 interference and YFP-FMNL1β variants expression. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, C3 cells transfected with the FMNL1-interfering plasmid shFMNL1-YFP (YFP<sup>+</sup> cells) (second row) showed very low anti-FMNL1 signal when compared with non-transfected cells in the same preparation or control YFP<sup>-</sup> cells (first row). In contrast, cells transfected with YFP-FMNL1βWT, YFP-FMNL1βS1086A, or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D (rows 3–5, respectively) showed higher anti-FMNL1 fluorescence signals when compared to non-transfected cells in the same microscopy field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows, by single cell image analysis, that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the anti-FMNL1 in shFMNL1-YFP-expressing cells is extremely low when compared to the control YFP<sup>-</sup> group, whereas it is much higher in YFP-FMNL1βWT, YFP-FMNL1βS1086A, or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D-expressing cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, anti-FMNL1 MFI correlated with YFP-FMNL1β MFI in YFP-FMNL1βWT, YFP-FMNL1βS1086A, or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D-expressing cells. To further verify this data, lysates from bulk populations of transfected cells were analyzed by western blot (WB) using the same anti-FMNL1 antibody. The apparent molecular weights (MW) of the bands observed in the WB analysis were compatible with the predicted MW of endogenous FMNL1 (150 kDa) and the chimeric YFP-FMNL1β variants (150+30 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The endogenous FMNL1 (150 kDa band) levels in lysates from cells transfected with YFP-FMNL1βWT, YFP-FMNL1βS1086A, or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D were lower than in control untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The reduction of endogenous FMNL1 expression, as assessed by WB (between 40% and 80% reduction relative to control YFP<sup>-</sup> cells), was apparently lower than that observed by single cell imaging analysis (compare panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To this end, we stimulated C3 clone transfected with the different constructs with the PKCδ activator PMA, which has been shown to induce strong FMNL1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequently, we immunoprecipitated FMNL1 with an anti-FMNL1 that recognizes all FMNL1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>) and analyzed these immunoprecipitates (IPs) by WB with anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, in IPs from PMA-stimulated cells expressing YFP-FMNL1βS1086A or S1086D no apparent phosphorylation of these FMNL1β chimeras could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, substitution of S1086 by a non-phosphorylatable or a phosphomimetic residue fully abolished PKCδ activator-induced phosphorylation of FMNL1β, as detected by anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate, confirming our hypothesis that S1086 is indeed the residue that is phosphorylated in FMNL1β upon PKC activation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>S1086 in FMNL1β is phosphorylated upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation.</title><p>C3 control clone was unstransfected (Control YFP<sup>-</sup>) or transfected with either FMNL1-interfering expressing interference-resistant YFP-FMNL1βWT (shFMNL1-HA-YFP-FMNL1βWT), YFP-FMNL1βS1086A, or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D constructs.

Next, we quantified MTOC/MVB polarization index (PI) in fixed synapses formed by the mentioned cell groups by epifluorescence microscopy and deconvolution, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Obino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the first series of experiments, average MTOC PI of untransfected (Control YFP<sup>-</sup>) C3 cells forming synapses with unpulsed Raji cells was significantly lower than with SEE-pulsed Raji cells, and similar to MTOC PI of FMNL1-interfered cells (shFMNL1-YFP) forming synapses with SEE-pulsed Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This confirms that antigenic stimulation at the IS indeed triggers MTOC polarization and validates our synapse model measurements. In addition, confirming our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), MTOC/MVB polarization was disrupted upon FMNL1 interference to the levels obtained with unpulsed Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, compare the first two rows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and was restored by YFP-FMNL1βWT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, third row and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, non-phosphorylatable YFP-FMNL1βS1086A expression was unable to restore MVB/MTOC polarization to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, fourth row and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas phosphomimetic YFP-FMNL1βS1086D expression restored MVB/MTOC polarization to the levels achieved by YFP-FMNL1βWT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, fifth row and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Comparable results were obtained by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). From confocal images, en face views of the IS interface were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). These images show the polarized MTOC or the polarized accumulation of MVB (measured as high MTOC and MVB PI values, in white types), respectively, in the cIS region of untransfected (control YFP<sup>-</sup>) C3 cells or cells expressing YFP-FMNL1WT or YFP-FMNL1S1086D, but not in cells transfected with shFMNL1-YFP or expressing YFP-FMNL1βS1086A (low MTOC and MVB PI values). Thus, phosphorylation of S1086 in FMNL1β appears to be essential for secretory polarized traffic toward the IS in T lymphocytes. Moreover, throughout the experiment, we observed that MTOC and MVB were polarizing together toward the IS. This fact, together with the previous work regarding segregation between MTOC movement and secretory granules traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chemin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nath et al., 2016</xref>), prompted us to simultaneously analyze both MTOC and MVB positioning with respect to the IS at the single cell level. Remarkably, we observed a robust linear correlation between MVB and MTOC PIs both in untransfected (control YFP<sup>-</sup>) C3 cells and cells transfected with shFMNL1-YFP (Pearson’s linear correlation coefficients 0.96 and 0.95, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that MVB and MTOC centers of mass (MVB<sup>C</sup> and MTOC<sup>C</sup>, respectively) are very closely located in all the studied cell groups, regardless of polarization state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the MTOC and MVB did not efficiently polarize in cells transfected with shFMNL1-YFP, their MVB<sup>C</sup> were still located next to MTOC<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, second row), and equivalent results were obtained in all the analyzed cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of S1086 in FMNL1β appears to be essential for both MTOC and MVB polarization toward the IS in T lymphocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>FMNL1β phosphorylation at S1086 is involved in microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)/multivesicular bodies (MVB) polarization toward the immune synapse (IS).</title><p>C3 control clone was untransfected (Control YFP<sup>-</sup>) (first row) or transfected with FMNL1-interfering (shFMNL1-HA-YFP) (second row), or FMNL1-interfering expressing interference-resistant YFP-FMNL1βWT (shFMNL1-HA-YFP-FMNL1βWT) (third row), YFP-FMNL1βS1086A (fourth row), or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D (fifth row) constructs.

In this context, we have previously shown that FMNL1β lies downstream of PKCδ in the same pathway controlling MTOC/MVB polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2021</xref>). Thus, in order to analyze this important issue we transfected the PKCδ-interfered P5 and P6 clones with the different plasmids and compared the MTOC PI among the different cell groups, as previously done in C3 clone. We have previously shown that neither PKCδ nor FMNL1 interference affects IS conjugate formation, since P5 and P6 clones and FMNL1-interfered C3 clone formed IS with SEE-pulsed Raji cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, IS formed by P5 clone with SEE-pulsed Raji cells (fifth group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) had a MTOC PI comparable to those of IS formed by C3 clone with unpulsed Raji cells or P5 clone with unpulsed Raji cells (first and fourth group, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), supporting that both FMNL1 and PKCδ interference fully inhibited MTOC polarization.</p><p>In contrast to what was found in the control C3 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) or C9 clone (not shown), YFP-FMNL1βWT expression in PKCδ and FMNL1-interfered P5 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or P6 clone (not shown) did not restore MTOC PI to the values observed in control YFP<sup>-</sup> C3 cells, which is compatible with the idea that FMNL1β lies downstream of PKCδ and its phosphorylation is indispensable for MTOC polarization. Consistently, expression in P5 clone of YFP-FMNL1βS1086A, a variant non-phosphorylatable by PKC, was also unable to enhance MTOC PI to the values observed in control YFP<sup>-</sup> C3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, phosphomimetic YFP-FMNL1βS1086D expression, which restored MVB/MTOC PI to the values achieved by YFP-FMNL1βWT expression in the C3 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), did not restore MTOC PI in PKCδ and FMNL1-interfered P5 cells to the levels observed in control YFP<sup>-</sup> C3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, FMNL1βS1086D expression was unable to revert the deficient MTOC polarization occurring in P6 (not shown), a different PKCδ-interfered clone previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>). We have shown that the deficient MTOC/MVB polarization in the PKCδ-interfered P5 and P6 clones is due exclusively to the reduction in PKCδ expression, since transient re-expression of PKCδ in all these clones recovered MTOC/MVB polarization to control levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>). Since both the FMNL1 interference and FMNL1 variant re-expression for IS experiments were performed in transient assays (2–4 days after transfection), there was no chance for any clonal variation in these short-time experiments. Taken together, these results show that although FMNL1β phosphorylation at S1086 is necessary, it does not seem to be sufficient for MTOC polarization, at least in cells lacking PKCδ.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>YFP-FMNL1βS1086D expression does not rescue deficient microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) polarization in PKCδ-interfered cells.</title><p>PKCδ-interfered P5 clone was untransfected (Control YFP<sup>-</sup>) (first row) or transfected with FMNL1-interfering (shFMNL1-HA-YFP) (second row), FMNL1-interfering expressing interference-resistant YFP-FMNL1βWT(shFMNL1-HA-YFP-FMNL1βWT) (third row), YFP-FMNL1βS1086A (fourth row), or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D (fifth row) constructs.

To this end we analyzed YFP-FMNL1βWT translocation upon IS formation in the PKCδ-interfered P5 clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

At these subsynaptic locations, FMNL1 colocalized with F-actin (white pixels), which is compatible with the idea that FMNL1 regulates F-actin at the IS. To extend these results obtained in Jurkat cells, we have performed experiments using primary T cells developing synapses mediated by TCR recognizing SEE plus SEB superantigens and a dual chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing CD19/CD22 on Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, respectively).

To address this point, fixed synapses formed by the C3 clone transfected with the previously described plasmids were stained with phalloidin AF647 to label F-actin and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The relative area of the F-actin-low region at the cIS (Fact-low cIS area/IS area) in the IS interface, which mirrors cortical F-actin reorganization at the IS, was measured as indicated in Materials and methods and represented for all cell groups.

Subsequently, the colocalization pixels (white) along all the Z stack at the IS interface (interface colocalization) were determined as indicated in Materials and methods. This involved merging the indicated fluorescence channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, second row, F-actin in blue and anti-FMNL1 in red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, second row, F-actin in blue and YFP fluorescence in green) on the IS interfaces of the synaptic areas generated as shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and consistently with results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, both control YFP<sup>-</sup> (first column) and YFP-FMNL1βWT-expressing cells (third and fourth columns) exhibited a wide F-actin depletion area at the cIS and an F-actin accumulation at the dSMAC. Interestingly, in some synapses from control YFP<sup>-</sup> (first column) and YFP-FMNL1βWT-expressing cells (fourth column), F-actin and FMNL1 colocalized (white pixels) at certain small areas at the wide F-actin-low region at the cIS, although the MFI profiles show relatively less F-actin and FMNL1 at the cIS than at the dSMAC. In other synapses from both control YFP<sup>-</sup> (not shown) and YFP-FMNL1βWT-expressing cells (third column), F-actin and FMNL1 colocalization occurred at the F-actin-rich area corresponding to the dSMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), which was consistent with the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. In contrast, and consistently with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, FMNL1-interfered cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, second column) displayed small F-actin low areas at the cIS.

In cells expressing the YFP-FMNL1β variants, colocalization of all the YFP-FMNL1β variants with F-actin was mainly in the F-actin-low area at the cIS or at the dSMAC. When colocalization in all Z optical sections was assessed using directly the YFP fluorescence construction instead of anti-FMNL1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, second row, F-actin in blue and YFP fluorescence in green), comparable results were obtained. In addition, we analyzed the subsynaptic location of FMNL1 with respect to Ser-phosphorylated PKC substrates by using an anti-FMNL1 and an anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate. The last antibody was validated by WB, both on endogenous FMNL1 and FMNL1β variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, the phospho-PKC does not recognize YFP-FMNL1βS1086A or S1086D variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, when FMNL1 is interfered, the phospho-PKC does not colocalize with FMNL1 and it strongly colocalizes at the synapse with expressed YFP-FMNL1βWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) in the Jurkat cell.

Although all these data do not yet allow us to infer that FMNL1β is phosphorylated at the IS due to the resolution limits of superresolution microscopy and the possibility that another PKC substrate may be associated with FMNL1 or very close to FMNL1, in a strictly S1086-dependent manner, the results are compatible with the idea that both endogenous FMNL1 and YFP-FMNL1βWT are specifically phosphorylated at the cIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>S1086 phosphorylation of FMNL1β regulates exosome secretion</title><p>The aforementioned results support that FMNL1β and its phosphorylation at S1086 are involved in MTOC/MVB polarized traffic to the IS, most probably via control of F-actin rearrangement at the IS. MVB transport and fusion to the plasma membrane are necessary for exosome secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Théry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2020</xref>) and PKCδ controls F-actin depletion at the cIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>), thus, it is conceivable that FMNL1β may control subsequent exosome secretion at the IS. To directly analyze FMNL1β contribution to exosome secretion, we used an exosome secretion reporter assay. We transiently co-transfected C3 clone with the exosome reporter GFP-CD63 expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>) and the different shFMNL1-YFP constructs. Subsequently, IS were formed between the co-transfected C3 clone and SEE-pulsed Raji cells, exosomes were purified from cell culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>), lysed, and exosome lysates were analyzed by anti-CD63 WB. This secretion assay excludes the detection of exosomes released by Raji cells in the co-culture, that otherwise may mask the exosomes released by Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2020</xref>). In parallel, we determined nanovesicle concentrations in co-culture supernatants by using nanoparticle tracking analyses (NTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Anti-CD63 WB analysis of exosome secretion is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. We normalized exosomal GFP-CD63 signal to the transfection efficiency of the exosome reporter (measured by GFP-CD63 signal from cell lysates) and the number of viable exosome-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, interference with all FMNL1 isoforms not only reduced exosomal GFP-CD63 levels, but also reduced SEE-stimulated nanovesicle concentration increase. These results mirrored those obtained in cells in PKCδ-interfered cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, interference with all FMNL1 isoforms and YFP-FMNL1βWT expression recovered exosome secretion to the levels produced by control YFP<sup>-</sup> cells. However, YFP-FMNL1βS1086A expression did not recovered exosome secretion, whereas YFP-FMNL1βS1086D expression rescued exosome secretion to the values observed in control YFP<sup>-</sup> or YFP-FMNL1βWT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These results demonstrate IS-induced exosome secretion, but do not reveal the presence of exosomes at the synaptic cleft. Therefore, we have performed STED superresolution imaging of the IS made by control and FMNL1-interfered cells. Nanosized (100–150 nm) CD63<sup>+</sup> vesicles can be found in the synaptic cleft between the APC and control YFP<sup>-</sup> cells with polarized MVB, whereas we could no detect these vesicles in the cleft from FMNL1-interfered cells that maintain unpolarized MVB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

We have previously shown that phosphorylation occurs in FMNL1 but not in a homologous formin, Dia1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), that also regulate MTOC polarization and it is a major actin regulator in T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>), supporting an specific role of FMNL1 phosphorylation, but not Dia1 phosphorylation on MTOC polarization. Here, we have identified for the first time a positive regulatory role of FMNL1β phosphorylation at S1086 in cortical F-actin regulation that governs MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion at the IS in Th lymphocytes. Moreover, the fact that the phosphomimetic YFP-FMNL1βS1086D expression in PKCδ and FMNL1-interfered cells did not recover the MTOC PI observed in C3 control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) supports the idea that FMNL1β phosphorylation at S1086 is necessary but not sufficient for MTOC polarization, at least in cells lacking PKCδ. Thus, these results support that another signal, apart from PKCδ activation, or another PKCδ-controlled pathway not involving FMNL1β phosphorylation, evoked upon TCR triggering at the IS, is also implicated in MTOC/MVB polarization to the IS.</p><p>Our results on FMNL1β phosphorylation are certainly related to what was found in formin homology domain protein 1 (FHOD1) regulation. FHOD1 is grouped into Dia-related formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schönichen and Geyer, 2010</xref>). FHOD1 requires active Rac to be recruited to the plasma membrane, but its recruitment appears insufficient for FHOD1 activation, which is achieved only after being phosphorylated by Rho-dependent protein kinase (ROCK) at three serine and threonine sites included in a polybasic arginine-rich region inside the C-terminal DAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takeya et al., 2008</xref>), leading to disruption of FHOD1 autoinhibitory state and F-actin stress fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takeya et al., 2008</xref>). This activation process is similar to what we have described in this article for FMNL1β. Moreover, the PKC-dependent mode of FMNL2 activation during integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzen et al., 2023</xref>) is comparable to what we have found in FMNL1β during polarized traffic to the IS. Furthermore, FHOD3 formin is also autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its C- and N-terminal domains. Phosphorylation of the three highly conserved residues (S1406, S1412, and T1416) within the polybasic, C-terminus of FHOD3 by ROCK1/2 is sufficient for its activation and is crucial in regulating myofibrillogenesis in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, with the results provided here for FMNL1β, it has been reported that at least four different formins are activated through phosphorylation by three different kinases at the C-terminal polybasic regions, which are included in a common DAD. This underscores the evolutionary importance of this regulatory mechanism in formin activation, ultimately leading to very diverse cellular responses. However, although we do not have conclusive evidence supporting that PKC directly phosphorylates FMNL1β, the presence of a conserved S1086 within an RRSV/AR motif that contains a potential target for classical PKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nishikawa et al., 1997</xref>), along with the recognition of the phosphorylated residue by a validated anti-Phospho-Ser PKC substrate antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), certainly support this possibility.</p><p>With regard to potential regulatory pathways involved in formin activation and subcellular localization, it is remarkable that the most abundant formins in T lymphocytes, Dia1 and FMNL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>), are constitutively inactive in the cytoplasm due to intramolecular DAD-DID binding, which blocks formin ability to nucleate and elongate actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). Regarding a possible control of formin subcellular location by PKC, it has been shown that both relocation of FMNL2 from the plasma membrane to the endosomal compartment and activation are dependent on C-terminal S1072 phosphorylation by PKCα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, FMNL2 location in filopodia seems to be independent of the phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzen et al., 2023</xref>). We have previously described PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of FMNL1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), and here we have demonstrated that this phosphorylation occurs at S1086, leading to F-actin reorganization at the IS, and resulting in MTOC polarization. However, in contrast to FMNL2 relocation, which is dependent on PKCα, we have shown that transient YFP-FMNL1βWT relocation from cytosol to the IS occurred in the absence of PKCδ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), in conditions where neither F-actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>) nor MTOC polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) occurred. Moreover, both YFP-FMNL1βS1086A and YFP-FMNL1βS1086D translocated to the IS (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that S1086 phosphorylation is not required for IS location. However, as it happens during S1072 phosphorylation in FMNL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that blocking phosphorylation at S1086 through the introduction of single point mutations (YFP-FMNL1βS1086A or YFP-FMNL1βS1086D) may not block FMNL1β translocation to the IS per se, but may alter the kinetics of the process. For this reason, in future approaches, a thorough study on the kinetic considerations on S1086 PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation contribution to FMNL1β translocation to the IS will need to be addressed.</p><p>Jurkat T cells may not fully recapitulate the regulation of polarization in primary T cells, and the evidences from activating surfaces acting as artificial synapses show distinct actin cytoskeleton behavior (presence or not of F-actin foci) in primary versus immortalized T cells, at least in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, that may reflect mechanistic distinctions in the T cell models systems utilized to study cytoskeletal actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colin-York et al., 2019</xref>). However, to date, no clear evidence has been obtained regarding the existence of such an F-actin foci network in cell-cell IS models based on primary T lymphocytes or Jurkat cells. F-actin foci have been exclusively observed in primary T cells engaged with artificial activating surfaces (planar lipid bilayers or coated glass), which does not apply to our data obtained from cell-cell synapses. However, to solve any potential differences in FMNL1 localization between primary versus immortalized T cells, we have performed experiments analyzing the subcellular localization of FMNL1 in CD19/CD22 dual-targeted CAR T cells forming synapses with CD19<sup>+</sup>/CD22<sup>+</sup> Raji cells used as CTL targets and T lymphoblasts forming synapses with SEE and SEB-pulsed Raji cells. We observed, in fixed-cell images, the presence of endogenous FMNL1 colocalizing with F-actin-enriched areas in the IS region of both CAR T cells and primary T lymphoblasts, which also exhibited MTOC polarization toward the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of FMNL1 at the IS developed by primary T lymphoblasts was transient, as occurred in Jurkat cells (not shown). These observations extend our results on FMNL1 localization at the IS in the Jurkat-Raji plus SEE synapse model to the IS developed by primary human T lymphocytes. Regarding exosome secretion in primary human T lymphocytes, additional experiments involving the expression of the diverse FMNL1β variants will be necessary to assess whether FMNL1β and its phosphorylation at S1086 controls exosome secretion in primary T lymphocytes, as occurred in Jurkat cells. These experiments will require the development of new transduction protocols to improve the otherwise inefficient expression in primary T lymphocytes, that it is even worse using the bi-cistronic large plasmids (&gt;15 kb) that we have employed in our studies. In addition, it is well known that the mere expression of large proteins such as the 180 kDa (30+150 kDa) YFP-FMNL1 chimeric variants constitutes a significant challenge. Thus, we have been unable to achieve enough transfection efficiency to perform these experiments, which would have allowed us to fully extend the effect of FMNL1β and its phosphorylation at S1086 on exosome secretion to primary T cells. However, FMNL1 is necessary for MTOC/MVB polarization in Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), as confirmed in this manuscript, and this finding has already been extended to primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>). All of this, together with the fact that exosome secretion requires MTOC/MVB polarization both in Jurkat cells and primary T lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>), suggests FMNL1 may also control exosome secretion in primary T cells, although the formal demonstration will require further research. Regarding the effect of the diverse FMNL1β variants expression on MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion in primary T lymphocytes, the data from activating surfaces clearly shows that the synaptic actin architecture of the IS from primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is essentially indistinguishable and thus unbiased from that of Jurkat T cells, but different to that of primary CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is expected that all our data in Jurkat T cells could probably be extrapolated to the synaptic architecture of primary CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, although more experiments involving primary CD4<sup>+</sup> are necessary to extend all our results to the last cell type.</p><p>Although the mechanism(s) involved in FMNL1β recruitment to the IS remains unclear, it is probably that it involves Rac1 and Cdc42 small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kühn and Geyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Favaro et al., 2013</xref>), which are activated at the IS upon TCR triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deckert et al., 2005</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the participation of another PKC isoform or a different protein kinase that may induce FMNL1β phosphorylation in different residues upon previous FMNL1β relocation to the IS primed by small G protein, as was shown for FMNL2 relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Further experiments are needed to establish this important point.</p><p>Taken together, our results support that IS-induced, PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of S1086 in FMNL1β DAD, most probably executed by PKCδ itself, activates FMNL1β, which in turn regulates cortical actin at the IS and hence controls MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. The behavior of non-phosphorylatable YFP-FMNL1βS1086A (equivalent to FMNL2-S1072A described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) confirms this hypothesis, since its expression inhibits F-actin reorganization at the IS, MTOC polarization, and exosome secretion. In this respect, it has been reported that the phosphorylation of FMNL2 by PKCα in S1072 is necessary for the secretion of the pro-metastatic factor Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank et al., 2023</xref>), which constitutes the first description for an activated formin involvement in secretion during cell invasion. In addition, ANGPTL4 can be secreted into exosomes by lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) and FMNL2 controls exosome secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, although it is not clear whether ANGPTL4 is released in exosomes or in soluble form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank et al., 2023</xref>), both FMNL2 and FMNL1β appear to control PKC-regulated exosome secretion. However, the extracellular signals evoking exosome secretion are strikingly different in the various cell types, since in tumor cells hypoxia and radiation can amplify the otherwise constitutive and multidirectional exosome secretion, whereas T lymphocytes constitutively secrete very low levels of exosomes and none in a polarized manner unless activated through TCR or synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2020</xref>). Taken together, these considerations support a more general role of the formin-actin cytoskeleton axis in directional exosome secretion. Given all these considerations, it will be interesting to analyze the role of FMNL2 in inducible exosome secretion at the IS in T lymphocytes, but also the role of FMNL1β in exosome secretion by cancer cells during cell invasion. This is particularly relevant as exosome secretion is required for directionally persistent and efficient in vivo movement of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sung et al., 2015</xref>), and it is known that FMNL1 stimulates both leukemia cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Favaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The fact that FMNL1- and PKCδ-interfered cells have a similar phenotype to that of FMNL1- or PKCδ-interfered cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>) (this paper) supports the notion that PKCδ and FMNL1β participate in the same F-actin regulatory pathway controlling MTOC/MVB polarization. Additional experiments involving in vitro measurements of F-actin reorganizing/severing activities of the diverse FMNL1β variants, phosphorylated or not in vitro by PKCδ, will be necessary to address whether PKCδ directly phosphorylates FMNL1β at S1086.</p><p>Our findings show that FMNL1 colocalizes with F-actin at the IS edges which are part of the dSMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). These data are aligned with the previous observation that Dia1 and FMNL1 are intrinsically inactive because they undergo intramolecular folding and remain in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>) and that after IS formation, they are enriched at the tips of F-actomyosin spikes at the outer edge of the dSMAC, giving rise to the actomyosin arcs at the pSMAC in the IS formed by Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). Dia1 is not a target of PKC, whereas FMNL1 is phosphorylated by PKC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, in this paper we have focused on FMNL1. High-resolution, spatiotemporal analysis of FMNL1β localization at the different subsynapic locations, together with superresolution techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2018</xref>), may provide new clues regarding the subsynaptic F-actin network targeted by phosphorylated FMNL1β. Even though the nature of the downstream effectors and consequences of FMNL1β phosphorylation on synaptic F-actin architecture can only be speculated at this point, concentric actomyosin arcs generated by FMNL1 propel TCR microclusters toward the IS and reinforce cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of actomyosin arcs structure and function during TCR microcluster movement in FMNL1-interfered cells, and/or cells expressing the FMNL1β mutants described here, will provide important clues on this important matter. It is noteworthy that a majority of the image analysis of IS organization and F-actin dynamics is based on planar synapses obtained using artificial APC substitutes, by either coating stimulatory and co-stimulatory molecules on glass or plastic surfaces or by embedding these molecules into lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dustin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dupré et al., 2021</xref>). These artificial synapses can indeed be imaged and analyzed with the highest possible resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carisey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2018</xref>). However, the cell-cell synapse model analyzed here mimics the complex interactions and irregular, 3D stimulatory surface of a physiological synapse better than artificial synapses do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dustin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). In this important sense, the data presented here are indeed closer to a physiological situation. In addition, since actomyosin arcs arise from active, formin-dependent nucleation sites at the outer edge of the dSMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>), it will be interesting to analyze, using superresolution techniques, whether phosphorylated FMNL1β is located at these sites. Indeed, actomyosin arc network spanning from dSMAC along the pSMAC is the most likely source of T cell-based force that augments cytotoxicity by straining the target cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to study the effect of FMNL1β mutants on actomyosin arcs formation and analyze functional deficiencies (i.e. decreased T cell-APC adhesion frequency, IS size, and IS formation efficiency) in IS formed by cells interfered in FMNL1β and/or expressing the FMNL1β variants described here. Visualization of actin and actomyosin networks, TCR microclusters, and secretion granules dynamics in ‘real’ live T cell-APC conjugates at the superresolution level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>) is clearly needed to advance in this area.</p><p>Remarkably, although it has already been shown that FMNL1 is important for MTOC polarization in Jurkat cells and for target cell lysis in CTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>), our data provide the first molecular basis underpinning this essential FMNL1 function. Here, we demonstrate that FMNL1β and its phosphorylation at S1086 participate in F-actin-controlled, polarized MVB traffic secreting effector exosomes in Jurkat T lymphocytes developing IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2005</xref>), which deliver pro-apoptotic signals to target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bálint et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cassioli and Baldari, 2022</xref>). In addition, FMNL1 promotes proliferation and migration of leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Favaro et al., 2013</xref>) and mediates posterior perinuclear actin polymerization to promote T lymphocyte effector cell migration to inflammatory sites to enable T cell-mediated autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>). PKCδ is crucial for directional T cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Volkov et al., 1998</xref>) and this process requires MVB polarized traffic and exosome secretion in the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sung et al., 2015</xref>). For that reason, it will be interesting to analyze the effects of the FMNL1β mutants we have described here during T lymphocyte migration and tumorigenesis, as well as to study the role of FMNL1β phosphorylation in several autoimmune disorders. In addition, improving our understanding of the molecular bases underlying the traffic events involved in polarized secretion of pro-apoptotic exosomes as we have performed here, provided that the FMNL1 effect on exosome secretion in Jurkat cells can be extended to primary T lymphocytes, will deliver clues to modify crucial immune functions involving apoptosis, such as cytotoxicity by CTLs and immunoregulatory AICD and their associated pathologies.

Then the MTOC (or MVB) PI was calculated by dividing the distance between the MTOC<sup>C</sup> (or MVB<sup>C</sup>) projection and the Cell<sup>C</sup> (‘B’ or ‘A’ distance, respectively) by the distance between the Cell<sup>C</sup> and the synapse (‘C’ distance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Cell<sup>C</sup> position was taken as the origin to measure distances, thus those ‘A’ and ‘B’ values in the opposite direction to the synapse were taken as negative. Thus, PI (PI = A/C or B/C) ranked from +1 (fully polarized) to –1 (fully anti-polarized). Therefore, PI values were normalized by cell size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernández-Hermira et al., 2023</xref>) and measured the relative ability of MTOC and MVB to polarize toward the IS. Remarkably, one important feature of the IS consists of both the onset of the initial cell-cell contacts and the establishment of a mature, fully productive IS are intrinsically stochastic, rapid, and asynchronous processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Friedl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calvo and Izquierdo, 2018</xref>). Thus, the score of the PI corresponding to the distance of MTOC/MVB with respect to the IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kupfer and Singer, 1989</xref>) may be contaminated by background MTOC/MVB polarization, in great part due to the stochastic nature of IS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). In order to circumvent this caveat, a substantial number of IS of each cell group/condition were analyzed to obtain statistically significant results, as reported by numerous authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duchez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Obino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Obino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bello-Gamboa et al., 2020</xref>). Image analysis data correspond to at least three different experiments, analyzing a minimum of 30 synapses from 15 different, randomly selected, microscopy fields per experiment. ANOVA was performed for statistical significance of the results using Excel and IBM’s SPSS Statistics software, followed by Tukey’s post hoc analyses (provided as Source data).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-96942-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Tukey’s post hoc analyses corresponding to all dot plot figures.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96942-data1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>We declare we have deposited our Source data (Excel dataset) corresponding to all the dot plot data presented in this contribution with Dryad, a generic public repositorie, and thus the materials described in the manuscript, including all relevant raw data, will be freely available to any researcher wishing to use them for non-commercial purposes, without breaching participant confidentiality.

They demonstrate that FMNL1beta is indeed phosphorylated on S1086 in a PKCdelta-dependent manner and that S1086-phosphorylated FMNL1beta acts downstream of PKCdelta to regulate centrosome and MVB polarization to the IS and exosome release. They provide evidence that FMNL1beta accumulates at the IS where it promotes F-actin clearance from the IS center, thus allowing for MVB secretion.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The work is based on a solid rationale, which includes previous findings by the authors establishing a link between PKCdelta, FMNL1beta phosphorylation, synaptic F-actin clearance and MVB polarization to the IS. The authors have thoroughly addressed the working hypotheses using robust tools.

The evidence presented in the Jurkat model is solid, but concerns have been raised about the statistical analysis and more details would be required to fully assess the significance of the results. For example, ANOVA is the method described, but it requires large amounts of normally distributed data in multiple groups and cannot be used to make pairwise comparisons within groups, which would require a post-hoc method (which is not discussed). In addition, the data showing forming-like 1 β in primary human T cells without and with a CAR are provided without quantification and don't investigate any of the novel claims, so doesn't address the relevance of Formin-like 1 β beyond the Jurkat model. Nonetheless, the consistent trends in the body of the study provide solid support for the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this general statement on statistics. Thus, we have now discussed and provided more details on the post-hoc method (Tukey), as a new Supplementary data S13 (p-values after applying tukey's method -post hoc- to the one-way anova for all the pairwise comparisons). Additionally, we have now provided quantitative data on the percentage of primary cells with and without CAR that show FMNL1 accumulations at the immune synapse (Suppl. Fig. S7). Regarding the data in primary human T cells, we have already changed the title of the manuscript to strictly adjust it to the main body of the data and our conclusions in the well-established Jurkat synapse model. We also want to emphasize that we have not pretended to extrapolate the relevance of our data regarding FMNL1 and exosomes beyond the Jurkat model. Thus, we have included some additional sentences and/or nuances in the Discussion to somewhat soften our statements in this regard (i.e. “…..provided that the FMNL1 effect on exosome secretion in Jurkat cells can be extended to primary T lymphocytes”) and to clarify this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>(1) The main findings have been obtained in clones of Jurkat cells. They have not been confirmed in primary T cells. The only experiment performed in primary cells is shown in Figure S7 (primary human T lymphoblasts) for which only the distribution of FMNL1 is shown without quantification. No results presenting the effect of FMNL1 KO and expression of mutants in primary T cells are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Referee is right regarding the extension of exosome secretion studies to primary human T lymphocytes. Unfortunately, it is well known that primary T lymphocytes are extremely difficult to transfect. Moreover, the expression of our large bi-cistronic large plasmids (&gt;15 Kb) is very inefficient, coupled with the challenge of expressing large proteins, such as the 180 kDa YFP-FMNL1 chimeric variants. The convergence of all these undesirable factors synergistically hampers these studies and we have been unable to consistently achieve enough transfection efficiency to perform these experiments. However, the role of FMNL1 on MTOC/MVB polarization in Jurkat cells, confirmed in this manuscript, has been already extended to primary CD8+ T cell clones (DOI10.1016/j.immuni.2007.01.008). Given that exosome secretion requires</p><p>MTOC/MVB polarization both in Jurkat and primary T lymphoblasts (10.1038/cdd.2010.184, 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00851), this suggests FMNL1 may also control exosome secretion in primary T cells, although the formal demonstration will require further research.</p><p>A new sentence has been included in the Discussion to address this important point. Regarding the second request, we have quantified the images mentioned in Suppl. Fig. S7, and the percentages of fixed T cells showing FMNL1 accumulations at the immune synapse are included in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Analysis in- depth of the defect in actin remodeling (quantification of the images, analysis of some key actors of actin remodeling) is still lacking. Only Factin is shown, no attempt to look more precisely at actors of actin remodeling has been done.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right. Since we have obtained new results on the role of FMNL1 on actin remodeling, we have focused on this formin, which is already a key actor in this process. In this context, we have previously shown that the formin Dia1, another major actor of actin remodeling in T lymphocytes along with FMNL1 (DOI10.1016/j.immuni.2007.01.008), does not undergo phosphorylation upon PKC activation (Suppl. Fig. 5 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1759926">https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1759926</ext-link>). Since our aim was to unravel the PKC-mediated pathway controlling actin remodeling, we have ruled out more studies on Dia1. Therefore, we have included a new sentence to emphasize the specific role of FMNL1 phosphorylation, but not Dia1, in this regard. Nonetheless, future studies aimed to identifying new important players in this or related pathways could offer significant insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The defect in the secretion of extracellular vesicles is still very preliminary. Examples of STED images given by the authors are nice, yet no quantification is performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right regarding this point and we acknowledge this comment. Accordingly, we have now quantified the STED images and provided numerical data on the percentages of cells exhibiting the observed phenotypes (see the figure legend for Fig. 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Results shown in Figure S12 on the colocalization of proteins phosphorylated on Ser/Thr are still not convincing. It seems indeed that &quot;phospho-PKC&quot; is labeling more preferentially the CMAC positive cells (Raji) than the Jurkat T cells. It is thus particularly difficult to conclude on the colocalization and even more on the recruitment of phosphorylated-FMNL1 at the IS. Thus, these experiments are not conclusive and cannot be the basis even for their cautious conclusion: &quot;Although all these data did not allow us to infer that FMNL1b is phosphorylated at the IS due to the resolution limit of confocal and STED microscopes, the results are compatible with the idea that both endogenous FMNL1 and YFP-FMNL1bWT are specifically phosphorylated at the cIS&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee may be correct regarding the detail of the &quot;phospho-PKC&quot; labeling. However, it cannot be overlooked that Raji cells also contain proteins that are or may be potential PKC substrates. As a matter of fact, Raji cells also express FMNL1. In addition, MHCII triggering in B cells induces PKC activation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.200323351">https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.200323351</ext-link>). Regarding which cell type is preferentially labeled, this is a variable topic depending on the analyzed synapse.</p><p>It is true that there are likely several PKC substrates, both in Jurkat in Raji cells, but our point is that one of these substrates either colocalizes with FMNL1 or is FMNL1 itself. We do not claim at any point that FMNL1 is the only PKC substrate, neither in Jurkat or in Raji cells.</p><p>Apparently, the referee has either overlooked our results or we did not emphasize them sufficiently. Our results effectively validated the PKC substrate antibody, both on endogenous phospho-FMNL1 and phospho-YFPFMNL1β by WB (Fig. 3). Moreover, the phospho-PKC does not recognize</p><p>YFP-FMNL1β S1086A or S1086D variants (Fig. 3). Last, but not least, when FMNL1 is interfered in the Jurkat cell, the phospho-PKC does not colocalize with FMNL1, but it strongly colocalizes at the synapse with expressed YFPFMNL1βWT in the Jurkat cell (Fig. S11). Indeed YFP-FMNL1β belonged to the Jurkat cell. Taken together these results demonstrate: 1. the specificity of phospho-PKC antibody, 2. the phospho-PKC antibody certainly recognizes phosphorylated YFP-FMNL1β but not its non-phosphorylatable mutant variants, 3. the colocalization of phospho-PKC with anti-FMNL1 is specific. We have included some sentences to clarify these points and to avoid possible misunderstandings by potential readers. We acknowledge the referee for his/her clarifying point, and we firmly believe our mentioned cautious conclusion is strictly correct, although we have tuned it to consider the possibility that a different PKC substrate could be closely associated to FMNL1, producing the observed colocalization: “Although all these data do not yet allow us to infer that FMNL1b is phosphorylated at the IS due to the resolution limits of super resolution microscopy and the possibility that another PKC substrate may be associated to FMNL1 or very close to FMNL1, in a strictly S1086-dependent manner”.</p><p>To clear any doubt regarding which cell is labelled with phospho-PKC, we have changed the lower panels in Suppl. Fig. S12, and now is more evident that FMNL1 and phospho-PKC belong to the Jurkat cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study would benefit from a more careful statistical analysis. The dot plots showing polarity are presented for one experiment. Yet, the distribution of the polarity is broad. Results of the 3 independent experiments should be shown and a statistical analysis performed on the independent experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right and we have now included further post-hoc analyses data (Tukey) at Suppl. Fig S13. Tukey’s test values were included for all the dot plot figures. We have not included all the plots from 3 different experiments since the manuscript already contains 10+12 multi panel figures and is too large. However, we have stated in the figure legend that these independent experiments are representative of the data obtained from 3 independent experiments. Referee’s consideration regarding the broad distribution of polarity data is correct. We included in the first version of the manuscript a sentence in this regard, that it may have been overlooked: “Remarkably, one important feature of the IS consists of both the onset of the initial cell-cell contacts and the establishment of a mature, fully productive IS, are intrinsically stochastic, rapid and asynchronous processes (87, 88) (43). Thus, the score of the PI corresponding to the distance of MTOC/MVB with respect the IS (42) may be contaminated by background MTOC/MVB polarization, in great part due to the stochastic nature of IS formation (87)”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
