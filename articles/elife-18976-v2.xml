of potassium channels fine-tunes the electrical signaling in excitable cells through an internal timing mechanism that is mediated by a hydrogen bond network in the channels' selectively filter. Previously, we used nonsense suppression to highlight the role of the conserved Trp434-Asp447 indole hydrogen bond in Shaker potassium channels with a non-hydrogen bonding homologue of tryptophan, Ind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pless et al., 2013</xref>). Here, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Trp434Ind hydrogen bonding partner, Asp447, unexpectedly 'flips out' towards the extracellular environment, allowing water to penetrate the space behind the selectivity filter while simultaneously reducing the local negative electrostatic charge. Additionally, a protein engineering approach is presented whereby split intein sequences are flanked by endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motifs (ERret) are incorporated into the N- or C- termini of Shaker monomers or within sodium channels two-domain fragments. This system enabled stoichiometric control of Shaker monomers and the encoding of multiple amino acids within a channel tetramer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18976.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18976.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>atomic mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>C-type inactivation</kwd><kwd>noncanonical amino acids</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>intein protein ligation</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated sodium channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galpin</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahern</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name><name><surname>Infield</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galpin</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahern</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>062342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A22180002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahern</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Pless, 2013), we argue that side-chain 'flip out' is a key event in potassium channel C-type inactivation, and propose a new method for encoding multiple noncanonical amino acids and controlling protein stoichiometry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>C-type inactivation, also termed ‘slow-inactivation’ due to its delayed kinetics, in voltage-gated potassium channels describes a phenomenon by which ionic conductance through the channel pore is decreased in the presence of continued depolarizing stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>). In a physiological setting, this mechanism represents a form of activity-dependent macromolecular memory that can alter action-potential firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldrich et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roeper et al., 1997</xref>). The basis for C-type inactivation has been investigated with functional, structural and computational approaches, which have produced a consensus mechanism whereby channels become non-conducting due to local perturbations in the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yellen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kiss and Korn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perozo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roux and MacKinnon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernèche and Roux, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cordero-Morales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panyi and Deutsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thomson et al., 2014</xref>). However, the nature of the conformational change and role of specific residues remain an area of active experimentation and debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devaraneni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoshi and Armstrong, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified an intra- and inter-subunit hydrogen bond network that controls the rate of entry into the non-conducting pore conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pless et al., 2013</xref>). Our study employed nonsense suppression in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte expression system to genetically encode a variety of synthetic noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). In the context of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte, the cRNA of the target protein contains an introduced stop codon (often <italic>amber,</italic> TAG) that is subsequently suppressed by a co-injected orthogonal tRNA that has been misacylated in vitro with the ncAA. This approach was used to encode a tryptophan homologue, 2-amino-3-indol-1-yl-propionic acid (referred to as Ind) that fails to participate in hydrogen bonding at position 434, a site previously identified as being important for channel inactivation. Our original efforts failed to determine the functional role of individual hydrogen bonds with Ind because subunit concatenation in the tetrameric construct resulted in a significant loss of expressing channels, an outcome that prevented the application of nonsense suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pless et al., 2013</xref>). Reduced channel expression is a common challenge of the nonsense suppression method where amino acid incorporation varies greatly from position to position within a single reading frame and between channel families. Furthermore, given the central role of the Trp434-Asp447 hydrogen bond in the mechanism of C-type inactivation, it was not possible to simultaneously encode Ind within each of the four subunits of the channel because this resulted in a non-conducting phenotype which lacked the relatively high expression levels needed to measure gating currents which originate from the movement of the channel voltage-sensor in the transmembrane electric field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, we concluded that while one can control the stoichiometry of individual subunit composition in a concatenated construct, their low expression impeded the use of nonsense suppression in combination with this approach. In our original publication, this shortcoming was partially overcome by combining WT cRNA with Ind-tRNA and Trp434TAG cRNA within an individual oocyte. This experimental approach resulted in predicted accelerated, but complex, inactivation kinetics consistent with a mixed population of channels with 1, 2 or 3 Ind434-containing monomers (see Figure 2F, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pless et al., 2013</xref>, <italic>eLife</italic>). In the present study, we examined the mechanism of Ind-induced inactivation by generating a new approach to control subunit stoichiometry to test individual hydrogen bond contributions in <italic>Shaker</italic> channel C-type inactivation and more generally, for the encoding of multiple ncAA within a single channel or an ion channel complex in the application of nonsense suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular dynamic simulations of Ind and the Trp434-Asp447 hydrogen bond</title><p>Targeted replacement of Trp434 with the isosteric ncAA Ind was used previously to highlight the general importance of the indole hydrogen bond of this highly conserved Trp residue.

For instance, it is not known if the Ind substitution would specifically limit hydrogen bonding at the indole nitrogen atom (the purpose for which it was designed) or could it also produce a new side-chain orientation that itself alters protein function. A computational approach based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was therefore employed to examine the local dynamics of the Ind side-chain and its relation to the intra-subunit hydrogen bond accepting side-chain Asp447. These MD simulations reveal key conformational and dynamic differences between wild type (WT) and Trp434Ind of the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel selectivity filter in the conductive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In WT <italic>Shaker</italic>, a hydrogen bond is formed between Trp434 and Asp447, restraining the two residues close to each other during a large fraction of a 500 ns trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

First, the formation of a hydrogen bond between Asp447-Trp434 in the wild type blocks the exchange of water molecules between extracellular bulk and the water binding pocket behind the selectivity filter, as shown in the water occupancy map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. In the absence of this hydrogen bond in Trp434Ind, the increased spatial separation of Asp447 and Trp434Ind promotes the formation of a continuous connection between the bulk solution and the water molecules in the buried pocket. The easier accessibility of the buried water-binding pocket probably accelerates C-type inactivation of <italic>Shaker</italic>. Second, the flipping of Asp447 leads to an additional effect to the selectivity filter. Considering Asp447 in each subunit carries a negative charge, the reorientation of the Asp447 side-chain from facing inside to outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) perturbs the local electrostatic potential at the outer end of the selectivity filter, altering the binding affinity of potassium ions in multiple binding sites, and is likely to shift the relative stability between conductive and nonconductive states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A strategy for defining the stoichiometry of multimeric protein complexes</title><p>An engineered protein approach was designed to circumvent issues raised with expressing <italic>Shaker</italic> monomer concatemers: complementary split inteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muralidharan and Muir, 2006</xref>), were incorporated into the N- or C- termini of <italic>Shaker</italic> monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Split inteins drive a post-translational event involving precise excision of the intein sequence and formation of a normal peptide bond between the flanking sequences (N- and C-exteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saleh and Perler, 2006</xref>). We reasoned that <italic>Shaker</italic> monomers would form split intein-dependent dimers, and <italic>Shaker</italic> channels would consist of dimers of dimers. In order to exclude nonconforming <italic>Shaker</italic> monomers from the surface membrane, we encoded endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval (ER<sub>ret</sub>) motifs which flank the split inteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that would be removed following the intein ligation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used the Kir6.2 ER<sub>ret</sub> motif because it works in a variety of eukaryotic cell types, has strong retention properties, and functions independently from its position within a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zerangue et al., 1999</xref>). Oocytes injected with only one of the monomer cRNAs did not show measurable voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> selective currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panels). This is presumably due to the retention of the monomers within the ER as a result of the appended ER<sub>ret</sub> motifs. In contrast, co-expression of <italic>Shaker</italic> monomers with complementary split inteins resulted in robust outward voltage-dependent potassium currents due to the nature of the split intein protein ligation mechanism. The formation of tetrameric dimer-of-dimer complexes with no ER<sub>ret</sub> motif allows trafficking of <italic>Shaker</italic> channels from the ER to the plasma membrane. The level of expressed potassium current was stable over a large range of injected <italic>Shaker</italic> monomer cRNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) suggesting a limiting cellular component in channel assembly and/or trafficking. This method allows for control of subunit stoichiometry and the possibility for encoding multiple Ind side-chains within a single channel tetramer by placing the introduced TAG mutation within one (or both) of the two complementary fragments that form a dimer.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18976.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Attachment of ER retention/retrieval motifs paired with split inteins results in co-dependent surface membrane expression of <italic>Shaker</italic> channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of either <italic>Shaker</italic> channel with C-terminal appended Kir6.2 ER retention/retrieval motif (ER<sub>ret</sub>; yellow) with N-intein (red) (<bold>A</bold>, left) or <italic>Shaker</italic> channel with N-terminal appended Kir6.2 ER retention/retrieval motif (yellow) with C-intein (green) (<bold>A</bold>, right), resulted in negligible ionic current (<bold>A</bold>, lower panels).Representative currents in lower panel <bold>A</bold>, are raw capacitance and ionic currents that are blanked above and below 25 and −5µA, respectively.

Previously, it has been shown that both sodium and calcium channels are amenable to functional complementation via expression of ‘split’ hemi-channels consisting of DI-DIII and DIV or DI-II and DIII-DIV, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stühmer et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern et al., 2001</xref>). This result suggests that sodium and calcium channels need not be tethered on a single polypeptide to form a functional tetrameric channel. We therefore reasoned that co-assembly of sodium channel domains I-II and III-IV would likely bring ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein sequences on the C-terminus of DI-II and the N-terminus of DIII-IV in close proximity and promote intein dependent cleavage of the ER<sub>ret</sub> sequences and formation of a peptide bond between domains II and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To this end, cRNA for Nav1.4 DI-II and DIII-IV ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein containing hemi-channel fragments were expressed in Xenopus oocyte and subsequent currents were recorded by TEVC. As with the <italic>Shaker</italic> intein constructs, expression of either individual fragment did not result in expressed ionic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; triangles and squares). However, co-expression of the split Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 halves resulted in robust inward voltage-gated sodium currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C– D</xref>, diamonds) similar to WT full-length channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, circles). Notably, full-length sodium channels produced from the ER<sub>ret</sub>-inteins had biophysical properties that were indistinguishable from WT sodium channels, p&gt;0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. To examine the general versatility of the approach, we expressed the Na<sub>V</sub>1.4hemi-channel construct cDNA by transient transfection into HEK293 cells and examined the ligation efficiency by Western blot using C-terminal HA epitopes that are on both N- and C-channel fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the case of the DI-II-HA construct, this epitope is cleaved out during the in-cell ligation reaction but the full-length channel can still be identified by the remaining C-terminal HA epitope on the DIII-IV protein (see methods for protein sequence and construct design). The Western blot data show that each hemi-channel is robustly expressed, producing bands of ~150 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 2) and ~110 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 3) for the DI-II-HA and DIII-DIV-HA truncated constructs, respectively. Co-expression of the channel halves resulted in the formation of a ~250 kDa band (lanes 4 and 5) similar to WT Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 full-length channels (lane 1). The efficiency of protein ligation was similar to that of intein ligated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel hemi-channel fragments where also, interestingly, the fragment corresponding to the DIII-IV construct was limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramanyam et al., 2013</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the ligation reaction occurred during sample preparation, i.e after the fragments had been solubilized, cell lysates from Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 DI-II or DIII-IV expressing HEK cells were mixed and then incubated for 10, 30 or 60 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. No higher band corresponding with the full-length Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 was observed at these time points. Thus, the biochemical data demonstrate that the Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 DI-II and DIII-IV ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein constructs are competent in HEK cells where they are ligated to produce full-length sodium channels.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18976.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ERret-intein construction allows for expression of functional split WT Nav1.4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein with ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein sequence engineered on the C- (blue) and N-terminus (orange) of domains I-II and III-IV, respectively.

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> with <italic>Shaker</italic> ER<sub>ret</sub>-inteins show that this approach can be used to produce tetrameric K<sup>+</sup> channel complexes containing two ncAA, but these are within the dimer of dimers K<sup>+</sup> channel structural context (i.e. not within the same polypeptide). In contrast, double suppression within the same reading frame poses a particular challenge. Specifically, the ability of an acylated tRNA in the oocyte expression system to suppress stop sites has variable efficiency that is compounded when two stop sites are present, resulting in the expression of full-length channels that are far below that of WT channels, and often immeasurable using electrophysiological methods. Thus, suppression at the second site down-stream from the first compounds the overall efficiency of producing a full-length peptide. We hypothesized that if the two sites are suppressed independently, within the individual Nav1.4 I-II and III-IV hemi-channels for instance, and then subsequently ligated via the ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein sequences that the reduced expression would not be compounded but only limited by the site with the lower suppression efficiency. To test this possibility directly, stop (TAG) sites were engineered into the DI-II construct at Tyr401 near the outer vestibule of the selectivity filter and within the DIII-IV hemi-channel at Phe1304, a site within the DIII-IV linker. When expressed as hemi-channels, the simultaneous dual suppression with Phe-tRNA at Tyr401 and Phe1304 yielded macroscopic sodium currents with gating similar to wildtype Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 demonstrating that the split ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein method enables dual suppression, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.

MD simulations indicate that the Trp434Ind substitution alters the orientation of the hydrogen bond partner, Asp447. Notably, the ‘flipped out’ orientation of Asp447 occurs in WT channels, but does so briefly and returns to the hydrogen-bonded state. Thus, the simulations suggest that the Ind substitution increases the likelihood of the ‘flipped out’ Asp447 conformation, which disrupts the local environment of the selectivity filter. This orientation of Asp447 allows water to fill the space behind the selectivity filter and simultaneously alters the local electrostatics properties, two outcomes that likely impact the occupancy of potassium ions in the filter. One possibility is that the reorientation of Asp447 may represent an event in the mechanism of C-type inactivation as the channel transitions from the open/conductive (O/C) to a C-type inactivated conformation (O/I), see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panyi and Deutsch, 2007</xref>. Further, the breakage of two versus one of the four Asp447-Trp434 hydrogen bonds further accelerates C-type inactivation, possibly due to the loss of an additional hydrogen bond and ultimately results in a concomitant destabilization of the open pore. However, the data do not inform on the details of movements required to break the hydrogen bonds or the nature of the final non-conducting state, an event that occurs downstream from hydrogen bond breakage.</p><p>We previously attempted to understand domain-specific contributions of hydrogen bonding and C-type inactivation with a <italic>Shaker</italic> concatemer with all four subunits tethered into a single peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). However, while this construct tolerated a single Trp434Phe mutation by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pless et. al, 2013</xref>, <italic>eLife</italic>) encoding an ncAA was not feasible as the concatemer displayed a significant decrease in overall expression, a common effect of protein concatenation. Here we describe a protein engineering approach for altering side-chain chemistry prior to concatenation that produces macroscopic potassium currents from <italic>Shaker</italic> channels containing two Ind amino acids. Split intein sequences have been used to ligate a variety of protein fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shah and Muir, 2014</xref>) and the ER<sub>ret</sub> motif used in this study has been shown to work in several types of eukaryotic cells including yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zerangue et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, this approach could be used to examine other proteins in other cellular environments for studying the effects of dominant negative mutations, heteromers, etc. Western blot data of expressed Nav1.4 ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein hemi-channels demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach outside of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte expression system and also suggests the ER<sub>ret</sub>-intein can be transferred to other channel types aside from potassium channels. Encoding of multiple ncAA within an individual protein complex remains a significant challenge. Where success is reported, it stems primarily from improving the efficiency of the suppression process and tRNA delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neumann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lammers et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the approach described here changes the nature of the dual suppression problem by rescuing each transcript independently prior to protein ligation thus abrogating the loss of expression due to the compounded efficiency of multiple suppression events. Further, the sodium channel data obtained with dual TAG sites suggests that the approach will be useful for suppression of multiple stop sites, a possibility that will be valuable for encoded FRET, once such probes become available.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Initial coordinates for the molecular dynamic simulations were modeled based on the crystal structure of Kv1.2/Kv2.1 Voltage-gated potassium channel chimera (PDB ID:2R9R).

The intein sequence was followed by tandem human influenza hemagglutinin (<italic>HA</italic>) epitope sequences (underlined) that were used as both flexible linkers and for Western blot analysis. The HA linker was followed by the Kir6.2 ER retention/retrieval motif (italics) and canonical KKXX ER retention/retrieval motif (italics underlined) (<bold>CLSYETEILTVEYGLLPIGKIVEKRIECTVYSVDNNGNIYTQPVAQWHDRGEQEVFEYCLEDGSLIRATKDHKFMTVDGQMLPIDEIFERELDLMRVDNLPN</bold><underline>YPYDVPDYAYPYDVPDY</underline><italic>LLDALTLASSRGPLRKRSVAVAKAKPKFSISPDSLS</italic>PR<italic><underline>KKFQ</underline></italic>stop).

DNA template 20 µg of annealed oligonucleotides coding for the tRNA preceded by a T7 promoter were used (Forward: ATTCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTCTATAGTATAGCGGTTAGTACTGGGGACTCTAAATCCCTTGACCTGGGTTCGAATCCCAGTAGGACCGC; Reverse:</p><p>GCGGTCCTACTGGGATTCGAACCCAGGTCAAGGGATTTAGAGTCCCCAGTACTAACCGCTATACTATAGAACCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACGAAT; Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The total reaction volume was adjusted to 100 µl and the kit reagents were added in the following amounts: 10 µl of 10X T7-Scribe transcription buffer, 7.5 µl of each nucleotide (100 mM stocks), 10 µl of 100 mM Dithiothreitol, 2.5 µl ScriptGuard RNase Inhibitor, 10 µl T7-Scribe enzyme solution. After the reaction was incubated for 4–5 hr at 37°C, the DNA template was digested with 5 µl DNase (1 U/µl) provided with the kit for 30–60 min. The tRNA was extracted from the reaction with acidic phenol chlorophorm (5:1, pH 4.5) and precipitated with ethanol. The precipitates tRNA was pelleted, washed, dried and resuspended in 100 µl DEPC-treated water and further purified with Chroma Spin-30 columns (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The procedure yielded roughly 100 µl of ~5 µg/µl tRNA that was stored in aliquots at −80°C. Prior to the ligation reaction of the 73-mer THG73 to the ncAA-pCA conjugate (or just the pCA to yield a complete, nonacylated tRNA), the tRNA was folded in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) by heating at 94°C for 3 min and subsequent gradual cool-down to ~10°C. 25 µg of folded tRNA in 30 µl of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) were mixed with 28 µl of DEPC-treated water, 8 µl of 3 mM ncAA-pCA (or pCA) dimethylsulphoxide stock, 8 µl of 10X T4 RNA Ligase 1 buffer, 1 µl 10 mM ATP and 5 µl of T4 RNA Ligase 1 (New England Biolabs. Ipswich, MA) then incubated at 4°C for 2 hr. The (misacylated) tRNA was extracted from the samples with acidic phenol chlorophorm (5:1, pH 4.5) and precipitated with ethanol. The precipitated tRNA pellets were washed, dried in a Speedvac and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (stage V and VI) were purchased from Ecocyte (Austin, TX).

For many years it has been known that a single substitution at the position 443 of the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel (W434F) yields a protein non-functional, presumably deeply C-type inactivated. C-type inactivation gating is widely accepted to be the functional collapse of the channel's selectivity filter. Structural changes at the channel's selectivity filter have been proposed to produce its structural collapse causing C-type inactivation and ceasing in this way ion conduction. The Lueck et al. paper deal with the identification of molecular interactions that are crucial in determining the conductive conformation of the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel selectivity filter. Particularly interesting to keep the Shaker channel conductive is the highly conserved indole hydrogen bond between the pair Trp434-Asp447. It has been shown before by Dr. Ahern group that the incorporation of a non-hydrogen bonding homologue of tryptophan at position 434 obliterate ion conduction, presumably by constitutively C-type inactivating the Shaker channel, which is similar to the phenotype displayed by the mutation W343F. In this sequel of the previous paper by Pless, Galpin et al. 2013, the authors make two very provocative and significant observations that notably contribute to cement our understanding about C-type inactivation gating in K<sup>+</sup> channels. First, they propose, based in MD simulation studies, that the Asp447 flips out toward the channel external vestibule and gives space for water molecules to enter a &quot;crack or crevice&quot; behind the channel selectivity filter. This event (the hydration of this crack) and/or a change in the electrostatic potential around the potassium binding sites of the channel's selectivity filter, trigger the functional collapse of latter. Second, the authors in a very innovative way present a new strategy to dissect the contribution of each subunit within the homotetramer channel to the C-type inactivation process. These combined strategies and the ideas derived from this experimental approach I think will be well received among the members of the ion channel community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following revisions will be required for acceptance:</p><p>1) It would have been very powerful and conclusive to perform an SDS PAGE analysis documenting the tetrameric &quot;dimer of dimer complexes&quot; obtained after removal of the ERret motif and putative recovering of trafficking to the oocyte membranes.</p><p>2) A more complete statistical analysis is required. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is missing a more detailed characterization of the ERret-intein cRNAs constructs to conclude they show &quot;WT-like currents&quot;.

The resubmitted manuscript now contains new Western blot data demonstrating the high fidelity of in-cell protein ligation using newly designed sodium hemi-channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The reason for using sodium channels was two-fold. First, to further demonstrate the versatility of the approach in terms of channel type, second, the expression system used for these experiments was HEK cells as opposed to <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. Thus the data support the notion that the ERret/intein sequences are generally tolerated between channel and cell types.</p><p><italic>2) A more complete statistical analysis is required. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is missing a more detailed characterization of the ERret-intein cRNAs constructs to conclude they show &quot;WT-like currents&quot;.
