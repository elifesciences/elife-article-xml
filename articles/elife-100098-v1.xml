cell migration. While CXCR4 couples to G proteins and directly promotes cell migration, ACKR3 is G-protein-independent and scavenges CXCL12 to regulate extracellular chemokine levels and maintain CXCR4 responsiveness, thereby indirectly influencing migration. The receptors also have distinct activation requirements. CXCR4 only responds to wild-type CXCL12 and is sensitive to mutation of the chemokine. By contrast, ACKR3 recruits GPCR kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins and promiscuously responds to CXCL12, CXCL12 variants, other peptides and proteins, and is relatively insensitive to mutation. To investigate the role of conformational dynamics in the distinct pharmacological behaviors of CXCR4 and ACKR3, we employed single-molecule FRET to track discrete conformational states of the receptors in real-time. The data revealed that apo-CXCR4 preferentially populates a high-FRET inactive state, while apo-ACKR3 shows little conformational preference and high transition probabilities among multiple inactive, intermediate and active conformations, consistent with its propensity for activation. Multiple active-like ACKR3 conformations are populated in response to agonists, compared to the single CXCR4 active-state. This and the markedly different conformational landscapes of the receptors suggest that activation of ACKR3 may be achieved by a broader distribution of conformational states than CXCR4. Much of the conformational heterogeneity of ACKR3 is linked to a single residue that differs between ACKR3 and CXCR4. The dynamic properties of ACKR3 may underly its inability to form productive interactions with G proteins that would drive canonical GPCR signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemokine receptor</kwd><kwd>single-molecule FRET</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>ACKR3</kwd><kwd>conformational dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM133157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Handel</surname><given-names>Tracy M</given-names></name><name><surname>Millar</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019346</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA254402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Handel</surname><given-names>Tracy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI161880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Handel</surname><given-names>Tracy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM137505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>Christopher T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM115017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pauszek</surname><given-names>Raymond F</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI007354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pauszek</surname><given-names>Raymond F</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013961</institution-id><institution>Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Irvington Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustavsson</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conformational dynamics and landscapes of the related chemokine receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, revealed by single-molecule analysis, provide mechanistic insights into differences in constitutive activity, ligand promiscuity, and effector coupling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is one of the most intensively studied chemokine receptors due to its central role in driving cell migration during development and immune responses, and in cancer where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balkwill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Domanska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawaguchi et al., 2019</xref>). As a class A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), CXCR4 activates inhibitory Gαi protein signaling pathways to directly control cell movement in response to the chemokine CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kufareva et al., 2017</xref>). The activated receptor is also phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), which promotes arrestin recruitment and cessation of the G protein signal. CXCR4 often works together with atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3, formerly CXCR7) which indirectly influences migration by scavenging CXCL12 to regulate available extracellular levels of the agonist and in turn the responsiveness of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nibbs and Graham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vacchini et al., 2016</xref>). In the absence of ACKR3 scavenging, excessive CXCL12 stimulation of CXCR4 leads to downregulation, resulting in profound effects on neuronal cell migration and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saaber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wong et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to CXCR4 and with some exceptions noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Odemis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fumagalli et al., 2020</xref>), ACKR3 lacks G protein activity and instead is considered to be arrestin-biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajagopal et al., 2010</xref>). However, we and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saaber et al., 2019</xref> have shown that arrestins are dispensable for chemokine scavenging while GRK phosphorylation is critical for this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schafer et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that ACKR3 might be better described as GRK-biased. The molecular basis for its inability to couple to G proteins in most cell types remains an unanswered question. Our recently determined structures of ACKR3-ligand complexes showed the expected hallmarks of GPCR activation including ‘microswitch residues’ in active state configurations, displacement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) away from the helical bundle and an open intracellular pocket, consistent with a receptor that should be able to activate G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, we replaced the intracellular loops (ICLs) of ACKR3 with those of CXCR2, a canonical G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor; however, these changes did not lead to G protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the lack of coupling is not due to the absence of specific residue interactions. CXCL12 also adopts a distinct pose when bound to ACKR3 compared to CXCR4 and all other chemokines in chemokine-receptor complexes, but since small molecules induce similar biased effector responses, the chemokine pose cannot explain the effector-coupling bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>). Having excluded other mechanisms we therefore surmised that the inability of ACKR3 to activate G proteins may be due to differences in receptor dynamics. Consistent with this hypothesis, the ICLs observed in ACKR3-agonist complexes are disordered, which may preclude productive effector coupling. The dynamic nature of ACKR3 is also suggested by its considerable constitutive activity in recruiting β-arrestins and its high level of constitutive internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopkins et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naumann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their distinct effector interactions, ACKR3 and CXCR4 have dramatically different susceptibilities to activation by different ligands. CXCR4 is activated by a single chemokine agonist, CXCL12. Moreover, modifications of the CXCL12 N-terminal signaling domain (e.g. single point mutations as in CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> or multiple mutations as in CXCL12<sub>LRHQ</sub>) transform the chemokine into an antagonist of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaracz-Ros et al., 2020</xref>). Mutational analysis, modeling, and new structures of CXCR4 suggest that ligand activation involves a precise network of interacting residues that stabilize the active receptor conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ngo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stephens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saotome et al., 2025</xref>). By contrast, ACKR3 is activated by CXCL12 as well as its variants (including CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> and CXCL12<sub>LRHQ</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaracz-Ros et al., 2020</xref>), other chemokines (CXCL11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burns et al., 2006</xref>), other proteins (adrenomedullin, BAM22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda et al., 2013</xref>), and opioid peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyrath et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, most ligands for ACKR3 act as agonists, which is best explained by a non-specific ‘distortion’ mechanism of activation whereby any ligand that breaches the binding pocket causes helical movements that are permissive to GRK phosphorylation and arrestin recruitment. A distortion mechanism is consistent with the different binding poses observed for a small molecule agonist compared to the CXCL12 N-terminus in the receptor orthosteric pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>), and ligand bulk rather than specific interactions between agonist and ACKR3 being required for activation. We hypothesize that this distortion mechanism would also be facilitated by a receptor that is conformationally dynamic, by enabling nonspecific ligand interactions and more than a single conformation to promote activation.</p><p>To investigate the role of conformational dynamics in the distinct pharmacological behaviors of ACKR3 and CXCR4, we developed a single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) approach. Many ensemble methods such as EPR, NMR and fluorescence-based methods have provided considerable insights into GPCR dynamics, conformational heterogeneity, and exchange between distinct structural states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wingler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fay and Farrens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elgeti and Hubbell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wingler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ray et al., 2023</xref>). However, these methods are limited in their ability to resolve the sequence of state-to-state transitions except in rare cases where transitions can be temporally coordinated with high precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schafer et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast smFRET enables detection of sparsely populated states, reveals the sequence of state-to-state transitions and provides kinetic information through analysis of state dwell times. For example, smFRET studies of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) revealed a dynamic equilibrium between inactive and active conformations that was responsive to agonist and G protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gregorio et al., 2017</xref>). More recent smFRET studies of the glucagon receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishna Kumar et al., 2023</xref> and the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor A<sub>2A</sub>R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref> have documented the existence of distinct intermediate conformations in addition to inactive and active receptor conformations.</p><p>Here, we present the first smFRET study of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3. Our experimental system allows real-time observation of the conformational fluctuations of individual receptor molecules in a native-like lipid environment and assessment of the differences in the conformational dynamics of the two receptors in their apo states and in response to ligands. Our results indicate that ACKR3 is more dynamic and conformationally heterogeneous than CXCR4 or other class A GPCRs previously studied, which may explain its activation prone nature and lack of G protein coupling. In contrast, CXCR4 appears less flexible, consistent with a more restricted, structurally defined activation mechanism. Together these data characterize the molecular differences between CXCR4 and ACKR3 and suggest that enhanced conformational dynamics plays an important role in the atypical function of ACKR3.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of smFRET experimental systems for CXCR4 and ACKR3</title><p>To visualize conformational fluctuations of CXCR4 and ACKR3 by smFRET, cysteine residues were introduced into CXCR4 at positions 150<sup>4.40</sup> in TM4 and 233<sup>6.29</sup> in TM6, and at 159<sup>4.40</sup> and 245<sup>6.28</sup> in ACKR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) (numbers in superscript refer to the Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering scheme for GPCRs) for covalent labeling with FRET donor (D, Alexa Fluor 555, A555) and acceptor (A, Cyanine5, Cy5) fluorophores.

Accordingly, we anticipated that labeling at the positions indicated above would be sensitive to transitions between inactive and active receptor conformations and would give rise to different donor-acceptor distances and apparent FRET efficiencies that could be resolved by smFRET measurements (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Importantly, neither wild-type (WT) CXCR4 nor ACKR3 exhibited significant labeling, obviating the need to remove any of the native cysteine residues in either receptor.

Several hundred individual receptor-nanodisc complexes were typically observed in the field of view. Individual receptor molecules labeled with a single A555 donor and a single Cy5 acceptor were identified by single-step photobleaching transitions (abrupt loss of acceptor fluorescence signal or simultaneous loss of fluorescence signal in both channels), as shown for two representative ACKR3-nanodisc complexes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

To evaluate the appropriate level of model complexity, each resulting apparent FRET efficiency distribution was fit with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the corresponding Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was calculated. The BIC is a statistical measure of the likelihood that the model describes the data, while also penalizing the addition of parameters that could lead to overfitting of noise. Theoretically, this value will be at a minimum for the model with the appropriate number of states. As an additional criterion, we carefully compared the FRET distributions following the initial HMM analysis for the different models and confirmed that peak positions were consistent across the different experimental conditions.</p><p>These analyses indicated that three FRET states were sufficient to fit the smFRET data for CXCR4 under all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). The resulting apparent FRET efficiency distributions are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>. The predominant high-FRET state (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.85) observed in the apo-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) suggests that TM4 and 6 are in close physical proximity, which is consistent with the conformation of inactive GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palczewski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rasmussen et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, we interpret this FRET state as the inactive conformation of CXCR4 and designate it as R. The minor low-FRET state (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.19) reflects outward movement of TM6 away from TM4, as expected for an active receptor conformation (designated R*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farrens et al., 1996</xref>) and consistent with the limited basal activity of CXCR4. Moreover, there was a major population shift from the high-FRET state to the low-FRET state upon addition of CXCL12<sub>WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with the expected stabilization of active GPCR conformations by agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleist et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otun et al., 2024</xref>). To gain insight into the nature of the mid-FRET state (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.59), we examined the connectivity between all three FRET states. Two-dimensional transition density probability (TDP) plots revealed that the three FRET states were connected in a sequential fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), indicating that the transitions occurred within the same molecules. Notably, these observations exclude the possibility that the mid-FRET state arises from different local fluorophore environments (hence FRET efficiencies) for the two possible labeling orientations of the introduced cysteines: assuming two receptor conformations, this model would produce four distinct FRET states, but only two cross peaks in the TDP plot. Another significant observation is that direct transitions between R and R* states were rarely observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the mid-FRET state represents an intermediate receptor conformation (designated R’) that lies on the pathway between inactive and active conformations. In the apo-state, transitions were mostly observed between states R and R’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while in the presence of CXCL12<sub>WT</sub> the most frequent transitions were observed between the R’ and R* states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ACKR3 exhibits greater conformational flexibility compared to CXCR4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Apparent FRET efficiency histogram of apo-CXCR4 (left, black trace) resolved into three distinct conformational states: a high-FRET state corresponding to the inactive receptor conformation (R, blue), a low-FRET active receptor conformation (R*, red) and an intermediate conformation (R’, gray).

Moreover, the smFRET data for ACKR3 could not be described by three FRET states and the inclusion of a fourth state was necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). The FRET distributions recovered by four-state global analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>. The positions of the high-FRET (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.85) and low-FRET (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.11) peaks are similar to the corresponding peaks observed in CXCR4 and are likewise assigned to inactive (R) and active (R*) conformations, respectively. Consistent with these assignments, the R* state increased in population at the expense of the R state in the presence of the chemokine agonists CXCL12<sub>WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) or CXCL11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). TDP plots indicated that the four FRET states in ACKR3 were connected in a sequential fashion and reside along the receptor activation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Similar to the arguments presented above for CXCR4, the intermediate FRET states are most likely discrete receptor conformations and not arising from mixed labeling of the two introduced cysteines. Accordingly, the mid-FRET peaks (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.39 and <italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.66) are assigned to two intermediate receptor conformations, designated R*’ and R’, respectively. Notably, the R*’ state was not observed in CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The R’ state in ACKR3 decreased in population in the presence of chemokine agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>), suggesting that this state represents an inactive intermediate receptor conformation, consistent with its position on the conformational pathway (closest to R). In striking contrast to apo-CXCR4, apo-ACKR3 populated the four conformational states more or less equally, and all possible sequential conformational transitions were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, ACKR3 is intrinsically more conformationally heterogenous and dynamic than CXCR4. In the presence of CXCL12<sub>WT</sub>, ACKR3 showed more frequent R’ ↔ R*’ and R*’ ↔ R* transitions compared with the apo-receptor, accounting for the population shift towards the R* state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effect of small-molecule ligands on conformational states of CXCR4 and ACKR3</title><p>The small-molecule ligand IT1t is reported to act as an inverse agonist of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perpiñá-Viciano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mona et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosenberg et al., 2019</xref>).

Since structures of ACKR3 show intracellular loop disorder, and progressive structural substitutions within the loops fail to promote G protein coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>), we recently proposed that the atypical nature of ACKR3 may be related to receptor conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, in the present study we found that the conformational dynamics of ACKR3 and the canonical GPCR CXCR4 are indeed markedly different. Our smFRET results revealed four distinct conformations of apo-ACKR3 with approximately equal populations: inactive R, active R*, R’ (inactive-like) and R*’ (active-like; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The state-to-state TDP plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) further reinforced the notion that ACKR3 is a flexible receptor that readily exchanges between different conformational states, consistent with our previous structural studies where a flexible intracellular interface in the absence of interaction partners was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, apo-CXCR4 primarily populates the inactive R state, with only a single intermediate state (R’), and relatively few transitions between states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These observations imply that ACKR3 has a relatively flat energy landscape, with similar energy minima for the different conformations, whereas the energy landscape of CXCR4 is more rugged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For both receptors, the energy barriers between states are sufficiently high that transitions occur relatively slowly with seconds long dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the conformational energy landscapes for CXCR4 and ACKR3, highlighting the differences in the responsiveness of the two receptors to ligands.</title><p>CXCR4 populates three distinct conformations, shown here as wells on the energy landscape. Apo-CXCR4 is predominantly in the inactive R state. The receptor is converted incompletely to R* with CXCL12<sub>WT</sub> treatment, while the small molecule inhibitor IT1t has little impact on the conformational distribution. Though CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> is an antagonist of CXCR4, the ligand promoted a detectable shift to the active R* state, suggesting TM6 movement is not sufficient for CXCR4 activation. In contrast, ACKR3 populates four distinct conformations and shows little preference among them in the apo-form. The inverse agonist, VUF16840, shifts the population to the inactive R conformation, while the agonists CXCL12<sub>WT</sub> and CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> promote the R* and R*’ populations of ACKR3. Despite stabilizing different levels of the active R* state and active-like intermediate R*’ state, both CXCL12<sub>WT</sub> and CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> are agonists of ACKR3. The flexibility of ACKR3 may contribute to the ligand-promiscuity of this atypical receptor.

In principle, ligands could promote activation by providing more energetically favorable binding interactions with the receptor in the active R* or R*’ conformations relative to the inactive R or R’ conformations. Alternatively, ligands could destabilize the inactive R or R’ conformations of the receptor, which would also shift the receptor population to the active conformation(s). Our results do not distinguish between these two possibilities. Regardless, the similar free energies of different receptor conformations in ACKR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) implies that relatively little energy is required to switch the receptor from one state to another. Moreover, activation can be achieved by populating either the R* or R*’ state. Thus, independent of specific binding poses and receptor interactions, a variety of different ligands may be able to tip the balance between different receptor conformations.</p><p>The TDP plots demonstrate that the R’ state in CXCR4 and the R’ and R*’ states in ACKR3 are intermediate species that lie on the pathway between inactive R and active R* receptor conformations. SmFRET studies of the glucagon receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishna Kumar et al., 2023</xref>) and the A2<sub>AR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref>; both labeled in TM4 and TM6, as here) also revealed a discrete intermediate receptor conformation. In principle, the intermediates in CXCR4 and ACKR3 could represent partial movements of TM6 from the inactive to active conformation or more subtle conformational changes altering the photophysical characteristics of the probes without drastically altering the donor-acceptor distance. Either possibility leads to detectable changes in apparent FRET efficiency and reflect discrete conformational steps on the activation pathway; however, it is not possible to resolve specific structural changes from the data. Interestingly, the R*’ intermediate appears to be unique to ACKR3. Moreover, this state responds to agonist and inverse agonist ligands in the same manner as the active R* state: agonists increase the population of the R*’ state, while an inverse agonist decreases the population. In contrast, the single intermediate state in CXCR4 (R’) is not responsive or only weakly responsive to ligands. The presence of both active (R*) and active-like (R*’) conformations in ACKR3 may be responsible for its activation prone nature and ligand promiscuity.</p><p>Structural features that make ACKR3 conformationally flexible include Y257<sup>6.40</sup>, which we previously showed contributes to the constitutive activity of ACKR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>). Similar to the constitutively active M257<sup>6.40</sup>Y mutant of rhodopsin, Y<sup>6.40</sup> in ACKR3 stacks against Y<sup>5.58</sup> and Y<sup>7.53</sup> and stabilizes the active-like conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deupi et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the broad conformational distribution and high probability of state-to-state transitions of ACKR3 parallel the dramatically lower energy barrier of the M257<sup>6.40</sup>Y rhodopsin mutant relative to WT rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsukamoto and Farrens, 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, ACKR3 remains functional in the absence of these cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Szpakowska et al., 2018</xref>) unlike other chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai and Liao, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Limatola et al., 2005</xref>). The disulfide may constrain the relative positions of TM1 and TM6/7 and the opening of the orthosteric pocket; therefore, its absence may confer ACKR3 with greater conformational flexibility than other chemokine receptors, consistent with our observations. It may also allow ACKR3 to be activated by diverse ligands.</p><p>Our results provide insights into the linkage between receptor conformation and ligand pharmacology in CXCR4. The chemokine variants CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> and CXCL12<sub>LRHQ</sub> are reported to act as antagonists of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaracz-Ros et al., 2020</xref>), and the small molecule IT1t acts as an inverse agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mona et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosenberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zarca et al., 2024</xref>). Surprisingly, none of these ligands inhibit formation of the active R* conformation of CXCR4. In fact, the chemokine variants both stabilize and increase this state to some degree, although less effectively than CXCL12<sub>WT</sub>. Thus, the antagonism and inverse agonism of these ligands does not appear to be linked exclusively to receptor conformation, suggesting that the ligands inhibit coupling of G proteins to CXCR4 or disrupt the ligand-receptor-G protein interaction network required for signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ngo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stephens et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, these ligands also increase the probabilities of state-to-state transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), suggesting that enhanced conformational exchange prevents the receptor from productively engaging G proteins. Similarly, ACKR3 is naturally dynamic and lacks G protein coupling, suggesting a common mechanism of G protein antagonism. Future smFRET studies performed in the presence of G proteins should be informative in this regard.</p><p>An unusual aspect of ACKR3 behavior is the failure to activate G proteins. Instead, ACKR3 recruits arrestins in response to phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail. Why ACKR3 does not couple to G proteins, at least in most cells, is unclear and not readily explained by differences in primary sequence, since insertion of a DRY box motif and substitution of all ICLs from a canonical GPCR failed to confer G protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that the active receptor conformation clashes sterically with the G protein as suggested by docking of G proteins to structures of ACKR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, the receptor dynamics and conformational transitions revealed here may prevent formation of productive contacts between ACKR3 and G protein that are required for coupling, even though G proteins appear to constitutively associate with the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fumagalli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levoye et al., 2009</xref>). An important caveat is that our study does not report on the dynamics of the other TM helices and H8, some of which are known to participate in arrestin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wingler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fay and Farrens, 2015</xref>). Lack of a well-organized intracellular pocket due to frequent conformational transitions may also explain why the fingerloop of arrestin is not observed to interact with the pocket, in contrast with other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Staus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), but instead inserts into membranes/micelles adjacent to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, arrestins are still recruited to CXCL12-stimulated ACKR3 due to GRK phosphorylation of the receptor C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schafer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarma et al., 2023</xref>). Since GRKs also interact with the cytoplasmic pocket to facilitate phosphorylation, it remains to be determined how dynamics might decouple G protein activation and arrestin binding to the receptor cytoplasmic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2023</xref>) while supporting pocket-mediated GRK activity. However, given the fleeting interaction between GRKs and GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pulvermüller et al., 1993</xref>), rapid state sampling by ACKR3 may not necessarily be detrimental to GRK engagement and phosphorylation. Furthermore, conformational intermediates in addition to the fully active receptor have been shown to be targets for GRK phosphorylation, such as the early photoactivated rhodopsin metarhodopsin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paulsen and Bentrop, 1983</xref>). A more constrained system may be necessary to promote productive interactions between ACKR3 and G proteins. Along these lines, a local increase of membrane pressure in certain cell environments could explain the apparent ability of ACKR3 to activate G proteins in astrocytes and glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Odemis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fumagalli et al., 2020</xref>). The atypical activation of ACKR3 does not appear to be dependent on any singular receptor feature and is likely a combination of several factors.</p><p>The pharmacological behavior of ACKR3 resembles the human cytomegalovirus chemokine receptor US28, which also recognizes diverse chemokines, constitutively internalizes, and displays multiple functional conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Groof et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to ACKR3, US28 appears to be activated by distortion of the orthosteric binding pocket rather than by specific side chain contacts between receptor and ligand, which is supported by multiple active conformations observed for both apo-US28 and US28 with different agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Groof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsutsumi et al., 2022</xref>). Whether US28 also has a relatively flat energy landscape like ACKR3 remains to be seen. The conformational dynamics and activation mechanisms revealed here for ACKR3 may also be operative in other chemokine receptors that respond to multiple ligands and have considerable constitutive activity, such as CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilliland et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the ability of ACKR3 to be activated by populating more than one conformational state may explain why antagonizing the receptor by targeting the orthosteric binding pocket has proven to be challenging; in contrast, the specific requirements for CXCR4 agonism has permitted the development of many orthosteric antagonists but few agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lefrançois et al., 2011</xref>). Drug discovery efforts aimed at inhibiting ACKR3 may therefore require allosteric strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise stated all chemicals and reagents were purchased from SigmaAldrich or Fisher Scientific.

Traces were screened manually for single donor and acceptor bleach steps and anti-correlated behavior between fluorophores to confirm the presence of single receptors within the identified particles and single donor and acceptor labeling. All traces for a particular protein/ligand combination were analyzed globally by a single Hidden Markov Model assuming two, three, four, or five states and shared variance as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pauszek et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, each model was trained on all selected trajectories for a given sample simultaneously using an expectation-maximization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rabiner, 1989</xref>). Once a model was trained, the Viterbi algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rabiner, 1989</xref>) was used to determine the most likely hidden path for each trajectory. This labeled state path was then used to aggregate all data points belonging to a particular state in order to compile composite histograms of apparent FRET efficiency, using a Kernel Density estimation algorithm (Python package Scikit-learn, version 1.2.2) with a Gaussian kernel and a bandwidth of 0.04. The relative populations of distinct FRET states were directly obtained during compilation of the corresponding histograms. The resulting apparent FRET efficiency histograms were fit with a Gaussian Mixture Model (Scikit-learn) and the corresponding Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwarz, 1978</xref>).

CXCR4 is highly selective for CXCL12 and activates heterotrimeric G proteins. In contrast, ACKR3 is quite promiscuous and does not couple to G proteins, but like most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), it is phosphorylated by GPCR kinases and recruits arrestins. By monitoring FRET between two positions on the intracellular face of the receptor (which highlight the movement of transmembrane helix 6 [TM6], a key hallmark of GPCR activation), the authors show that CXCR4 remains mostly in an inactive-like state until CXCL12 binds and stabilizes a single active-like state. ACKR3 rapidly exchanges among four different conformations even in the absence of ligand, and agonists stabilize multiple activated states.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The core method employed in this paper, smFRET, can reveal dynamic aspects of these receptors (the breadth of conformations explored and the rate of exchange among them) that are not evident from static structures or many other biophysical methods. smFRET has not been broadly employed in studies of GPCRs. Therefore, this manuscript makes important conceptual advances in our understanding of how related GPCRs can vary in their conformational dynamics.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The probes used cannot reveal conformational changes in other positions besides transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). GPCRs are known to exhibit loose allosteric coupling, so the conformational distribution observed at TM6 may not fully reflect the global conformational distribution of receptors. This could mask important differences that determine the ability of intracellular transducers to couple to specific receptor conformations.</p><p>While it is clear that CXCR4 and ACKR3 have very different conformational dynamics, the data do not definitely show that this is the main or only mechanism that contributes to their functional differences.</p><p>The extent to which conformational heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of ACKRs that contributes to their promiscuity and arrestin bias is unclear. The key residue the authors find promotes ACKR3 conformational heterogeneity is not conserved in most other ACKRs, but alternative mechanisms could generate similar heterogeneity.</p><p>An inherent limitation of the approach is that mutagenesis, purification, and labeling of the receptors could affect their conformational distributions. The cysteine mutations in ACKR3 required to site-specifically install fluorophores substantially increase its ligand-induced activity (Fig. S1D). There are no data to confirm that the two receptors retain the same functional profiles observed in cell-based systems following in vitro manipulations (purification, labeling, nanodisc reconstitution).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100098.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>Christopher T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>VU Amsterdam</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pauszek</surname><given-names>Raymond F</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Scripps Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gustavsson</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Copenhagen</named-content></addr-line><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Handel</surname><given-names>Tracy M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Millar</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Scripps Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper uses single-molecule FRET to investigate the molecular basis for the distinct activation mechanisms between 2 GPCR responding to the chemokine CXCL12 : CXCR4, that couples to G-proteins, and ACKR3, which is G-protein independent and displays a higher basal activity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>It nicely combines the state-of-the-art techniques used in the studies of the structural dynamics of GPCR. The receptors are produced from eukaryotic cells, mutated, and labeled with single molecule compatible fluorescent dyes. They are reconstituted in nanodiscs, which maintain an environment as close as possible to the cell membrane, and immobilized through the nanodisc MSP protein, to avoid perturbing the receptor's structural dynamics by the use of an antibody for example.</p><p>The smFRET data are analysed using the HHMI technique, and the number of states to be taken into account is evaluated using a Bayesian Information Criterion, which constitutes the state-of-the-art for this task.</p><p>The data show convincingly that the activation of the CXCR4 and ACKR3 by an agonist leads to a shift from an ensemble of high FRET states to an ensemble of lower FRET states, consistent with an increase in distance between the TM4 and TM6. The two receptors also appear to explore a different conformational space. A wider distribution of states is observed for ACKR3 as compared to CXCR4, and it shifts in the presence of agonists toward the active states, which correlates well with ACKR3's tendency to be constitutively active. This interpretation is confirmed by the use of the mutation of Y254 to leucine (the corresponding residue in CXCR4), which leads to a conformational distribution that resembles the one observed with CXCR4. It is correlated with a decrease in constitutive activity of ACKR3.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the data overall support the claims of the authors, there are however some details in the data analysis and interpretation that should be modified, clarified, or discussed in my opinion</p><p>Concerning the amplitude of the changes in FRET efficiency: the authors do not provide any structural information on the amplitude of the FRET changes that are expected. To me, it looks like a FRET change from ~0.9 to ~0.1 is very important, for a distance change that is expected to be only a few angstroms concerning the movement of the TM6. Can the authors give an explanation for that? How does this FRET change relate to those observed with other GPCRs modified at the same or equivalent positions on TM4 and TM6?</p></disp-quote><p>The large FRET change in our system was initially unexpected. However, the reviewer is mistaken that the expected distance change is only a few angstroms. Crystal structures of the homologous beta2 adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) in inactive and active conformations reveal that the cytoplasmic end of TM6 moves outwards by 16 angstroms during activation (Rasmussen et al., 2011). Consistent with this, smFRET studies of β<sub>2</sub>AR labeled in TM4 and TM6 (as here) showed that the donor-acceptor (D-A) distance was 14 angstroms longer in the active conformation (Gregorio et al., 2017). Surprisingly, the apparent distance change in our system (calculated for our FRET probes, A555/Cy5, using FPbase.com) is almost 30 angstroms. A possible explanation is that the fluorophore attached to TM6 interacts with lipids within the nanodisc when TM6 moves outwards, which could stretch the fluorophore linker and thereby increase the D-A distance (lipids were absent in the β<sub>2</sub>AR study). Such an interaction could also constrain the fluorophore in an unfavorable orientation for energy transfer, also leading to lower than expected FRET efficiencies and inflated distance calculations. Regardless, it is important to emphasize that none of the interpretations or conclusions of our study are based on computed D-A distances. Rather, we resolved different receptor conformations and quantified their relative populations based on the measured FRET efficiency distributions.</p><p>Finally, we note that a recent smFRET study of the glucagon receptor (labeled in TM4 and TM6, as here) also revealed a large difference in apparent FRET efficiencies between inactive (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.83) and active (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.32) conformations (Krishna Kumar et al., 2023). Thus, the large change in FRET efficiency observed in our study is not unprecedented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the intermediate states: the authors observe several intermediate states.</p><p>(1) First I am surprised, looking at the time traces, by the dwell times of the transitions between the states, which often last several seconds. Is such a long transition time compatible with what is known about the kinetic activation of these receptors?</p></disp-quote><p>We too were surprised by the apparent kinetics of the receptors in our system. However, it was previously noted that purified systems, including nanodiscs, lead to slower activation times for GPCRs compared to cellular membrane systems (Lohse et al, Curr. Opin. Cell Biology, 27, 8792, 2014). Indeed, slow transitions among different FRET states (dwell times in the seconds range) were also observed in recent smFRET studies of the mu opioid receptor (Zhao et al., 2024) and the glucagon receptor (Krishna Kumar et al., 2023). These studies are consistent with the observed time scale of the FRET transitions reported here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Second is it possible that these “intermediate” states correspond to differences in FRET efficiencies, that arise from different photophysical states of the dyes? Alexa555 and Cy5 are Cyanines, that are known to be very sensitive to their local environment. This could lead to different quantum yields and therefore different FRET efficiencies for a similar distance. In addition, the authors use statistical labeling of two cysteines, and have therefore in their experiment a mixture of receptors where the donor and acceptor are switched, and can therefore experience different environments. The authors do not speculate structurally on what these intermediate states could be, which is appreciated, but I think they should nevertheless discuss the potential issue of fluorophore photophysics effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the intermediate FRET states could, in principle, arise from a conformational change of the receptor that alters the local environment of the donor and/or acceptor fluorophores, rather than a change in donor-acceptor distance. This caveat is now included in the discussion on Pg. 10:</p><p>“In principle, the intermediates in CXCR4 and ACKR3 could represent partial movements of TM6 from the inactive to active conformation or more subtle conformational changes altering the photophysical characteristics of the probes without drastically altering the donor-acceptor distance. Either possibility leads to detectable changes in apparent FRET efficiency and reflect discrete conformational steps on the activation pathway; however, it is not possible to resolve specific structural changes from the data.”</p><p>Regarding the second possibility, it is true that our labeling methodology leads to a statistical mixture of labeled species (D on TM6 and A on TM4, D on TM4 and A on TM6). If the photophysical properties of the fluorophores were markedly different for the two labeling orientations, this would produce two different FRET efficiencies for a given receptor conformation. Assuming two receptor conformations, this scenario would produce four distinct FRET states: <italic>E</italic><sub>1</sub> (inactive receptor, labeling configuration 1), <italic>E</italic><sub>2</sub> (active receptor, labeling configuration 1), <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> (inactive receptor, labeling configuration 2) and <italic>E</italic><sub>4</sub> (active receptor, labeling configuration 2), with two cross peaks in the TDP plots, corresponding to <italic>E</italic><sub>1</sub> ↔ <italic>E</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> ↔ <italic>E</italic><sub>4</sub> transitions. Notably, <italic>E</italic><sub>2</sub> ↔ <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> cross peaks would not be present, since states <italic>E</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> exist on separate molecules. Instead, we see all states inter-connected sequentially, R ↔ R’ ↔ R* in CXCR4 and R ↔ R’ ↔ R*’ ↔ R* in ACKR3 (Fig. 2), suggesting that the resolved FRET states represent interconnected conformational states.</p><p>We added the following text to the Results section on Pg. 6:</p><p>“Two-dimensional transition density probability (TDP) plots revealed that the three FRET states were connected in a sequential fashion (Figs. 2A &amp; B), indicating that the transitions occurred within the same molecules. Notably, these observations exclude the possibility that the midFRET state arises from different local fluorophore environments (hence FRET efficiencies) for the two possible labeling orientations of the introduced cysteines: assuming two receptor conformations, this model would produce four distinct FRET states, but only two cross peaks in the TDP plot.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would also have been nice to discuss whether these types of intermediate states have been observed in other studies by smFRET on GPCR labeled at similar positions.</p></disp-quote><p>Intermediate states have also been reported in previous smFRET studies of other GPCRs. For example, in the glucagon receptor (also labeled in TM4 and TM6), a third FRET state (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.63) was resolved between the inactive (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.85) and active (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.32) states (Krishna Kumar et al., 2023). Discrete intermediate receptor conformations were also observed in the A<sub>2A</sub>R labeled in TM4 and TM6 (Fernandes et al., 2021). These examples are now cited in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On line 239: the authors talk about the R↔R' transitions that are more probable. In fact it is more striking that the R'↔R* transition appears in the plot. This transition is a signature of the behavior observed in the presence of an agonist, although IT1t is supposed to be an inverse agonist. This observation is consistent with the unexpected (for an inverse agonist) shift in the FRET histogram distribution. In fact, it appears that all CXCR4 antagonists or inverse agonists have a similar (although smaller) effect than the agonist. Is this related to the fact that these (antagonist or inverse agonist) ligands lead to a conformation that is similar to the agonists, but cannot interact with the G-protein ?? Maybe a very interesting experiment would be here to repeat these measurements in the presence of purified G-protein. G-protein has been shown to lead to a shift of the conformational space explored by GPCR toward the active state (using smFRET on class A and class C GPCR). It would be interesting to explore its role on CXCR4 in the presence of these various ligands. Although I am aware that this experiment might go beyond the scope of this study, I think this point should be discussed nevertheless.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation and the possible explanation offered. In response, we have added the following text to the Results section on Pg. 7:</p><p>“The small-molecule ligand IT1t is reported to act as an inverse agonist of CXCR4 (54-56). However, the conformational distribution of CXCR4 showed little change to the overall apparent</p><p>FRET profile, although R’ ↔ R* transitions appeared in the TDP plot (Figs. 3A &amp; B, Fig. S8). This suggests that the small molecule does not suppress CXCR4 basal signaling by changing the conformational equilibrium. Instead IT1t appears to increase transition probabilities which may impair G protein coupling by CXCR4.”</p><p>We have also added the following text to the Results on Pg. 8:</p><p>“Despite the ability of CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> and CXCL12<sub>LRHQ</sub> to stabilize the active R* conformation of CXCR4, both variants are known to act as antagonists (20). This suggests that the CXCL12 mutants inhibit CXCR4 coupling to G proteins not by suppressing the active receptor population but rather by increasing the dynamics of the receptor state transitions. Our results suggest that the helical movements considered classic signatures of the active state may not be sufficient for CXCR4 to engage productively with G proteins.”</p><p>In addition, we have added the following text to the Discussion on Pg. 11:</p><p>“The chemokine variants CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> and CXCL12<sub>LRHQ</sub> are reported to act as antagonists of CXCR4 (19, 20), and the small molecule IT1t acts as an inverse agonist (54-56). Surprisingly, none of these ligands inhibit formation of the active R* conformation of CXCR4. In fact, the chemokine variants both stabilize and increase this state to some degree, although less effectively than CXCL12<sub>WT</sub>. Thus, the antagonism and inverse agonism of these ligands does not appear to be linked exclusively to receptor conformation, suggesting that the ligands inhibit coupling of G proteins to CXCR4 or disrupt the ligand-receptor-G protein interaction network required for signaling (Fig. S10) (21, 23). Interestingly, these ligands also increase the probabilities of state-to-state transitions (Figs. 3B &amp; 4B), suggesting that enhanced conformational exchange prevents the receptor from productively engaging G proteins. Similarly, ACKR3 is naturally dynamic and lacks G protein coupling, suggesting a common mechanism of G protein antagonism.”</p><p>Finally, we also agree that experiments with G proteins could be informative. In fact, we initiated such experiments during the course of this study. However, it soon became apparent that significant optimization would be required to identify fluorophore labeling positions that report receptor conformation without inhibiting G protein coupling. Accordingly, we decided that G protein experiments would be the subject of future studies.</p><p>However, we added the following text to the Discussion on Pg. 12:</p><p>“Future smFRET studies performed in the presence of G proteins should be informative in this regard”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also mentioned in Figure 6 that the energetic landscape of the receptors is relatively flat ... I do not really agree with this statement. For me, a flat conformational landscape would be one where the receptors are able to switch very rapidly between the states (typically in the submillisecond timescale, which is the timescale of protein domain dynamics). Here, the authors observed that the transition between states is in the second timescale, which for me implies that the transition barrier between the states is relatively high to preclude the fast transitions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have modified the description of the energy landscapes of ACKR3 and CXCR4 in the discussion on Pg. 10 as follows:</p><p>“These observations imply that ACKR3 has a relatively flat energy landscape, with similar energy minima for the different conformations, whereas the energy landscape of CXCR4 is more rugged (Fig. 6). For both receptors, the energy barriers between states are sufficiently high that transitions occur relatively slowly with seconds long dwell times (Figs. 1C and S2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>his manuscript uses single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to identify differences in the molecular mechanisms of CXCR4 and ACKR3, two 7transmembrane receptors that both respond to the chemokine CXCL12 but otherwise have very different signaling profiles. CXCR4 is highly selective for CXCL12 and activates heterotrimeric G proteins. In contrast, ACKR3 is quite promiscuous and does not couple to G proteins, but like most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), it is phosphorylated by GPCR kinases and recruits arrestins. By monitoring FRET between two positions on the intracellular face of the receptor (which highlights the movement of transmembrane helix 6 [TM6], a key hallmark of GPCR activation), the authors show that CXCR4 remains mostly in an inactive-like state until CXCL12 binds and stabilizes a single active-like state. ACKR3 rapidly exchanges among four different conformations even in the absence of ligands, and agonists stabilize multiple activated states.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The core method employed in this paper, smFRET, can reveal dynamic aspects of these receptors (the breadth of conformations explored and the rate of exchange among them) that are not evident from static structures or many other biophysical methods. smFRET has not been broadly employed in studies of GPCRs. Therefore, this manuscript makes important conceptual advances in our understanding of how related GPCRs can vary in their conformational dynamics.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The cysteine mutations in ACKR3 required to site-specifically install fluorophores substantially increase its basal and ligand-induced activity. If, as the authors posit, basal activity correlates with conformational heterogeneity, the smFRET data could greatly overestimate the conformational heterogeneity of ACKR3.</p></disp-quote><p>The change in basal ACKR3 activity with the Cys introductions are modest in comparison and insignificantly different as determined by extra-sum-of-squares F test (P=0.14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The probes used cannot reveal conformational changes in other positions besides TM6. GPCRs are known to exhibit loose allosteric coupling, so the conformational distribution observed at TM6 may not fully reflect the global conformational distribution of receptors. This could mask important differences that determine the ability of intracellular transducers to couple to specific receptor conformations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the overall conformational landscape of the receptors has not been investigated and we have added this caveat to the discussion on Pg. 12.</p><p>“An important caveat is that our study does not report on the dynamics of the other TM helices and H8, some of which are known to participate in arrestin interactions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While it is clear that CXCR4 and ACKR3 have very different conformational dynamics, the data do not definitively show that this is the main or only mechanism that contributes to their functional differences. There is little discussion of alternative potential mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>The main functional difference between CXCR4 and ACRK3 is their effector coupling: CXCR4 couples to G proteins, whereas ACKR3 only couples to arrestins (following phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail by GRKs). As currently noted in the discussion, ACKR3 has many features that may contribute to its lack of G protein coupling, including lack of a well-ordered intracellular pocket due to conformational dynamics, lack of an N-term-ECL3 disulfide, different chemokine binding mode, and the presence of Y257. Steric interference due to different ICL loop structures may also interfere with G protein activation. No one thing has proven to confer ACKR3 with G protein activity including swapping all of the ICLs to those of canonical chemokine receptor, suggesting it is a combination of these different factors. The following has been added to the discussion on Pg. 13 to clearly note that any one feature is unlikely to drive the atypical behavior of ACKR3:</p><p>“The atypical activation of ACKR3 does not appear to be dependent on any singular receptor feature and is likely a combination of several factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The extent to which conformational heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of ACKRs that contributes to their promiscuity and arrestin bias is unclear. The key residue the authors find promotes ACKR3 conformational heterogeneity is not conserved in most other ACKRs, but alternative mechanisms could generate similar heterogeneity.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the commonalities in the roles of the ACKRs, they all appear to have evolved independently. Thus, we do not believe that all features observed and described for one ACKR will explain the behavior of another. We have carefully avoided expanding our observations to other ACKRs to avoid suggesting common mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) There are no data to confirm that the two receptors retain the same functional profiles observed in cell-based systems following in vitro manipulations (purification, labeling, nanodisc reconstitution).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point. All labeled receptors responded to agonist stimulation as expected. As only properly folded receptors are able to make the extensive interactions with ligands necessary for conformational changes (for instance, CXCL12 interacts with all TMs and ECLs), this suggests that the proteins are folded correctly and functional following all manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-designed and rigorous comparative study of the conformational dynamics of two chemokine receptors, the canonical CXCR4 and the atypical ACKR3, using single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. These receptors play a role in cell migration and may be relevant for developing drugs targeting tumor growth in cancers. The authors use single-molecule FRET to obtain distributions of a specific intermolecular distance that changes upon activation of the receptor and track differences between the two receptors in the apo state, and in response to ligands and mutations. The picture emerging is that more dynamic conformations promote more basal activity and more promiscuous coupling of the receptor to effectors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is well designed to test the main hypothesis, the sample preparation and the experiments conducted are sound and the data analysis is rigorous. The technique, smFRET, allows for the detection of several substates, even those that are rarely sampled, and it can provide a &quot;connectivity map&quot; by looking at the transition probabilities between states. The receptors are reconstituted in nanodiscs to create a native-like environment. The examples of raw donor/acceptor intensity traces and FRET traces look convincing and the data analysis is reliable to extract the sub-states of the ensemble. The role of specific residues in creating a more flat conformational landscape in ACKR3 (e.g., Y257 and the C34-C287 bridge) is well documented in the paper.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The kinetics side of the analysis is mentioned, but not described and discussed. I am not sure why since the data contains that information. For instance, it is not clear if greater conformational flexibility is accompanied by faster transitions between states or not.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that kinetic information is available, in principle, from smFRET experiments. However, a detailed kinetic analysis will require a much larger data set than we currently possess, to adequately sample all possible transitions and the dwell times of each FRET state. We intend to perform such an analysis in the future as more data becomes available. The purpose of this initial study was to explore the conformational landscapes of CXCR4 and ACKR3 and to reveal differences between them. To this end, we have documented major differences in conformational preferences and response to ligands of the two receptors that are likely relevant to their different biological behavior. Future kinetic information will add further detail, but is not expected to alter the conclusions drawn here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The method to choose the number of states seems reasonable, but the &quot;similarity&quot; of states argument (Figures S4 and S6) is not that clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting a need for further clarification. We qualitatively compared the positions of the various FRET peaks across treatments to gain insight into the consistency of the conformations and avoid splitting real states by overfitting the data. For instance, fitting the ACKR3 treatments with three states leads to three distinct FRET populations for the R’ intermediate. Adding a fourth state results in two intermediates that are fairly well overlapping. In contrast, the two-intermediate model for CXCR4 appears to split the R* state of the CXCL12 treated sample and causes a general shift in both intermediate states to lower FRET values when CXCL12 is present. As we assume that the conformations are consistent throughout the treatments, we conclude that this represents an overfitting artifact and not a novel CXCR4 R*’ state. Additional sentences have been added to the supplemental figure legend to better describe the comparative analysis.</p><p>“(Top) With the 3-state model, the R’ states for apo-CXCR4 and for CXCL12- and IT1t-bound receptor overlapped well with similar apparent FRET values across all of the tested conditions. In the case of the four-state model, the R*’ (Middle) and R’ (Bottom) states were substantially different across the ligand treatments. In particular, the R*’ state with CXCL12 treatment appears to arise from a splitting of the R* conformation, indicating that the model was overfitting the data.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the &quot;dynamics&quot; explanation offered for ACKR3's failure to couple and activate G proteins is not very convincing. In other studies, it was shown that activation of GPCRs by agonists leads to an increase in local dynamics around the TM6 labelling site, but that did not prevent G protein coupling and activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that any single explanation for ACKR3 bias, including the dynamics argument presented here, is insufficient to fully characterize the ACKR3 responses. As noted by the reviewer, the TM6 movement and dynamics is generally correlated with G protein coupling, whereas other dynamics studies (Wingler et al. 2019) have noted that arrestinbiased ligands do not lead to the same degree of TM6 movement.

S3 and S5 are Gaussian fits to the final apparent FRET efficiency histograms.</p><p>Similar to our response to Review 2 above, due to the consistency of the fitted peak positions obtained across different conditions for a given sample, we did not feel that further global analysis was necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is shown FRET changes from ~0.85 in the inactive (closed) state to ~0.25 in the active (open) state. How do these values match the expectations based on crystal structure and dye properties?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to Reviewer 1, translating the apparent FRET values using the assumed Förster distances for A555/Cy5 (per FPbase) suggest a change in D-A distance of ~30 angstroms, whereas the expected change from structures is ~16 Å. We suspect this discrepancy is due to the lipids immediately adjacent to the fluorophores, which may lead to the probes being constrained in an extended position when TM6 moves outwards, thus also reporting the linker length in the distance change. Additionally, such interactions may constrain the donor and acceptor in unfavorable orientations for energy transfer, which would also reduce the FRET efficiency in the active state. Since the calculated D-A distance changes appear too large for GPCR activation, we have opted to not make any structural interpretations. Instead, all of our conclusions are based on resolving individual conformational states and quantifying their relative populations, which is based directly on the measured FRET efficiency distributions, not computed distances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The results on the effect of CXCL12-P2G on CXCR4 are confusing...despite being an antagonist, this ligand stabilizes the &quot;active state&quot;...I am not sure if the explanation offered is sufficient that the opening of the intracellular cleft is not sufficient to drive the G protein coupling/activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the explanation related to the opening of the intracellular cleft being insufficient to drive G protein coupling/activation is speculative and we have removed that text. We now simply propose that the CXCL12 variants inhibit coupling of G proteins to CXCR4 or disrupt interactions necessary for signaling, as stated in the following text to the results on Pg. 8:</p><p>“Despite the ability of CXCL12<sub>P2G</sub> and CXCL12<sub>LRHQ</sub> to stabilize the active R* conformation of CXCR4, both variants are known to act as antagonists (20). This suggests that the CXCL12 mutants inhibit CXCR4 coupling to G proteins not by suppressing the active receptor population but rather by increasing the dynamics of the receptor state-to-state transitions. Our results suggest that the helical movements considered classic signatures of the active state may not be sufficient for CXCR4 to engage productively with G proteins.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
