Although various NO delivery systems have emerged, the immunogenicity and long-term toxicity of artificial carriers hinder the potential clinical translation of these gas therapeutics. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the capacities of self-renewal, differentiation, and low immunogenicity, have been used as living carriers. However, MSCs as gaseous signaling molecule (GSM) carriers have not been reported. In this study, human MSCs were genetically modified to produce mutant β-galactosidase (β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>). Furthermore, a new NO prodrug, 6-methyl-galactose-benzyl-oxy NONOate (MGP), was designed. MGP can enter cells and selectively trigger NO release from genetically engineered MSCs (eMSCs) in the presence of β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>. Moreover, our results revealed that eMSCs can release NO when MGP is systemically administered in a mouse model of acute kidney injury (AKI), which can achieve NO release in a precise spatiotemporal manner and augment the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs. This eMSC and NO prodrug system provides a unique and tunable platform for GSM delivery and holds promise for regenerative therapy by enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of stem cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals are made up of cells of different types, with each type of cell specializing on a specific role. But for the body to work properly, the different types of cells must be able to coordinate with each other to respond to internal and external stimuli. This can be achieved through signaling molecules, that is, molecules released by a cell that can elicit a specific response in other cells.</p><p>There are many types of different molecules, including hormones and signaling proteins. Gases can also be potent signaling molecules, participating in various biological processes. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas signaling molecule that can freely diffuse through the membranes of cells and has roles in blood vessel constriction and other disease processes, making it a promising therapeutic agent. Unfortunately, using artificial carriers to deliver nitric oxide to the organs and tissues where it is needed can lead to issues, including immune reactions to the carrier and long-term toxicity. One way to avoid these effects is by using cells to deliver nitric oxide to the right place.</p><p>Huang, Qian, Liu et al. have used mesenchymal stem cells – which usually develop to form connective tissues such as bone and muscle – to develop a cell-based NO-delivery system. The researchers genetically modified the mesenchymal stem cells to produce a compound called β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>. On its own β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup> does not do much, but in its presence, a non-toxic, non-reactive compound developed by Huang, Qian, Liu et al., called MGP, can drive the release of NO from cells.</p><p>To confirm the usefulness of their cells as a delivery system, Huang, Qian, Liu et al. transplanted some of the genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells into the kidneys of mice, and then showed that when these mice were given MGP, the levels of NO increased in the kidneys but not in other organs. This result confirms that the cell-based delivery system provides spatial and temporal control of the production of NO.</p><p>These findings demonstrate a new delivery system for therapies using gas molecules, which can be controlled spatiotemporally in mice. In the future, these types of systems could be used in the clinic for long-term treatment of conditions where artificial carriers could lead to complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>gaseous signaling molecule </kwd><kwd>genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cell</kwd><kwd>acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>controlled release</kwd><kwd>delivery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zongjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U2004126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zongjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81925021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006606</institution-id><institution>Tianjin Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22JCZXJC00170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zongjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Funding from Nankai University Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NKYKD202203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zongjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006606</institution-id><institution>Tianjin Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21JCZDJC00070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zongjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82330066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tianjin Key Medical Discipline (Specialty) Construction Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TJYXZDXK-043A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zongjin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could produce mutant β-galactosidase and trigger nitric oxide (NO) release when the NO prodrug is systemically administered, which can achieve NO release in a precise spatiotemporal manner and augment the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO), as a gaseous signaling molecule (GSM), plays vital roles in various physiological processes, including tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Midgley et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the extremely short half-life of NO, efforts to extensively enhance the therapeutic efficacy of NO by various types of artificial carriers, such as polymers, peptides, and nanoparticles, have achieved many successes, and there are remaining challenges that need to be addressed, including off-targeting, toxicity, immunogenicity, and clinical translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Park, 2013</xref>). Successful NO delivery requires an appropriate carrier for delivering these therapeutic molecules to the target sites in an on-demand and controlled manner, as well as in a protected, pharmacologically active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Weaver et al., 2014</xref>). Bioinspired delivery vehicles, including biological cells, exosomes, and isolated membrane ghosts, are highly attractive because they exhibit excellent biodistribution, immune compatibility, innate disease-targeting abilities, and reduced toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bush et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Samanta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). Among these systems, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained considerable attention as drug-delivery vehicles owing to their genetic tractability, payload diversity, intrinsic tropism for disease sites, and differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tran and Damaser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Thanuja et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>MSCs are adult stem cells capable of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation that have been reported to promote tissue regeneration mediated by immunomodulatory and proangiogenic properties via paracrine effects, and MSC-based cell therapeutics have entered multiple clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baraniak and McDevitt, 2010</xref>). Previous studies revealed that MSCs do not express blood-group antigens or MHC class II antigens and have long been reported to be hypoimmunogenic or immune privileged, which possess the clinical potential of MSC-based cell therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhou and Shi, 2023</xref>). MSCs as delivery vehicles have been widely studied for the delivery of various drugs and bioactive molecules into target disease sites, including peptides, proteins, DNA, and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). However, the concept of MSCs as vehicles to deliver GSMs has not been studied. In this regard, we propose an MSC-based gas-generating platform as a unique and tunable platform for extensively broad GSM therapies.</p><p>To achieve a gas-generating platform based on living cells, MSCs are programmed to sustain the generation and release NO by taking advantage of enzyme prodrug therapy, a versatile and exploitable technique to convert inactive, nontoxic prodrugs to active drugs at the desired sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we developed an engineered MSC (eMSC)-based NO delivery platform for controlled NO delivery. In this advanced delivery platform, the expression of mutant β-galactosidase (β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>) by eMSCs enabled the production of NO when the NO prodrug was administered. We hypothesized that eMSCs could successfully generate and release NO in a precise spatiotemporal manner, as well as augment the therapeutic effects of MSCs and result in superior efficacy of stem cell therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MSC-mediated NO release platform</title><p>Other than mentioned in context, MSCs represent human placenta-derived MSCs. To establish a living cell-mediated gas generation platform, MSCs were genetically modified to produce mutant β-galactosidase (β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>), which triggers NO release from MSCs when the corresponding NO prodrug is applied and avoids the interference of endogenous glycosidase. We constructed a lentiviral vector to stably express mutant β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>, Renilla luciferase (Rluc), and red fluorescence protein (RFP), in which Rluc and RFP were used for molecular imaging and immunohistology, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

MGP contains a lipid-soluble self-decomposition chain oil that enhances its water distribution coefficient and enables it to cross the cell membrane of eMSCs and then be catalyzed by β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup> to release NO from eMSCs. The structure and synthesis routes of MGP are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>. To verify whether the redesigned NO prodrug MGP could release NO specifically by β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup> catalysis, we measured the NO release profile of MGP in response to β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup> in vitro. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, MGP can be specifically catalyzed by β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup> and has sustained NO release behavior. In this novel NO release eMSC (NO-eMSC) system, eMSCs, as a manufacturing factory for producing β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>, could further release NO by catalyzing the NO prodrug MGP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We detected NO production in the medium of eMSCs with MGP administration using the Griess method, confirming that MGP can diffuse into eMSCs and release NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We next directly measured the NO levels of eMSCs in vitro by an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique using the spin trap Fe•(DETC)2 colloid solution. The characteristic triplet EPR signal was observed in eMSCs with MGP administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and we further confirmed that 1×10<sup>6</sup> eMSCs could release 1 nmol NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Moreover, NO production of eMSCs with MGP administration was visualized by using diaminofluorescein (DAF)-FM diacetate, a cell-permeable fluorescent probe for the detection of intracellular NO, which also supported that eMSCs could specifically release NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>).</p><p>Considering the cell-protective effects of a low NO concentration, our results revealed that the optimum concentration of MGP was 2 µg/mL by cell viability, immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki67, and immunostaining for the expression of proliferation-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Meanwhile, mRNA expression profiling further confirmed this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).

Damaged renal tubular cells were overloaded with excessive lipids caused by abnormal lipid metabolism, while elevated ROS levels can lead to irreversible oxidative damage to lipids and further result in cell damage and death. Excessive intracellular accumulation of lipids was observed in the renal tubules of the PBS group after I/R injury, while the eMSCs with MGP administration significantly decreased lipid deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

This advanced NO-eMSC system was engineered to both program the continuous release of NO and enhance stem cell-mediated regeneration of damaged tissues, which is a unique and mosaic approach to maximize the therapeutic effect. The NO-eMSC system successfully generated and released NO in a precise spatiotemporal manner and improved eMSC functionalities, resulting in higher cell survival and more resistance to apoptosis under oxidative stress. The NO-eMSC system exerted superior therapeutic effects, including rescuing renal tubules, relieving inflammation, stimulating angiogenesis, and improving renal function.</p><p>GSMs with pharmaceutical effects, such as oxygen, NO, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), have tremendous potential in the treatment of many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Markhard et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the therapeutic effects of GSMs are highly concentration dependent; for example, low levels of NO (nmol to μmol) are frequently associated with cell protection, while high concentrations (&gt;mmol) of NO exert apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Midgley et al., 2020</xref>). Although a plethora of GSM small molecule donors have been developed, the insufficient solubility, poor stability, and unfavorable pharmacokinetics of these GSM donors have prevented their wide application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). NO, the first and most well-known gaseous molecule, has been widely shown to play critical roles in a wide spectrum of physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As a result, many kinds of NO-releasing platforms have emerged in the field of chemical materials to deliver NO in a controlled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zafonte et al., 2022</xref>). Although endogenous (enzyme and pH variations) or exogenous (light and ultrasound)-triggered NO delivery systems for controlled NO release profiles have been developed, it remains a challenge to maintain long-term NO release and eliminate immunogenicity and systemic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zafonte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, an increasing number of cell delivery systems have entered multiple clinical trials or been approved for marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hartmann et al., 2017</xref>). Genetic engineering of MSCs is an approach to produce and deliver specific therapeutic proteins or enhance innate properties such as migration, differentiation, and survival for treating many tremendous diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, genetically eMSCs, usually as living ‘drug reservoirs’, offer long-term and stable production of the therapeutic protein of interest and thus have gained appreciable attention as therapeutic delivery vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bush et al., 2021</xref>). Taking advantage of this NO delivery system and stem cell therapy, we engineered MSCs as an enzyme reservoir that catalyzes the NO prodrug to produce NO on demand, which combines the therapeutic potential of MSCs and NO.</p><p>For NO delivery, the undesired release of NO was observed due to the widespread distribution of endogenous β-GAL in blood and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hou et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous study developed a novel NO-enzyme-prodrug pair for the specific release of NO, in which native β-GAL is transformed into mutant homologs with a ‘hole’ and only interacts with its corresponding ‘bump’-prodrug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hou et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, genetically eMSCs as living reservoirs enabled the continuous production of the ‘hole’-enzyme (β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>), thereby achieving the controlled release of NO from its corresponding NO-prodrug, MGP. Moreover, the NO detection results confirmed that our NO-generating platform could release NO in a precise spatiotemporal manner; the duration and dosing of NO release could be tuned by controlling the NO prodrug. Specifically, NO release is initiated in the presence of the NO prodrug as long as eMSCs survive. NO dosing is controlled by the concentration of the administered NO prodrug, and an elevated NO signal was observed only at the site of transplanted eMSCs. In this study, we substantially advance the concept of a cell-mediated gas-generating platform for NO long-term applications, which may be applied for other gas enzyme prodrug pairs in the future.</p><p>The combinational use of NO-releasing biomaterials and stem cells is an emerging field of regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2015</xref>); however, temporal and local release of NO-releasing biomaterials results in less contact time with cells and hinders their long-term applications. Moreover, in-depth knowledge of the underlying mechanisms to elucidate the influence of NO on stem cells and the stem cell microenvironment is of great value in the fields of biomaterials and regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Midgley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we developed an advanced MSC-mediated NO-generating platform engineered to both program the continuous release of NO and enhance stem cell-mediated regeneration of damaged tissues. Moreover, the NO-eMSC system exerted an immunosuppressive effect by reshaping macrophage inflammatory properties and an enhanced angiogenesis effect to promote kidney regeneration. This endogenous-like NO-generating platform may represent a new paradigm for the future of long-term NO application on MSCs or other cell types.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a genetic eMSC-based NO delivery, NO-eMSC system, for targeted, controlled, and long-term NO delivery for the first time. This advanced NO delivery system can serve as a generic delivery system that holds promise for extensively broadening other gaseous molecule therapies and provides a new library of clinical solutions for regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>HUVEC culture</title><p>Primary HUVECs were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in EGM2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA).

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used (1:200, SP-9000, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China), and a DAB staining kit was used to develop colors (ZLI-9017, ZSGB-BIO). The integrated optical density values of positive staining were measured using Image-pro plus 6.0 software. Antibodies are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Renal oxidative stress-related index</title><p>Kidney samples (100 mg) were collected and homogenized in 900 μL of cold PBS with a tissue homogenizer to prepare a 10% tissue homogenate.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anton Jan van Zonneveld (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors generated engineered MSC (eMSC) to produce mutant b-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>, and when stimulated with a pro-drug (MGP) they can release NO. These cells were tested in vivo in a mouse model of AKI. When MGP is systemically administrated in AKI mice, it can induce eMSC to release NO in a precise and spatiotemporal manner, possibly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of these stem cells.</p><p>The authors have conducted a very interesting study. They provide proof of concept that the pharmacokinetically controlled generation of NO in transplanted mesenchymal stem cells can augment the regenerative actions of these cells in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the kidney. This could impact the treatment of patients with acute kidney injury. State-of-the-art techniques are used to confirm the NO generation and, the data are consistent and very convincing. Thus, these results are likely of interest to the renal scientific community, especially in the context of acute kidney injury.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A criticism relevant to the clinical arena is the lack of information on the survival of the MSC after transplantation and the introduction of novel antigens associated with the engineered cells.</p><p>2) The mice utilized were C57/Bl6 females, the most resistant sex and strain to both acute and chronic kidney injury.</p><p>3) The use of human placental MSCs only; as such it is not clear whether other MSCs will perform equally well.</p><p>4) In general, the methods should contain more details on experimental procedures, nature, and isolation of cells.</p><p>5) The paper should contain more information on biological replicates and groups, time points, deep sequencing, and QC for the bulk RNA-seq should be provided.</p><p>6) Some of the figures are either not convincing or difficult to understand and a more detailed figure legend could help in appreciating the results presented.</p><p>Based on these criticisms, the authors should:</p><p>1) Provide evidence that other MSC can equally perform in vivo;</p><p>2) Perform AKI studies on male mice which are more prompt to injury thus facilitating the evaluation of the beneficial effects of MSCs;</p><p>3) Extensively re-write methods and figure legend and provide more convincing figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is key to better explain the important assays in the text and figure legends.</p><p>1. Please describe the AKI model used on Page 9, in the figure 3 legend, etc. so that the reader knows which AKI model is being utilized immediately. The AKI models available are quite variable so this is important. Why were C57/Bl6 females, the strain and sex most resistant to kidney injury, chosen for this study? More details need to be provided on page 19 as well. Yes, it says &quot;previously described&quot; but as this is a key detail, the authors should give a description in this methods section of this paper.</p><p>2. Please give the ratio of the GSH/GSSG ratio (reduced to oxidized glutathione) rather than just GSH. To determine oxidative stress, the ratio is needed.</p><p>3. In Figure S4, &quot;NO release in PBS with β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>&quot; the Griess assay was provided but there are no controls.</p><p>4. Did the authors try MSCs from mice vs human, or from other sources vs placenta? The human placenta source of the MSCs should be sporadically highlighted throughout including in the paper abstract, not only mentioned once in the methods section, as the conclusions of this manuscript could possibly be specific to human placental MSCs unless others were tested. Also, the authors should add sentences on why there was a lack of immune rejection of the MSCs in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>See comments below for improvements.</p><p>– Methods are lacking in important details. How were the cells isolated (it can not be referenced to a previous publication, details should be also included in this Manuscript)? How many samples were tested (biological replicates)? How many cells are used for each experiment? Also, a lot more information (groups, time points, biological replicates, deep sequencing, QC for the bulk RNA-seq should be provided). Were human cells injected into non-immunodeficient mice? How was the AKI induced? How many mice per group? It is not clear in which experiments the HK-2 and the HEK-293T cells were used.</p><p>– Figure 1C. It is not clear the percentage of eMSC that are positive for both b-GAL as well as for RFP. The first panel does not seem to be the same as the second one, therefore it is hard to understand the merged panel. Dapi should have been used to distinguish the nuclei. A Flow should have been provided to determine the percentage of cells that are positive for both markers. In this case, the WB is not sufficient, a qualitative and quantitative analysis is important.</p><p>– Please eliminate this sentence &quot; eMSCs showed similar morphology and expression</p><p>patterns, indicating minimal side effects of genetic modification (Figure S2).&quot; Similar morphology does not indicate minimal side effects of genetic modification. Even if the morphology is similar, the gene expression could also be very different. Please eliminate this sentence.</p><p>– Figure S5 is very confusing. In the Results section, it seems that immunostaining for the expression of proliferation-related genes is shown. There are no staining and usually, staining does not show gene expression (unless it is in situ hybridization).</p><p>– Time points for the experiments are not always clear. For example, Figure S6 and S7 have different time points (48hr vs 24hr or 12hr). It is very hard to understand the rationale behind these choices.</p><p>– It is supposed that Figure S8 is showing bulk RNA-seq? please specify. Legends are not clear. Is red showing upregulated genes? Are the data significant? How many cells were sequenced and how many biological replicates? Same questions for Figure 2.</p><p>– &quot;Together, these results demonstrated that NO might be able to ameliorate the</p><p>oxidative stress of eMSCs, thus elongating the survival of eMSCs&quot; This is a very strong statement that is not supported by the results presented. Please revise.</p><p>– Figure 3. It is hard to understand the time points for the experiments shown in this Figure. Are they all after 1 week after administration of the cells? How the cells were administered? Figure 3H is not indicative. Are the sham mice WT mice with no damage? Based on the images, the last panel in Figure 3H seems to show that eMSC+MGP is worse than the eMSC; the eMSC+MGP seems to have more cast formation and worse histology.</p><p>– Figure 5: Why a time point of 1 week was chosen? What happens at a later stage? Figure 5A: how do the authors explain the signaling in the sham and in the PBS groups?</p><p>– Figure S13A: it is understood that the treatment with MSC should lower the lipids deposition. It is strange though that the sham group does not have any lipid deposition (none).</p><p>This is an interesting work but the Authors should provide a better method and legend description as well as focus the discussion on their findings, and correct the figures as suggested thus providing more evidence of the effect of eMSC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The abstract starts with the notion that &quot;the immunogenicity and long-term toxicity of artificial carriers hinders the potential clinical translation of this gas therapeutics…&quot; One could argue that, although MSC has been shown to display immunomodulatory effects, MSC from the allogenic origin, as well as the mutant β-galactosidase, may provide novel antigens that can be targeted by the host's immune system. It would be good to discuss this issue.</p><p>The authors report in Figure S4 and 1F that the addition of MGP to the MSC elicits a release of NO based on a Griess assay (S4) and staining of DAF-FM. This is a nice result, but it has to be taken into account that Griess and DAF-DA also detect NO indirectly via oxidation products. Therefore, a biological sensor of NO production in the MSC could be the generation of cGMP. cGMP can be easily measured and is, to this reviewer's knowledge, the most likely effector of the effects of NO on MSC. Alternatively, and surprisingly the authors do use a NO analyzer and even EPR! in the in vitro studies, why not use these also for the validation of NO release by the cells in vitro?</p><p>Figures S6 and S7 demonstrate the modest effect of the MGP-dependent NO generation on H2O2-induced apoptosis and survival. A missing control is the effect of MGP on H2O2-induced apoptosis and survival of the control cells. May spontaneous release of NO, without the help of the galactosidase is enough for the effect?</p><p>For the in vivo studies described in figure 3 it would be helpful I a description in the methods section would be given on how the MSC are transplanted.</p><p>The model of IR can be performed in different ways and even though the authors refer to a published paper it should be stated whether this is a unilateral model or a bilateral model and whether or not the contralateral right kidney is dissected (most likely).</p><p>In the angiogenesis studies it is surprising that PBS stimulates angiogenesis, can this be discussed? Again, the MGP-only control is lacking. Nice this is confirmed in HUVEC. Do you have any indication of how long the MSC survives after transplantation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84820.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A criticism relevant to the clinical arena is the lack of information on the survival of the MSC after transplantation and the introduction of novel antigens associated with the engineered cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. In the present study, MSCs were genetically modified with triple reporter genes, mutant β-galactosidase (β-GAL<sup>H363A</sup>), Rluc, and RFP. Engineered mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) can produce mutant β-galactosidase and trigger the release of nitric oxide (NO) when the NO prodrug is administered systemically. Furthermore, Rluc can be used for in vivo bioluminescence imaging of the survival of MSCs after transplantation, and RFP can be used for immunofluorescence staining. The Rluc imaging of eMSCs, as reflected by BLI signals, showed that 1×10<sup>6</sup> eMSCs could be retained in the I/R injured kidney for 5 days, while eMSCs with MGP administration could significantly improve cell survival, indicating that NO could significantly promote cell survival in vivo.

As suggested, we conducted additional experiments to investigate whether other MSCs will perform equally well. Human adipose-derived MSC (AD-MSC), human umbilical cord MSC (hUC-MSC) were genetically modified and our results confirmed that AD-MSC and hUC-MSC perform well with this system. We first performed an EPR technique to directly measure the NO levels of eAD-MSC and ehUC-MSC with MGP administration in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic effects of the NO-eAD-MSC and NO-ehUC-MSC system in AKI mice were then evaluated by histological analysis and renal function analysis. An obvious characteristic triplet EPR signal (NO signal) was observed in eAD-MSC and ehUC-MSC with the administration of MGP in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the eAD-MSC-NO system showed significantly lower levels of SCr and BUN. Furthermore, tubular dilation, cast formation, and massive loss of brush borders at the initial stage after kidney injury (3 d) were obviously reduced after treatment with the NO-eMSC system. Furthermore, KIM-1 expression was significantly decreased in the proximal tubules of the kidneys in the eAD-MSC with MGP administration group. Thus, our eMSC and NO prodrug system provides a tunable platform for NO delivery and holds promise for regenerative therapy.

We have carefully revised our manuscript and supplemented the experimental details in the revised manuscript. Briefly, engineered MSCs (eMSCs) treated with MGP (2 μg/mL) or PBS for 24 h were collected. For each group, 3 duplicates were prepared for RNA-seq analysis. Total RNA from eMSCs and eMSCs with MGP administration was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The amount and purity of RNA in each sample was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). The integrity of the RNA was demonstrated with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA), RIN &gt; 7.0, and confirmed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA was sent for RNA-Seq library construction and high-throughput sequencing on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 with 2×150 bp paired-end sequencing (PE150). Raw reads obtained from RNA-Seq were preprocessed. The reads that contained adapter contamination were removed using Cutadapt software. After removing low-quality and undetermined bases, we mapped the reads to the genome using HISAT2 software. The results of quality control (QC) of the RNA-seq profiles of eMSCs and eMSCs with MGP administration are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some of the figures are either not convincing or difficult to understand and a more detailed figure legend could help in appreciating the results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our unclear descriptions.

In our study, renal ischemia/reperfusion injury models were established to mimic acute kidney injury.

We measured serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, renal histopathology, and the acute kidney injury marker Kim-1 to evaluate the therapeutic potential of eMSCs with MGP administration. Our results demonstrated that eMSCs with MGP administration could significantly improve renal function by decreasing serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. IRI caused the formation of a necrotic tubule mass accompanied by cast formation and loss of the brush border, and this process was significantly reduced by eMSC with MGP administration. Immunostaining of the kidney injury marker (Kim-1) revealed similar results. Data from male mice were combined with data from female mice, which can be found in the revised Figure 3D-H and Figure 5A-E.</p><p>We have described the AKI model in more detail in the Results, Methods, and Figure Legend sections.</p><p>“Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% avertin (240 mg/kg, Sigma‒Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada), and protective ophthalmic ointment was applied to mouse eyeballs to maintain moisture. At the same time, remove the hair from the surgical site on the back of the mouse with a hair scraper and depilatory cream and disinfect it with povidone-iodine. A longitudinal incision was made on the back of the mouse above the left kidney to expose the kidney. Using ophthalmic forceps, dissect bluntly the fat and connective tissue surrounding the renal arteries and veins to expose the renal arteries and veins. Clamping of the renal artery and vein with an arterial clamp for 45 min resulted in ischemic blackening of the kidney and visually verified reperfusion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
