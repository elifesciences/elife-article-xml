They are a heterogeneous collection of vesicular structures that are exported from cells by a variety of mechanisms. Exosomes are 30–150 nm in diameter and are released into cell supernatants <italic>via</italic> fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. Exosomes and other EVs carry specific proteins and RNAs, and EVs derived from different cell types contain different cargoes. EV cargoes are biomarkers for specific diseases. Because EVs can encapsulate RNAs and protect them from degradation, and then deliver those RNAs to recipient cells, they represent a promising new type of therapeutic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Teng and Fussenegger, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about mechanisms involved in EV targeting to specific cell types. EVs are internalized into cells after receptor binding using a variety of endocytic mechanisms, resulting in the delivery of their cargoes into the recipient cells. They can also directly activate intracellular signaling without endocytosis by interacting with cell surface receptors. In this paper, we identify Stranded at second (Sas), a large <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell surface protein (CSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schonbaum et al., 1992</xref>), as an EV targeting ligand. Full-length Sas (Sas<sup>FL</sup>) has an extracellular domain (ECD) containing a signal peptide, a unique N-terminal region, four von Willebrand factor C (VWFC) domains, and three Fibronectin Type III (FN-III) repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A shorter isoform, Sas<sup>short</sup>, which is translated from an alternatively spliced mRNA, lacks a 345 amino acid (aa) region of the ECD. The two Sas isoforms share a single transmembrane (TM) domain and a short cytoplasmic domain (ICD).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of Sas isoforms.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram of the Sas<sup>FL</sup> protein.

A tyrosine motif in the Sas ICD was found to bind to the PTB domain of Numb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chien et al., 1998</xref>), an protein involved in endocytosis that is a negative regulator of Notch signaling. Sas has no obvious mammalian orthologs, but there are many mammalian CSPs that contain VWFC and FN-III domains.</p><p>In earlier work, we identified the receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) Ptp10D as a binding partner for Sas, and showed that Sas::Ptp10D interactions regulate embryonic axon guidance, as well as glial migration and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Ptp10D is one of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> R3 subfamily RPTPs, which have ECDs composed of long chains of FN-III repeats. Sas::Ptp10D interactions also control the elimination of neoplastic epithelial clones by surrounding normal tissue. Sas is on normal epithelial cells, and it relocalizes to the parts of their cell surfaces that are adjacent to the neoplastic clone and binds to Ptp10D on the neoplastic cells. Ptp10D in turn relocalizes and dephosphorylates the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to death of the neoplastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>). The Sas ECD has other binding partners as well, because it interacts with cells that do not express Ptp10D in live embryo staining assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian Arc is a locally translated dendritic protein that regulates synaptic plasticity, in part by modulating endocytosis of AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chowdhury et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shepherd et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes two proteins distantly related to mammalian Arc, dArc1 and dArc2. The <italic>dArc2</italic> gene, which encodes a truncated protein, was likely generated by a gene duplication, and the <italic>dArc1</italic> and <italic>dArc2</italic> genes are adjacent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattaliano et al., 2007</xref>). dArc1 functions in larval and adult brain neurons to regulate aspects of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mattaliano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mosher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Keith et al., 2021</xref>). Arc and dArc1 evolved independently from retrotransposon Gag proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shepherd, 2018</xref>). Remarkably, they both form virus-like capsids that can encapsulate <italic>Arc</italic> mRNAs and are transported between cells via EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hantak et al., 2021</xref>). dArc1, but not dArc2, has a C-terminal Zn<sup>2+</sup> finger that might be involved in nucleic acid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Erlendsson et al., 2020</xref>). Mammalian Arc lacks Zn<sup>2+</sup> fingers, but RNA is required for normal capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> dArc1 capsids bearing <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA move from neurons to muscles across larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses, and dArc1 transfer is required for activity-induced induction of morphological synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that full-length Sas expressed in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells localizes to EVs that preferentially target to cells expressing Ptp10D. Sas binds to dArc1 in EVs via a tyrosine motif in its ICD that is conserved between Sas and the human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> APP orthologs. This finding led us to examine mammalian Arc as well, and we showed that it also binds to Sas and APP. The interaction between APP and Arc is of interest because several studies have implicated Arc in control of β-amyloid accumulation and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Landgren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bi et al., 2018</xref>). APP also localizes to EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laulagnier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pérez-González et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Since Sas binds to dArc1, which can encapsulate its own mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>), we then investigated whether Sas EVs can target <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA to Ptp10D-expressing recipient cells in vivo. Here, we show that co-expression of dArc1 and full-length Sas in embryonic salivary glands (SGs) causes <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA to appear in distant tracheal cells that express Ptp10D.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sas is an EV targeting ligand</title><p>Sas has two isoforms, translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs. Sas<sup>FL</sup> (PB/PD isoform) is a 1693 aa single-transmembrane cell-surface protein with a short (37 aa) ICD. It contains a 345 aa region (EVT) between the VWFC and FN-III domains that is lacking in the Sas<sup>short</sup> (PA/PC) isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We expressed Sas<sup>FL</sup> tagged with an N-terminal V5 epitope tag (inserted immediately after the signal sequence) in embryonic late stage 16 Apterous (Ap) neurons, which consist of paired neurons (one per hemisegment) in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and scattered neurons in the brain lobes. It was expressed together with mCD8-GFP, which is also a transmembrane CSP. The GFP signal was restricted to Ap neuron cell bodies, with faint staining on the axons. However, V5-Sas<sup>FL</sup> was observed in sheaths around brain lobes and in areas adjacent to axons in the VNC, as well as in puncta throughout the VNC and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The V5 signal in cell bodies was very weak, especially in the brain.</p><p>We also expressed V5-Sas<sup>short</sup> in Ap neurons, and observed that V5 staining was restricted to cell bodies and axons in the VNC, and to cell bodies in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, although Sas<sup>FL</sup> and Sas<sup>short</sup> have the same TM and ICD, they differ in subcellular localization, with Sas<sup>short</sup> being retained in expressing cells and Sas<sup>FL</sup> moving away from these cells and into the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Movement of V5-Sas<sup>FL</sup>, and presumably of endogenous Sas<sup>FL</sup>, away from its source could occur through cleavage of the Sas ECD from the cell surface or by release of intact Sas in EVs. To distinguish between these possibilities, we expressed V5-tagged Sas<sup>FL</sup> and Sas<sup>short</sup> in transiently transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider 2 (S2) cells, which express endogenous Sas at almost undetectable levels. We prepared EVs from S2 cell supernatants using the Invitrogen Exosome Isolation Kit or by ultracentrifugation, and analyzed their contents by western blotting. EVs contained the Wg protein, which is a marker for EVs in S2 cells and is present at very low levels in lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). They lacked β-actin, showing that they are not heavily contaminated by cytosol. We found that about 50% of V5-Sas<sup>FL</sup> localized to EVs, while ~90% of V5-Sas<sup>short</sup> was retained in the cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We did not observe any proteolytic cleavage products in EVs or unpurified supernatants.</p><p>EV preparations made using the Exosome Isolation kit have similar characteristics to those generated by ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Skottvoll et al., 2019</xref>), and the kit requires much less material, allowing EVs to be purified from small-scale transfections. However, to confirm results obtained with the kit, we also purified EVs from S2 cells expressing V5-tagged Sas<sup>FL</sup> using a standard ultracentrifugation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Théry et al., 2006</xref>), and showed that Sas<sup>FL</sup> and Wg are also present in these EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The commonly used rabbit antiserum against Sas primarily recognizes the EVT region, so embryo staining reveals the localization of endogenous Sas<sup>FL</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schonbaum et al., 1992</xref>). To visualize Sas<sup>short</sup>, we made an anti-peptide antibody against a sequence spanning an exon junction in the PA/PC isoforms. This recognizes Sas<sup>short</sup>, and staining with the antibody is eliminated in <italic>sas</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Double-staining of the foregut and hindgut with the two Sas antibodies showed that Sas<sup>FL</sup> localizes to apical cell surfaces, while Sas<sup>short</sup> is distributed across the entire cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These data imply that the EVT sequence lacking in Sas<sup>short</sup> is required for both apical localization and targeting to EVs. Polarized cells can release EVs with different cargoes from their apical and basolateral surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsui et al., 2021</xref>), so EV targeting could be downstream of apical localization in vivo. S2 cells are unpolarized, however, so this mechanism is unlikely to apply to trafficking of Sas<sup>FL</sup> to EVs in cultured S2s.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis of Sas<sup>FL</sup> EVs by electron microscopy</title><p>To demonstrate that Sas is actually on EVs, we used immuno-EM and EM tomography to analyze purified EV preparations from V5-Sas<sup>FL</sup>-expressing S2 cells. The tomographic images showed that the EVs span a range of sizes, from ~30 nm in diameter to &gt;100 nm, and that they are a mixture of single and double-membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For immuno-EM, we incubated EVs with anti-V5, followed by gold-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows a typical image, in which an EV is associated with multiple 10 nm gold particles. The distance between the EV membrane (yellow bracket: diameter of the vesicle) and a gold particle (white bracket: distance between membrane and a particle) can be more than 40 nm. This likely reflects the large size of the Sas ECD, in which the N-terminal V5 epitope is separated by 1590 aa from the TM domain. The distance is variable, however, because the Sas ECD, which is composed of a chain of domains separated by linkers, is likely to be flexible and able to adopt many different conformations. The region outside the membrane boundary is of higher density, probably because it represents the protein sheath around the EV membrane. To further characterize Sas localization, we performed an experiment in which EVs were incubated with both mouse anti-V5 and rabbit anti-Sas, which primarily recognizes the EVT region in the middle of the ECD, followed by 10 nm gold particle-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody and 5 nm gold particle-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> shows an EV that is associated with multiple 10 nm (arrow) and 5 nm (arrowhead) gold particles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of EVs by electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Immuno-EM images of EVs from a purified EV prep from V5-Sas<sup>FL</sup>-expressing S2 cells.

Proteins in these categories were found to be major EV components in a proteomic analysis of S2 and Kc167 cell EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koppen et al., 2011</xref>). We think it likely that some or all these proteins are abundant contaminants that do not actually interact with Sas but happened to be present at higher levels in the IP from Sas-expressing cells <italic>vs</italic>. the IP from control cells.

We coexpressed Myc epitope-tagged dArc1 with a fusion protein in which the V5-tagged ECD of mouse CD8 was attached to the TM domain and the 37 aa ICD of Sas. We then IP’d cell lysates with anti-Myc, and detected V5-mCD8<sup>ECD</sup>-Sas<sup>TM-ICD</sup> and dArc1-Myc by western blotting. We observed that dArc1 co-IP’d with the Sas ICD fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>The Sas ICD sequence contains the sequence motif YDNPSY, which is a PTB-binding motif (NPXY) that overlaps by two amino acids with an SH2-binding motif (YXXP) that is also a potential Abl tyrosine kinase substrate sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colicelli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The NPXY motif is the target for binding of the Numb PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 1998</xref>). This suggests that an SH2 protein and a PTB protein might compete for binding to this sequence, if the first tyrosine was phosphorylated to create an SH2 docking site. The PTB domain of Numb does not require tyrosine phosphorylation to bind to its NPXY target. Interestingly, in an earlier mass spectrometric analysis, we found that the Shc protein, which contains a phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain, was associated with Sas purified from S2 cells treated with pervanadate to induce high-level tyrosine phosphorylation.</p><p>We searched for other <italic>Drosophila</italic> CSPs containing a sequence with similar properties in their ICDs, and found only one, Appl, which has the sequence YENPTY but is otherwise unrelated to the Sas ICD. Human APP, the mammalian ortholog of Appl, contains the same sequence in its short ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), as do the two APP paralogs, APLP1 and APLP2. We then replaced the Sas ICD in the V5-mCD8<sup>ECD</sup>-Sas<sup>TM-ICD</sup> construct with the Appl and APP ICDs, and found that the Appl ICD protein co-IP’d with dArc1-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), implicating the Y(D/E)NP(S/T)Y sequence in binding to dArc1. This sequence contains the consensus motif for binding of mammalian Arc to TARPγ2, CaMKII, and NMDA receptor peptides, which is X-P-X-(Y/F/H)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nielsen et al., 2019</xref>). Arc binds to the NMDA receptor as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nielsen et al., 2019</xref>). The TARPγ2 Arc-binding peptide is RIPSYR, which is similar to the sequences in Sas (PSYK) and APP (PTYK). Accordingly, we expressed Myc-tagged mammalian Arc (rArc<sup>FL</sup>) in S2 cells and examined whether it could co-IP with the V5-mCD8-ICD fusion proteins. We observed that Myc-rArc<sup>FL</sup> was able to co-IP with the Sas and APP ICDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>The co-IP data indicate that the Sas, APP, and Appl ICDs associate with dArc1 and Arc, but does not show that the proteins bind directly to each other. To evaluate this, we made the complete Sas, APP, and Appl ICDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), as well as a scrambled version of the Sas ICD and a deletion mutant of the Sas ICD that lacks the YDNPSY sequence, as biotinylated peptides, and bound these to streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. To make purified Arc proteins for binding, we expressed dArc1 and mammalian Arc as GST fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We mixed the beads with purified GST-dArc1 and GST-rArc<sup>FL</sup> proteins and examined whether we could observe specific binding. As a positive control, we made purified Numb PTB domain, and showed that it bound as expected to the Sas, APP, and Appl peptides, which all contain the NPXY PTB-binding motif, but not to the scrambled Sas peptide or the YDNPSY deletion mutant. In the peptide binding assay, we observed that dArc1 directly bound to the Sas ICD peptide, but not to the other peptides. Mammalian Arc also bound to the Sas ICD peptide, as well as to the APP ICD peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Arc are not orthologs, and are apparently derived from independent Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hantak et al., 2021</xref>). The fact that both proteins mediate intercellular communication suggests that they may be products of convergent evolution. Our results implicate the Y(D/E)NP(S/T)Y sequence as a determinant of binding to Arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), and show that fly and mammalian Arcs can bind to the same peptide sequences.</p><p>Our data also suggest that APP might be a CSP that has a relationship to Arc which is similar to that of Sas to dArc1.

If YENP was phosphorylated, it would become a docking site for a class of SH2 domain proteins, and binding of this protein(s) could occlude Arc binding to the adjacent PTYK sequence.

To establish an assay system for dArc1 capsid movement in embryos, we first expressed V5-Sas<sup>FL</sup> in late stage 16 embryonic SGs together with RFP, and observed that V5 signal moved to the gut and tracheae, while RFP was retained in the SGs as expected. When V5-Sas<sup>short</sup> was expressed in SGs, however, V5 staining was only observed in the SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Colloidal gold particles (10 nm) were placed on both surfaces of the grid to serve as fiducial markers for subsequent image alignment. Grids were placed in a dual-axis tomography holder (Model 2040; Fischione Instruments, Inc) and imaged with a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) at 120 k eV. For dual-axis tomography, grids were tilted +/-62° and images acquired at 1° intervals. The grid was rotated 90° and a similar tilt-series was recorded about the orthogonal axis. Tilt-series data was acquired automatically using the SerialEM software package. Tomographic data was calculated, analyzed and modeled on iMac Pro and M1 computers (Apple, Inc) using the IMOD software package.</p><p>For immuno-EM, EV pellets were prepared as per above. Supernatant was removed and pellets fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jason D Shepherd (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as important mediators of cell-to-cell signaling. In this paper the authors aim to demonstrate that Stranded at second (Sas), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell surface protein, binds to dArc1 and Ptp10D to mediate intercellular transport of dArc1 via EVs. dArc1 protein has been shown to form virus-like capsids that carry dArc1 mRNA from neurons to muscle, but little is known about this new intercellular communication pathway. Similarly, not much is known generally about how EVs are targeted to specific cell types, or how specific EV cargo can be delivered. Thus, this work is of interest to cell biologists and neuroscientists. However, the jumbled description of the results and lack of rigor in some experiments diminish the impact and interpretability of the conclusions. Moreover, almost all experiments rely on gain-of-function and over-expression of Sas, thus the relevance to normal physiological signaling is unclear. There are other concerns detailed below that need to be addressed before acceptance. The authors are urged to address concerns raised that can be dealt with using <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The manuscript should also be toned to make it more '<italic>Drosophila</italic>-centric' as generalizations will require additional experiments ( such as with mammalian cell culture). While re-writing, a substantial reduction in the introduction is also suggested. In particular, there is no need to summarise the results in this section in such detail.</p><p>We detail below a composite summary of the major points raised by the reviewers for your attention,</p><p>The authors' EV isolation protocol is generally not a preferred procedure because it precipitates proteinaceous non-vesicular material, resulting in a mixed preparation of vesicles and protein aggregates. While the authors point to Skotvoll et al., 2019, this paper compares only one approach (ultracentrifugation) to the EV isolation kit. While there is an overlap in the protein components of these approaches in their report, there are considerable differences in the identified proteins. The consensus in the field is that these kits fall under what MISEV2018 Guidelines describe as &quot;high recovery, low specificity&quot; methods, and very likely, these samples have a greater incidence of non-vesicular materials. In this case, the authors' samples are more &quot;secretome-like&quot; and this is observed in their EM of S2 EVs (Figure S2 a,b,d). Using a more robust and specific EV isolation approach, such as a combination of filtration or ultracentrifugation, followed by density gradient fractionation would absolutely improve the quality of their manuscript by providing more convincing evidence that the proposed cargoes are indeed trafficked within EVs. The authors should provide further experimental validation of Sas's EV enrichment, isolating EVs from cultured cells using a more accurate approach.</p><p>The description of the results omits some data in the figures and is not in a logical order. This makes the manuscript hard to read and follow. There is also a lack of rigor and quantification in some experiments. Specifically:</p><p>1. Figure 1</p><p>Lack of quantification: 1 image is just not enough.</p><p>Calculate the ratio lysate/EV, also with EVi as a marker for EVs. Only the lysate is shown. EVs should also!</p><p>The authors claim (line 153) that most of FL Sas are in EVs? ` It looks like 60%, but it depends on the loading. Please quantify.</p><p>Further:</p><p>In Figure 1b, the authors suggest that full-length Sas is a predominant EV component, but not Sas-short. The figure would be strengthened by including data describing the in vivo distribution of the V5-tagged short Sas isoform in conjunction with mCD8-GFP. One would expect the Sas-short isoform to be less broadly distributed compared to Sas-FL.</p><p>In Supplemental Figure 1, the full blots should be shown for panel A. Why are the control β-Tub bands shown side-by-side, but not the bands for Sas-FL and Sas-short? Also, the authors could include protein samples from wild-type and Sas<sup>-1</sup>5 embryos to enhance the validation of their antibody reagents.</p><p>2. Figure 2: Nice IEM and tomography, but many details are needed. Could more IEM profiles (more examples) be provided to be sure of `BG and specificity (in a gallery). Are the capsid reconstitution with purified dARC1 and 2 performed in the presence of darc1 rRNA? Any RNA (figure 2)? Description of dArc1 putative capsids is absent from the Results section (2f,g) until describing Figure 4 data (line 362). Given that there is no immuno-EM labeling of dArc1 protein, it is not clear if Sas and dArc1 are localized to the same EVs. Nor is it clear if the double membrane EVs are actually EVs that contain capsids. Overall, the EM data lacks quantification. How many EVs on average show Sas labeling? How many EVs have double membranes? The immuno-EM data would be strengthened by adding quantifications in the form of distance measurements of gold particles of Anti-V5 and Anti-Sas in relation to EV membranes. The dense protein staining surrounding EVs seems unusual, is this due to an artifact of the purification? EV kits are generally non-specific and isolate non-EV membranes, Corroboration using ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography methods would be beneficial. SAS-FL overexpression results in more EVs, which confounds subsequent experiments suggesting that Sas targets EVs to specific cell types/regions.</p><p>3. Figure 3: There are no data showing the expression of Sas in SG cells using the GAL4 lines. Is this expression restricted to just SG cells? (The results jump from a-b to f-g. c-e are out of order. It will be easier if this is ordered). The quantification in g should be broken into two and paired with the actual data (c-e, and f). It is not clear how the quantification in g was performed. How many western blots (WBs) were analyzed? There seems to be a bubble in the first lane of f, which would preclude quantification. Why is d not quantified, and there seems to be an overall increase in background staining in e that is not specific to discs? The source data files are not labeled and these data should be incorporated into annotated supplemental figures. Is transfer in a-b due to Ptp10D? How many WBs were quantified in g? What is the specificity for full-length Sas? The expression of short Sas should not lead to its incorporation in EVs and their overnight addition should not lead to the same effect (Figure 3). This should be better investigated as short Sas is a good control for full-length Sas.</p><p>In the salivary gland (SG) expression data presented in Figure 3a-b, the authors should have included V5-Sas-short as a negative control for cross-tissue transport. Similarly, in Figure 3c-e, EVs isolated from Sas-Short transfected cells should have been included as a control in the overnight EV-imaginal disc incubation assays. Does over-expression of Numb on its own lead to increased uptake of Sas-FL EVs? Also, does the need for Ptp10D and Numb over-expression for efficient capture of Sas-FL EVs in Figure 3c-e raise doubts about the data presented in Figure 3a-b, in which the transfer from SGs seems to be efficient without the need for Ptp10D or Numb over-expression?</p><p>Also</p><p>a: Are wing discs the only recipient tissues upon S2 cells EVs exposure? The tissues in Figure 5 are the trachea and guts. Why switch?</p><p>b: What about Ptp10D mutant disc (as in section 2)?</p><p>Better quantification? Number of discs etc.</p><p>4. Figure 4: C and d, IP data has no inputs for IPs, no sizing markers, and no IgG controls for antibody specificity. These data would also be more convincing if done with FL Sas and included co-Ips from cell lysates.</p><p>The IPs presented in Figure 4C with myc-tagged constructs are not controlled properly. Western blots of protein extracts prior to IPs should be shown and a control antibody should be used to show equal loading in the WB for either dArc1-Myc or Myc-rArc-FL expressing cells. Showing the IPs one on top of each other is very confusing and WBs are critical to showing that the expected proteins are expressed in the transfected cells, even if their IP signature is negative.</p><p>5. In general, the WBs in the figures show very white backgrounds with high contrast. Please check if any contrast enhancement (or other such changes) were made and if so, they need to be documented and justified. Else, please revert to raw images of blots. Total protein controls are also missing.</p><p>6. Figure 5: Ashley et al. (Cell 2018) showed that dArc1 mRNA transfer required the 3'UTR so it is puzzling that the authors used heterologous UTRs. The results using FISH on endogenous dArc1 mRNA are dramatic. The authors should show definitively that their probe does not pick up over-expressed dArc1. In general, a better quantitative analysis should be provided. For instance, there is no quantitative data for Figure 5, but this point should be examined in other figures as well. The dAC1 increased expression in the target cells upon dARC1 increased production in SG(Figure 5) becomes an important part of the paper (and the model) but is not investigated! How does it work? Does the delivery of darc1 mRNAs packaged in capsids simply lead to more dARC1 translation? Is it proportional?</p><p>Or, is there also stimulation of darc1 transcription? Is there also an increase in the mRNA level (we cannot see the SG control of 5o (sage&gt;+) supporting the authors' claim on line 562!).</p><p>Also:</p><p>a: What is the dARC1 LOF mutant phenotype in SG and trachea?</p><p>b: Do EV produced upon FL Sas v5 expression in an SG not produce dARC1 in the recipient trachea?</p><p>c: Does this also depend on the same synergetic presence of Ptp10D and Numb in the trachea? Ptp10D LOF?</p><p>The authors' data suggest that dArc1 protein and mRNA are transferred by Sas-FL expressing EVs to Ptp10D enriched tissues in fly embryos. Could the authors conduct immuno-EM or nano-flow cytometry studies to assess the general proportion of Sas and dArc1 co-expression in purified EVs? If the general model is accurate, one would expect a higher degree of co-occurrence compared to control EV cargos. Additionally, evaluating the dArc1 protein and mRNA transfer properties in different genetic backgrounds (i.e. Sas-FL and Sas-Short in Ptp10D over-expressed or in Ptp10D null embryos) would significantly enhance the paper.</p><p>Also in Figure 5, the results suggesting that transgenic over-expression of dArc1 leads to a strongly increased expression of endogenous dArc1 should be validated using a complementary strategy (e.g. RT-qPCR on dissected tissue specimens, RNA-FISH with probes specific to the endogenous mRNA).</p><p>- For all the tissue imaging studies, including those in Figures 5-6,, the authors should provide an indication of how many specimens were analyzed in total, presuming the samples shown in the figures were representative of observations made across multiple tissue specimens co-labeled in the same experiment.</p><p>7. Figure 6: what is the red circle (and blue)?</p><p>What is the black circle, an SG cell?</p><p>8. Most (all) experiments are performed with over-expression of FL Sas or ICD. Does endogenous Sas bind endogenous Ptp10D and dARC1? ICDs? Also full-length APP? Many of the conclusions would be strengthened by the loss of function experiments, especially showing a requirement for Sas in dArc1 transfer.</p><p>9. Use of more extensive fly genetics using specific Ptp10D LOF in wing discs and trachea (to show the converse of the GOF). Does Ptp10D acts as the MAIN receptor to FL Sas? Numb LOF, a combination of LOF and GOF? Does Ptp10D GOF compensate for Numb and vice versa?</p><p>– The introduction section would benefit from some sentence restructuring, synthesizing major ideas into a more coherent train of thought. For instance, very short, matter-of-fact statements such as &quot;EV cargoes are biomarkers for specific diseases&quot; are not helpful, especially since no specific examples of diseases are provided. Also, more primary sources of literature should be cited, as many statements are lacking supporting evidence, particularly those describing EV biology and characteristics.</p><p>– While the authors use &quot;comparatively&quot; to describe the current knowledge of EV-biogenesis pathways as &quot;well understood,&quot; this is not an appropriate description and can be misleading. EV-biogenesis pathways are only beginning to be unraveled.</p><p>– When describing their major finding (Lee et al., 2013) that Ptp10D is a binding partner for Sas, The authors should stress that this was done in a previous study. Simply adding a world like &quot;previously&quot; will make this clear.</p><p>– The paragraph from lines 85-90 stating that 'Sas localizes to EVs, as demonstrated…' appears to be out of context and is more appropriate for the 'Results' section.</p><p>– The authors should mention what device they used for NTA, not just provide the name of the outsourcing company. From their description, it appears they used NanoSight, but don't provide acquisition parameters.</p><p>– In Figure 2 f,g the authors provide EM images of capsid-like structures for dArc1 and dArc2, however, they do not address these until much later in the manuscript, when they describe how these capsids were generated. The authors should consider reorganizing their figures to improve the flow of their narration and not group them into categories, as this makes the manuscript more difficult to follow.</p><p>– There may be referencing errors in the manuscript when mentioning figures, for instance when they describe the detection of V5-mCD8ECD-SasTM-ICD by western blotting, they reference Figure 4d, but it appears they actually mean Figure 4c. Another such error appears in the text describing Figure 5n, which depicts <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos co-expressing SasFL and dArc1, and which authors describe as Figure 5m. I recommend that they carefully double-check the manuscript for any such errors, which are confusing for the reader.</p><p>– When appropriate the authors should add statistical analysis to their quantitative data, for example, Figure 3g.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82874.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors' EV isolation protocol is generally not a preferred procedure because it precipitates proteinaceous non-vesicular material, resulting in a mixed preparation of vesicles and protein aggregates.

Ptp10D stimulates transfer but is not required. There is low-level Ptp10D expression in discs, and Sas has other binding partners. Transfer is much more efficient when Sas<sup>FL</sup> is expressed in SGs in vivo than when supernatant is added to discs. We used discs because they can be easily dissected away from larvae. Tracheae are embedded in the body wall, and the larval gut is huge and hard to visualize. In embryos, tracheae and gut can be visualized in whole-mounts, but that is not possible in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae. It is not worth doing <italic>Ptp10D</italic> LOF experiments. These would be time-consuming, requiring months to combine the LOF allele with drivers and reporters, and would likely not produce clear results, since Sas has other binding partners. We now report the number of discs measured (5 per condition).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: C and d, IP data has no inputs for IPs, no sizing markers, and no IgG controls for antibody specificity. These data would also be more convincing if done with FL Sas and included co-Ips from cell lysates.</p><p>The IPs presented in Figure 4C with myc-tagged constructs are not controlled properly. Western blots of protein extracts prior to IPs should be shown and a control antibody should be used to show equal loading in the WB for either dArc1-Myc or Myc-rArc-FL expressing cells. Showing the IPs one on top of each other is very confusing and WBs are critical to showing that the expected proteins are expressed in the transfected cells, even if their IP signature is negative.</p><p>5. In general, the WBs in the figures show very white backgrounds with high contrast.

The CD8 chimera is better than Sas<sup>FL</sup> because it isolates the binding region to the ICD and also produces cleaner blots than Sas<sup>FL</sup>, being a much shorter protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: Ashley et al. (Cell 2018) showed that dArc1 mRNA transfer required the 3'UTR so it is puzzling that the authors used heterologous UTRs. The results using FISH on endogenous dArc1 mRNA are dramatic. The authors should show definitively that their probe does not pick up over-expressed dArc1. In general, a better quantitative analysis should be provided. For instance, there is no quantitative data for Figure 5, but this point should be examined in other figures as well. The dAC1 increased expression in the target cells upon dARC1 increased production in SG(Figure 5) becomes an important part of the paper (and the model) but is not investigated! How does it work? Does the delivery of darc1 mRNAs packaged in capsids simply lead to more dARC1 translation? Is it proportional?</p><p>Or, is there also stimulation of darc1 transcription?

The probe we used cannot detect the transgene RNA because that does not contain any of the <italic>dArc1</italic> 3’ UTR sequences in the probe. We now include new FISH experiments with an SV40 3’ UTR probe, which picks up only the mRNA from the transgene, and this confirms the results of Ashley et al., showing that the transgene mRNA cannot move away from the SGs because it is not loaded into capsids. Regarding the other criticisms of Figure 5: (1) it is beyond the scope of this paper to define the mechanism by which dArc1 protein increases production of the endogenous <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA. It could be due to de novo transcription or to mRNA stabilization. (2) there are no embryonic <italic>dArc1</italic> LOF phenotypes that have been detected. (3) It would be difficult and time-consuming to incorporate <italic>Ptp10D</italic> LOF mutations into a genetic background that already contains several transgenes and a driver. In any case, it is likely that Sas has other binding partners, as demonstrated by our original paper (Lee et al., 2013), so we would not expect that transfer would be eliminated. (3) The FISH experiments are representative of the results from &gt;100 embryos. Such experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are normally not quantitated. (4) We show that translocation of <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA requires expression of both Sas<sup>FL</sup> and dArc1. dArc1 capsids are a normal EV component, but our data show that without Sas<sup>FL</sup> they cannot move to tracheae. It is difficult to determine what percentage of EVs have both Sas<sup>FL</sup> and dArc1, because in immuno-EM experiments there are always many antigens that do not have gold particles, and in any case we were not able to do immuno-EM with anti-dArc1. (5) We now show data with both <italic>dArc1</italic> 3’ UTR and SV40 3’ UTR probes, showing that the transgenic construct expresses in SGs but its mRNA is not observed outside of the expressing cells.</p><p>Responses to the remaining criticisms in the composite review</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2: Nice IEM and tomography, but many details are needed. Could more IEM profiles (more examples) be provided to be sure of `BG and specificity (in a gallery). Are the capsid reconstitution with purified dARC1 and 2 performed in the presence of darc1 rRNA? Any RNA (figure 2)? Description of dArc1 putative capsids is absent from the Results section (2f,g) until describing Figure 4 data (line 362). Given that there is no immuno-EM labeling of dArc1 protein, it is not clear if Sas and dArc1 are localized to the same EVs. Nor is it clear if the double membrane EVs are actually EVs that contain capsids. Overall, the EM data lacks quantification. How many EVs on average show Sas labeling? How many EVs have double membranes? The immuno-EM data would be strengthened by adding quantifications in the form of distance measurements of gold particles of Anti-V5 and Anti-Sas in relation to EV membranes. The dense protein staining surrounding EVs seems unusual, is this due to an artifact of the purification? EV kits are generally non-specific and isolate non-EV membranes, Corroboration using ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography methods would be beneficial. SAS-FL overexpression results in more EVs, which confounds subsequent experiments suggesting that Sas targets EVs to specific cell types/regions.</p></disp-quote><p>1) In immuno-electron microscopy of embedded material, regardless of the methodology used, antibodies do not penetrate beyond the surfaces of the physical section. Because of this, only epitopes that are exposed at the section surfaces are available to and labeled by the antibodies. Thus, if a portion of an EV is at the section surface it can be labeled. However, if the entirety of the EV is contained within the volume of the section and no part of it is exposed at the surface, it is not accessible to the antibodies and will not be labeled (despite the fact that densities corresponding to the structure can still be seen). Because of this, overview images and/or galleries may show both labeled and unlabeled structures, but those that are unlabeled cannot be interpreted or quantified as being negative for the specific probe. (2) The capsids made from dArc1 and dArc2 made in <italic>E. coli</italic> do not have added RNA but probably incorporate <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA. In any case, we have removed these data, as they repeat published data on the capsids and don’t add value to the paper. (3) We have not been able to obtain immuno-EM labeling for dArc1. The antibody is of low quality and we had only a very small quantity of it. However, it is already known from Ashley et al., 2018 and others that EVs from untransfected S2 cells, which express Sas<sup>FL</sup> only at very low levels, often contain dArc1 capsids and <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA. (4) There is no point in doing distance measurements since the Sas ECD is a flexible structure that would not have a defined length. In fact, the observed distance is highly variable, probably because the Sas ECD, which is composed of a chain of domains separated by linkers, is likely to be flexible and able to adopt many different conformations. (5) It is true that Sas<sup>FL</sup> expression modestly increases EV production, but the effects observed in Figure 5 are all-or-nothing, so this cannot account for translocation of <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA to other cells. 6) We have purified EVs using ultracentrifugation, and these data are reported in Figure 1. We did not think it worthwhile to do a new series of EM experiments just to visualize S2 EVs purified in this manner, since this has already been published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' data suggest that dArc1 protein and mRNA are transferred by Sas-FL expressing EVs to Ptp10D enriched tissues in fly embryos. Could the authors conduct immuno-EM or nano-flow cytometry studies to assess the general proportion of Sas and dArc1 co-expression in purified EVs? If the general model is accurate, one would expect a higher degree of co-occurrence compared to control EV cargos. Additionally, evaluating the dArc1 protein and mRNA transfer properties in different genetic backgrounds (i.e. Sas-FL and Sas-Short in Ptp10D over-expressed or in Ptp10D null embryos) would significantly enhance the paper.</p><p>Also in Figure 5, the results suggesting that transgenic over-expression of dArc1 leads to a strongly increased expression of endogenous dArc1 should be validated using a complementary strategy (e.g. RT-qPCR on dissected tissue specimens, RNA-FISH with probes specific to the endogenous mRNA).</p></disp-quote><p>See above. We were not able to do immuno-EM with antibody against dArc1 and in any case this technique is not quantitative. One could not draw any conclusions from counting EVs that appeared to be labeled for both antigens vs. only one (see discussion above). We did do FISH with probes specific for the endogenous mRNA, as discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most (all) experiments are performed with over-expression of FL Sas or ICD. Does endogenous Sas bind endogenous Ptp10D and dARC1? ICDs? Also full-length APP? Many of the conclusions would be strengthened by the loss of function experiments, especially showing a requirement for Sas in dArc1 transfer.</p><p>8. Use of more extensive fly genetics using specific Ptp10D LOF in wing discs and trachea (to show the converse of the GOF). Does Ptp10D acts as the MAIN receptor to FL Sas? Numb LOF, a combination of LOF and GOF? Does Ptp10D GOF compensate for Numb and vice versa?</p></disp-quote><p>1) Ectopic expression of Sas and dArc1 is the only way to evaluate transfer from one cell type to another, since both genes are broadly expressed. (2) There is no way to determine if endogenous Sas binds to dArc1. Endogenous Sas, however, is found in cells adjacent to those expressing Ptp10D (Lee et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al. 2017), suggesting that the two proteins might form a complex. (3) There would be no reason to express full-length APP in S2s, since we have already demonstrated that dArc1 and Arc binding can be localized to the APP ICD using the CD8 chimera. In any case, the rest of APP is on the outside of the cell/EV and therefore not accessible to Arcs. (4) One cannot show a requirement for Sas in dArc1 transfer. This would be possible to test if it was observed that <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA moved to other cells in the absence of Sas<sup>FL</sup> coexpression in SGs (since one could then remove Sas and ask if transfer still occurred), but since <italic>dArc1</italic> mRNA remains in the SGs unless Sas<sup>FL</sup> is coexpressed this experiment cannot be done. (5) It would be very time-consuming to introduce <italic>Ptp10D</italic> LOF mutations into genetic backgrounds containing 3 or more transgenes (as in Figure 5). (6) Numb is an early embryonic lethal, so <italic>numb</italic> mutant embryos cannot be examined.</p></body></sub-article></article>
