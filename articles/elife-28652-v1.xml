these pathogens. RNA viruses typically have high mutation rates, resulting in frequent production of protein variants with compromised biophysical properties. Their evolution is necessarily constrained by the consequent challenge to protein folding and function. We hypothesized that host proteostasis mechanisms may be significant determinants of the fitness of viral protein variants, serving as a critical force shaping viral evolution. Here, we test that hypothesis by propagating influenza in host cells displaying chemically-controlled, divergent proteostasis environments. We find that both the nature of selection on the influenza genome and the accessibility of specific mutational trajectories are significantly impacted by host proteostasis. These findings provide new insights into features of host–pathogen interactions that shape viral evolution, and into the potential design of host proteostasis-targeted antiviral therapeutics that are refractory to resistance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28652.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza viruses, commonly called flu, can evade our immune system and develop resistance to treatments by changing frequently. Specifically, mutations in their genome cause influenza proteins to change in ways that can help the virus evade our defences. However, these mutations come at a cost and can prevent the viral proteins from forming functional and stable three-dimensional shapes – a process known as protein folding – thereby hampering the virus’ ability to replicate.</p><p>In human cells, proteins called chaperones can help our other proteins fold properly. Influenza viruses do not have their own chaperones and, instead, hijack those of their host. Host chaperones are therefore crucial to the virus’ ability to replicate. However, until now, it was not known if host chaperones can influence how these viruses evolve.</p><p>Here, Phillips et al. used mammalian cells to study how host chaperones affect an evolving influenza population. First, cells were engineered to either have normal chaperone levels, elevated chaperone levels, or inactive chaperones. Next, the H3N2 influenza strain was grown in these different conditions for nearly 200 generations and sequenced to determine how the virus evolved in each distinctive host chaperone environment.</p><p>Phillips et al. discovered that host chaperones affect the rate at which mutations accumulate in the influenza population, and also the types of mutations in the influenza genome. For instance, when a chaperone called Hsp90 was inactivated, mutations became prevalent in the viral population more slowly than in cells with normal or elevated chaperone levels. Moreover, some specific mutations fared better in cells with high chaperone levels, whilst others worked better in cells with inactivated chaperones.</p><p>These results suggest that influenza evolution is affected by host chaperone levels in complex and important ways. Moreover, whether chaperones will promote or hinder the effects of any single mutation is difficult to predict ahead of time. This discovery is significant, as the chaperones available to influenza can vary in different tissues, organisms and infectious conditions, and may therefore influence the virus' ability to change and evolve in a context-specific manner.</p><p>The findings are likely to extend to other viruses such as HIV and Ebola, which also hijack host chaperones for the same purpose. More work is now needed to systematically quantify these effects so that we can better predict how specific chaperones will affect the ability of viruses to adapt, especially in pathologically relevant conditions like fever or viral host-switching. In the future, such insights could help shape the design of treatments to which viruses do not evolve resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heat shock response</kwd><kwd>Hsp90</kwd><kwd>mutational landscape</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd><kwd>heat shock factor 1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001341</institution-id><institution>Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Smith Family Foundation Excellence in Biomedical Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoulders</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Director's New Innovator Award 1DP2GM119162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoulders</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004334</institution-id><institution>Merck</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UNCF-Merck Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nekongo</surname><given-names>Emmanuel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoulders</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-ES002109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoulders</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Host protein homeostasis is a critical force shaping influenza evolution, impacting both the nature of selection on the influenza genome and the accessibility of specific mutational trajectories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Minimalist pathogens like RNA viruses survive dynamic host environments by virtue of their extreme adaptability. This adaptability is driven by a high rate of genetic variation, mediated by error-prone genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>). Most missense mutations have deleterious consequences for protein function, often owing to either thermodynamic (reduced stability of the native state or enhanced stability of unfolded/misfolded states) or kinetic (slow folding or enhanced misfolding/aggregation) effects on folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>). In the context of viruses, these phenomena may underpin the observation that the distribution of mutational fitness effects can be largely accounted for by considering protein folding biophysics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wylie and Shakhnovich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chéron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009a</xref>). Indeed, stable proteins tend to be more evolvable, as any given missense mutation is less likely to severely disrupt protein folding or structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In cells, protein folding challenges are addressed by proteostasis networks composed of chaperones and quality control factors that work in concert to shepherd nascent proteins to folded, functional conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Powers and Balch, 2013</xref>). Important work focused primarily on the Hsp90 chaperone has suggested a critical role for chaperones in modulating the evolution of their endogenous clients, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lachowiec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sangster et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Whitesell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998</xref>) in part by buffering deleterious effects of non-synonymous mutations. The consequences of Hsp90 activity for protein evolution may be due to Hsp90 directly engaging an evolving client protein (termed a primary effect). Alternatively, the effects of Hsp90 may be secondary, mediated indirectly by Hsp90 influencing the folding of other endogenous clients that themselves engage relevant evolving proteins. For instance, Hsp90-dependent azole resistance in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is mediated by secondary effects of Hsp90 on calcineurin, an Hsp90 client that regulates responses to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>). Efforts to look beyond Hsp90 to understand how other components of the metazoan proteostasis machinery modulate evolution (e.g., Hsp40/70 chaperones or protein misfolding stress responses like the heat shock response) have been slowed by the paucity of chemical biology tools to perturb the activities of these systems. However, Tawfik and coworkers have shown that the GroEL/ES chaperonin system can govern the fitness of certain client protein variants in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009b</xref>), and computational modeling suggests that other chaperones may also have roles in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bogumil and Dagan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cetinbaş and Shakhnovich, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Chaperones and other proteostasis mechanisms are theoretically well-positioned to address the biophysical challenges created by high mutation rates in viruses. Intriguingly, most RNA viruses lack autonomous chaperones or other co-factors to assist their proteins with folding. Instead, viral proteins engage host chaperones, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Melville et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Momose et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Naito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">York et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>) and host chaperone inhibitors have been shown to limit the viability of certain RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heaton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taguwa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chase et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geller et al., 2012</xref>). However, the possibility that host chaperones can shape the evolution of viral pathogens has not been investigated.</p><p>In summary, it is clear that: (1) high genetic variability is essential to support RNA virus adaptability; (2) missense mutations important for viral adaptation are often biophysically deleterious, constraining the accessible mutational landscape; and (3) many viruses engage host chaperones to fold their proteins. An important but still untested hypothesis is that host proteostasis modulates RNA virus evolutionary trajectories. Experimentally testing this hypothesis requires methods to regulate the host cell’s proteostasis network without significantly perturbing cell health or the ability of an RNA virus to propagate. Here, we achieve this goal in the context of long-term influenza propagation by using small molecules to either modulate the heat shock response in a stress-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moore et al., 2016</xref>) or to inhibit Hsp90 at sub-lethal concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ying et al., 2012</xref>). We find that the resulting perturbations to host proteostasis mechanisms significantly impact both the extent and the nature of selection pressure on the influenza genome. We conclude that host proteostasis is a critical, under-appreciated player in influenza evolution, with significant implications for our ability to predict and prevent the evolution of influenza and other RNA viral pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Small molecule-based strategies create three distinctive host proteostasis environments for influenza evolution experiments</title><p>Eukaryotic cells dynamically match proteostasis network capacity to demand via compartment-specific stress responses. Thus, one biologically relevant strategy to create an altered proteostasis environment is to induce such responses. We focused on the heat shock response, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Åkerfelt et al., 2010</xref>) because numerous influenza proteins must fold and/or function in the cytosol and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>). Typical methods to induce heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of the heat shock response and thus of cytosolic and nuclear chaperone and quality control protein levels, involve treatment with toxins or acute heat stress. These methods are not useful for our studies because they engender massive protein misfolding stress in host cells that rapidly become apoptotic, preventing influenza propagation. An alternative strategy is to over-express a constitutively active form of HSF1 lacking amino acids 186–202 (termed cHSF1), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voellmy, 2005</xref>) but high levels of cHSF1 over-expression outside the physiologically relevant regime are typically toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ryno et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Instead, we took a chemical genetic approach, fusing cHSF1 to a destabilized variant of <italic>E. coli</italic> dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iwamoto et al., 2010</xref>). The DHFR.cHSF1 fusion is targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation and is therefore non-functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), unless cells are treated with the DHFR-stabilizing pharmacologic chaperone trimethoprim (TMP). We created a stable, clonal Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line expressing DHFR.cHSF1. In these cells, termed MDCK<sup>HSF1</sup> cells, we can dosably induce cHSF1 transcriptional activity by TMP treatment in a stress-independent manner within the biologically relevant regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), avoiding cytotoxicity that would be induced by stressors or cHSF1 overexpression and yet still providing robust access to cells expressing enhanced levels of HSF1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). To control for any possible unintended consequences of TMP treatment or expression of a DHFR-fusion protein in our evolution experiments, we also created a control MDCK cell line expressing DHFR.YFP (MDCK<sup>YFP</sup>). This MDCK<sup>YFP</sup> cell line does not display TMP-dependent upregulation of HSF1-dependent chaperones, indicating that TMP induces HSF1 activity in our MDCK<sup>HSF1</sup> cells specifically by stabilizing DHFR.cHSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28652.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chemical biology methods to modify the host cell’s proteostasis environment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Destabilized domain technology for stress-independent control of HSF1 activity with trimethoprim (TMP).

Here, we employed the Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090, a small molecule capable of targeting multiple Hsp90 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ying et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, Hsp90 inhibition using high concentrations of STA-9090 can cause an undesirable compensatory heat shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moore et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in activation of HSF1 and upregulation of Hsp70, Hsp40, and other HSF1 targets. Such compensatory HSF1 activation would convolute interpretation of our results. Thus, we treated with the highest possible STA-9090 concentration that does not induce a compensatory heat shock response in MDCK cells. We selected the concentration used via a functional assay for all experiments, examining Hsp70 protein levels by immunoblotting to ensure the absence of any heat shock response signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm that we are still engaging Hsp90 at the low STA-9090 concentration used in our serial passaging experiments, we performed a cellular thermal shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinez Molina et al., 2013</xref>) and observed a small but highly reproducible increase in Hsp90 thermal stability upon STA-9090 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Because Hsp90 inhibition can be employed in our MDCK<sup>HSF1</sup> cell line, these methods access three distinctive host proteostasis environments in a single cell line dependent only on small molecule treatment. The use of just a single cell line for experiments (MDCK<sup>HSF1</sup>) and for controls (MDCK<sup>YFP</sup>) minimizes any possible cell line-dependent bias in our evolution experiments. Importantly, monitoring chaperone levels in the context of influenza A/Wuhan/1995 (H3N2) infection shows that, under our infection conditions, influenza itself neither induces heat shock protein transcripts nor interferes with our method to activate HSF1.

Thus, differences observed in evolutionary trajectories cannot be attributed to either systematically altered rates of viral growth in the three different host proteostasis environments studied here or to gross differences in cell health.</p><p>Next, we sought to evaluate whether our serial passaging strategy provides a valid platform for modeling influenza evolution. In the absence of a strong exogenous selection pressure, such as an antiviral drug or antibody, we would predict that the influenza genome experiences purifying selection, meaning that most amino acid substitutions result in reduced fitness relative to the wild-type consensus sequence. We assessed the extent of purifying selection by determining the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions at each passage, normalized to the ratio of non-synonymous sites to synonymous sites in the influenza genome (3.5: 1), defined as D<sub>n</sub>/D<sub>s</sub>. As expected, non-synonymous mutations are selected against in all folding environments, as indicated by a D<sub>n</sub>/D<sub>s</sub> &lt; 1 throughout our serial passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breen et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nature of selection pressure differs in modified proteostasis environments</title><p>To comparatively evaluate the selection pressure placed on influenza by our three distinctive host proteostasis environments, we constructed variant frequency distributions (site frequency spectra; SFS) for each viral population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nielsen, 2005</xref>).

As expected, the resulting SFS for non-synonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) show that early passages consist entirely of low frequency variants. As the passaging experiment progresses, the high mutation rate of influenza maintains a substantial population of low frequency variants. However, the proportion of low frequency variants in the viral population decreases as selected mutations increase in frequency and become fixed.

Non-synonymous mutations fix latest in the Hsp90-inhibited environment and earliest in the HSF1-activated environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; outlined in green). For instance, in the Hsp90-inhibited environment, no mutations have exceeded 60% frequency by passage 9 or 80% frequency by passage 11. In contrast, in the HSF1-activated environment, mutations exceed 80% frequency as early as passage 9 and become fixed (&gt;90%) by passage 11. The basal environment lies between these two extremes, with mutations exceeding only 70% frequency by passage 9 and with no mutations yet being fixed at passage 11.</p><p>As mutations in each environment increase in frequency, all the distributions achieve similar U-shaped, bimodal distributions by passage 23. For the basal and HSF1-activated environments, the distributions become U-shaped by passage 11, whereas for the Hsp90-inhibited environment, this distribution emerges only after passage 19. To assess the significance of these differences in the shape of the SFS, we applied the Mann-Whitney test, which is a statistical test for comparing two distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mann and Whitney, 1947</xref>). Indeed, by passage 11, the first passage at which we observe fixed mutations in any environment, the shape of the non-synonymous SFS for influenza evolved in the Hsp90-inhibited environment is significantly different from that of influenza evolved in the basal and HSF1-activated environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This reduced rate of adaptation in Hsp90-inhibited versus basal and HSF1-activated environments is also evident from plotting individual mutation trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), revealing specific mutations that increase in frequency more gradually when Hsp90 is inhibited. In contrast, the overall shapes of the basal and HSF1-activated SFS are not significantly different.</p><p>As an internal control, we also examined the SFS and mutation trajectories for synonymous variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We find that synonymous mutations for each environment have similar SFS within each passage, and that the Mann-Whitney test cannot distinguish between the synonymous SFS in different proteostasis environments at any stage of the serial passaging experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, unlike non-synonymous mutations (see below and also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), specific synonymous mutations do not fix reproducibly in one particular environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). This observation is consistent with our expectation that, although the influenza genome does undergo selection at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Air et al., 1990</xref>), the host proteostasis-based perturbations of HSF1 activation and Hsp90 inhibition should primarily affect influenza evolution by modulating protein-level folding/function. The similar SFS for synonymous mutations also confirm that differences between folding environments for non-synonymous mutations cannot be attributed to altered viral growth rates.</p><p>Taken together, these observations draw an intriguing picture of the impact of host proteostasis on viral evolution. On the one hand, there is little effect on strongly deleterious mutations, as illustrated by the similar D<sub>n</sub>/D<sub>s</sub> ratios across environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On the other hand, the rate of adaptation by accumulation of advantageous mutations is significantly reduced in the Hsp90-inhibited environment, as compared to the basal and HSF1-activated environments. This signature of altered selection pressure in distinctive host proteostasis environments highlights the importance of this under-appreciated factor impacting viral evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Influenza protein mutational landscapes are modulated by host proteostasis</title><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that the host proteostasis environment is a determinant of the nature of selection pressure placed on the influenza genome.

We observed that the PA variants, which occur in both the HSF1-activated and Hsp90-inhibited environments, have slightly less favorable binding energy with wild-type PB1<sub>N</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The PB1 variants, which occur exclusively in the HSF1-activated environment, are also destabilizing, with the K11E substitution very strongly destabilizing the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that, whereas our perturbations of host proteostasis may be necessary to accommodate strongly destabilizing mutations in PB1, they may not be important for moderately destabilizing variants in PA. We note that co-occurrence of certain PA variants (e.g., E629K in PA) can compensate for the strongly destabilizing effects of observed PB1 substitutions (e.g., the combination of E629K in PA and K11E in PB1 results in a stable complex; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). However, the mutation frequencies are not strongly correlated in our data and likely occur in distinctive influenza genomes. Cumulatively, these observations indicate that host proteostasis impacts the fitness of destabilizing amino acid substitutions in influenza proteins in a protein-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Divergent mutational trajectories in HSF1-activated versus Hsp90-inhibited environments</title><p>Next, we analyzed the mutational trajectories of variants present at high frequency in our founder virus to identify those with significantly altered fitness between proteostasis environments. Such variants had the opportunity to be selected for or against in all environments and thus are less subject to the stochasticity inherent in a serial passaging-based evolution experiment.

Moreover, these variants completely fall out of two replicates of the Hsp90-inhibited environment by passage 9. All three mutations share identical mutational trajectories and V242I and M246I occur together in sequencing reads. Hence, the trajectory of only one variant, N144T, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. The three mutations occur in the globular head domain of HA that binds cellular sialic acid and has inherently high mutational tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014</xref>). These mutations may increase the affinity of HA for MDCK sialic acid receptors, but may be less fit when Hsp90 is inhibited. HA folding occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, which contains an Hsp90 isoform (Grp94) that is also inhibited by STA-9090 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marzec et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of active Grp94, these HA variants may have compromised folding and/or intracellular trafficking, resulting in diminished fitness relative to wild-type HA regardless of any functional advantage they may confer in other host proteostasis environments.</p><p>In PA, we observed that the H452Q variant is present at 20% frequency in the founder virus and becomes fixed in two replicates of the Hsp90-inhibited environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This variant does not become fixed in the basal environment, and is selected against in the HSF1-activated environment. Interestingly, although the H452Q mutation is far from the PA endonuclease site, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reich et al., 2014</xref>) it is known to occur preferentially in reassorted viruses compared to pure strains, which is indicative of a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zeldovich et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To unequivocally determine the fitness of the H452Q variant relative to wild-type PA in HSF1-activated and Hsp90-inhibited host cells, we performed reverse genetics to enable head-to-head competition of the variants, thereby quantitatively establishing their relative fitness in our three distinct host proteostasis environments. We prepared wild-type and H452Q PA-containing influenza populations that were otherwise genetically identical. Next, we co-infected host cells displaying HSF1-activated, basal, or Hsp90-inhibited folding environments with equivalent amounts of each virus at low MOI and sequenced the resulting populations after the competition to quantify variant fitness relative to wild-type. We found that Hsp90 inhibition does indeed significantly enhance the fitness of the H452Q variant relative to wild-type PA, while HSF1 activation significantly reduces it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One likely possibility is that Hsp90 delays subunit assembly or directs destabilized PA variants to degradation, as H452Q has a predicted ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> of +1.10 kcal/mol relative to wild-type PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin et al., 2007</xref>). In either scenario, this observation that the fitness of an otherwise deleterious amino acid substitution in a non-autonomous Hsp90 client can be enhanced by chaperone inhibition but reduced by HSF1 activation is provocative.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Considerable evidence suggests that autonomous chaperone networks can critically influence the evolution of their endogenous client protein partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lachowiec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sangster et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Whitesell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009b</xref>). However, prior to this work, the possibility that host chaperones significantly modulate pathogen evolution had not been rigorously investigated. Moreover, in eukaryotic systems, research has focused largely on Hsp90 inhibition. Here, we not only define a new role for host proteostasis in influenza evolution, but we also show that two unique proteostasis perturbations, HSF1 activation and Hsp90 inhibition, have distinctive consequences for client protein evolution. These consequences are revealed at the levels of the whole genome, individual genes, and specific mutations.</p><p>At the whole genome-level, our data indicate that non-synonymous mutations are fixed more slowly when Hsp90 is inhibited and more quickly when HSF1 is activated. Moreover, the overall shape of the Hsp90-inhibited passage 11 SFS is significantly different from that observed in the other two environments. Changes in the rate of adaptation could be caused by buffering of mildly deleterious mutations or by potentiation of advantageous variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lachowiec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sangster et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rohner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Whitesell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cetinbaş and Shakhnovich, 2013</xref>). In the case of buffering, the rate of fixation of advantageous variants (driver mutations) would be decreased if the effects of mildly deleterious variants linked with the driver (passenger mutations) are rendered more damaging by Hsp90 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McFarland et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2014</xref>). In the case of potentiation, Hsp90 activity could necessitate emergence of the observed high frequency variants. Alternatively, Hsp90 activity may reduce weakly deleterious effects of driver mutations on their carrier proteins (e.g., disrupted folding caused by an otherwise beneficial mutation), thereby increasing the selective advantage provided by the drivers. Though we cannot yet fully resolve which of these factors, or combinations thereof, are at play here, overall, we observe that host proteostasis indeed modulates the pace of influenza evolution.</p><p>At the level of individual genes, we find that mutational tolerance at the interface of the PA:PB1 influenza polymerase complex, a region essential for polymerase assembly and activity, is impacted by host proteostasis. Interestingly, moderately destabilizing variants in PA are tolerated in all three host proteostasis environments studied. In contrast, amino acid substitutions in the N-terminus of PB1 are observed only when HSF1 is activated. These PB1 variants strongly destabilize the PB1:PA complex and thus may be accessible only in host cells with high chaperone levels. Indeed, polymerase assembly is known to be mediated by cytosolic host chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Naito et al., 2007</xref>). These observations indicate that the evolution of the influenza polymerase complex may be modulated by host proteostasis in significant ways.</p><p>At the level of individual mutations, our data demonstrate that host proteostasis impacts the fitness of specific mutations in at least two viral proteins. Intriguingly, the directionality of this effect seems to be specific to a given variant or protein. For example, the apparently destabilizing H452Q PA variant is significantly more fit when Hsp90 is inhibited, but significantly less fit when HSF1 is activated. These results highlight that the impact of proteostasis perturbation on evolution is currently difficult to predict <italic>a priori</italic> and demands further study, as one might by default assume that chaperone inhibition would enhance the fitness costs of such a mutation. We also identified variants in HA that behave in the opposite manner, displaying apparently enhanced fitness when HSF1 is activated. These divergent effects of host proteostasis on the fitness of individual variants illustrate the complexity of the interactions between viral proteins and host proteostasis mechanisms.</p><p>Thus, we observe that host proteostasis modulates the nature of selection on the influenza genome, the mutational tolerance of specific influenza proteins, and the trajectories of particular variants. These results are especially compelling because consequences of altered host proteostasis for influenza evolution are emerging in the course of a relatively short-timescale evolution experiment, and without exerting additional selection pressure such as treatment with antiviral drugs. As in previous studies on the role of Hsp90 in the evolution of their endogenous protein clients, our observations may derive from direct interactions between host proteostasis components and influenza proteins, or from indirect consequences of perturbing proteostasis. Untangling these possibilities will require detailed biophysical and mechanistic studies.</p><p>Regardless of its precise origin, this role for host proteostasis in modulating both the pace and the directionality of influenza evolution is provocative. Our observations raise a number of intriguing questions for future work. How do host proteostasis mechanisms beyond the heat shock response modulate influenza evolution, and what specific chaperones beyond Hsp90 are involved? Can we quantitatively evaluate the magnitude and ultimately predict the directionality of these effects? Are these effects direct consequences of host chaperones engaging influenza clients? If not, what are the mediators? How does host proteostasis impact the evolution of rapidly evolving viruses beyond just influenza? Do physiological states involving altered or perturbed proteostasis (e.g., fever or host-switching) impact viral evolution? Defining the molecular details of this interplay between host proteostasis and viral evolution will be essential to fully elucidate the factors potentiating and constraining viral evolution. Moreover, such studies may eventually enable design of improved antiviral therapeutics and antibodies that are refractory to the evolution of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MDCK cells were generously provided by Prof. Jianzhu Chen (MIT), and were originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

To quantify differences in the passage 11 site frequency spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the Mann-Whitney test was performed using Graph Pad Prism software (nonparametric, one-tailed). This test was performed on the passage 11 site frequency spectra because this is the first passage at which we observe fixed mutations in any environment. A one-tailed test was used as we expect mutation frequency spectra to shift in a one-directional manner as mutations become fixed and the distribution becomes U-shaped. All mutation frequencies observed in the two distributions (where each distribution represents three biological triplicate data sets) to be compared were ranked. Each set of ranks was then compared to determine if the distributions are significantly different.

PA<sub>C</sub> is the C-terminal PA domain (residues 257–716), and PB1<sub>N</sub> is the N-terminal domain (residues 1–15) of PB1. In 2ZNL there are some missing residues (residues 349–353; 372–397; 550–557), but they were distant from the PA<sub>C</sub>–PB1<sub>N</sub> binding site. As all of these missing residues were far from the binding site they were not added back in. Furthermore, as described below, only residues 398–716 of PA<sub>C</sub> were allowed to move and the rest of PA<sub>C</sub> was position-restrained throughout the simulations. For each segment of PA<sub>C</sub>, the termini were far away from the interaction site and thus were left uncapped. The N-terminus of PB1<sub>N</sub> was also left uncapped; however, the C-terminus of the short 15-residue PB1<sub>N</sub> was capped with an N-methyl group to remove the artificial negative charge. All mutations of the wild-type complex were made using the Pymol molecular modeling package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeLano, 2002</xref>). All MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS 4.6.7 suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hess et al., 2008</xref>). All simulations were performed using the AMBER99 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hornak et al., 2006</xref>) and TIP3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) water. Each initial complex structure (wild-type and mutant subunits) was first immersed in a cubic box containing pre-equilibrated water molecules. The dimensions of the water box were 102 Å ×109 Å × 79 Å. Counter-ions were added as necessary to neutralize the system. The solvated system was then energy-minimized using the steepest descent algorithm for a maximum of 5000 iterations with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup> applied to all non-hydrogen atoms. Next, a further energy minimization was performed without any constraints where the steepest descent method switched to conjugate gradient every 500 steps for a maximum of 2500 total steps. The system then underwent a two-stage equilibration process. The first stage of equilibration was a 100 ps <italic>NVT</italic> (isochoric–isothermal) simulation and consisted of a gentle annealing of the system from 0 to 300 K over the first 50 ps. Throughout the first stage of equilibration, a position restraint was applied to all non-hydrogen atoms with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup>. The temperature was maintained at 300 K using the V-rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) with a coupling time constant of 1.0 ps. The complex and solvent molecules were coupled to separate thermostats to avoid the ‘hot solvent-cold solute’ problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng and Merz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lingenheil et al., 2008</xref>). The second stage of equilibration was a 500 ps <italic>NPT</italic> (isobaric–isothermal) simulation where position restraints were applied to all non-hydrogen atoms of residues 257–348 and 354–371 of PA<sub>C</sub>, as these residues are far from the PA<sub>C</sub>–PB1<sub>N</sub> interaction site. The pressure was regulated using the Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>) with a reference pressure of 1 bar and a pressure coupling constant of 2.0 ps. The leapfrog algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hockney, 1970</xref>) with a time step of 2 fs was used for dynamics evolution. All bonds involving hydrogen were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hess et al., 1997</xref>). All neighbor searching, electrostatic interactions and van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.4 nm. Long-range Coulomb interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>) with a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm and a PME order of 4. A long-range dispersion correction for energy and pressure was applied to account for the 1.4 nm cut-off of Lennard-Jones interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen and Tildesley, 1987</xref>). All production runs followed the same scheme as the second equilibration stage and were run for 20 ns total.</p><p>Binding free energy calculations were performed on the last 10 ns of each production simulation. The last 10 ns of each simulation were stripped of water molecules and counter ions. From these, snapshots were extracted every 10 ps giving 1000 snapshots for the last 10 ns. The binding free energy was calculated as described by Liu and Yao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu and Yao, 2010</xref>). Here, the binding free energy was calculated as <italic>H</italic><sub>total, GB</sub> = <italic>E</italic><sub>gas</sub> + <italic>G</italic><sub>sol,GB</sub>, and thus did not contain any contribution from solute configuration entropy. Since our focus here is on the relative order of binding affinities and the complexes have similar binding poses, the solute configuration entropy is thus omitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rastelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hou et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). The GBSA implicit solvent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Still et al., 1990</xref>) was used with a dielectric constant of 80. The OBC(II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Onufriev et al., 2004</xref>) algorithm was used to calculate the Born radii with a frequency of 1 and a cutoff of 1.4 nm. A surface tension of 3.01248 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup> was set using the Ace-approximation. Averages and standard error of mean were calculated based on 200 snapshot increments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Brandon Ogbunugafor

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Host Proteostasis Modulates Influenza Evolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Phillips and colleagues present work demonstrating that unique cellular proteostasis environments dictate the mutational landscape of influenza A virus over serial passage in MDCK cells. The authors utilize a unique chemical/biology approach to either inhibit or activate nodes of the cellular heat shock protein family network (nuclear: HSF1 activation, cytoplasmic: Hsp90 inhibition). Influenza A/Wuhan/95 virus was chosen, and as the virus is shown to have comparable RNA dependent RNA RNA polymerase mutational kinetics to a more pathogenic H5N1 virus, studying proteostasis' role in shaping viral protein adaptation may provide insights on pathogenesis. The study reveals changes to the mutational trajectory and adaptation of influenza virus, which may be dependent on cellular proteostasis involvement</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is shown that viral infection itself does not activate the HSR. It is also shown that STA treatment does not activate the HSR. However, the authors need to demonstrate that viral infection + STA does not activate the HSR. It is possible that STA treatment sensitizes the cytosolic environment to viral infection, which would lead to increased HSR activation that could complicate the analysis.</p><p>2) A major question regarding this manuscript is 'Does HSF1 activation influence viral trajectories’? However, this is not clear despite statements to that effect in the discussion. It isn't clear that the HSF1 activated environment shows significant differences in the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The stats for the HSP90 inhibited environment are shown, but no stats for the HSF1 activated environment are shown. Similarly, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> do not show the basal environment. This makes it difficult to determine whether effects are coming from increased HSF1 activity or reduced Hsp90 activity. Even if the data are not significant between HSF1 and basal, it is still important to include the stats to help determine where these effects are coming from.</p><p>3) The method for determining viral titer is problematic. The authors use a hemagglutination assay, which measures viral particles but not infectious particles. In the event that the acquired mutations changed the ratios of infectious to un-infectious particles, the passaging would have been performed at different multiplicities of infection. This would obviously complicate the interpretation of the results. I would suggest that the authors determine plaque forming units as well as hemagglutinating units across their passages to ensure there was no change.</p><p>4) The authors are overexpressing a transcription factor (HSF1) that not only regulates the HSR pathway, but also regulates genes involved in DNA damage repair and metabolism. As such, there are expected transcriptomic changes beyond what is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The RNAseq results are extremely filtered – a global analysis needs to be shown, as other changes to the cell upon HSF1 activation may influence the response to influenza and its subsequent mutational adaptation. The same logic can be applied to the authors' Hsp90 inhibition setting, as pre-infection inhibition of a well-known nuclear chaperone likely has manifest consequences on access of transcription or nuclear factors. This setting should not be thought of as &quot;cytoplasmic,&quot; but in fact, may have intimate connections to the authors' HSF1 setting. To clarify their system, the authors should display global transcriptomics for both chemical treatment mock (no virus) and chemical treatment infected (+ virus) settings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28652.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is shown that viral infection itself does not activate the HSR.

Hsp90 inhibition significantly enhances fitness of the H452Q PA variant relative to the basal environment. HSF1 activation significantly reduces the fitness of the H452Q variant relative to the basal environment. Variant fitness in the HSF1-activated and Hsp90-inhibited environments is also significantly different.

We used this data to calculate the multiplicity of infection (MOI) throughout serial passaging, which is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The exact infectious MOI does fluctuate slightly during serial passaging (0.001–0.04 virions/cell), as expected. However, as noted by the Reviewers, the key points are that (1) the MOI does not vary systematically between proteostasis environments and (2) the MOI is always &lt; 0.1 virions/cell to minimize co-infection, as was intended in our experimental design. Thus, our interpretation of the results remains unchanged.</p><p>Hemagglutination titers for each passage are also still shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors are overexpressing a transcription factor (HSF1) that not only regulates the HSR pathway, but also regulates genes involved in DNA damage repair and metabolism.
