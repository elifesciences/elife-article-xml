established binary model for information storage (slot model). However, recent observations based on the continuous reproduction paradigms have shown that assuming dynamic allocation of WM resources (resource model) instead of the binary hypothesis will give more accurate predictions in WM assessment. Moreover, continuous reproduction paradigms allow for assessing the distribution of error in recalling information, providing new insights into the organization of the WM system. Hence, by utilizing two continuous reproduction paradigms, memory-guided localization (MGL) and analog recall task with sequential presentation, we investigated WM dysfunction in MS. Our results demonstrated an overall increase in recall error and decreased recall precision in MS. While sequential paradigms were better in distinguishing healthy control from relapsing-remitting MS, MGL were more accurate in discriminating MS subtypes (relapsing-remitting from secondary progressive), providing evidence about the underlying mechanisms of WM deficit in progressive states of the disease. Furthermore, computational modeling of the results from the sequential paradigm determined that imprecision in decoding information and swap error (mistakenly reporting the feature of other presented items) was responsible for WM dysfunction in MS. Overall, this study offered a sensitive measure for assessing WM deficit and provided new insight into the organization of the WM system in MS population.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Working memory is a system that temporarily stores and manipulates information used in tasks like decision-making and reasoning. Patients with multiple sclerosis – a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord – often have impaired working memory, which can negatively affect their quality of life.</p><p>Traditionally, working memory has been evaluated using tests that determine whether a patient can recall an item or not. In this approach, an incorrect response implies a complete absence of information regarding the specific item, resulting in a binary evaluation. More recently, researchers have shown that the precision of the memories people recall degrades gradually as they are asked to remember more things and that focusing on an item negatively affects recall precision for other items. This implies that working memory is reorganised flexibly between memorised items, a so-called ‘resource model’.</p><p>Unlike previous research, which favoured a binary model, Motahharynia et al. used a resource model to study visual working memory impairment in multiple sclerosis. The study participants consisted of healthy volunteers and patients with two subtypes of multiple sclerosis. Each participant completed one of two different types of test. In one, they were shown targets for short periods of time and then asked to pinpoint their position after they disappeared. In the other, participants were asked to memorise the orientation and colour of consecutively presented bars.</p><p>The findings confirmed that multiple sclerosis patients had worse memory recall than people without the disease. However, computer modelling provided insights into the sources of error in working memory dysfunction, showing that the memory deficiency was due to imprecision in recalling information and ‘swap errors’, the phenomenon of mistakenly reporting the property of other memorised items. This rise in swap errors is likely due to an increase in unwanted signals, or noise, in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients.</p><p>Motahharynia et al. have presented a sensitive way of measuring working memory deficiency. Importantly, the measurements were able to distinguish between different stages of multiple sclerosis. This could help doctors detect disease progression earlier, allowing for more timely and effective treatment interventions. This method could also be useful in the development and testing of drugs for therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>binding</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>resource model</kwd><kwd>swap error</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003970</institution-id><institution>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup Grant to Center for Translational Neuroscience</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaygannejad</surname><given-names>Vahid</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashtari</surname><given-names>Fereshteh</given-names></name><name><surname>Adibi</surname><given-names>Iman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003970</institution-id><institution>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2400104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaygannejad</surname><given-names>Vahid</given-names></name><name><surname>Ashtari</surname><given-names>Fereshteh</given-names></name><name><surname>Adibi</surname><given-names>Iman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Imprecision in decoding information and swap error, that is, mistakenly reporting a non-target feature, contributes to working memory deficit in the multiple sclerosis population.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating inflammatory disorder characterized by demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) plaques creating a progressive neurodegenerative state with heterogeneous clinical characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedict et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobson and Giovannoni, 2019</xref>). Impairment in cognitive function is a common clinical manifestation of MS, which detrimentally affects different aspects of patients’ daily life, from decreased physical performance and productivity to unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedict et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clemens and Langdon, 2018</xref>). One of the frequently affected domains of cognition in MS is working memory (WM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vacchi et al., 2017</xref>), which, due to its essential role in several cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nee and D’Esposito, 2016</xref>), is one of the main areas of MS research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Covey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hulst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rocca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vacchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Multiple neuropsychological cognitive paradigms, such as paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), n-back, and delayed-match to sample, were developed to investigate different aspects of WM deficit in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parmenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pourmohammadi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rocca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stojanovic-Radic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vacchi et al., 2017</xref>). The basis of these change detection paradigms is the slot model of WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). In this quantized model, WM is considered a short-term storage for a limited number of items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cowan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller, 1956</xref>), storing the information in a binary format. This assumption creates an all-or-none condition in which only the stored items in these limited slots will be remembered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, recent observations from analog recall paradigms assessing the precision of WM determined dynamic allocation of WM resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bays and Husain, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorgoraptis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schneegans and Bays, 2016</xref>). Each stored item in this framework possesses a fraction of WM storage in which the allocated space changes dynamically between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bays and Husain, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schneegans and Bays, 2016</xref>). This concept is the foundation for the resource-based model of WM.</p><p>The analog nature of inputs in resource-based model paradigms makes it possible to investigate the resolution and variability of stored memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zokaei et al., 2015</xref>). Also, assessing the distribution of error in these paradigms further helped in uncovering the underlying structure of the visual WM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lugtmeijer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McMaster et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zokaei et al., 2020</xref>). An analog recall task is a paradigm in which subjects need to simultaneously recall multiple features of items in a continuous space, hence requiring encoding the information of connected features in addition to their distinct value (e.g., object, location, and object-location binding information) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McMaster et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zokaei et al., 2020</xref>). According to the study of Bays et al., there are three different sources of error for recalling information in visual WM tasks with connected features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2009</xref>). They are identified as (i) the Gaussian variability in response around the target value (target response proportion), (ii) Gaussian variability in response around the non-target value, that is, mistakenly reporting feature of other presented items (swap error), and (iii) random responses (uniform response proportion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zokaei et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Studies based on analog recall paradigms unraveled new insights into the sources of recall error in neurodegenerative disorders. It was determined that random response and swap error contribute to the impairment of visual WM in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zokaei et al., 2020</xref>). However, regardless of the influential impact of these study designs on the discovery of novel mechanistic insights into the organization of visual WM system, it has not gotten enough attention in the field of MS research.</p><p>This study followed our previous study in which the quantity of MS-related visual WM was assessed based on the slot model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pourmohammadi et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we aimed to evaluate recall precision (quality) based on the resource-based model paradigms. In this regard, we developed two analog recall paradigms, a memory-guided localization (MGL) and two analog recall tasks with sequential bar presentation (3 bar and 1 bar). Primarily using the simplistic design of MGL, recall error (absolute error) and precision of visual WM were assessed. Similarly, recall error and precision were evaluated using the two designed analog recall paradigms with sequential presentation, that is, the low memory load, 1 bar, and high memory load, 3 bar conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the classifying performance of these paradigms in distinguishing different groups was assessed. Finally, the distribution of recall error in analog paradigms with sequential presentation was further investigated using the probabilistic model of Bays, Catalao, and Husain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2009</xref>). In both MGL and sequential paradigms (low and high memory load conditions), recall error and precision were impaired in MS. The dissociable function of these paradigms in classifying MS subtypes (relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive) gave some clues about the underlying structure of WM deficit in progressive states of the disease. Investigation into sources of error in the high memory load condition revealed that target response proportion and swap error (non-target response proportion) contribute to visual WM dysfunction in MS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the MGL paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), 45patients (19 relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS] and 26 secondary progressive MS [SPMS]) and 24 healthy controls participated. As mentioned in the ‘Materials and methods’ section, the mean data of five participants (one healthy control, three RRMS, and one SPMS) were excluded from further analysis. In the sequential paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and C), from a total of 76patients (42 RRMS and 34 SPMS) and 49 healthy controls who participated, three healthy controls, three RRMS, and two SPMS were excluded.

A closer look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D and G</xref> suggested that these paradigms differentiate MS and healthy control with distinct patterns. Hence, we separately applied ROC analysis to healthy control vs. RRMS, healthy control vs. SPMS, and RRMS vs. SPMS for MGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and sequential paradigms with 3 bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and 1 bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Complementary to the above findings, the 1 bar paradigm showed an in-between pattern of results. The 1 bar paradigm accurately discriminates healthy control from SPMS (94.4%), while it also performed well in differentiating healthy control from RRMS (79.6%).

Our results align with the previous reports regarding WM deficit in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parmenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pourmohammadi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stojanovic-Radic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vacchi et al., 2017</xref>). Complementary to these reports, which envisaged a binary model for storing information (slot-based model), we assessed recall precision in WM using analog reproduction paradigms (resource-based model). Further, by utilizing the unique design of our sequential paradigm, which allows us to assess the distribution of error in recalling information, we introduced a new mechanistic insight into the visual WM dysfunction in MS.</p><p>Although the results from both MGL and sequential paradigms showed an overall decrease in recall precision and increased recall error in MS population, the post hoc analysis demonstrated inconsistent results. In the MGL paradigm, while SPMS patients performed worse than other groups, no significant difference was observed between healthy control and RRMS. This result contrasted with the sequential paradigm with 3 bar (high memory load condition), in which MS subtypes (RRMS vs. SPMS) were not significantly different, and healthy control performed better than RRMS and SPMS. The situation also varied for the 1 bar paradigm (low memory load condition), in which all three groups performed with different levels of precision. ROC analysis further confirmed these results, which determined a dissociation between the classifying performance of MGL and sequential paradigms. Additionally, although the low memory load condition was better than the high memory load condition in distinguishing MS subtypes, its classifying performance was not as good as the MGL paradigm. It seems that these paradigms evaluated distinct aspects of WM dysfunction in MS.</p><p>The dissociable function of our paradigms could arise from using different types of stimuli (location in MGL vs. orientation in sequential paradigms), in which spatial WM was assessed in the MGL paradigm. As the spatial WM process was associated with the function of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rolls, 2018</xref>), the observed difference could indicate more hippocampal disruption in SPMS patients. This finding is in line with previous studies that showed more hippocampal regional loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sicotte et al., 2008</xref>) and increased hippocampus neuroinflammatory activity in SPMS compared to RRMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cree et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that assessment of the spatial WM could be a specific marker for disorganization of the WM system in SPMS.</p><p>Another explanation is the long delay interval in MGL, which assessed the maintenance of information. Therefore, the observed difference could be due to additional impairment of SPMS patients in keeping that information. This finding is in line with our previous study, which showed that change detection paradigms with long delay intervals were promising in differentiating MS subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pourmohammadi et al., 2023</xref>). At the same time, one may debate that this difference was related to the longer stimulus presentation time in the MGL paradigm (1000 ms vs. 500 ms in the sequential paradigm). However, since the stimulus presentation time was adequate in sequential paradigms and the stimuli were presented consecutively, it did not seem that the inadequate time for encoding information was responsible for this difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zokaei et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, one may argue that the observed dissociation could be due to the extra binding process needed in the sequential paradigm with 3 bar. However, the results from the low memory load condition and our findings from the sequential paradigm nearest-neighbor analysis, which provided a proxy to assess the isolated effect of orientation, demonstrated a similar pattern of dissociation in the absence of a binding effect. Based on these findings, we concluded that the binding process was not responsible for the observed dissociation. Nevertheless, since the evaluated binding process was an intra-term association (i.e., conjunctive binding), we could not be assured that the same results would be reached for an inter-term association (i.e., relational binding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parra et al., 2015</xref>). This issue becomes more interesting when we realize that the relational binding function is mainly centered on the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parra et al., 2015</xref>), the structure we presumed was responsible for the observed dissociation in the MGL paradigm.</p><p>Finally, due to the diffuse pattern of involved brain areas in MS and evidence demonstrating that brain networks accounted for different WM processes, it is reasonable to assume that distinct WM-related networks, instead of a single region, were responsible for the observed dissociable patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobson and Giovannoni, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figueroa-Vargas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lugtmeijer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vacchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We applied a probabilistic model to disentangle the error distribution in recalling information in the sequential paradigms to further investigate the underlying mechanism behind the visual WM dysfunction in MS. Our finding revealed that in addition to imprecision in decoding information, swap error (mistakenly reporting a non-target feature) contributed to WM dysfunction in individuals with MS. Swap error has been associated with various mechanisms, including the variability in cue feature dimension, cue-independent sources, and strategic guessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McMaster et al., 2022</xref>). The recent study by McMaster et al. comprehensively investigated these hypotheses and determined that the variability in cue feature dimension could solely account for the swap error mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McMaster et al., 2022</xref>). The neural correlates of swap error could be explained by the imprecision in decoding information in the cue feature dimension (i.e., color in this study) due to the noise in neural activity. Hence, a non-cued item may mistakenly be considered as the actual cue, leading to the reporting of the corresponding non-target feature as a response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneegans and Bays, 2017</xref>). Therefore, the swap error observed in this study can be attributed to the variability in the color dimension. The neural underpinning of this observation in MS population could be related to their impaired neural activity. Recent studies have demonstrated disturbed neural activity during WM tasks in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figueroa-Vargas et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, Costers et al. showed a disturbed theta band oscillation, which plays a crucial role in WM encoding information, in the hippocampal area of MS population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costers et al., 2021</xref>). While this evidence provides a primary insight into the possible underlying mechanisms of WM dysfunction in MS, future electrophysiological studies using the cued recall paradigms could further elucidate this matter.</p><p>Swap errors (misbinding errors) have been observed in various neurological disorders, including different types of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cecchini et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Della Sala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zokaei et al., 2020</xref>), epileptic patients with temporal lobe lobectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zokaei et al., 2019</xref>), and voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody (VGKC-Ab) limbic encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pertzov et al., 2013</xref>). From a neuroanatomical perspective, previous studies proposed that impairment in hippocampus and medial temporal lobe regions contributes to problems in relational binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Della Sala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pertzov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zokaei et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, whereas regions related to conjunctive binding have yet to be better understood, occipital and parietal regions seem to be mainly related to conjunctive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cecchini et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, a recent study by Valdés Hernández and colleagues also demonstrated the possible role of globus pallidus in conjunctive binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valdés Hernández et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, a study by Vacchi et al. demonstrated less activation of the superior and inferior parietal lobule during an N-back fMRI task in individuals with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vacchi et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, globus pallidus was shown to be involved in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, considering the convergence of brain regions involved in conjunctive processing (assessed through the current sequential paradigm) with those shown to be affected in MS, the parietal regions and globus pallidus could be the candidate regions responsible for the observed impairment. Additionally, based on the evidence showing the involvement of hippocampal regions in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rocca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sicotte et al., 2008</xref>), we also expect to see relational processing impairment; however, this study’s design did not allow us to evaluate this condition. Further neuroimaging studies are needed to validate these findings. Eventually, the insignificant results from the low memory load condition suggested more impairment in visual WM under high memory load situations, which was not unexpected.</p><p>Despite these findings, our study had some limitations that should be addressed in future research. This study only assessed WM dysfunction using behavioral paradigms. Further structural and functional evaluations should be performed to confirm our suggested brain areas associated with conjunctive binding and spatial WM deficit in MS. Concurrent assessment of brain networks using fMRI and EEG or volumetric studies alongside behavioral paradigms could address this issue. Furthermore, although we hypothesized that relational binding could be a specific marker for the progressive state of the disease based on the more disruption of hippocampal-related areas in SPMS, this study’s design did not allow us to evaluate this assumption. Future studies assessing the source of WM deficit regarding relational binding could elucidate this statement. Additionally, although clinical and cognitive assessments were performed to mitigate the possible confounding effects of cognitive, visual, and motor impairments on the outcomes of the study, it cannot be concluded that no confounding effects occurred. In future studies, including a control condition matched to the experimental paradigm where only the memory components are removed could better clarify this issue. Finally, considering the aim of this study, which was to develop a practical apparatus for WM assessment in clinical settings, we did not use an eye tracker. Although we attempted to minimize the effect of eye movement in both paradigms by instructing the participants to fixate on a central fixation point, using an eye tracker is necessary to validate these findings further.</p><p>In summary, using the resource-based model paradigms, we demonstrated that recall error and precision were impaired in MS. We provided new insight regarding the progressive state of the disease by assessing the plausible mechanisms related to the dissociable behavior of MGL and sequential paradigms in classifying MS subtypes. Furthermore, applying a computational model capable of disentangling error distribution in recalling information allowed us to uncover new insight regarding WM deficit in the MS population. Our results determined that decreased signal-to-noise ratio and swap error were responsible for WM deficit in MS. Overall, this study provided a sensitive measure for assessing WM impairment and gave new insight into the organization of WM dysfunction in MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 121 patients with confirmed MS (61 RRMS and 60 SPMS) and 73 healthy control volunteers participated in this study.

Using the Mixture Model, the probabilities of target, non-target, and uniform responses and the von Mises distribution concentration score were calculated for each subject. The sources of error were evaluated by comparing the probability of target, non-target, and uniform responses between groups among different bar orders (mixed model ANOVA). Also, von Mises SD, defined as the circular standard deviation of the concentration score of von Mises distribution, was assessed using the same method. Moreover, nearest-neighbor analysis was performed to further evaluate the isolated effect of orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pertzov et al., 2013</xref>). In this set of analyses, we removed the effect of swap error by defining recall error as the difference between the subject response and the nearest presented bar in each trial. The isolated effect of orientation was assessed between groups among different bar orders (mixed model ANOVA). Finally, due to the 1 bar design of the low memory load condition, swap error was not present; hence, only the target proportion, uniform proportion, and von Mises SD were compared (one-way ANOVA).</p><p>For each comparison, hierarchical regression analyses were performed to evaluate the possible confounding effect of demographic and clinical variables (significantly different between groups) on results.

Recall error was used for classification purposes, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as a measure of the paradigms’ accuracy in group classification.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Written informed consent and consent for publication have been obtained from all participants before the start of the study.

We appreciate the time and effort they have put into this manuscript to provide feedback for improving our work. Based on their comments, we carefully considered their suggestions and revised the manuscript to address their concerns. Our one-by-one response to reviewers comments is as follows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study compares visuospatial working memory performance between patients with MS and healthy controls, assessed using analog report tasks that provide continuous measures of recall error. The aim is to advance on previous studies of VWM in MS that have used binary (correct/incorrect) measures of recall, such as from change detection tasks, that are not sensitive to the resolution with which features can be recalled, and to use mixture modelling to potentially disentangle different contributions to overall performance. This aim is met in part, but there are some problems with the authors' interpretation of their findings:</p><p>1. How can the authors be confident the performance deficits in the patient groups are impairments of working memory and not visual or motor in nature? I appreciate there was some kind of clinical screening, but it seems like there should have been a control condition matched to the experimental tasks with only the memory components removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the potential confounding effects of visual or motor impairment on the outcomes of our study.</p><p>While we acknowledge that a control condition with only the memory components removed could have further strengthened our results, we did not include one, which is a limitation of the current study.</p><p>To address this limitation, we conducted clinical screening to ensure that the observed deficit was due to working memory impairment and not visual or motor in nature. As part of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) evaluation, we did not include individuals with issues such as visual acuity, visual field, and extraocular movement impairment, scotoma, nystagmus, and tremors in the upper extremity, which could interfere with the study. Moreover, participants were screened using the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) before entering the study. These evaluations helped us to ensure that participants with impaired visual or motor performance, which could potentially confound the study, were not included. Our effort to remove the confounding factors with clinical screening provided additional insight into the interpretability of the results. We have updated our inclusion/exclusion criteria accordingly and included this limitation in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The participant groups are large, which is definitely a strength, but not particularly well-matched in terms of demographics, with notable differences in age (mean and spread), years of education and gender. These could potentially contribute to differences in performance between groups and tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment and agree that a matched control group would be ideal. However, we addressed this issue using hierarchical regression analysis.</p><p>Our study assessed visual working memory (VWM) resolution using two analog recall paradigms: the sequential paradigm with bar stimuli and memory-guided localization (MGL). While the demographic data of gender, age, and education in the MGL paradigm were matched between patients and control group, there was a significant difference in these factors between groups in the sequential paradigm.</p><p>To address this issue, we performed hierarchical regression analysis to compare recall parameters in the sequential paradigm with 3-bar and 1-bar stimuli, respectively. We assessed for the confounding effect of gender, age, and education, and the results were presented in supplementary tables 3 and 5.</p><p>In the sequential paradigm with 3-bar stimuli (high memory load condition), we found that all recall parameters were significantly different between groups. However, after adjusting for age and education, the result became insignificant for uniform response proportion. In the 1-bar paradigm (low memory load condition), while the results were significantly different between groups, after adjusting for gender, age, and education, target and uniform response proportions became insignificant (uniform proportion = 1 – target proportion, since there was no swap error in the 1-bar condition).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors interpret the mixture model parameter described as &quot;misbinding error&quot; as reflecting failures of feature binding, and propose a link to hippocampus on that basis, however there is now quite strong evidence that these errors (often called swaps) are explained mostly or entirely by imprecision in memory for the cue feature (bar color in this case), e.g. McMaster et al. (2022), already cited in the ms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment regarding interpreting the mixture model parameter, described as a “misbinding error” in our study.</p><p>Swap error has been attributed to different mechanisms, including the variability in cue feature dimension, cue-independent sources, and strategic guessing. As the reviewer mentioned, in a recent study by McMaster et al., a comprehensive evaluation of these hypotheses was performed and determined that the variability in cue feature dimension could solely explain the occurrence of swap error.</p><p>In response to this comment, we have added a discussion of this matter, the neural correlates of swap error, and the possible explanation for this phenomenon in multiple sclerosis (MS) population to the seventh paragraph of the discussion. Additionally, since our study did not include neuroimaging assessment, we have discussed the results from neuroanatomical points of view to further explain the possible structures involved in the occurrence of swap errors in MS. The seventh and eighth paragraphs of the discussion have been revised for further clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The methodology of the ROC analyses should be described in more detail: it is not clear what measures are being used to classify participants or how.</p></disp-quote><p>This matter is clarified in the results and the last paragraph of materials and methods. In both paradigms, recall error was used for classification purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There are a number of unusual choices of terminology that could potentially confuse or mislead the reader: The tasks are not &quot;n-Back&quot; tasks by the usual meaning: they are analog report tasks with sequential presentation. The terms recall &quot;error&quot;, &quot;variability&quot;, &quot;precision&quot; and &quot;fidelity&quot; are used idiosyncratically. Variability and precision usually refer to the same thing: they describe the dispersion or spread of errors. The measure described as recall error in the sequential tasks is presumably absolute (or unsigned) error. For the mixture model parameters I suggest describing them more explicitly in terms of the mixture attributes, e.g. &quot;Von Mises SD&quot;, &quot;Target proportion&quot;, &quot;Non-target proportion&quot; &quot;Uniform proportion&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have made revisions to clarify the terminology used in our study.</p><p>The term &quot;n-back&quot; is changed to an analog recall paradigm with sequential presentation. Additionally, as mentioned in the materials and methods, the recall error in the MGL paradigm is the Euclidian distance between the target's location and subject response in visual degree. In the sequential paradigms, this value is the angular difference between the response and target value, in which both are absolute errors. To avoid confusion, we have added the term &quot;absolute error&quot; alongside the term &quot;recall error&quot; to provide a clear understanding of this measurement. Moreover, as the reviewer suggested, we changed &quot;recall variability&quot; to &quot;von Mises SD&quot; for a more precise description. We also changed the remaining terms to &quot;target proportion&quot;, &quot;swap error (non-target proportion)&quot;, and &quot;uniform proportion&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors applied two visual working memory tasks, a memory-guided localization (MGL), examining short-term memory of the location of an item over a brief interval, and an N-back task, examining orientation of a centrally presented item, in order to test working memory performance in patients with multiple sclerosis (including a subgroup with relapsing-remitting and one with secondary progressive MS), compared with healthy control subjects.

It has the potential to lead to more sensitive and specific tests which could potentially be used as useful outcome measures in clinical trials of disease modifying drugs, for example.</p><p>However, there are some significant limitations which severely affect the scientific validity and interpretability of the study:</p><p>1. There is a striking lack of key clinical information:</p><p>(1.1) The inclusion and exclusion criteria are unclear and a recruitment flowchart has not been provided. Therefore it is unclear what proportion of MS patients were ineligible due to, for example, visual impairment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this matter. To address this issue, we revised the first section of materials and methods to include detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria information. However, it is important to note that we recruited the patients in a full-census manner, where only the patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria participated. Unfortunately, we did not record the number of patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.2) Basic clinical data such as EDSS scores, disease duration, treatment history, and performance on standard cognitive testing were not provided. Basic clinical and demographic data for each subgroup were not provided in a clear format. This severely limits the interpretability of the study and its significance for this clinical population. For example, might it be that the SPMS patients performed worse on the MGL task because they were more cognitively impaired than RRMS patients? That question might be easily answered, but the answer is unclear based on the data provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this important concern. To further clarify the basic clinical and demographic data, we have revised tables 1 and 2 to include detailed information regarding gender, age, education, cognitive ability, disease duration, EDSS score, and disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for each group, respectively. The information is reported as mean ± standard deviation except for the categorical data.</p><p>Regarding the participants' cognitive ability, we added the Montreal cognitive assessment test results for both paradigms. MoCA is a standard cognitive screening tool that has a score of 0 to 30. The different ranges of MoCA scores related to the different levels of cognitive function, in which a score ≥ 26 is considered normal cognitive ability, 18-25 denotes mild cognitive impairment, 10-17 determines moderate cognitive impairment, and a score ≤ 10 is considered severe impairment.</p><p>First, we classify the participants based on their MoCA value and compare groups with each other. While the primary results showed that patient groups were more impaired compared to healthy controls, our results remained significant after adjusting for MoCA using hierarchical regression analysis. This suggests that the observed difference was not solely due to more cognitive impairment in the patients' population.</p><p>Moreover, the information regarding the treatment history of patients is added in the following format. DMT is classified into two groups, i.e., platform and non-platform treatments. In our study, the platform treatments include interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate, and non-platform treatments include rituximab, ocrelizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, and natalizumab. In both paradigms, the patients did not significantly differ based on the received therapy.The MoCA assessment and treatment history information is added to tables 1 and 2 and supplementary tables 1, 3, and 5. Moreover, the second paragraph of materials and methods, second paragraph of statistical analysis in materials and methods, and the appropriate sections of the results are revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The study is completely agnostic to the underlying pathophysiology. There is no neuroimaging available, therefore it is unclear how the specific working memory impairments observed might relate to lesioned underlying brain networks which are crucial for specific aspects of working memory. This severely limits the scientific impact of the results. This limitation is acknowledged by the authors, but the authors did not put forward any hypotheses on how their results may be underpinned by the underlying disease processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. To further strengthen the connection between our findings and the possible underlying mechanisms of WM dysfunction in MS, we have added a discussion from the neuroanatomical perspective in the eighth paragraph of the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The present study does not compare the continuous-report testing with a discrete measure task so it is unclear if the former is more sensitive, or more feasible in this patient group, although this may not have been the purpose of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer pointed out an interesting matter. However, this was not the focus of the current study. Nonetheless, it is a valuable suggestion for future work to compare continuous vs. discrete measure paradigms to determine their sensitivity and feasibility in the MS population.</p></body></sub-article></article>
