contains thousands of different proteins that are encoded by the nuclear genome. These proteins are imported into the chloroplast via the action of the TOC translocase and associated downstream systems. Our recent work has revealed that the stability of the TOC complex is dynamically regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent chloroplast-associated protein degradation pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the TOC complex is also regulated by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants representing almost the entire SUMO conjugation pathway can partially suppress the phenotype of <italic>ppi1</italic>, a pale-yellow mutant lacking the Toc33 protein. This suppression is linked to increased abundance of TOC proteins and improvements in chloroplast development. Moreover, data from molecular and biochemical experiments support a model in which the SUMO system directly regulates TOC protein stability. Thus, we have identified a regulatory link between the SUMO system and the chloroplast protein import machinery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All green plants grow by converting light energy into chemical energy. They do this using a process called photosynthesis, which happens inside compartments in plant cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts use thousands of different proteins to make chemical energy. Some of these proteins allow the chloroplasts to absorb light energy using chlorophyll, the pigment that makes leaves green. The vast majority of these proteins are transported into the chloroplasts through a protein machine called the TOC complex. When plants lack parts of the TOC complex, their chloroplasts develop abnormally, and their leaves turn yellow.</p><p>Photosynthesis can make toxic by-products, so cells need a way to turn it off when they are under stress; for example, by lowering the number of TOC complexes on the chloroplasts. This is achieved by tagging TOC complexes with a molecule called ubiquitin, which will lead to their removal from chloroplasts, slowing photosynthesis down. It is unknown whether another, similar, molecular tag called SUMO aids in this destruction process.</p><p>To find out, Watson et al. examined a mutant of the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This mutant had low levels of the TOC complex, turning its leaves pale yellow. A combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical experiments showed that SUMO molecular tags control the levels of TOC complex on chloroplasts. Increasing the amount of SUMO in the mutant plants made their leaves turn yellower, while interfering with the genes responsible for depositing SUMO tags turned the leaves green. This implies that in plants with less SUMO tags, cells stopped destroying their TOC complexes, allowing the chloroplasts to develop better, and changing the colour of the leaves. The SUMO tagging of TOC complexes shares a lot of genetic similarities with the ubiquitin tag system.</p><p>It is possible that SUMO tags may help to control the CHLORAD pathway, which destroys TOC complexes marked with ubiquitin. Understanding this relationship, and how to influence it, could help to improve the performance of crops. The next step is to understand exactly how SUMO tags promote the destruction of the TOC complex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>SUMO</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd>TOC proteins</kwd><kwd>chloroplast protein import</kwd><kwd>chloroplast biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K018442/1 BB/N006372/1 BB/R016984/1 BB/R009333/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>R Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Interdisciplinary Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The small ubiquitin-like modifier system directly regulates components of the chloroplast protein import apparatus, that is, TOC proteins, to control chloroplast biogenesis and plant development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The chloroplast is a membrane-bound organelle that houses photosynthesis in all green plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jarvis and Lopez-Juez, 2013</xref>). Chloroplasts have an unusual evolutionary history – they are the integrated descendants of a cyanobacterial ancestor that entered the eukaryotic lineage via endosymbiosis. Although chloroplasts retain small genomes, almost all of the proteins required for chloroplast development and function are now encoded by the central, nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarvis, 2008</xref>). These proteins must be imported into the organelle after synthesis in the cytosol, and this import is mediated by the coordinate action of the TOC and TIC complexes (the translocons at the outer and inner envelope membranes of chloroplasts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarvis, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The TOC complex contains three major components: the Omp85 (outer membrane protein, 85 kDa)-related protein, Toc75, which serves as a membrane channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tranel et al., 1995</xref>), and two GTPase-domain receptor proteins, Toc33 and Toc159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirsch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perry and Keegstra, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarvis, 2008</xref>). Toc33 and Toc159 project into the cytosol and bind incoming preproteins.</p><p>The key components of the TOC complex were identified more than two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirsch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tranel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarvis, 2008</xref>). However, the regulation of the activity and stability of the complex was, until recently, poorly understood. Major insights came from a forward genetic screen for suppressors of the pale-yellow Toc33 mutant, <italic>ppi1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2012</xref>). In this screen, SP1 (SUPPRESSOR OF PPI1 LOCUS 1), a novel RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, was identified. A series of <italic>sp1</italic> mutations were shown to partially suppress the phenotypic defects of <italic>ppi1</italic> with respect to chlorosis, chloroplast development, and chloroplast protein import. In addition, SP1 function was shown to promote plastid interconversion events (e.g., the development of the chloroplast from its precursor organelle, the etioplast). Later work demonstrated that SP1 function is also important for abiotic stress tolerance by enabling optimization of the organellar proteome via protein import regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ling and Jarvis, 2015</xref>). Thus, through SP1, the ubiquitin-proteasome system promotes TOC complex degradation and reconfiguration in response to developmental and/or environmental stimuli.</p><p>Ubiquitinated TOC proteins are extracted from the chloroplast outer envelope membrane and degraded in the cytosol. Recent work identified two proteins that physically associate with SP1 and promote the membrane extraction of TOC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2019</xref>). These are SP2, an Omp85-type β-barrel channel protein that was identified in the same genetic screen as SP1, and Cdc48, a well-characterized cytosolic AAA+ chaperone ATPase that provides the motive force for the extraction of proteins from the chloroplast outer envelope. The three proteins – SP1, SP2, and Cdc48 – together define a new pathway for the ubiquitination, membrane extraction, and degradation of chloroplast outer envelope proteins, which has been named chloroplast-associated protein degradation (CHLORAD). In addition to CHLORAD, there exist cytosolic ubiquitin-dependent systems that also contribute to chloroplast biogenesis by regulating the levels of unimported preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grimmer et al., 2020</xref>) and by controlling the stability of the Toc159 receptor prior to its integration into the outer envelope membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of SP1 and the CHLORAD pathway demonstrated that the TOC complex is not static but, instead, can be rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. To complement this work, we decided to explore whether the TOC complex is also regulated by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system. This work was motivated in part by the results of a high-throughput screen for SUMO substrates in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elrouby and Coupland, 2010</xref>). This screen suggested that Toc159, a key component of the TOC complex, is a SUMO substrate. SUMOylation is intricately involved in plant development and stress adaptation, and so we were interested to determine whether the TOC complex is targeted by the SUMO system, and whether any such SUMOylation is functionally important. As crosstalk between the SUMO system and the ubiquitin-proteasome system is common, we reasoned that answering these questions might provide insights into the regulation of SP1 and the CHLORAD pathway.</p><p>To explore the relationship between the chloroplast protein import and SUMO systems, we carried out a comprehensive series of genetic, molecular, and biochemical experiments. Mutants representing most components of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUMO pathway were found to partially suppress the phenotype of the chlorotic Toc33 null mutant, <italic>ppi1</italic>, with respect to leaf chlorophyll accumulation, chloroplast development, and TOC protein abundance. Conversely, overexpression of either <italic>SUMO1</italic> or <italic>SUMO3</italic> enhanced the severity of the <italic>ppi1</italic> phenotype. Moreover, the E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme, SCE1, was found to physically interact with the TOC complex in bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments; and TOC proteins were seen to physically associate with SUMO proteins in immunoprecipitation (IP) assays. In combination, our data conclusively demonstrate significant crosstalk between the SUMO system and the chloroplast protein import apparatus, and emphasize the complexity of the regulation of the TOC translocase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme mutant <italic>sce1-4</italic> and the E3 SUMO ligase mutants <italic>siz1-4</italic> and <italic>siz1-5</italic> partially suppress the phenotype of the Toc33 mutant <italic>ppi1</italic></title><p>Two key components of the CHLORAD pathway, SP1 and SP2, were identified in a forward genetic screen for suppressors of <italic>ppi1,</italic> an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Toc33 null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2019</xref>). Both <italic>sp1</italic> and <italic>sp2</italic> mutants can partially suppress the <italic>ppi1</italic> phenotype with respect to chlorophyll accumulation, chloroplast development, and TOC protein abundance. To investigate whether the TOC complex is targeted by the SUMO system, we obtained several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUMO system mutants, crossed them with <italic>ppi1</italic>, and carefully examined the phenotypes of the resulting double mutants. This reverse genetic approach was possible because the basic architecture of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUMO system is remarkably simple. In the SUMO pathway, the ubiquitin-like SUMO modifier protein is conjugated to substrates by the coordinated action of E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes, and E3 SUMO ligases. Although thousands of proteins are SUMOylated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there is just one known E1 SUMO activating enzyme, one known E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme, and only two known E3 SUMO ligases of canonical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saracco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishida et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>First, we analyzed <italic>sce1-4</italic>, a weak mutant allele of the sole E2 SUMO conjugating enzyme gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which is an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saracco et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>sce1-4</italic> mutant shows a moderate reduction in the expression of SCE1 and in global levels of SUMOylation, but it displays no obvious visible phenotypic defects under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saracco et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic> double mutant was phenotypically characterized, and, intriguingly, it appeared greener than the <italic>ppi1</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This was linked to a moderate increase in leaf chlorophyll concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we asked whether the phenotypic suppression observed in <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic> was linked to changes in the development of chloroplasts. The chloroplasts of <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic> were visualized via transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the chloroplasts of the <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic> double mutant appeared larger and better developed than those of the <italic>ppi1</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The transmission electron micrographs were quantitatively analyzed, and the <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic> chloroplasts were indeed found to be significantly larger than those of <italic>ppi1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with larger, more interconnected thylakoidal granal stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The E2 small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugating enzyme mutation <italic>sce1-4</italic> and the E3 SUMO ligase mutations <italic>siz1-4</italic> and <italic>siz1-5</italic> suppress the phenotype of the plastid protein import mutant <italic>ppi1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic> double mutant appeared greener than <italic>ppi1</italic> after approximately 5 weeks of growth on soil.

NEM is a potent inhibitor of SUMO-specific proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilgarth and Sarge, 2005</xref>). Importantly, we detected protein SUMOylation in the isolated chloroplast samples, and this SUMOylation was increased by NEM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we carried out a series of biochemical experiments to investigate whether TOC proteins may be SUMOylated. In the first of these, the <italic>SCE1</italic> coding sequence was cloned into a vector that appends a C-terminal YFP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karimi et al., 2002</xref>). We confirmed that the resulting SCE1-YFP construct delivers good expression and the expected nucleocytoplasmic fluorescence pattern when transiently expressed in protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we transfected a large volume of protoplasts with the SCE1-YFP construct (or with a YFP-HA negative control construct) and performed IP using YFP-Trap magnetic beads. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. The YFP-HA and SCE1-YFP fusion proteins both showed robust expression and strong recovery in the IP elutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Remarkably, the SCE1-YFP fusion protein was found to be associated with native Toc159 and Toc132, but not with the negative control proteins Tic110 or Tic40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovacheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inaba et al., 2005</xref> ). Conversely, YFP-HA did not associate with any of the tested proteins. Given that SCE1 is a promiscuous enzyme that associates with thousands of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elrouby and Coupland, 2010</xref>), and that these interactions are likely to be transient, it is remarkable that TOC co-elution was detectable in this experiment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis reveals that TOC proteins are small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) targets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SCE1 physically associated with native TOC proteins. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts expressing YFP-HA (left panel) or SCE1-YFP (right panel) were solubilized and subjected to IP analysis.

All three YFP-SUMO proteins were found to associate with native Toc159; however, YFP-SUMO3 immunoprecipitated Toc159 with the greatest efficiency.

In both cases, two samples (the ‘Total lysate’ and ‘IP’ samples) were analyzed by immunoblotting. The results showed that YFP-SUMO3, but not YFP-HA, was associated with Toc33-HA (indicated by the lower arrow).

All three constructs expressed well and showed the expected nucleocytoplasmic fluorescence pattern when transiently expressed in protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The three constructs were expressed in parallel in protoplasts alongside the YFP-HA negative control construct.

To extend our analysis of SUMO3 to include another TOC protein, and to more rigorously investigate the possibility of TOC protein SUMOylation, the experiment was repeated with modifications, as follows. Protoplasts were co-transfected with YFP-SUMO3 and Toc33-HA, or YFP-HA and Toc33-HA; in each case, Toc33 was transiently overexpressed to aid detection of this component and its adducts. Upon co-expression of these construct pairs, the protoplast samples were subjected to YFP-Trap IP analysis, as described earlier.

The genetic experiments demonstrated that SUMO system mutations can suppress the phenotype of the Toc33 mutant, <italic>ppi1</italic>, while the molecular and biochemical experiments indicated that TOC proteins associate with key SUMO system proteins and are likely SUMOylated. Visible suppression effects observed in the <italic>ppi1</italic> / SUMO system double mutants were linked to improvements in chloroplast development and enhanced accumulation of key TOC proteins. Thus, our results suggest that SUMOylation acts to destabilize the TOC complex, and that when such SUMOylation is perturbed the TOC proteins are stabilized. We interpret that TOC complexes containing Toc34, Toc75, and Toc159 accumulate at higher levels in <italic>ppi1</italic> / SUMO system double mutants, and that this synthetically improves the double mutant phenotypes relative to the <italic>ppi1</italic> control.

described here are remarkably similar to those mediated by the <italic>sp1</italic> and <italic>sp2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2019</xref>). Like <italic>sp1</italic> and <italic>sp2</italic>, SUMO system mutations can partially suppress <italic>ppi1</italic> with respect to chlorophyll concentration, TOC protein accumulation, and chloroplast development. This similarity suggests that SUMOylation may regulate the activity of the CHLORAD pathway. This is an attractive hypothesis as both SUMOylation and the CHLORAD pathway are activated by various forms of environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurepa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ling and Jarvis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2019</xref>). One possibility is that the SUMOylation of TOC proteins promotes their CHLORAD-mediated degradation. Indeed, as already noted, the ability to carry out SUMOylation is negatively correlated with the stability of TOC proteins in the context of the developed plants studied here. However, it should be kept in mind that SUMOylation can both promote and antagonize the effects of ubiquitination in different situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desterro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liebelt and Vertegaal, 2016</xref>); and so our results do not preclude the possibility that SUMOylation may have different consequences for chloroplast biogenesis in other contexts. The Toc159 receptor is regulated by SP1 when integrated into the outer envelope membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2019</xref>), but by a different E3 ligase when it exists as a cytosolic precursor during the earliest stages of development before germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shanmugabalaji et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, regulation by SUMOylation might be similarly different in these two distinct developmental contexts.</p><p>The precise mechanisms underpinning the observed negative regulation of the TOC apparatus by SUMOylation are currently unknown. One possibility is that the SUMOylation of TOC proteins promotes their association with SP1. SUMOylation can modify protein-protein interactions, and some RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases specifically recognize SUMOylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sriramachandran and Dohmen, 2014</xref>). However, these SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) typically contain SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), which guide the ligases to SUMO proteins conjugated to their substrates, and these are not apparent in SP1 (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). However, SP1 forms a complex with SP2 and very likely additional cofactors, and these could hypothetically provide a SUMO binding interface. Another possibility is that SUMOylation could be involved in the recruitment of Cdc48 from the cytosol. Two important Cdc48 cofactors are Ufd1 and Npl4, and the former contains a SIM, which can guide Cdc48 to SUMOylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the SUMO-mediated recruitment of Cdc48 has important roles in the maintenance of genome stability in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergink et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The biochemical experiments described in this article indicate that, of the three SUMO isoforms tested, SUMO3 binds TOC proteins with the highest affinity. However, there is an apparent incongruence between the results of these experiments and the results of the genetic experiments. While the <italic>sum1-1</italic> and <italic>sum2-1</italic> mutants were found to additively suppress <italic>ppi1</italic>, the <italic>sum3-1</italic> mutant did not suppress <italic>ppi1</italic>. At face value, this seems puzzling; however, it can be explained by the relative abundance of the three SUMO proteins in planta. SUMO1 and SUMO2 are highly abundant relative to SUMO3, which is, at steady state, very weakly abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van den Burg et al., 2010</xref>). The IP data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> indicated that SUMO1 and SUMO2 can weakly interact with Toc159, and so it is likely that these two isoforms can compensate for the loss of SUMO3 in the <italic>sum3-1</italic> mutant. Although SUMO3 associates with TOC proteins with the highest affinity, the higher abundance of the other two SUMO proteins may facilitate such compensation. It is also noteworthy that, when overexpressed, SUMO3 accentuates the <italic>ppi1</italic> phenotype to a far greater extent than does SUMO1.</p><p>It is now well established that the regulation of chloroplast protein import has critical roles in plant development and stress acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sowden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watson et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrate regulatory crosstalk between the SUMO system and the chloroplast protein import machinery, and present results that are consistent with a model in which SUMOylation modulates the activity or effects of the CHLORAD pathway. The precise nature of the links between these two critically important control systems will be the subject of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Danny Schnell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>ppi1 mutants (defective in Toc33 component of the chloroplast protein import machinery) are small and yellow due to chloroplast defects. The authors have previously identified a suppressor of PPI1, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that can destabilize TOC components to regulate chloroplast protein import. Based on predicted SUMOylation sites, they speculated that the TOC complex might also be regulated by SUMOylation. Mild mutants in the single, essential Arabidopsis SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme (SCE1), one E3 ligase (SIZ1), or two of the three SUMO-encoding genes were able to partially suppress the chlorotic ppi1 mutant phenotype, implying that SUMOylation may also play a role in chloroplast protein import or chloroplast development. Similarly, SUMO overexpression enhanced the chlorosis of ppi1 mutants. The authors test for physical interactions between TOC components and SCE1 (the E2 conjugating enzyme, not SIZ1 the E3 ligase) using BiFC and Co-IP. They also document an interaction between the SUMOs and TOC159 via Co-IP, though this is strongest for SUMO3, which could not suppress the ppi1 phenotype. Finally, the authors detected high molecular weight bands when probing for TOC components after Co-IP for SUMO3-YFP, implying the SUMO3 maybe directly conjugated to TOC components. The authors propose a model in which SUMOylation of TOC proteins might negatively regulate their stability in the chloroplast outer membrane in combination with the ubiquitination mechanism that they have described previously.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Although the changes in chlorophyll content and thylakoid morphology are consistent with impacts on protein import, they can be attributed to other processes that impact nuclear gene expression of chloroplast genes. The manuscript lacks a direct link between the very low levels of SUMOylation of Toc33 and an impact on protein import. In fact, the levels of the two nuclear encoded plastid proteins that they examine other than TOC components, Tic40 and Tic110, don't appear to change. Furthermore, the single immunoblot in figure 1I is the only evidence that addresses the impact of SUMOylation on TOC complex abundance or stability. Unfortunately, it does not provide conclusive evidence that the ppi1 siz1-4 double mutant stabilizes TOC complexes. Although it appears that the Toc75 band in the double mutant is slightly more intense, this could be attributed to variability in blotting, and the Toc159 band does not seem to increase significantly. This experiment would need to be repeated with quantification using replicates. Full blots will need to be presented in the supplemental data, including molecular weight markers and loading controls.</p><p>2) Similarly, Figure 5A, there are very faint bands for both TOC159 and 132 compared to the huge amount in the input and it is surprising that the authors see no flow through of SCE-1YFP. In 5B there is a band even in the YFP-HA control for Toc159 so how can the authors claim that Toc159 is indeed SUMOylated? This experiment would need to be repeated with quantification using replicates. Full blots will need to be presented in the supplemental data, including molecular weight markers and loading controls. Ideally, the authors would also generate a non-SUMO form of TOC159 and show that it does not bind SUMO.</p><p>3) Authors should characterize the T-DNA insertion alleles (sce1-4 and siz1-5) with respect to their effect on SUMO conjugation. This is crucial for the reviewer to determine if sce1-4 or siz1-4 has any significant role in global SUMOylation. To do this, authors should include data on the comparative SUMOylation immunoblot that includes WT, siz1-2/siz1-3, sce1-4 and siz1-5 and siz1-4. It will give the readers clarity about the role of these mutants in SUMO conjugation and how significantly different they are from previously validated E2 and E3 mutants.</p><p>4) The BiFC data presented in figure 3 is inconsistent and lacks appropriate controls. The C-termini of Toc33 and Toc34 are known to reside in the intermembrane space. If properly localized, we would not expect C-terminal cYFP fusions to exhibit BiFC with cytosolically localized SCE1nYFP fusions. Yet, the authors demonstrate BiFC and conclude that this supports their hypothesis for TOC SUMOylation. The similar topology is true for OEP7, which they use as a negative control. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that the C-termini of Toc159 and Toc132 are in the cytosol, which also raises issues with these C-terminal fusions. On this basis, the authors cannot eliminate the possibility that the fusions are not properly localized to chloroplasts.</p><p>5) The authors speculate that SUMOylation works in concert or in opposition to the CHLORAD system.

Do the authors propose that it is stability of the functionally redundant Toc34 isoform that is affected? If so, what is the link between Toc34 stabilization and Toc159 SUMOylation?

The manuscript lacks a direct link between the very low levels of SUMOylation of Toc33 and an impact on protein import. In fact, the levels of the two nuclear encoded plastid proteins that they examine other than TOC components, Tic40 and Tic110, don’t appear to change. Furthermore, the single immunoblot in figure 1I is the only evidence that addresses the impact of SUMOylation on TOC complex abundance or stability. Unfortunately, it does not provide conclusive evidence that the ppi1 siz1-4 double mutant stabilizes TOC complexes. Although it appears that the Toc75 band in the double mutant is slightly more intense, this could be attributed to variability in blotting, and the Toc159 band does not seem to increase significantly. This experiment would need to be repeated with quantification using replicates. Full blots will need to be presented in the supplemental data, including molecular weight markers and loading controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very important point. To address this comment, we prepared fresh protein samples and repeated the immunoblotting analysis. Moreover, we included the <italic>ppi1 siz1-5</italic> genotype in the analysis (in addition to <italic>ppi1 siz1-4</italic>) to strengthen the experiment. Four independent, biological replicates were taken from plants of each genotype. The samples were taken from the batch of plants shown in Figure 1 – Supplement 1 on the day of photography. The new immunoblots show a clear increase in both Toc159 and Toc75 accumulation in both of the double mutants, relative to the <italic>ppi1</italic> control. Please see the new data in Figure 1I of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Tic110 was included as a compartment-specific loading control in this analysis. We quantified the Toc159 and Toc75 bands, and normalized the data using values for the Tic110 control. These new data show that both <italic>ppi1 siz1-4</italic> and <italic>ppi1 siz1-5</italic> display a statistically significant increase in the accumulation of both TOC proteins, relative to <italic>ppi1</italic>. Please see Figure 1J and Figure 1K.</p><p>We have included the full blots, including annotations and molecular weight markers in our revised manuscript. Please see Source data 1.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to clarify that Tic110 and Tic40 panels in the original figure served as loading controls, exactly as Tic110 does in the new experiment. The abundancies of these TIC proteins was not expected to change in the double mutants, as we expected that the SUMO system would exhibit specificity for TOC proteins in the same manner as the ubiquitin-based CHLORAD system (Ling et al., 2012; Ling et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, Figure 5A, there are very faint bands for both TOC159 and 132 compared to the huge amount in the input and it is surprising that the authors see no flow through of SCE-1YFP. In 5B there is a band even in the YFP-HA control for Toc159 so how can the authors claim that Toc159 is indeed SUMOylated? This experiment would need to be repeated with quantification using replicates. Full blots will need to be presented in the supplemental data, including molecular weight markers and loading controls. Ideally, the authors would also generate a non-SUMO form of TOC159 and show that it does not bind SUMO.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for making these important points, to which we have the following responses.</p><p>Firstly, regarding Figure 5A: SCE1 is a promiscuous enzyme that associates with thousands of proteins, and these interactions are highly transient. Therefore, we argue that it is actually not so surprising that the co-eluting Toc159 and Toc132 bands are quite faint; on the contrary, we think it is remarkable that we were able to detect even low-level co-elution in this experiment. To address this point, we have included a short additional statement in the manuscript (see Results). The anti-YFP beads used in this experiment are commercially produced and highly effective, and consequently it is not unexpected that there was no SCE1-YFP protein in the flow-through sample.</p><p>Secondly, regarding Figure 5B: We repeated this experiment and obtained a very similar result. Please see Figure 5 – Supplement 3. Moreover, we included quantification of the data in the new figure. We are fully confident in this result, especially as it is in agreement with results independently obtained by two other groups (Accossato et al., 2020; Elrouby and Coupland, 2010).</p><p>As requested, we have made the full blots, including annotations and molecular weight markers, available for each panel of Figure 5. Please see Source data 1. Unfortunately, our access to the laboratory has been severely restricted due to the ongoing pandemic, and as a result we were not able to create the non-SUMO form of Toc159.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Authors should characterize the T-DNA insertion alleles (sce1-4 and siz1-5) with respect to their effect on SUMO conjugation. This is crucial for the reviewer to determine if sce1-4 or siz1-4 has any significant role in global SUMOylation. To do this, authors should include data on the comparative SUMOylation immunoblot that includes WT, siz1-2/siz1-3, sce1-4 and siz1-5 and siz1-4. It will give the readers clarity about the role of these mutants in SUMO conjugation and how significantly different they are from previously validated E2 and E3 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for making this is important point. To address this comment, we have thoroughly characterised the <italic>siz1-4</italic> and <italic>siz1-5</italic> mutant alleles (see below). However, as <italic>sce1-4</italic> has already been characterised (Saracco et al., 2007), and the mutant was found to show a moderate reduction in global SUMOylation, we do not believe it is necessary to repeat that analysis. Nonetheless, we have more clearly drawn attention to the prior published work in the revised text (see Results).</p><p>Regarding the <italic>siz1</italic> mutants: We carried out the suggested experiment, and found that <italic>siz1-4</italic> and <italic>siz1-5</italic> both show a decrease in global SUMOylation that is highly similar to the decrease observed in <italic>siz1-2</italic> and <italic>siz1-3</italic>, two previously characterised mutants. Please see Figure 1 – Supplement 3. The plants used in this analysis were subjected to heat shock to aid detection of SUMO1/2.</p><p>To further corroborate the usefulness of the <italic>siz1-4</italic> and <italic>siz1-5</italic> alleles, we have also included information on the respective T-DNA insertion sites, which both fall within the <italic>SIZ1</italic> open reading frame; please see Figure 1 – Supplement 2A. Moreover, we have added new data which confirm that both mutants show a major reduction in <italic>SIZ1</italic> expression; please see Figure 1 – Supplement 2B. Finally, we wish to emphasize that the <italic>siz1-4</italic> and <italic>siz1-5</italic> mutants also visually resemble <italic>siz1-2</italic> and <italic>siz1-3</italic>, and have added a statement to this effect in the revised manuscript (see Results).</p><p>Based on all of the aforementioned data, and given that SIZ1 has thousands of potential substrates and is one of the most important components of the SUMO pathway (Rytz et al., 2018), we are confident that the two new mutants show significant decreases in global SUMOylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The BiFC data presented in figure 3 is inconsistent and lacks appropriate controls. The C-termini of Toc33 and Toc34 are known to reside in the intermembrane space. If properly localized, we would not expect C-terminal cYFP fusions to exhibit BiFC with cytosolically localized SCE1nYFP fusions. Yet, the authors demonstrate BiFC and conclude that this supports their hypothesis for TOC SUMOylation. The similar topology is true for OEP7, which they use as a negative control. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that the C-termini of Toc159 and Toc132 are in the cytosol, which also raises issues with these C-terminal fusions. On this basis, the authors cannot eliminate the possibility that the fusions are not properly localized to chloroplasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this point to our attention. Actually, the problem here was entirely related to our presentation, in the text and with the over-simplified annotation we employed in the relevant figure, and we sincerely apologize for the confusion that this has caused. We have reviewed all the constructs employed in this experiment, and can confirm that all of the TOC fusion proteins carried an N-terminal tag. The labelling in Figure 3 has now been changed to more clearly indicate that this is the case, and the relevant sections of text have been corrected. Please note that the OEP7 fusion protein carried a C-terminal tag, which is entirely in line with published information on the targeting properties of this protein (Lee et al., 2001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors speculate that SUMOylation works in concert or in opposition to the CHLORAD system. This group previously demonstrated that CHLORAD is important for remodeling TOC complexes during developmental events or stress responses. Do they propose something similar for SUMOylation?

Do the authors propose that it is stability of the functionally redundant Toc34 isoform that is affected? If so, what is the link between Toc34 stabilization and Toc159 SUMOylation? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model is that SUMOylation works in concert with the CHLORAD pathway. The two major components of the CHLORAD pathway – SP1 and SP2 – were originally identified as suppressors of <italic>ppi1</italic> in a genetic screen. It is therefore intriguing that a series of SUMO mutants seem to suppress <italic>ppi1</italic> in a similar fashion, and suggests that SUMOylation might promote CHLORAD function.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the <italic>ppi1 siz1-4</italic> and <italic>ppi1 siz1-5</italic> double mutants show clear increases in the accumulation of Toc75 and Toc159 (please refer to Figure 1I, 1J and 1K). These results suggest that SUMOylation acts to destabilise the TOC complex, and that, when its function is perturbed, TOC proteins accumulate at higher levels. We interpret that TOC complexes containing Toc34, Toc75 and Toc159 accumulate at higher levels in <italic>ppi1 siz1-4</italic> and <italic>ppi1 siz1-5</italic>, and that this synthetically improves the double mutant phenotypes relative to the <italic>ppi1</italic> control. We have added a statement to the text to more clearly outline our model (see discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Additional controls are required for single/double mutant combinations:</p><p>a. sce1-4, siz1-4, and siz-15 single mutant analysis from Figure 2E/2F should be included in Figure 1G and H.</p><p>b. sum1-1, sum2-1, sum3-1, and sum1-1 sum2-1 mutants in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these controls will strengthen our experiments.</p><p>To address point (a), we repeated the <italic>ppi1 sce1-4</italic>, <italic>ppi1 siz1-4</italic>, and <italic>ppi1 siz1-5</italic> experiments alongside single mutant controls; please refer to Figure 1 – Supplement 1. As expected, the <italic>sce1-4</italic>, <italic>siz1-4</italic>, and <italic>siz1-5</italic> single mutants did not show an increase in chlorophyll abundance relative to wild-type plants, which underscores the synthetic nature of the effects observed in the <italic>ppi1</italic> double mutants.</p><p>To address point (b), we phenotypically characterised the <italic>sum1-1</italic> and <italic>sum2-1</italic> single mutants, as well as a <italic>sum1-1</italic>† <italic>sum2-1</italic> double mutant (where the dagger indicates that the line is heterozygous with respect to the mutation); please refer to Figure 4 – Supplement 1. We found that none of the mutants display a change in phenotype relative to wild type. Please note that we did not carry out this experiment alongside <italic>ppi1</italic>, <italic>ppi1 sum1-1</italic>, <italic>ppi1 sum2-1</italic>, and <italic>ppi1 sum1-1</italic>† <italic>sum2-1</italic> lines, as the experiment would otherwise have been too laborious, under the current challenging circumstances. This is because the <italic>sum1-1</italic>† <italic>sum2-1</italic> double mutants must be genotyped by PCR to identify <italic>sum1-1</italic> heterozygotes in a segregating population, and so it would have been a very large amount of work if all of the mutants were included in the experiment.

However, we decided to also retain the original data in the manuscript (in Figure), with directions to the new experiments in the figure legends. The new data are shown in Figure 1 – Supplement 1.
