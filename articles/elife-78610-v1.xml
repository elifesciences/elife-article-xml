The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during central pain development. Prior adverse injuries are precipitating factors thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state for chronic pain. However, the cellular basis underlying the primed state and the subsequent development of chronic pain remains unknown. Here, we investigated the cellular and synaptic alterations of the CeA in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain. In these mice, local infusion of pregabalin, a clinically approved drug for fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders, into the CeA or chemogenetic inactivation of the somatostatin-expressing CeA (CeA-SST) neurons during the priming phase prevented the chronification of pain. Further, electrophysiological recording revealed that the CeA-SST neurons had increased excitatory synaptic drive and enhanced neuronal excitability in the chronic pain states. Finally, either chemogenetic inactivation of the CeA-SST neurons or pharmacological suppression of the nociceptive afferents from the brainstem to the CeA-SST neurons alleviated chronic pain and anxio-depressive symptoms. These data raise the possibility of targeting treatments to CeA-SST neurons to prevent central pain sensitization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chronic muscle pain</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>central sensitization</kwd><kwd>somatostatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004737</institution-id><institution>National Health Research Institutes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHRI-EX111-11135NI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 108-2320-B-010-026-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 109-2926-I-010-506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 110-2321-B-010-006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 111-2321-B-A49-005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Chang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maladaptive changes of pro-nociceptive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala drive the chronification of muscle pain and comorbid affective behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prior adverse events or perceived physical injuries are one of the precipitating factors for chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mills et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stevans et al., 2021</xref>). A prior injury is thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state, which lasts variably in different types of chronic pain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kandasamy and Price, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichling and Levine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and Chen, 2016</xref>). Subsequent injuries occurring during the priming phase can result in the chronification of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and Chen, 2016</xref>). Acid-induced muscle pain (MP) in rodents, which is a preclinical model for chronic MP disorders, including fibromyalgia syndrome, requires two episodes of acute MP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sluka et al., 2001</xref>). Specifically, the second acid injection into the gastrocnemius muscle of animals during a priming phase is warranted for the development of chronic MP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluka and Clauw, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and Chen, 2016</xref>). Chronic pain disorders are associated with psychiatric comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooten, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Velly and Mohit, 2018</xref>). Indeed, patients with fibromyalgia syndrome have chronic widespread pain and other comorbid symptoms, for example, sleep, psychological, and cognitive disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clauw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluka and Clauw, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Central sensitization is believed to underlie widespread MP and affective symptoms in the fibromyalgia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clauw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolf, 2011</xref>). However, the cellular basis underpinning central sensitization in MP disorders is poorly elucidated. Among the anatomically and functionally distinct amygdaloid nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDoux, 2000</xref>), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during the development of chronic pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuner and Kuner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neugebauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson and Neugebauer, 2017</xref>). The CeA receives a direct nociceptive projection from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Maladaptive changes in synaptic transmission at the PBN to the CeA neuron synapses are thought to underlie persistent pathological pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Sheets, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). The CeA houses distinct gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neuronal populations; the two major groups include the somatostatin-expressing (SST) and protein kinase C delta-expressing (PKCÎ´) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babaev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). These two types of neurons form a reciprocal inhibitory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babaev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). It is believed that PKCÎ´ neurons are pro-nociceptive, whereas SST neurons are antinociceptive under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). However, the role of these two types of neurons in the regulation of nociception is inconsistent in different chronic pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we aimed to investigate the cellular basis underlying MP using the acid-induced MP model. By combining electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and in vivo calcium imaging, we attempted to demonstrate that CeA-SST neurons, which are believed to be antinociceptive neurons, become hyperexcitable following MP development. Consistent with this finding, selective chemogenetic inactivation of CeA-SST neurons or suppression of synaptic transmission of the PBN to the CeA-SST neurons alleviated MP and negative emotions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intra-CeA application of pregabalin alleviated pain in an MP mouse model</title><p>Acid-induced MP in rats or mice is considered a preclinical model of fibromyalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sluka et al., 2001</xref>). In this study, we induced MP in mice using a well-established protocol for acid-induced MP. Mice with acidic (pH 4.0) saline injected into the gastrocnemius muscle unilaterally on day 0 (baseline [BL]) and day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are referred to as the MP mice. Following the first acidic saline injection, the MP mice showed a transient decrease in the paw withdrawal (PW) threshold in both the ipsilateral (âipsiâ) and contralateral (âcontraâ) hind limbs in response to the von Frey filament stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The acute pain mostly recovered by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A second injection, however, caused a sustained decrease in the PW threshold that lasted for at least 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to the MP mice, the neutral (pH 7.2) saline-injected mice, referred to as the control (Ctrl) mice, showed no significant changes in the PW response to the von Frey filament stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Collectively, only the MP mice exhibited an increase in the PW response to a wide range of von Frey filament stimulations bilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark (L/D) box are common approach-avoidance conflict tests based on the general aversion of mice to bright and open environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoon and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>). Anxious mice prefer to stay in the closed arms and dark compartment. Compared to the Ctrl mice, the MP mice spent less time in the open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and made fewer transitions between the light and dark zones in the L/D box test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Neither of these behavioral phenotypes was due to reduced locomotion because the total travel distances of the MP and Ctrl mice were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We also tested mice in the marble burying test where anxious animals directed their energies toward minimizing threatening stimuli and tended to bury more marbles. Compared to the Ctrl mice, the MP mice buried more marbles in the marble burying test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Anxiety disorders are often associated with depression-like behavior and social avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allsop et al., 2014</xref>). The forced swim test (FST) is commonly used for testing depression-like behavior in mice. Compared to the Ctrl mice, the MP mice spent more time in the floating state, suggesting enhanced depression-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Finally, we tested the sociability of the mice by measuring the time spent in a social chamber containing a novel mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, the MP mice spent less time in the social chamber than the Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). The total travel distance of the MP mice was not significantly different from that of the Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the MP mice exhibited mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia as well as a variety of behavioral traits commonly associated with anxiety and depression. Thus, the acid-induced MP model satisfies the face validity of chronic MP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoon and Tye, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we tested the predictive validity of this model. Pregabalin (PGB) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of chronic pain disorders and affective comorbidities. PGB is a selective ligand for the Î±2Î´ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">HÃ¤user et al., 2009</xref>). However, the exact action site of PGB on both the sensory and affective dimensions is unknown. The CeA receives a direct nociceptive projection from the PBN, which is enriched with the calcium channel Î±2Î´ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To test whether PGB acted on the PBN-CeA pathway, we locally infused PGB into the CeA of the Ctrl and MP mice bilaterally through a cannula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Compared to the Ctrl mice, cannula infusion of PGB (1 mM, 0.15 Î¼L/site), instead of a vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid [ACSF]), into the CeA of the MP mice on days 16 and 19 increased the PW threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This result supports the predictive validity of this model.</p><p>In this model, the first acidic saline injection initiated a priming phase, which reportedly lasts for 5â8 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and Chen, 2016</xref>). Therefore, we determined whether earlier administration of PGB could prevent chronic pain development. Thus, we infused ACSF or PGB bilaterally through a cannula on day 3 into the CeA of the MP mice right after the second acidic saline injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The group infused with ACSF was able to develop chronic pain effectively. In contrast, the pain response of the group infused with PGB became weakened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This result demonstrated that local infusion of PGB into the CeA during hyperalgesic priming was sufficient to prevent the development of chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Local infusion of PGB into the CeA alleviated negative emotions</title><p>To test whether local PGB administration in the CeA also alleviated negative emotions in the MP mice, we infused PGB into the CeA of the Ctrl and MP mice bilaterally through a cannula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To determine the changes in intrinsic properties, the CeA neurons were recorded in the presence of synaptic blockers, which blocked glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission (see Materials and methods). Compared to the Ctrl mice, resting membrane potentials and input resistance of the CeA-SST neurons and CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons in the MP mice were not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C-F</xref>). However, the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice generated more spikes in response to prolonged current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons in the MP mice generated fewer spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Consistent with these results, the CeA-SST neurons exhibited a lower rheobase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), while the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons exhibited a higher rheobase in the MP mice compared to the Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These results indicated that cell-intrinsic mechanisms that induce enhancement of excitability in the MP mice are CeA-SST neuron-specific. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the number of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)-positive CeA cells was increased in the MP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Moreover, increased pERK-positive cells were mostly CeA-SST cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, C, D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Inhibition of the CeA-SST neurons alleviated the pain and affective symptoms</title><p>The increased CeA-SST excitability was associated with chronic pain phenotypes in the MP mice. We sought to determine the causal role of the CeA-SST neurons in the MP development. Therefore, we tested whether suppression of neuronal excitability of the CeA-SST neurons during the initial muscle injuries was sufficient to interfere with the development of chronic pain states. A Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) encoding an inhibitory designer receptor (hM4Di) was injected bilaterally into the CeA of SST-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Most (~80%) hM4Di-expressing cells, as identified by the mCherry expression, were immunoreactive for SST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Whole-cell current-clamp recordings from acute amygdala slices prepared from the mice expressing the hM4Di in the CeA demonstrated that bath application of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 5 ÂµM) inhibited spontaneous firing in the hM4Di-expressing SST neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C<sub>1</sub></xref>). In contrast, CNO had no effect on the firing of the SST neurons, which only expressed mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C<sub>2</sub></xref>). To test the essential role of CeA-SST neuronal activity in MP induction, CNO (5 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into the mice immediately after the second acidic saline injection. Silencing the CeA-SST neurons during the primed state prevented the development of MP in the hM4Di-expressing mice compared to the mCherry-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This result suggests that activation of the CeA-SST neurons following peripheral injury was necessary for pain chronification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inactivating the somatostatin-expressing central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA-SST) neurons alleviated pain and affective symptoms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viral constructs and experimental schematic.

CNO was i.p. injected into the mice following the establishment of MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that inhibiting the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice 2 weeks following MP induction was still effective in increasing the PW threshold on day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and the pain-reduction effect lasted for 24 hr and persisted if CNO was administered repeatedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). On the same day following the CNO injection, we also tested the effect of inhibiting the CeA-SST neurons on the affective symptoms. Compared to the mCherry-MP mice, the hM4Di-MP mice spent more time in the open arms during the EPM test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), exhibited increased transitions between light and dark zones in the L/D box test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), buried fewer marbles in the marble burying test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), and immobilized less in the FST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Moreover, the hM4Di-MP mice spent more time in the social zone in the three-chamber sociability test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). However, the total travel distances of the mCherry-MP and hM4Di-MP mice were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G and J</xref>). Notably, chemogenetic inhibition of the CeA-SST neurons in the hM4Di-Ctrl mice had little effects on the PW threshold and on their respective performances in the EPM, L/D box, marble burying test, FST, and sociability test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

These two types of neurons reciprocally inhibit each other. We subsequently tested whether increasing CeA-PKCÎ´ neuronal activity could also reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and anxiety-like behaviors. The excitatory designer receptor (hM3Dq) was virally expressed in the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Most of the hM3Dq-expressing cells, as identified by the mCherry expression, were immunoreactive for PKCÎ´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Whole-cell current-clamp recordings demonstrated that bath application of CNO (5 Î¼M) selectively enhanced spontaneous firing in the hM3Dq-expressing CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons as compared to the mCherry-expressing CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C</xref>). Like the silencing of the hM4Di-expressing CeA-SST neurons, the activation of the hM3Dq-expressing CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons greatly increased the PW threshold in the MP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4D</xref>). Intriguingly, unlike the results of inactivating the CeA-SST neurons, enhancing the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons had little effect on the anxiety-like behaviors. There were no changes in the open-arm time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4E</xref>), number of transitions during the L/D box test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4F</xref>), and number of buried marbles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4G</xref>).

The second acidic saline injection during the hyperalgesic priming promoted pain chronification. Local PGB application into the CeA reduced mechanical allodynia and reversed affective behaviors in the MP mice. Intriguingly, intra-CeA PGB application or selective inactivation of CeA-SST neurons immediately following the second acidic saline injection prevented the chronification of pain. Notably, the MP was accompanied by enhanced glutamatergic transmission onto the CeA-SST neurons and decreased synaptic transmission onto the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons. Furthermore, the CeA-SST neuron excitability and CeA-PKCÎ´ neuron excitability was increased and decreased, respectively. In agreement with the role of CeA-SST neurons in central sensitization, chemogenetic inactivation or pharmacological suppression of the CeA-SST neurons by PGB effectively alleviated MP and comorbid affective behaviors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effect of PGB on pain and emotional behaviors</title><p>The effect of PGB on the PW threshold could be replicated by either reducing or elevating the CeA-SST and CeA-PKCÎ´ neuron activities, respectively; however, this is not the case for the anxiety-like affective behaviors. Therefore, the effect of PGB on the PW threshold and emotional behaviors in the MP mouse model may be caused by distinct simultaneously occurring circuit mechanisms. To further elucidate this, we plotted the changes of the immobility time in the FST or number of buried marbles in the marble burying test against the change of mechano-sensitivity to examine the effect of PGB on pain sensitivity and emotional behaviors. Only the data obtained from the FST and marble burying test were used to examine the effect of PGB on the pain sensitivity and emotional behaviors because these two behavioral assays could be tested before and after PGB application on the same animals. After PGB application, no positive correlation was observed between the increase in the PW threshold and the reduction of the immobility time. On the other hand, only a weak positive correlation between the change of PW threshold and change in the number of buried marbles was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

The formation of long-term potentiation at the synapses in pain-related brain regions is considered one of the synaptic mechanisms underlying the transition of acute to chronic MP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Min et al., 2011</xref>). The protein kinase C (PKC)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays a key role in the maladaptive changes in the neural circuitry of the MP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Min et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, MP is associated with enhanced pERK expression in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The PVT, a structure that is readily activated by both physical and psychological stressors, projects to the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Penzo et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies supported the involvement of the PKC and/or ERK activity in these two brain regions. First, inhibition of the PKC or ERK activity in the PVT, a major input to the CeA, prevents the chronification of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Second, upregulation of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors function at the PBN-capsular central amygdala neurons (CeAC) synapse in the MP mice requires the activation of the PKC-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway in the CeAC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, PKC-dependent, but ERK-independent, enhancement of synaptic release occurs at the PBN-CeAC synapses in the MP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we reported an increase in the sEPSC and mEPSC frequencies but not their amplitudes in the CeA-SST neurons.

Several excitatory inputs impinge onto CeA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fadok et al., 2018</xref>). The CeA receives nociceptive inputs from the dorsal horn via the PBN and affect-related information from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuner and Kuner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Sheets, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the PVT, which is a structure that is readily activated by both physical and psychological stressors, projects onto the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Penzo et al., 2015</xref>). The sEPSC decay time analysis revealed at least two populations of sEPSCs, suggesting heterogeneous excitatory inputs impinging on different spatial domains of the CeA neuron dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Previous studies have reported that synaptic inputs from the PVT and BLA onto the CeA are strengthened in chronic pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the role of ERK in the PVT for MP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), the PVT input most likely contributes to the enhancement of glutamate release to the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice. Moreover, we cannot exclude the contribution of the BLA input, because BLA-CeA synapses are potentiated in chronic neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to synaptic plasticity, ERK is probably involved in the cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Considering that pERK is increased in CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), we speculate that the ERK activity may contribute to the increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability of the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice. The CaMKII-PKA/PKC-ERK-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) pathway triggers gene transcription and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolch, 2000</xref>). The activated ERK1/2 can undergo phosphorylation after translocating to the nucleus and then activate the downstream transcriptional factor CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iyengar et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of CREB triggers gene transcription and plasticity including regulation of a variety of ion channels, thereby changing the AP threshold and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, downregulation of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels such as K<sub>v</sub>4.2 expression or upregulation of the voltage-gated Na channels such as Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 expressions can either decrease the rheobase or increase action potential numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu and Gereau, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Subtype of sensitized CeA neurons depends on the mouse model of chronic pain</title><p>A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>, demonstrated that neuropathic pain-induced activated forms of ERK (pERK) and cFos were preferentially expressed in the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons, which exhibited enhanced excitability relative to the CeA-SST neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons or activation of the CeA-SST neurons reversed nerve-injury-induced hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, another study demonstrated that chemogenetic inhibition of the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons reduced mechanical hyperalgesia in mice with formalin-induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). However, two recent studies contradicted this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Using the spared nerve injury model, Zhou and colleagues demonstrated that a small population of CeA-SST neurons, which are glutamatergic and project to the lateral habenula (LHb), exhibited enhanced excitability and were involved in a neural circuit for hyperalgesia and comorbid depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, a subpopulation of neurons co-expressing PKCÎ´ and enkephalin confined to the mid-posterior axis of the CeA was shown to mediate the antinociceptive function in response to general anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, using the acid-induced MP model, we observed that chemogenetic inactivation of the CeA-SST neurons effectively alleviated MP and comorbid affective behaviors. Overall, the subtype of sensitized neurons in the CeA may vary based on the chronic pain models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The CeA contains functionally distinct neuronal populations</title><p>CeA-SST neurons form reciprocal connections with CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, silencing the CeA-SST neurons in the MP model improved affective behaviors, while activating the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons had little effect on them. Our results support a notion that the CeA-SST neurons contain heterogeneous subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Penzo et al., 2014</xref>). The CeA-SST neurons could comprise at least two distinct subtypes of pro-nociceptive neurons based on their intrinsic firing properties and downstream targets in the MP model. A subset of the CeA-SST neurons could project onto the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis for approach-avoidance behavior, the midbrain ventrolateral periaqueductal gray for active-avoidance behavior, and the LHb for depression-like behavior. We speculate that the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons could inhibit the other subset of the CeA-SST neurons, which form reciprocal inhibition with the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons. In agreement with this hypothesis, chemogenetic activation of CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons reduced tactile allodynia without influencing affective behaviors in MP. Notably, investigations on pain-related affective comorbidities at the cellular level between these two neurons have not been reported in the acid-induced MP model. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms by which the CeA-SST neurons and their downstream targets regulate negative affect have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the hyperexcitability of the CeA-SST neurons and the resulting affective symptoms can be well explained by the downstream pathways of the CeA-SST neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>A potential caveat of this study is that single molecular markers such as SST or PKCÎ´ may not be specific enough to identify functionally distinct CeA neuronal populations in the modulation of pain. For instance, these neurons display different intrinsic properties such as firing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). According to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2016</xref>), we analyzed the CeA neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and classified them into early-spiking (ES) and late-spiking (LS) neurons based on their spike delay at rheobase. Using the same criteria, the CeA neurons with a spike delay greater than 1.5 s were classified as LS neurons, whereas the rest were classified as ES neurons. The ratio of these two subpopulations (ES vs. LS subtype) in either CeA-SST or CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons was not significantly altered in the MP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). However, in the MP mice, the enhanced excitatory transmission was specific to the CeA-SST-ES neurons, whereas the depressed excitatory transmission was specific to the CeA-PKCÎ´-LS neurons. On the other hand, the modification of cell excitability in the MP mice was specific to ES neurons in both the CeA-SST and CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To achieve greater specificity, composite molecular markers and/or anatomical locations should be considered. A single molecularly defined population can be further divided based on its location within a brain area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Sheets, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). For example, spared nerve injury distinctly alters inputs from the PBN to the SST neurons based on their location in the lateral division of the CeA (CeL). Notably, the input from the PBN to the SST neurons in the capsular division of the CeA (CeC) is depressed, whereas the same input to the SST neurons in the CeL and the medial division of the CeA (CeM) is not altered. Moreover, our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2016</xref>) reported that the CeA-SST neurons exhibit a high degree of variation in the spike delay in response to the current injection in the slice recording and added an additional layer of heterogeneity. Considering the distinct synaptic and cellular properties of these subpopulations, they are likely to react differently to chemogenetic manipulations. Thus, while the entire molecularly defined neuronal population is targeted for manipulations, the net effects are likely to be dominated by the subpopulations that are preferentially expressed with optogenetic or chemogenetic actuators. Thus, a novel toolkit integrating anatomical, physiological, and molecular profiles of single neurons is warranted for functional dissection of CeA microcircuitry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The SST-Cre line and Ai14 tdTomato reporter (stock no. 007914) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. PKCÎ´-Cre and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC) and National Laboratory Animal Center, respectively. Mice aged 2â5 months of either sex were used in the electrophysiological and behavioral studies. All the mice were bred against the C57BL/6J genetic background. Mice were housed in a 12 hr light-dark cycle and provided food and water ad libitum. Two-month-old mice were injected with a virus and implanted with optical fibers in the CeA. The animals were handled in accordance with national and institutional guidelines. All behavioral procedures were conducted in accordance with the protocol (no. 1080317) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viruses</title><p>To specifically express designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) onto the CeA-SST and CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons, we used a recombinant AAV5 carrying hM3Dq or hM4Di conjugated to mCherry in a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO), driven by the human Synapsin I (hSyn) promoter (AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry). In the optogenetic experiments, AAV5 carrying channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) conjugated to eYFP driven by the CaMKIIÎ± promoter (AAV5-CaMKIIÎ±-ChR2-eYFP) was used to selectively express ChR2 onto the PBN neurons. To silence the neurons, AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry was injected into the CeA region. To activate the neurons, the AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry virus was injected into the CeA region and the AAV5-CaMKIIÎ±-ChR2-eYFP virus was injected into the PBN region. In addition, a viral vector carrying the red fluorescent protein (AAV5-hSyn-DIO-mCherry) was used as the control. In the in vivo calcium imaging experiment, the AAV5-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 was injected into the CeA region.

After anesthesia, the MP and Ctrl mice received 20 Î¼L injections of acidic saline (pH 4.0) and neutral saline (pH 7.2), respectively, on day 0 in the left gastrocnemius muscle. After 3 days (day 3), the same gastrocnemius muscle was re-injected with acidic or neutral saline. The pH value of the 2-(<italic>N</italic>-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES)-buffered saline (154 mM of NaCl, 10 mM of MES) was used to construct both the acidic and neutral saline, while the pH values were adjusted with 0.1 M of HCl or NaOH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized and PBS (0.9% NaCl in 0.01 M of phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was sequentially perfused through the left ventricle, followed by 30 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M of PBS. The brain was rapidly removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M of PBS for 6 hr at 4Â°C, after which it was cryoprotected with 15% sucrose in 0.1 M of PBS for 24 hr at 4Â°C, followed by 30% sucrose in 0.1 M of PBS for 24 hr at 4Â°C. Coronal brain sections (45 Î¼m thickness) containing the amygdala and surrounding regions were cut using a cryostat microtome (CM1900, Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany). Sections were treated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min and then blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 2 hr at room temperature. To confirm the expression of the virus in the CeA, the slices were stained with a primary antibody: rabbit anti-red fluorescent protein (1:300; Rockland, Limerick, PA, USA) or rabbit anti-PKCÎ´ (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or rat anti-SST (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

The injections were performed using the following stereotaxic coordinates: for the CeA, 1.31 mm posterior from bregma, 2.87 mm lateral from the midline on both sides, and 4.72 mm ventral from the cortical surface; for the PBN, 5.1 mm posterior from bregma, 1.2 mm lateral from the midline on both sides, and 3.2 mm ventral from the cortical surface. During all the surgical procedures, the mice were kept on a heating pad (TCAT-2LV CONTROLLER, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ, USA or Physiological Biological Temperature Controller TMP-5b, Supertech Instruments, Budapest, Hungary) to maintain their surface body temperatures at 34Â°C. After securing the head with ear bars, 75% ethanol was used to sterilize the surgical area, and the eyes were protected using an ophthalmic gel. For viral injection, we injected 0.35 and 0.5 Î¼L of the viral solution bilaterally into the CeA and PBN, respectively, using a 10 Î¼L NanoFil syringe and a 34-gauge (G) beveled metal needle (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA). The flow rate (0.1 Î¼L/min) was controlled with a nanopump controller (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). After viral injection, the needle was raised 0.1 mm above the injection site for an additional 10 min to allow the virus to diffuse before being withdrawn slowly. To reach optimal viral expression, all the animals were allowed to recover for at least 4 weeks before conducting behavioral and electrophysiological experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cannula implantation for intra-CeA drug application</title><p>The cannula for implantation consisted of the guide (27 G, 0.41 mm in diameter and 5 mm long; RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China) and dummy (0.2 mm in diameter and 5.5 mm long; RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China) cannulas. The guide cannulas were placed in the CeA bilaterally (Â±2.87 mm laterally, 1.31 mm posteriorly, 4.65 mm ventrally). To fix the guide cannulas onto the skull, dental resin cement C&amp;B Super-Bond (Sun Medical, Moriyama, Japan) was applied to the surface of the skull around the cannula for approximately 10 min. After the resin cement hardened, the cannula was removed from the homemade holder and the mice were placed back into their home cages for recovery. One week after recovery, the mice underwent behavioral tests. During the test, the dummy cannulas were replaced by internal cannulas (0.21 mm in diameter and 5.5 mm long; RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China). We bilaterally injected 0.15 Î¼L of ACSF at a rate of 75 nL/min through the cannulas on days 15 and 18. For the delivery of PGB (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA), we bilaterally injected 0.15 Î¼L of 1 mM PGB at a rate of 75 nL/min through the cannulas on days 16 and 19.

To fix the lens onto the skull, dental resin cement C&amp;B Super-Bond (Sun Medical, Moriyama, Japan) was applied to the surface of the skull around the lens for approximately 10 min. After the resin cement hardened, the lens was removed from the holder and the mice were placed back into their home cages for recovery. Three to four weeks after injection of the virus, the mice underwent MP induction. Two weeks after MP induction, the calcium activities of the CeA-SST neurons were recorded. Calcium signals were detected using the miniscope system (nVista 3.0, Inscopix). The blue light-emitting diode (LED) power was approximately 1.4 mW at the focal plane. The images (1280Ã800 pixels) were acquired at a 15 or 20 Hz frame rate. After adapting the miniscope, the calcium imaging was recorded from freely moving mice in the home cage. The analysis was performed using the Inscopix data processing software (version 1.6.0, Inscopix).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Marco Capogna as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and editors agreed that this manuscript is interesting, but they also raised criticism that needs to be taken into consideration. We would like to ask you to prepare a revised version of the manuscript and re-submit. The ideal deadline for re-submission for <italic>eLife</italic> is two months, but some more experiments will be required. Thus the authors should take the time required to address the issues below in a convincing manner as well as respond to the comments of the original reviews.</p><p>1) The investigation of the direct monosynaptic excitatory input from the PBN to CeA neurons should be completed by recordings from PKCd+ neurons. Furthermore, more statistical analyses of the data already submitted should be performed, as explained by Reviewer 1.</p><p>2) Increase the number of animals used with chronic muscle pain treated with PGB for the EPM and sociability behavioral tests.</p><p>3) Provide control data on post-hoc images of the virus injection/expression and co-localization with cell type specific markers; refer to previously published data or publicly available data (Allen Inst) on a2d VGCC subunit expression in parabrachial -CeA.</p><p>4) Better discuss: acute PGB effect on the mechano-sensitivity versus emotional behavior; mechanisms involved in changes in intrinsic excitability of neurons in the MP model; pre- versus pot-synaptic changes detected in the MP model; the source(s) of the spontaneous synaptic events.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The direct monosynaptic excitatory input from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), which is enriched with the calcium channel Î±2Î´ subunit, onto CeA neurons, is directly investigated by presynaptic optogenetic stimulation and postsynaptic recordings of SST neurons (Figure 5B). I think this is an important approach that should be further exploited. From the data submitted, it seems that such evoked EPSCs are about 3 times bigger in MP mice compared to controls. Provided that optogenetically-evoked EPSCs from control and MP mice could be appropriately compared, e.g. through normalization, is this difference statistically significant?</p><p>It would be also useful to statistically compare the inhibition of the evoked EPSCs by PGB in the two genotypes. Finally, could the Authors perform some more experiments and report the results of a similar experiment by recording from PKCÎ´ neurons, and statistically compare it to the evoked EPSCs recorded in SST neurons?</p><p>2) What mechanisms the Authors envisage to account for by the changes in intrinsic excitability in SST+ and PKCÎ´ neurons observed in MP mice? This aspect should be discussed.</p><p>3) The Authors reported effects on amplitude and/or frequency of sEPSCs and mEPSCs onto CeA recorded neurons seem to suggest a presynaptic mechanism of action. In contrast, the effect of PGB on calcium transient revealed by 1P deep calcium imaging may be interpreted as pre and/or postsynaptic.</p><p>The Authors should make a more definitive conclusion whether they think their data suggest a presynaptic only or also a postsynaptic mechanism of action. It may be difficult to draw any conclusion from sEPSCs since these events are probably due to the release of multiple synaptic vesicles (e.g., mean amplitude of sEPSCs is bigger than the mean amplitude of mEPSCs).</p><p>4) The Authors should discuss the possible source(s) of the spontaneous synaptic events. Do they only originate from PBN terminals or also from BLA principal neurons or elsewhere? Is an analysis of mEPSCs kinetics compatible with an homogeneous pool of presynaptic terminals as source of the m/sEPSCs or rather SST+ and PKCÎ´+ neurons are biophysically too compact to make out the presence of heterogeneous excitatory inputs perhaps impinging on different spatial domains of the neurons' dendritic trees?</p><p>5) The paw withdraw effect could be replicated by either reducing the CeA SST+ cell activity or by elevating PKCd+ cell activity, but this is not the case for the anxiety-like affective behaviors (Figure 4, Figure 4 S2). Therefore, the PGB effect on the increased paw withdraw threshold and emotion behaviors in the MP mouse model may be caused by distinct circuit mechanisms occurring simultaneously.</p><p>To further elucidate their observation, the Author should test the acute PGB effect on the mechano-sensitivity and emotional behavior separately using a wild type mice or should at least acknowledge this possibility in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My specific issues are outlined below:</p><p>1) Why does the number of animals tested in the different behavioural paradigms (relative to Figures 2 and 4) vary from test to test? Were these different cohorts for each behavioural test?</p><p>2) The size of the cohorts in which PGB was tested (and the relative controls) after induction of chronic muscle pain (Figure 2A-E) is suboptimal for the EPM and sociability tests, also in view of the known relatively high interindividual variability, and should, therefore, be increased.</p><p>3) It should be made more clear in the text that in vivo ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments were performed in mice with chronic muscle pain. Why did the authors did not test the effect of PGB on SST+ neuron activity in control animals? This would have strengthened their findings. Moreover, they could have better exploited their study by testing the effect of PGB on SST+ neuron activity during a von Frey filament stimulation, as this test offers good behavioral bouts in which to analyse ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have the following comments, which require more experiments to address in order to make the manuscript more convincing.</p><p>1, Figure 3 shows recording results from CeA-SST and CeA-PKCd neurons in the MP mice. Since these neurons at baseline consist of different firing phenotypes (spontaneous, late-firing, and regular firing), it would be useful to know whether all firing types show the same changes in synaptic transmission and excitability in the MP model.</p><p>Notably, in Wilson et al., 2019 paper, they found that CeA neurons require at least 50-80 pA current injection to induce the spikes, whereas in this manuscript, CeA neurons require a much lower current injection to fire. Could the author provide some explanation to this difference?</p><p>2, The number of animals in each test is quite different. For instance, in Figure 4E, n=10 for the mCherry group and n=52 for the hM4Di group; this is a big difference to compare 2 groups. Also, in Figure 4 supplement 2, in the CeA-PKCd experiment, n=4 for the mCherry group and n=13 for the hM3q group. These numbers are significantly fewer than those for CeA-SST hM4Di group (n=52). Please explain how the numbers of animals were assigned to each test? Did the author exclude some animals from some tests?</p><p>3, The authors did not show any post-hoc images of the virus injection/expression and co-localization with cell type specific markers for all the functional manipulation and imaging studies. These should be provided to substantiate the results.</p><p>4, In Figure 4 supplement 1B: Chemogenetic inhibition of CeA-SST neurons does not affect the paw withdrawal response in the naÃ¯ve mice. In contrast, the authors themselves showed in their recent paper that optogenetic inhibition of CeA-SST neurons increased paw withdrawal response (Chen et al., 2022, Pain). Please reconcile these two different results in the same lab.</p><p>5, There is no data on a2d VGCC subunit expression in parabrachial or CeA in the chronic MP model in this manuscript. Given so much emphasis on PGB results, this information is crucial and is missing here.</p><p>6, The authors performed the in vivo calcium imaging of CeA-SST neurons in response to PGB. It would be more informative to know how CeA-SST neurons or CeA-PKCd neurons respond to 1st and 2nd acid injection.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Central Sensitization in a Mouse Model of Chronic Muscle Pain&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined here and in the novel comments by the reviewers:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All the reviewers acknowledged that the Authors replied satisfactorily to most of their comments and that the first revised version is improved. However, they also concur that the manuscript still needs some significant improvements.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) The text is often hard to read and should be carefully checked to improve readability. If needed, a professional writer could be helpful.</p><p>2) All the reviewers acknowledged the additional excel database and your explanations regarding the data in Figure 3 â supplement 2 B-D. These data were submitted to support the electrophysiological results â that SST+ neuron excitability is selectively enhanced in MP mice. (See also comments of Reviewer 3 in their original review)</p><p>However, some improvements are needed:</p><p>a) We think that you pooled the data from &quot;all slices&quot; together at a given AP position relative to Bregma, to generate the plots and calculate SEM. However, we think you should re-calculate the mean at each AP position for each animal first, then average across animals and calculate SEM. In this way, the data would be averaged within an animal and the variance would be calculated between animals in order to assess the robustness of the results;</p><p>b) Explain why the number of slices at a given AP position varies dramatically across animals (some animals have 1 slice, some have 5-9 slices at a given AP-position). Furthermore, how it could be that in some mice the AP position has 5-9 slices, whereas from the method one can calculate that a maximum of 3 slices can be obtained for a given AP position;</p><p>c) The number of samples for each bregma level and animal should be similar and more control data should be collected and included since currently they show large variability;</p><p>d) Statistical analysis should be improved, e.g. a two-factor analysis of variance (with equal replications) would be a good way to analyze these data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think that the Authors have done a good job in revising the manuscript according to my suggestions.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) They further investigated and analyzed synaptic transmission at the PBN input to the CeA. The data suggest that the PBN input is not the major potentiated input onto the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice. They also compared the effect of PGB inhibition between the Ctrl and MP groups and found it similar. Then, they tested the effect of PGB on synaptic transmission at the PBN-CeAPKCÎ´ neuron synapses. Approximately 30% CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons were sensitive to PGB inhibition in the Ctrl mice and approximately 63% CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons were sensitive to PGB inhibition in the MP mice.</p><p>2) Potential changes in intrinsic excitability of CeA-SST neurons are discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>3) The Authors strengthen the interpretation of enhancement of vesicle release at the inputs onto the CeA-SST neuron synapses along with the increased excitability to account for the central sensitization of the CeA-SST neurons in MP.</p><p>4) They addressed the issue of PGB mediated increase in paw withdraw threshold and emotion behaviors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work by Lin and coworkers addresses the important and of broad interest process that underlies the progression of transient pain into persistent pain. This study used a number of sophisticated techniques to dissect the synaptic and cellular mechanisms that occur in the mouse central amygdala (CeA) during the development of chronic muscle pain. In particular, the study reveals shifts in opposite directions of the activity of somatostatin-expressing (SST+) and PKCÎ´+ neurons. Pharmacological and chemogenetic manipulation of these neurons prevented the chronification of pain and of the comorbid affective behaviors, although with important differences between these two neuronal classes.</p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors have made a number of significant changes by which they could adequately address my main concerns. In particular, the additional experimental data aimed at increasing the sample size of the behavioural experiments has appreciably improved the manuscript.</p><p>While the text has improved, it still contains several syntax and grammar errors that need to be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors addressed most of my previous concerns. In their response to my question of conflicting results for inhibition of CeA-SST neurons from their prior publication, they responded that &quot;It seems that different illumination protocols resulted in opposite behaviors&quot;. &quot;5 min optogenetic inhibition of CeA-SST reduced mechanical sensitivity, while 10 min illumination increased mechanical sensitivity&quot;. I honestly cannot think of any known mechanism that could explain opposing effect induced by 5min vs 10min optogenetic inhibition. I give up.</p><p>I do have some questions for Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</p><p>In D, the number of SST(-)pERK(+) in the Ctrl (-1.82 mm) is above 40, while in B, the number of total pERK(+) in the Ctrl (-1.82mm) is about 30. This is weird. How could total number of pERK<sup>+</sup> cells in B being less than that in D (a subset of neurons)?</p><p>Authors concluded in Line 212-213, &quot;increased pERK-positive cells are mostly CeA-SST cells.&quot; From the results shown in C and D, it's difficult to be convinced of this statement: the number of SST(+) pERK(+) cells increased from 1.1 to 3.7, while SST(-) pERK(+) cells increased from 18 to 28, even though statistics appeared to be not significant. I believe that instead of comparing the averaged number across sections, comparing the total number of cells in the CeA makes more sense.</p><p>The &quot;gray&quot; bars for &quot;control&quot; samples in panel B (total pERK<sup>+</sup>) and in panel D (SST-/pERK<sup>+</sup>) appear identical. Could there be an image duplication here?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78610.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The investigation of the direct monosynaptic excitatory input from the PBN to CeA neurons should be completed by recordings from PKCd+ neurons.

First, we found the average EPSC amplitude was 1.5 times greater in the MP mice compared to the Ctrl mice. However, the change did not reach the statistical significance (Ctrl, 73.9 Â± 17.9 pA, n = 8; MP, 110.7 Â± 20.0 pA, n = 8; MannâWhitney test, U = 17, n.s., non-significant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.13; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2A). Moreover, the PPR of the light-evoked EPSCs recorded at the PBN-CeA-SST neuron synapses showed no change in the Ctrl and MP groups (Ctrl, 0.65 Â± 0.04, n = 8; MP, 0.60 Â± 0.02, n = 8; MannâWhitney test, U = 25, n.s., non-significant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49). These results may suggest that the PBN input is not the major potentiated input onto the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice. However, it is worth noting that the CeA-SST neurons were randomly selected for recording. It is very possible that not all recorded CeA-SST neurons were sensitized neurons. Therefore, we need to carefully interpret our data.</p><p>Second, we compared the effect of PGB inhibition between the Ctrl and MP groups (Figure 5C). Bath application of PGB (500 ÂµM) decreased the amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs in some CeA-SST neurons of both the Ctrl and MP mice (Figure 5B). Overall, the percentage of PGB-sensitive neurons was only slightly increased in the MP mice (Figure 5C left; Ctrl mice, 37%; 8 cells from 5 mice vs. MP mice, 63%; 8 cells from 4 mice; Chi-square test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.317) and the degree of inhibition between these two groups was similar (Ctrl, 24.9 Â± 5.3 %, n = 3; MP, 30.1 Â± 5.5 %, n = 5; MannâWhitney test, U = 5, n.s., non-significant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.5).</p><p>Finally, we tested the effect of PGB on synaptic transmission at the PBN-CeA-PKCÎ´ neuron synapses. The amplitude of the light-evoked EPSCs recorded at the PBN-CeA-PKCÎ´ neuron synapses was decreased in the MP group (Ctrl, 134.2 Â± 13.2 pA, n = 10; MP, 75.7 Â± 14.5 pA, n = 8; MannâWhitney test, U = 12, *<italic>p</italic> = 0.01; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2C). However, the paired-pulse ratio of the light-evoked EPSCs recorded at the PBN-CeA-PKCÎ´ neuron synapses was not different between the Ctrl and MP groups (Ctrl, 0.62 Â± 0.06, n = 10; MP, 0.52 Â± 0.08, n = 8; MannâWhitney test, U = 28, n.s., non-significant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2D). Compared to the amplitude of the light-evoked EPSCs at the PBN-CeA-SST neuron synapses, the light-evoked EPSCs amplitude of the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons was increased in the Ctrl mice (SST, 73.9 Â± 17.9 pA, n = 8; PKCÎ´, 134.2 Â± 13.2 pA, n = 10; MannâWhitney test, U = 13, *<italic>p</italic> = 0.016; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2E), but showed no significant change in the MP mice (SST, 110.7 Â± 20.0 pA, n = 8; PKCÎ´, 75.7 Â± 14.5 pA, n = 8; MannâWhitney test, U = 19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2F). In addition, the paired-pulse ratio of the light-evoked EPSCs recorded at the synapses of the PBN-CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons and PBN-CeA-SST neurons were not different between the Ctrl (SST, 0.65 Â± 0.04, n = 8; PKCÎ´, 0.62 Â± 0.06, n = 10; MannâWhitney test, U = 18, n.s., non-significant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.054; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2G) and MP groups (SST, 0.60 Â± 0.02, n = 8; PKCÎ´, 0.52 Â± 0.08, n = 8; MannâWhitney test, U = 28, n.s., non-significant, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2H). Bath application of PGB decreased the amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs in the CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons of both the Ctrl and MP mice (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 1B, D). Approximately 30% CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons were sensitive to PGB inhibition in the Ctrl mice and approximately 63% CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons were sensitive to PGB inhibition in the MP mice (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 1C). Furthermore, the degree of inhibition between these two groups were similar (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 1C). Consistent with the effect of PGB on presynaptic Î±2Î´ subunit of VGCCs, the reduction of EPSCs was concomitant with an increase in the paired-pulse ratio (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What mechanisms the Authors envisage to account for by the changes in intrinsic excitability in SST+ and PKCÎ´ neurons observed in MP mice? This aspect should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Several molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant plasticity of sensitized neurons were reported in different chronic pain animal models (Min et al. 2011; Sun and Chen, 2016; Cheng et al., 2011; Fu et al., 2008). These changes include synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. We reported that increased spike number in response to current injection and reduced rheobase in the CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice (Figure 3), whereas their input resistance and resting potential were unaltered (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1). Therefore, we speculate that some active conductances such as voltage-gated sodium channels are upregulated in the CeA-SST neurons of the MP mice. It is worth noting that increased excitability was specific to early-spiking (ES) neurons, the subtype of CeA-SST neurons in the MP mice. Conversely, the decreased excitability was specific to the ES type of PKCÎ´ neurons. According to previous studies, modifications of intrinsic excitability are likely dependent on the PKC-ERK pathway (Min et al. 2011; Cheng et al., 2011). We discussed the possible mechanisms in Discussion (page 10, line 7 â 37).</p><p>References:</p><p>Min MY, Yang HW, Yen CT, Chen CC, Chen CC, Cheng SJ. (2011).

In contrast, the effect of PGB on calcium transient revealed by 1P deep calcium imaging may be interpreted as pre and/or postsynaptic.</p><p>The Authors should make a more definitive conclusion whether they think their data suggest a presynaptic only or also a postsynaptic mechanism of action. It may be difficult to draw any conclusion from sEPSCs since these events are probably due to the release of multiple synaptic vesicles (e.g., mean amplitude of sEPSCs is bigger than the mean amplitude of mEPSCs).</p></disp-quote><p>Our data showed that PGB suppressed synaptic transmission and increased the PPR at the PBN-CeA-SST neuron synapses (Figure 5). Therefore, we interpreted the suppression of calcium transients in the CeA-SST neurons by PGB was mediated by presynaptic inhibition (also see page 8, line 5 â 7).</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of synaptic plasticity, we reported that both the sEPSC and mEPSC frequency were increased in the CeA-SST neurons. Therefore, the enhancement of vesicle release at the inputs onto the CeA-SST neuron synapses along with the increased excitability might mainly account for the central sensitization of the CeA-SST neurons in MP (page 9, line 35 â 49; page 10, line 1 â 23).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Authors should discuss the possible source(s) of the spontaneous synaptic events. Do they only originate from PBN terminals or also from BLA principal neurons or elsewhere? Is an analysis of mEPSCs kinetics compatible with an homogeneous pool of presynaptic terminals as source of the m/sEPSCs or rather SST+ and PKCÎ´+ neurons are biophysically too compact to make out the presence of heterogeneous excitatory inputs perhaps impinging on different spatial domains of the neurons' dendritic trees?</p></disp-quote><p>In revision, we discussed the possible sources of the spontaneous synaptic events (see below; also page 10, line 11 â 23 in the Discussion). Several excitatory inputs impinge onto CeA neurons (Fadok et al., 2018). The CeA receives nociceptive inputs from the dorsal horn via the PBN and affect-related information from the LA (Li et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2019; Ikeda et al., 2007). The PBN-CeA synaptic potentiation is consolidated in chronic neuropathic pain (Ikeda et al., 2007). In addition, BLA-CeA synapses are potentiated in chronic neuropathic pain (Ikeda et al., 2007). The PVT, which is a structure that is readily activated by both physical and psychological stressors, also projects to the CeA (Penzo et al., 2015). Taken together, our results revealed that the net synaptic efficacy of the PBN-CeA, PVT-CeA or BLA-CeA synapses onto CeA-SST neurons were strengthened, whereas the synapses onto CeA-PKCÎ´ neurons were weakened in chronic muscle pain.</p><p>Our preliminary analysis of sEPSC decay time revealed at least two populations of sEPSCs, suggesting heterogeneous excitatory inputs impinging on different spatial domain of the neuronâs dendrites (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 3).</p><p>References:</p><p>Fadok JP, Markovic M, Tovote P, LÃ¼thi A.

Therefore, the PGB effect on the increased paw withdraw threshold and emotion behaviors in the MP mouse model may be caused by distinct circuit mechanisms occurring simultaneously.</p><p>To further elucidate their observation, the Author should test the acute PGB effect on the mechano-sensitivity and emotional behavior separately using a wild type mice or should at least acknowledge this possibility in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Distinct circuit mechanisms could account for the increased paw withdraw threshold and improved emotion behaviors in the MP mouse model by PGB because PGB treatment is not specific to the inputs onto the CeA-SST neurons. Nevertheless, our Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 provides a parsimonious explanation for the effect of PGB on the increased paw withdraw threshold and emotion behaviors.</p><p>Regarding the PGB effect on mechano-sensitivity and emotional behavior, we plotted the changes of immobility time in the FST or number of buried marbles in the marble burying test against the change of mechano-sensitivity. Only the data obtained from the FST and marble burying test were used to address this question because these two behavioral assays could be tested before and after PGB application on the same animals. After PGB application, no positive correlation was observed between the change of the PW threshold and the change of the immobility time. A weak positive correlation between the change of PW threshold and the change in the number of buried marbles (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1), suggests that PGB alleviates the mechano-sensitivity and emotional behavior through distinct circuit mechanisms (see the Discussion page 9; line 16 â 33). For the EPM and social avoidance, the results can be influenced by repeated tests. Therefore, animals were only tested with either ACSF or PGB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My specific issues are outlined below:</p><p>1) Why does the number of animals tested in the different behavioural paradigms (relative to Figures2 and 4) vary from test to test?

This is somehow inevitable during the development of a project. For the same cohort, we randomly and equally assigned animals to the MP and Ctrl groups and then performed behavioral tests. Initially we focused on some common anxiety-like behavioral tests such as the EPM, L/D box, and marble burying tests. After obtaining positive results, we decided to add additional behavioral tests to strengthen the face validity of this pain model. Anxiety disorders are often associated with depression-like behavior and social avoidance. Therefore, we added the FST for depression and the three-chamber test for sociability. Addition of different cohorts for each behavioral test accounts for different numbers of animals in the different paradigms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The size of the cohorts in which PGB was tested (and the relative controls) after induction of chronic muscle pain (Figure 2A-E) is suboptimal for the EPM and sociability tests, also in view of the known relatively high interindividual variability, and should, therefore, be increased.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the size of the cohorts is suboptimal for the EPM and sociability tests (Figure 2AâE).

Could the author provide some explanation to this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>According to our previous study (Hou et al., 2016), we analyzed all CeA neurons shown in Figure 3 and classified them into early-spiking (ES) and late-spiking (LS) neurons based on their spike delay at rheobase. Using the same criteria, the CeA neurons with a spike delay greater than 1.5 s were classified as LS neurons, while the rest were classified as ES neurons (see Figure 3 âfigure supplement 4). The ratio of these two subpopulations (ES vs. LS type) was not significantly altered in the MP mice.</p><p>For the changes in excitatory synaptic transmission (panel A and B in Figure 3 âfigure supplement 4), compared to the Ctrl mice, sEPSC frequency was increased in SST-ES neurons of the MP mice (Ctrl, 1.3 Â± 0.1 Hz, n = 4; MP, 3.5 Â± 0.6 Hz, n = 9; MannâWhitney test, U = 1, **<italic>p</italic> = 0.006).

Initially we tested the hM4Di effect on the MP mice (n = 43, Figure 4 âfigure supplement 2). To this end, we expressed hM4Di on the SST neurons and then tested the effects of VEH (saline, i.p.) vs. CNO (i.p.) on the mechanical sensitivity in the MP mice. The result suggested that silencing the CeA-SST neurons by CNO reduces mechanical hypersensitivity. However, a potential caveat of this experiment is the off-target effect of CNO (Manvich et al., 2018).

In contrast, the authors themselves showed in their recent paper that optogenetic inhibition of CeA-SST neurons increased paw withdrawal response (Chen et al., 2022, Pain). Please reconcile these two different results in the same lab.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer pointed out a key issue regarding the use of in vivo optogenetic manipulations and interpretation of animal behavior. Indeed, we also performed optogenetic inhibition (5-min illumination) of CeA-SST neurons in the control mice in this study (data not shown in the submitted manuscript). The result showed that the mechanical sensitivity was reduced. It was different from our recent paper (Chen et al., 2022) that optogenetic inhibition (10-min illumination) of CeA-SST neurons increased mechanical sensitivity (that is, increased paw withdrawal response). It seems that different illumination protocols resulted in opposite behaviors. Several factors could confound interpretation of optogenetic experiments. First, illumination protocols and intracranial heating could activate or inactivate temperature-sensitive ion channels and thus bias animal behavior (Owen et al., 2019). Second, long-term optogenetic inhibition is known to cause accumulation of intracellular CI<sup>-</sup>, which could alter the E<sub>GABA</sub> and reverse the GABAergic action (Raimondo et al., 2012). In our study, CeA-SST neurons receive reciprocal inhibition from neighboring CeA neurons. In our recent paper (Chen et al., 2022) and our unpublished data, yellow-light stimulation was applied to the naÃ¯ve mice to activate the NpHR3.0 for 10 minutes. This could lead to intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> accumulation after termination of light pulse and cause an increase in excitability or rebound action potential generation in the CeA-SST neurons. Because of several experimental parameters of optogenetic manipulations can result in different behaviors, we decided to employ chemogenetic manipulations in this study.</p><p>References:</p><p>Owen SF, Liu MH, Kreitzer AC.

The reason why some animals have 1 slice and some have 5-9 slices at a given AP position is because of the variation in the slice integrity and the slicing angle of each mouse.
