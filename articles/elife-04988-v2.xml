polypeptides. This study identifies a process unprecedented in bacterial replisomes. While bacteria and phage simply recruit polymerases to the fork, we find that suppression mechanisms are used to position the distinct eukaryotic polymerases on their respective strands. Hence, Pol ε is active with CMG on the leading strand, but it is unable to function on the lagging strand, even when Pol δ is not present. Conversely, Pol δ-PCNA is the only enzyme capable of extending Okazaki fragments in the presence of Pols ε and α. We have shown earlier that Pol δ-PCNA is suppressed on the leading strand with CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that CMG, the 11-subunit helicase, is responsible for one or both of these suppression mechanisms that spatially control polymerase occupancy at the fork.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04988.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04988.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04988.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must replicate their DNA before they divide so that the newly formed cells can each receive a copy of the same genetic material. DNA replication requires complex molecular machinery called a replisome, which comprises multiple proteins, enzymes, and other molecules. First, an enzyme called a helicase starts to unwind the double-stranded DNA into two single strands. This process continues while other enzymes, called polymerases, use the exposed single strands as templates to make complementary new strands of DNA. One of these new strands is built continuously and called the ‘leading strand’. The other newly forming strand—the ‘lagging strand’—is made in the opposite direction, as a series of short fragments that are later joined together.</p><p>The replisomes in bacterial cells have been well studied, but many researchers are investigating the composition of the replisome in animals, plants, and fungi (collectively called eukaryotes). Now, Georgescu et al. have essentially rebuilt a eukaryotic replisome from 31 different proteins in a test tube and confirmed that it can make both leading and lagging DNA strands—just like in a normal cell. Further experiments revealed that the polymerase enzyme that operates on the leading strand cannot work on the lagging strand and vice versa. This exclusivity is unique to eukaryotic DNA replication, as bacterial polymerases can use either DNA strand as a template.</p><p>Georgescu et al. then found that the eukaryotic polymerases are actively prevented from copying the ‘wrong’ strand of DNA and suggest that the helicase enzyme that unwinds the DNA might be behind this activity. Important future studies must now address how the replisome deals with obstacles created by certain DNA-binding proteins and damaged DNA and how it interfaces with the molecules that control cell division and DNA repair.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04988.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04988.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>replication fork</kwd><kwd>CMG</kwd><kwd>Pol delta</kwd><kwd>Pol epsilon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM38839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Georgescu</surname><given-names>Roxana E</given-names></name><name><surname>Schauer</surname><given-names>Grant D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Nina Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Langston</surname><given-names>Lance D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yurieva</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Mike E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Georgescu</surname><given-names>Roxana E</given-names></name><name><surname>Schauer</surname><given-names>Grant D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Nina Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Langston</surname><given-names>Lance D</given-names></name><name><surname>Yurieva</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Mike E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The different polymerases at eukaryotic replication forks achieve their asymmetric placement on the leading and lagging strands through exclusion processes that prevent their function on the 'wrong' strand.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Composition of the eukaryotic replisome and the function of its various proteins is an area of active investigation. Cellular studies reveal that eukaryotes use two different DNA polymerases for the leading and lagging strands, Pols ε and δ, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weinberg and Kelly, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsurimoto et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waga and Stillman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benkovic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pursell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kunkel and Burgers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nick McElhinny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stillman, 2008</xref>). Priming is performed by Pol α, a 4-subunit enzyme that contains an RNA primase and DNA polymerase activity and makes short RNA-DNA hybrid primers of 25–35 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaguni and Lehman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waga and Stillman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benkovic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stillman, 2008</xref>). The 11-subunit CMG complex consisting of the Mcm2-7 ‘motor’, a GINS heterotetramer, and one Cdc45 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Costa et al., 2014</xref>) provides the helicase activity. Numerous other proteins travel with eukaryotic replication forks and have no bacterial homolog or known function. In addition, many replication fork-associated proteins undergo modifications in response to the cell cycle or DNA damage.</p><p>While in vitro synthesis of the leading strand replisome has been accomplished with the purified CMG complex from budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>), the discontinuous lagging strand is a much more difficult process and the number of proteins required for lagging strand synthesis is currently unknown. Indeed, epitope tagging of CMG subunits, followed by cell extract pull-outs and mass spectrometry, has identified a large ‘replisome progression complex’ (RPC) that contains CMG along with several other factors, some of which are essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, RPCs contain CMG along with Mcm10, Ctf4, Pol α, Mrc1, Csm3, Tof1, FACT, and Topo I. Furthermore, there is evidence that nucleosomes may be involved in determining the size of eukaryotic lagging strand fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>). We demonstrate here a 31 protein system, requiring the three replicative Pols α, ε, and δ, which performs both leading and lagging strand synthesis and generates Okazaki fragments of a size similar to those observed in cells.</p><p>Study of the eukaryotic replisome identifies a new process that has no precedent in bacterial systems. Bacteria use simple recruitment processes to attract and hold polymerases to the fork. These are typically mediated by polymerase interactions with other proteins at the replication fork, such as the helicase and sliding clamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benkovic et al., 2001</xref>). However, we find that in addition to recruitment processes that attract polymerases to the fork, eukaryotes use suppressive mechanisms, which prevent polymerase action on one strand or the other. Thus, while Pol ε extends the leading strand, its activity is suppressed on the lagging strand, even in the absence of Pol δ. In opposite fashion, we demonstrate here that Pol δ is active on the lagging strand in the presence of Pol ε and Pol α. This activity stands in contrast to the suppression of Pol δ on the leading strand shown in our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). We also find that Pol α functions with CMG on both the leading and lagging strands. However, Pol α lacks a proofreading exonuclease and thus has lower fidelity than Pols ε and δ. Interestingly, Pol α extension activity is suppressed by Pol ε on the lagging strand, even though Pol ε is inactive on the lagging strand. Likewise, Pol δ suppresses Pol α on the leading strand despite its inefficient extension of this strand. Thus, multiple suppression reactions exist that prevent the activity of a polymerase positioned on the ‘wrong’ strand, and the only active solution is the asymmetric Pol ε/δ leading–lagging strand replisome with use of Pol α to prime the strands.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We expressed and purified yeast CMG helicase in our previous studies and demonstrated its function in leading strand synthesis with Pol ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). The discontinuous lagging strand is a more difficult process than continuous leading strand synthesis, and the current study aims to identify how polymerases are coordinated during coupled leading–lagging strand synthesis. To facilitate this study, we designed a synthetic substrate of 3.2 kb that lacks dG on one strand and thus lacks dC on the other. We then ligated a synthetic fork onto one end (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This nucleotide-biased fork enables separate monitoring of leading and lagging strand synthesis using either <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP (leading) or <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP (lagging).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04988.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pol α primes and extends leading and lagging strands with CMG helicase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the nucleotide-biased 3.2 kb fork substrate used in our experiments, explained further in ‘Materials and methods’.

To obtain the 4-subunit Pol α, we reconstituted it by expressing the Pol1 polymerase subunit of Pol α in yeast and Pol12 and the primase subunits, Pri1 and Pri2, in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. A mixture of cells containing the 4 subunits were lysed, and Pol α was purified as an intact 4-subunit holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then studied the behavior of Pol α with the 11-subunit CMG helicase and RPA on the forked DNA substrate. We initially assumed the lagging strand–specific Pol α would not function on the leading strand with CMG, especially since Pol δ-PCNA did not function well on the leading strand with CMG in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). To test Pol α function with CMG, we primed the leading strand with an oligonucleotide and examined Pol α DNA synthesis with CMG using <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to our expectations, Pol α was highly active with CMG and completely extended the leading strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 4–6). Dropout reactions demonstrated that CMG is absolutely required and therefore Pol α cannot perform this action alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Models of priming at bidirectional origins in the SV40 and bacterial systems indicate that leading strand primers are formed on the lagging strand of one fork and then extended from the leading strand of the opposite fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waga and Stillman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Méndez and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaguni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>). The current study uses a unidirectional linear fork and thus has no opposite fork from which to prime the leading strand. Therefore, we did not expect to observe leading strand synthesis using an unprimed leading strand fork. However, Pol α was fully active on unprimed DNA and thus the primase within Pol α is capable of priming the leading strand directly, while the polymerase subunit of Pol α is able to extend it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 1–3). We support and expand this observation again later in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04988.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Pol α requires CMG for priming activity during unwinding of forked DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of assays comparing Pol α activity using either CMG helicase or the strand displacing ϕ29 polymerase.

The leading strand is continuously extended to full-length product; consequently, once Pol α has switched to the DNA elongation mode, it does not appear to switch back to the priming mode. This behavior has not previously been observed at a moving fork with CMG. Moreover, there are reports to suggest that the eukaryotic fork is discontinuous on both strands (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langston and O'Donnell, 2006</xref>]). The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, however, indicate that the leading strand of the eukaryotic replication fork is synthesized continuously under our assay conditions.</p><p>To determine whether this minimal replication system is competent to prime and extend the lagging strand, we utilized <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP to specifically label lagging strand products.

We expected to observe the small hybrid RNA/DNA 25–35 nucleotide primers known to be generated by Pol α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaguni and Lehman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waga and Stillman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benkovic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stillman, 2008</xref>). However, we were surprised to observe sizeable Okazaki fragments (autoradiograph illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> left panel and quantified on the right panel). At 10–20 nM Pol α, a concentration consistent with intracellular concentrations of Pol α subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>), Okazaki fragments were in the range of 200 bp, similar to their length in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>). The fact that the Okazaki fragment size decreases with increasing Pol α concentration indicates that priming is stochastic, occurring with lower frequency as the Pol α concentration is decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that small Okazaki fragments are intrinsic to Pol α action with CMG in the absence of nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pol α requires CMG for priming function</title><p>To determine if CMG is needed for Pol α priming function, we used ϕ29 DNA Pol, an efficient strand displacing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanco et al., 1989</xref>), to perform leading strand synthesis and generate a lagging single strand (ss) without CMG and asked whether Pol α primase could prime the lagging strand ssDNA template and produce Okazaki fragments with RPA present (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The control shows ϕ29 Pol efficiently extends a primer through the 3.2 kb duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 5) and thus produces an ssDNA lagging strand. However, the lagging strand ssDNA did not serve as a template to generate Okazaki fragments when Pol α and RPA were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 6). In contrast, lagging strand synthesis by Pol α with CMG supports robust Okazaki fragment production by Pol α (lane 4). The requirement of CMG for Pol α primase activity suggests that Pol α forms a transient but specific interaction with CMG for priming action, since use of a heterologous enzyme to unwind DNA does not support Pol α priming activity. Although both Ctf4 and the essential Mcm10 proteins are known to bind Pol α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Warren et al., 2009</xref>), these results demonstrate that neither Ctf4 nor Mcm10 are required for Pol α priming function with CMG in vitro. To support this observation, we examined our protein preparations for trace contaminating Ctf4 and/or Mcm10 by mass spectrometry, but no Ctf4 or Mcm10 was detected. Consistent with results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Pol α also primes the leading strand directly and priming is stimulated by the presence of CMG (compare lanes 3 and 7). The results suggest Pol α binds CMG in the absence of Ctf4 or Mcm10 and therefore we tried to pull down a complex of Pol α with CMG but did not obtain a positive result. Thus the interaction, if it exists, may be weak, consistent with weak helicase–primase interactions in phage T4 and <italic>E. coli</italic> replication systems that can be deduced by activity assays but elude direct detection methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benkovic et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To determine if Okazaki fragments are distributed over the length of the DNA template, we used <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP to label Okazaki fragments and then analyzed the distribution of radioactivity across the DNA by restriction enzyme analysis in a native gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis using CMG and Pol α shows that all the restriction fragments are radioactive and therefore Okazaki fragments are synthesized along the entire length of the DNA (lanes 4–9). To create size markers, ϕ29 Pol was used to extend the leading strand using <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP, followed by restriction digestion (lanes 10–12). The analysis also confirms that Pol α cannot perform priming and extension in the absence of CMG (lanes 1–3) and that ϕ29 Pol cannot perform lagging strand synthesis (lanes 13–15).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04988.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Okazaki Fragments are produced along the entire DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Restriction enzyme map of the 3.2 kb substrate for Psi I and Ear I.

To determine if the Pol α/ε switch occurs as expected, we preloaded CMG on the forked DNA, then added increasing amounts of Pol α either with or without Pol ε, and stopped the reactions after 20 min. If Pol ε takes over the leading strand from Pol α, full-length products will be observed sooner in reactions that contain Pol ε because in the presence of CMG, this enzyme synthesizes DNA faster than Pol α. The results show full-length product in all the lanes containing Pol ε with Pol α (autoradiograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> left, compare lanes 1–4 with 5–8; the quantification on the right panel is based on the autoradiograph analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The Dpb2 subunit of Pol ε is known to bind the Psf1 subunit of GINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sengupta et al., 2013</xref>), and we have previously used a glycerol gradient to demonstrate that intact Pol ε can bind CMG helicase, forming a 1:1 CMG-Pol ε (CMGE) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langston et al., 2014</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, we document that the CMGE complex can also be reconstituted in a bead-based protein binding assay. In these experiments, we purified Pol ε containing an N-terminal StrepTag, incubated it with CMG, and then added Strep-Tactin magnetic beads. Biotin-specific elution of CMG in complex with StrepTag-Pol ε demonstrates that CMG is retained by Pol ε, forming the 15-protein ‘CMGE’ leading strand complex. No CMG was eluted from the column in the absence of Pol ε.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pol ε activity is suppressed specifically on the lagging strand</title><p>Considering that Pol ε takes over the primed template from Pol α on the leading strand, one may presume that Pol ε will also take over from Pol α on the lagging strand. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, we separately monitored leading and lagging strand synthesis in Pol α/CMG reactions in the absence or presence of Pol ε. The first two lanes are Pol α/CMG on the leading (lane 1) and lagging (lane 2) strands. At the concentration used, Pol α extended the leading strand DNA to about half of full length (lane 1), and the signal for Okazaki fragment synthesis was quite strong (lane 2). When Pol ε was added, it took over the leading strand and extended it full length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 3); however, lagging strand Okazaki fragments were inhibited, a result we did not expect (lane 4). We also tested a higher concentration of Pol ε to see if more Pol ε was required to efficiently extend the Okazaki fragments, but lagging strand synthesis was not enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 6) (for quantification see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> right panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This result is contrary to conventional wisdom because one would normally expect more synthesis upon addition of more polymerase. This is especially true considering that Pol ε enhances the leading strand in the very same reaction in which it inhibits the lagging strand (i.e., the only difference is the radioisotope).</p><p>The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> indicate that Pol ε activity is suppressed on the lagging strand. Moreover, Pol ε suppresses Pol α, suggesting that Pol ε gains access to lagging strand primed sites but is inactive on them. Considering that Pol ε extends DNA on RPA-coated primed ssDNA in the absence of CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wold, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garg and Burgers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>), it is possible that CMG controls the activity of Pol ε on the lagging strand. We further supported this observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> by titrating Pol ε into Pol α priming reactions and monitoring lagging strand synthesis. As Pol ε is titrated into the reaction, Okazaki fragment synthesis is inhibited, confirming that Pol ε suppresses Pol α polymerase but is unable to extend lagging strand primers (see quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right panel). Although Pol ε inhibits Pol α on the lagging strand, a combination of Pol ε and RFC/PCNA inhibits Pol α more than either Pol ε or RFC/PCNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, lanes 1–2 and 4–7 vs lanes 8–11; quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Inhibition of Pol α synthesis by RFC/PCNA is also consistent with results in the SV40 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</xref>) and model studies using primed ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mossi et al., 2000</xref>).

Our earlier study used CMG with Pol ε to reconstitute leading strand replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). The continuous nature of the leading strand is relatively simple compared to the discontinuous process of the lagging strand. Indeed, PCNA and RFC were not even required for the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). There are a multitude of proteins that travel with eukaryotic replication forks, many of which have been identified in the large RPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2009</xref>). This report demonstrates that leading/lagging strand replication is recapitulated in vitro with CMG, Pol ε, Pol α, Pol δ, RFC, PCNA, and RPA, comprising 31 different proteins. Hence, nucleosomes are not needed to size Okazaki fragments in vitro, the essential Mcm10 protein that binds Pol α is not required, nor is the Ctf4 trimer that connects Pol α to CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). Study of the leading/lagging strand reaction revealed many facets of replication that were unanticipated, as summarized below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Suppression reactions, not recruitment specifies eukaryotic replisome architecture</title><p>The current report reveals that suppression reactions specify correct polymerase placement at the fork and that when a polymerase occupies the ‘wrong strand’ it is excluded from functioning. This stands in contrast to current views in which the mechanism of polymerase placement is thought to be via recruitment (i.e., each polymerase binds a particular protein on each strand). Indeed, polymerase recruitment by binding clamps and the helicase underlies attraction of polymerases to replication forks of bacteria, its phages, and the SV40 virus. Recruitment is also partly responsible for polymerase placement in eukaryotes. For example, Pol ε binds directly to CMG helicase, stabilizing it on the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langston et al., 2014</xref>). However, the current study reveals the importance of suppression of polymerase action to the specific use of Pol ε and Pol δ on the leading and lagging strands, respectively. Thus, Pol ε function is suppressed on the lagging strand, even when Pol δ is not present. Likewise, our earlier study, confirmed here, showed that Pol δ-PCNA function is suppressed on the leading strand, even in the absence of Pol ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We were surprised to find that Pol α polymerase activity is highly functional with CMG on both leading and lagging strands in the absence of other polymerases. Pol α lacks the high fidelity of Pols ε and δ and does not provide bulk leading or lagging strand synthesis in cells, and thus processes must exist that suppress the polymerase activity of Pol α. In fact, we find many ways that Pol α polymerase is suppressed. One mechanism is by Pol ε positioning on the lagging strand. Interestingly, Pol ε is also suppressed on the lagging strand; perhaps, Pol ε is suppressed from function on the lagging strand by the relative orientation in which CMG holds Pol ε. On the leading strand, Pol ε simply prevents Pol α polymerase extension by switching with it and becoming processive with CMG. This can be likened to the switch of Pol δ with Pol α that prevents leading strand synthesis by Pol α in the SV40 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</xref>). Pol α polymerase activity is also inhibited by RFC/PCNA as shown in this report and an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mossi et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The exclusion processes that underlie eukaryotic fork leading/lagging strand function are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Pol α primes both leading and lagging strands (diagram A). Pol ε prevents further polymerase activity of Pol α by trading places with it, probably by waiting for the distributive Pol α to dissociate from DNA (diagram B); Pol ε then takes over the leading strand. Diagram C illustrates that Pol δ/RFC/PCNA also switch with Pol α but that Pol δ-PCNA cannot function in the presence of CMG on the leading strand. However, Pol δ-PCNA is uniquely capable of extending Okazaki fragments in the complete system (diagram D). Hence, the three-polymerase-CMG replisome is the product of polymerase suppression reactions that enable a unique asymmetric arrangement of DNA polymerases to advance the replication fork.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04988.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Exclusion reactions specify polymerase action at the eukaryotic fork.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pol α interacts with CMG to prime the leading and lagging strands.

The distributive behavior of Pol δ-PCNA with CMG suggests that CMG exerts a negative effect upon Pol δ, causing it to frequently dissociate from PCNA/DNA. A possible explanation for how CMG may cause distributive behavior of Pol δ with PCNA/DNA lies in our earlier finding that Pol δ self-ejects from PCNA upon completing replication of a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langston and O'Donnell, 2008</xref>). This property was originally noted for the highly processive <italic>E. coli</italic> Pol III replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Donnell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Studwell et al., 1989</xref>). Pol III remains firmly attached to the β clamp until reaching the last nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stukenberg et al., 1994</xref>). This also holds true for T4 polymerase upon colliding with a hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hacker and Alberts, 1994</xref>). Self-ejection of polymerase is thought to be useful for recycling among numerous lagging strand primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benkovic et al., 2001</xref>). In eukaryotes, however, the self-ejection process may be used to promote polymerase asymmetry at the fork. A straightforward mechanism could be that CMG occludes the leading strand ssDNA, tricking Pol δ-PCNA to eject as if it were at the end of an Okazaki fragment. If CMG were to trigger the Pol δ−PCNA self-ejection process, it would result in distributive behavior of Pol δ-PCNA, suppressing its activity on the leading strand. Another possible mechanism could be that the 3′ terminus of the leading strand is sequestered and held in a posture that Pol δ cannot freely access.</p><p>The suppression of Pol ε on the lagging strand could possibly result from the geometry of CMG-Pol ε (CMGE) complex, directing the single Pol ε molecule to the leading strand. Suppression of Pol α by Pol ε on the lagging strand could perhaps be explained by competition of these polymerases for CMG, where Pol ε is suppressed from extending the primer. In this connection, the Pol2 gene encoding the catalytic polymerase actually contains two polymerase structures: the active polymerase/exonuclease on the N-terminal half and B-family polymerase in the C-terminal half of Pol2 that is presumed to be inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tahirov et al., 2009</xref>). One possible mechanism by which Pol ε may suppress synthesis on the lagging strand could be that CMG positions Pol ε such that the ‘inactive polymerase’ binds lagging strand primers, preventing their elongation by Pol α and Pol ε. Interestingly, genetic studies have shown that the C-terminal ‘inactive polymerase’ region of Pol ε is required for cell viability, while the N-terminal region containing the active polymerase is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dua et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kesti et al., 1999</xref>). The binding of Pol ε to CMG involves Dpb2, and possibly the Dpb3, Dpb4 subunits of Pol ε, and regions of Pol2 as well. Expression and purification of a mutant Pol ε that lacks the active N-terminal half of Pol2 (ΔN-Pol ε) yields a 4-subunit complex, while the active polymerase half of Pol ε is monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogg et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the ΔN-Pol ε probably connects to CMG similar to wild-type Pol ε and may carry out a vital function at the fork. Alternatively, the C-terminal portion of Pol2 could be important to an origin activation step prior to replisome formation. Although direct evidence is lacking, Pol δ is presumed to function on the leading strand in the ΔN-Pol ε genetic background. However, the finding in this report that Pol α functions on the leading strand with CMG while Pol δ-PCNA is suppressed leaves open the possibility that Pol α could participate as the leading strand polymerase in ΔN-Pol ε mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other aspects of replisome operations emanating from this study</title><p>Numerous proteins travel with the replication fork, and it is not possible to know a priori how many are needed for functional leading and lagging strand replication. This is the first study to reconstitute leading/lagging strand replication with three pure polymerases in a eukaryotic system. It reveals that many of the proteins that move with forks are not required to recapitulate leading/lagging strand synthesis in vitro. For example, Ctf4/AND-1 is essential in most cells (not in budding yeast), and yeast Ctf4 helps recruit Pol α bind to RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>), yet the current study shows that Pol α functionally interacts with CMG without Ctf4. Hence, the complete role of Ctf4 remains unknown. Likewise, the essential Mcm10 protein is known to bind Pol α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Warren et al., 2009</xref>), but this study shows that Mcm10 is not required for fork function in vitro. The same can be said for a myriad of proteins that form the RPC complex, including Mrc1, Csm3, Tof1, Topo I, Mcm10, Ctf4, and FACT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>). It is important to note, however, that in vitro fork progression is 4–5 ntds/s, 5–10 times slower than in vivo measurements, and thus one or more of these proteins may be required to increase the rate of fork movement.</p><p>The current report also reveals that Pol α can prime the leading strand directly. To our knowledge, before this report, all proposed models of leading strand initiation in bacteria and SV40 show priming on the lagging strand of a bidirectional origin, which becomes the leading strand of one fork, rather than directly priming the leading strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waga and Stillman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Méndez and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaguni, 2011</xref>). We show here that this is not necessary. Pol α is robust in initiating the leading strand directly and targets CMG to do so.</p><p>Cellular studies indicate that nucleosomes are involved in determining Okazaki fragment size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>), but data in this report show that short Okazaki fragments of the size observed in vivo do not require nucleosomes. However, nucleosomes may still be needed for greater precision in Okazaki fragment length. We also demonstrate that Pol ε forms a stable and isolable complex with CMG, which stands in contrast to the inability to isolate Pol ε in RPCs as defined by a complex that stays associated during two successive affinity columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>). Presumably, the time involved in preparing RPC through two columns is sufficiently long for the CMGE complex to dissociate. However, some Pol ε can be recovered when isolated in a single-step pull down with epitope tagged CMG from cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sengupta et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Reconstitution of cellular replisomes in vitro should provide a framework to explore the effects of other proteins that move with forks and of post-translational modifications that control eukaryotic forks in response to the cell cycle and DNA checkpoint mechanisms. Reconstituted systems should also enable detailed study of factors that maintain the epigenetic state of a cell during replication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and buffers</title><p>Radioactive nucleotides were from Perkin Elmer.

Both of these enzymes cut outside of their recognition sequences, and their recognition sequences are excluded from the template.</p><p>CGGTATTCTAACCACATTAATCTACACCTCTCACACACTACTCATATCATCTTCCAAAACCCACCTTTAAAAAACCCTTTATCCACACTCATCACCATTTCACCAACCTTTTTCTTAATTCTACACAAATCCAATTAACCTATCTCCAATTTTAACTCCATCACCTCTTATATTAACCCACCTACTACTCCAACAATACCCTATCAAATCTACTTCTATCTCAAAACTATCACCTACTCCTTCCATCATAATCCACTCTTATCAATTAAACAATTATCCTTCTTTCCCACCATCACTCACCATCTTTTCTTAACACCCTTAACATTTCCTTTTATAAAACACTTCCAATCCTATTTTCTCACTATCCCACCCACCATAAAAACTATCTCACCCTAACTCAACCCTTTCCCTCTCACCAACACTCCTTTATCACACACACTTTACCACACAAATCCCTCCATCATACACCTTTACCCTCAAATCCTAAACCACCTAACTATTCCACACAATATATCTACAAAAATTTACTTTTCCACATCTCCAACCCTTCCAACACCTTAATCCCAAACCTTAACTAACCTCTCTTTAATACTTCCTCCCATTCCCACCACATACACCAAATTATCTTCAACTCAAAAACCTAAACTCTCCTTTTTATTCCCTATAAAAACTCTTAACCCTCCAATATACAACTCTAACTAACTTCATTATCAACCAATCTTCCTCTACTTCCTCATCTTATAATTTATCCATTCAAAATAACCTACCTACCACCTCTCCTCTTCACTTCCTACCCTAAAATCACCACCTTATCCCTAATTTACCTCTTTCAACTTTCCTTAACCCAACTTCTCAATCCTACTTCACTTACTTCTTATAAAACCATCATTATCACACTACACATTACTCTATCTATCCAATCATCACCTTCTACAATCCAAACTATCCCACTACCCTCTCATTCTACCTTTTCATCTATCTCAAACTATCCACCAATCCATACCTCAAACTTTAACCACCCACTCCAAATCTACAACATAAAATTAACCTATCACATTCCAAACTAATCACCCTAACCCTAACACCCTTTTATCCTCACCAAAATTACCATTTTCCTCTTTACTCATAAACAAACATTCTCACCCATTTATAAAACACTTAATACCCACTTAATTCACTTCCTTTTTCTACCTCACCATCATCAACTCCTAATATCAACAACCCAAAATCACCACCTATATCCTCATCTCCTATATAAAAAACTTCACATCTCAACCTCAAACCACCTATTCCACTTAATCCCAATCAACCTATCAACTCTACAACCTACTCTTCAAATACATCTCCTATCACTTTCCCACCTCCTTCAATCAATTATAACTTTATCACCTAAACATTCTAAAATCTCCTATCCACTACATCACATAAACCTAAACCTACTACCAACCTACCATTATCCTTATCAAACATCATCAATTCCATCTTTCTTTATACCCTCTCCATATCTCTCTCATTAAAAAAACCAAAATCTAACAACTTCTTATTTCTAATCAAAAAAACAATCAACCTAACTCATAAAATCTTCACCTTAAAATTCCTTTACATTTAACAAATCCACTCTCCCTATCTTTTTCATATCAAACTTATCTAAACCACTATCCTCATTTATCCTAATACTCCATATACAACACCAAATTTCTTATATCTCATCTAAAATCCTCCACCAATATAAACTCCTCTTTACCATTTCCACTCAACACACCAAATCTTATTATTCCATCAAATCTAATCCATTACCATCATCAACCCTAATAAACCTACTTCCCAACTTTTATCTCTCCACTACCACACCAAAAATTAACCTCCTCTAAAAACTATCATTCCCTTTACCTCTTCCACATTCCACCTATAACTCCTCATCTTAAAACCAATCAACACCAAACAACTATCTCACCATATTTCCTCTCCAAACCAACAAATTAACAATCCTACCCACTCCAACCTCCACATTACTAATAACTAAACTTACCTTACCTACCACACCCTATCAACCATATTTAAAAAATTACTTATTCACTAACTAAAACATCACCCACAAACTTAAATCATCACCTCCTCTTTTCCACCTTATTCACCAACCCAATCTATCTATCTCACCTATACCTTTCCCTAATATCTTTTACTAACCCTATAAATACCACAATTCTAAAAAACCCATACTTATCTCACACATCACTTTATACTTCACTCTTAAAATACCCTCCAATATATATTACAACCCAAAAATATCTCCCTTCTATCTCCTACACACAAATTATACCACTTTTAAACCACTCCTCATCTCTAACCCAACCCTCTACAATTCCATACATCTCTACTATCAACATCACTCCTTCTTTTCCACTCTTCTCTCCACATCTTTATTAAACATCTCCTCCTCATTTTCACATAACTATTTACTAAATAAATTTACCTAAACTACATTTATTAAAACCCTACAACATACTCCTTATTCTCCTACCTACCATTCTCTAATCTCTTTACATTCTACTACTTTCCTACCTACTATCTCAATAAATTCACTTTCCTTTCACCACACACCAACACACCTTCCTCCAAATTCTTTATATCTCCTTCTCCTAACCAAATTCCTCACTAATAACATCTTACCTCCCTACCTTTTTCCTTCTACCCTCCACCATTTCCCAACCTCATACTCAATAATCAATTTACCCTCCCACAACATAACTCTATTAACACCCATTTTCTATCCATCAACTTCCTATTACTTAAATTATCTTTTAAACCAATAAAACTCCACCTCAACCACCCACCTCTCTCTTTCAATCCAATTTCAATCTTTCCAACCATTCTATCTACCCTAAACTATTAACTATCTATCTCACCCACAATCCCTCCTACAATTCACAACAACATTCCACCACTTCACTTTATCTTCACCTCCAAACTTATTCCTTCCCATTATCACCTTCTCCAAAACCCACAAACATCTAACTCTCATCTCTCAACACTTTCTACCCATTCTCTCTAACAAAATTCCCTTACTCTTTATTCACAAAACCACTAAAATCACCACAACAACCCAACAAAAACAAAATCCTCACTTACCTATACTCAATAAATCCTTCAACTCATTATTCTATTTCTAACCCTAAATCAAAACTCCCATATCTACCATTCTTTCCACTCAATTAAATCCCACCAACCCTTATTTTCCTCCAATAACTTAACC.</p><p>The synthetic 3.2 kb DNA was cut from the plasmid using BsaI-HF and BtsCI and purified from low-melting agarose gel. 35 pmol of the 3.2 kb linear DNA template was ligated to a fivefold excess of forked junction on the BsaI end and to a 10-fold molar excess of a short blocking duplex on the BtsCI end. To make the forked junction, 1050 pmol 1T oligonucleotide was annealed to 175 pmol 160mer oligonucleotide, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>). The 160mer is the leading strand template and contains a 3′ biotin and three 3′ terminal thiophosphate linkages, to protect against nucleases. The synthetic fork contains a 5′-phosphorylated-ACCG overhang in the duplex region that ligates to the BsaI end of the 3.2 kb nucleotide-biased duplex. To protect the BtsCI end of the 3.2 kb duplex from excision and fill-in by the proofreading exonucleases of Pols δ and ε, a short protecting duplex was ligated to the BtsCI end of the forked junction. The blocking duplex was formed upon annealing 350 pmol 5′-tggttagtatagcaagtagagg-3′ and 2100 pmol tctacttgctatactaaccat3′-′3-dT. After ligation, this results in a 3.2 kb duplex with two 5′ terminal nucleotides at one end, to resist digestion by 3′–5′ exonuclease inherent in the DNA polymerases. Both the blocking duplex and the synthetic forked junction were present in the ligation reaction. Ligation was for 18 hr at 15°C with T4 DNA ligase. Excess non-ligated oligonucleotides were removed by gel filtration over a 20 ml bed volume of Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.44. Peak fractions containing the nucleotide-biased linear forked DNA were pooled and stored at −20°C. When the substrate was primed, a DNA oligonucleotide was annealed to the leading strand template, DNA 37mer (C2) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Leading/lagging strand replication assays</title><p>Replication assays contained 1.5 nM linear forked DNA, 24 nM CMG, 400 nM RPA (unless noted otherwise), 20 nM PCNA (unless noted otherwise), 6 nM RFC (unless noted otherwise), and Pol α, Pol ε, and Pol δ as indicated in the figure legends, in 25 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.5, 10 mM Mg-acetate, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 40 μg/ml BSA, 0.1 mM AMP–PNP, 5 mM ATP, 200 μM each rCTP, rUTP, rGTP, 60 μM of each unlabeled dNTP, and 20 μM of the labeled dNTP. Reactions were staged as follows. CMG was added first and pre-incubated with the DNA and 0.1 mM AMP-PNP for 10 min at 30°C, then the noted polymerases together with the RFC and PCNA (where indicated) were added, along with dATP, dCTP for an additional 2 min. Replication was then initiated upon the addition of a solution containing the RPA, ATP, dTTP, and dGTP. It is important to note that for leading strand replication reactions, we used 20 μΜ dCTP and 10 μCi <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP, while for lagging strand replications, we used 20 μM dGTP and 10 μCi <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP. Exceptions to this protocol are noted in the figure legends. Timed aliquots were removed and quenched upon adding SDS and EDTA to final concentrations of 0.5% and 20 mM, respectively. Quenched reactions were analyzed in 0.7% or 2% alkaline agarose gels and imaged in a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE/Molecular Dynamics, Berkeley, CA).</p><p>In order to compare total DNA synthesis rates on leading and lagging strand, we performed standard replication reactions containing all three DNA polymerases at 10 nM, CMG (30 nM), RFC (10 nM), PCNA (20 nM), and RPA (400 nM) in presence of 1 mM ATP, rNTPs (C,G,U at 100 μM), and 30 μM dNTPs; reactions were divided, and either <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP (leading) or <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP (lagging) was added. Timed reactions were stopped with an equal volume of 2× STOP solution (40 mM EDTA and 1% SDS) and spotted on DE81 filter papers, then analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Tri-Carb 2910 TR). Separately, we performed control replication reactions using ϕX174 ssDNA coated with RPA, containing a known amount of Gs and Cs, confirm that <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP and <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP are equally incorporated by each of the DNA polymerases in our experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Restriction enzyme analysis of Okazaki fragment distribution</title><p>Three replication reactions were performed as described above with the following differences. The first reaction used 1.5 nM unprimed forked DNA and 10 nM Pol α with 20 μM dGTP as well as 10 μCi <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP to label the lagging strand; the second reaction utilized 1.5 nM unprimed forked DNA and 10 nM each Pol ε and Pol α along with 20 μM dGTP and 10 μCi <sup>32</sup>P-dGTP to label the lagging strand, and the third reaction contained DNA-primed forked DNA and 1 U of ϕ29 DNA polymerase along with 20 μM dCTP and 10 μCi <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP to label the leading strand. Each reaction was quenched upon heating to 65°C for 10 min to inactivate the CMG and polymerases. Then, reactions were divided into three tubes, one was untreated, the second was treated with EarI, and the third was treated with PsiI, adjusting the reaction buffer for each enzyme with the commercial provided buffer. Reactions were analyzed in a 2% native agarose gel followed by autoradiography in a Typhoon 9400 PhosphorImager (GE/Molecular Dynamics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Primed ssDNA reactions</title><p>Reactions contained 1.5 nM ϕX174 circular ssDNA (as circles) primed with a DNA 30-mer and pre-incubated for 10 min with 420 nM RPA (as heterotrimer) in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mM potassium glutamate, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 40 μg/ml BSA, 8 mM MgOAc, 0.5 mm ATP, 5% glycerol, and 60 μM, each of dGTP and dATP. Reactions also contained the indicated amounts of RFC, PCNA, and Pol α and were pre-incubated for 5 min at 30°C. DNA synthesis was initiated by adding 15 μl of 60 μM dCTP, 20 μM dTTP, 15 μCi of (α-<sup>32</sup>P) dTTP and incubated at 30°C. At the times indicated, 25-μl aliquots were removed and quenched by addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS/40 mm EDTA. Products were analyzed in 0.7% alkaline agarose gels.
