Because mis-regulation of DEPTOR, an endogenous mTORC1 inhibitor, is associated with some cancers, we reconstituted mTORC1 with DEPTOR to understand its function. We find that DEPTOR is a unique <italic>partial</italic> mTORC1 inhibitor that may have evolved to preserve feedback inhibition of PI3K. Counterintuitively, mTORC1 activated by RHEB or oncogenic mutation is much more potently inhibited by DEPTOR. Although DEPTOR partially inhibits mTORC1, mTORC1 prevents this inhibition by phosphorylating DEPTOR, a mutual antagonism that requires no exogenous factors. Structural analyses of the mTORC1/DEPTOR complex showed DEPTOR’s PDZ domain interacting with the mTOR FAT region, and the unstructured linker preceding the PDZ binding to the mTOR FRB domain. The linker and PDZ form the minimal inhibitory unit, but the N-terminal tandem DEP domains also significantly contribute to inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>DEPTOR</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>partial inhibition</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105184308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Roger L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14801/A21211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Roger L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 603–2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anandapadamanaban</surname><given-names>Madhanagopal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012623</institution-id><institution>FEBS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anandapadamanaban</surname><given-names>Madhanagopal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inhibitory protein DEPTOR make two widely separated interactions with mTOR that are both necessary for its unique partial mTOR inhibition, and DEPTOR is a more potent inhibitor of mutation- or RHEB-activated mTORC1 than basal mTORC1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a large (~1 MDa) multiprotein complex consisting of two copies of three subunits: the evolutionary conserved Serine/Threonine protein kinase mTOR (a member of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinases superfamily of protein kinases, PIKKs), RAPTOR and mLST8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sabatini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sabers et al., 1995</xref>). mTORC1 senses and integrates inputs originating from nutrients, growth factor signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and cellular energy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jewell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). The net response of mTORC1 to such stimuli is to promote cell growth, by activating protein translation, ribosome biogenesis, lipid and nucleic acid biosynthesis and inhibiting autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunlop and Tee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Valvezan and Manning, 2019</xref>). The effect of mTORC1 on protein synthesis is primarily due to its phosphorylation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eIF-4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gingras et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holz and Blenis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). Both substrates interact with the mTORC1 complex through their general TOR signaling (TOS) motif that binds the RAPTOR subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schalm and Blenis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schalm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schalm et al., 2005</xref>), as well as by forming a second interaction with the FRB helical insertion within the N-lobe of the mTOR kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). A more elaborate mode of mTORC1 substrate interaction has been suggested for the transcription factor TFEB, which lacks a TOS motif, but instead binds an active Rag heterodimer that can form a complex with RAPTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martina and Puertollano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Napolitano et al., 2020</xref>). It has been proposed that the substrates’ multipartite mode of recognition is crucial for substrate specificity for mTORC1 versus mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baretić and Williams, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its three core components, mTORC1 associates with various subunits that regulate mTORC1 activity or direct its cellular localization: nutrients such as amino acids promote the association of RAPTOR with heterodimeric Rag GTPases, which, along with the Ragulator complex, recruit mTORC1 to lysosomal surfaces. There, the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) in its GTP-bound state activates mTORC1 via direct interaction with the mTOR catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anandapadamanaban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogala et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Two endogenous negative regulators of mTORC1 activity have been identified to date: DEPTOR (DEP-domain containing mTOR-interacting protein), which also inhibits mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>), and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sancak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). PRAS40 interacts with RAPTOR via a TOS-binding motif in a similar fashion as the substrates 4EBP1 and S6K1, resulting in a specificity for mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). PRAS40 inhibition is lost upon its insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation, which decreases its affinity for mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sancak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thedieck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haar et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interactions of DEPTOR with the mTOR complexes are less clear. DEPTOR is a 46 kDa protein that consists of three distinct and highly conserved regions (from N- to C-terminus): two tandem DEP domains (a DEPt), an unstructured linker of ~100 residues (residues 228–323, which we have named long-linker) and a C-terminal PDZ domain. The long-linker contains multiple serine phosphorylation sites as well as a consensus βTrCP1-binding site, SSGYFS (referred to as the DEPTOR phosphodegron). Previously, it was suggested that DEPTOR inhibits mTOR function in vivo via an interaction of its PDZ domain with mTOR FAT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). However, the nature of this interaction remained elusive.</p><p>Under starvation conditions, DEPTOR binds to mTOR and inhibits its kinase activity, whereas under nutrient replete conditions mTOR-dependent phosphorylation at its degron site marks DEPTOR for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Two models of DEPTOR-specific mTORC1 regulation were proposed: one suggesting that mTORC1 activation is due to DEPTOR displacement by the phospholipase D1 (PLD1) product phosphatidic acid (PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>) and another linking mTORC1 inhibition to deubiquitylation of DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Recent reports describe DEPTOR as a negative regulator of mTOR function rather than an inhibitor, as residual mTOR activity is observed in the presence of DEPTOR, in vivo, dampening but not eliminating S6K1 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laplante et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2014</xref>). As the mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in cancer, levels of DEPTOR are low in most tumours. Exceptions are a subset of multiple myeloma (MM), thyroid carcinoma, and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2012a</xref>), where overexpression of DEPTOR eliminates feedback inhibition downstream of mTORC1, resulting in hyperactivation of PI3K/mTORC2/Akt signaling and thereby stimulating cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). RNAi-silencing of overexpressed DEPTOR in a set of MM cells resulted in stalling cell growth and triggering apoptosis, suggesting DEPTOR regulation could be a viable therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, small molecule inhibitors that were recently reported to prevent the formation of an mTOR/DEPTOR complex showed selective cytotoxicity against MM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vega et al., 2019</xref>). To assist future inhibitor design, we determined the structural and kinetic basis for DEPTOR regulation of mTORC1. The cryo-EM reconstruction of mTORC1 in complex with DEPTOR at 4.3 Å resolution reveals a bipartite binding mechanism of DEPTOR to mTORC1. Specifically, DEPTOR’s long-linker and PDZ domain interact with the FRB and FAT domains of mTOR, respectively, and these interactions were validated with NMR and HDX-MS. Kinetic analysis narrowed down DEPTOR’s minimal inhibitory unit to the long-linker-PDZ region, revealing that, in contrast to previous cellular studies, the PDZ domain alone is not sufficient for mTORC1 inhibition, and showed that DEPTOR is a unique partial inhibitor. Remarkably, the DEPTOR/mTORC1 complex possesses kinase activity, so that maximal mTORC1 inhibition by DEPTOR leaves the complex with about ~50% residual activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DEPTOR is a partial inhibitor of mTORC1 in vitro, independent of substrate identity</title><p>To characterize the mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition by DEPTOR, we carried out reconstituted inhibition assays with purified recombinant mTORC1, DEPTOR and two major mTORC1 substrates, 4EBP1 (wild-type) and S6K1 (GST-tagged S6K1<sup>367-404</sup> polypeptide).

Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 by DEPTOR for both substrates appeared to be partial, with mTORC1 having about 50% residual activity at even the highest concentrations of DEPTOR that could be achieved. This residual activity could also be detected using Phos-tag gels, that efficiently separate phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>.B).

Consequently, a partial inhibitor cannot bind in a manner that completely occludes substrate binding. To test whether DEPTOR influences substrate binding, we measured the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for 4EBP1 in the presence and absence of DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previously, two distinct <italic>K</italic><sub>M,4EBP1</sub> have been detected, which represent independent binding at the TOS motif binding site on the RAPTOR subunit (<italic>K</italic><sub>M1</sub> = 1.8 µM) and at the FRB-binding site on the mTOR subunit (<italic>K</italic><sub>M2</sub> = 585 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Increasing concentrations of DEPTOR had no apparent effect on the <italic>K</italic><sub>M,4EBP1</sub> of the TOS motif binding site (<italic>K</italic><sub>M1</sub>), suggesting that DEPTOR is not able to compete with 4EBP1 at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The affinities for the FRB binding were too low to get a reliable kinetic result. Nevertheless, our structural analyses (described below) imply a very similar binding site at the FRB domain for the DEPTOR long-linker and for the 4EBP1/S6K1 substrates, suggesting a partially competitive binding mechanism for this site. The mTORC1 inhibitor PRAS40, which shares the TOS-binding site with 4EBP1, shows full inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation under our assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). DEPTOR’s inability to compete at the TOS-motif binding site suggested that inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation may be partial because of unhindered binding of 4EBP1 at the high affinity TOS site located on RAPTOR. To examine this proposition, we employed a TOS-less 4EBP1 mutant as a substrate. DEPTOR seemed to compete more effectively with this mutant, since the IC<sub>50</sub> was twofold lower with this modified substrate, however, the residual activity remained at about 50% at the maximum DEPTOR concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As 4EBP1 binding has been reported to involve additional sites, like the RAIP motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beugnet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eguchi et al., 2006</xref>), we next used a simpler substrate, consisting of a short S6K1 peptide that is expected to exclusively bind to the FRB site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Residual activity in the presence of DEPTOR was also observed with this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on these observations, we concluded that partial inhibition by DEPTOR is an intrinsic property of DEPTOR, which takes place independently of substrate identity and substrate binding mode.</p><p>To test the possibility that the residual activity is caused by half-site reactivity in mTORC1 via allosteric communication across the dimer interface, we tested DEPTOR inhibition of a monomeric form of mTOR (the mTOR<sup>ΔN</sup>-mLST8 complex, which lacks the N-terminal 1375 residues of mTOR and the RAPTOR subunit). The IC<sub>50</sub> for the monomeric mTOR<sup>ΔN</sup>-mLST8 was 0.4 µM, and the residual activity 33% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since DEPTOR could still not fully inhibit this monomeric mTOR, we conclude that DEPTOR’s residual activity was not caused by effects related to the dimeric nature of mTORC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The minimal inhibitory unit of DEPTOR is the long-linker-PDZ</title><p>To determine DEPTOR’s mechanism of inhibition of mTORC1 in more detail, DEPTOR deletion variants as well as a 13 S/T→A mutant with most of the phosphorylation sites in DEPTOR removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>) were designed to identify the regions that are crucial for inhibition and the role of DEPTOR phosphorylation in the mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It was reported that DEPTOR’s PDZ domain alone (residues 324–409) was sufficient to inhibit mTOR when transiently overexpressed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). However, our in vitro assay showed no measurable inhibition by the PDZ domain alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Furthermore, there was no inhibition by constructs of PDZ preceded by a short section of the linker (short-linker, described below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, we even observe a slight, but reproducible activation of mTORC1 by these PDZ constructs. In contrast, a DEPTOR construct that includes the entire long-linker region preceding the PDZ <italic>in addition to</italic> the PDZ domain comprises the minimal inhibitory unit. However, the increased IC<sub>50</sub> for the linker-PDZ construct compared with full-length DEPTOR suggests that the N-terminal tandem DEP domain region (DEPt) contributes to inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). A mechanism for the inhibitory role of DEPt is suggested by the structural work reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>. Overexpression of the DEPTOR PDZ domain alone may have an indirect effect on mTOR signaling in cells. Recently, an interaction of DEPTOR PDZ with the C-terminal portion of pREX2, a PTEN inhibiting protein that includes domains structurally related to DEPTOR, has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yen et al., 2012</xref>).

As crystallization of the 324–409 construct remained unsuccessful, the structure of the DEPTOR PDZ domain was determined using NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, instead of calculating a formal solution structure of the PDZ domain, NMR restraint-based models were created using the ROSETTA software suite. The assigned backbone chemical shifts, which are uniquely sensitive to the secondary structure in which each residue resides, were employed to more accurately select fragments of homologous proteins using the POMONA webserver. These fragments then were used to calculate the PDZ model using CS-RosettaCM that combines both chemical shifts (CS) and comparative modeling (CM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen and Bax, 2015</xref>). An ensemble of structures was then further refined using a limited set of NOE distance restraints, resulting in a homology model that also satisfies solution state parameters that we observed. This process is advantageous as it creates data driven models significantly faster than traditional NMR structure calculation techniques. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> represents an ensemble of the 10 lowest energy structures calculated using this methodology, with the lowest energy model used in the final cryo-EM structure refinement. The PDZ domain binds to three consecutive helices (fα16, fα17, fα18, residues 1525–1580), in the middle of the C-shaped FAT domain at a corkscrew junction between two helical solenoids (previously referred to as TRD2 and TRD3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The key interactions in this surface are formed by E1530, E1531, C1534, M1535, R1538, and Q1562 on the mTORC1 FAT domain, and residues 336–342 and 354–362 on the DEPTOR PDZ domain.</p><p>We identified a second density adjacent to the mTOR FRB domain, covering the lipophilic patch formed by the FRB domain residues Y2038, F2038, Y2105, and F2108 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We modeled the density as three turns of an α-helix, but the local resolution is insufficient to assign a sequence. It is plausible that this density represents part of the DEPTOR long-linker preceding the PDZ domain, since our kinetic results identified the long-linker-PDZ as the minimal region of DEPTOR required for mTORC1 inhibition. However, we also see density at the TOS and RAIP-binding sites on RAPTOR, raising the possibility that an unidentified substrate might be associated with the mTORC1, although no substrate was included in the sample preparation. To verify the interaction of DEPTOR with the FRB, we carried out a series of experiments described below. Neither the long-linker nor the PDZ interactions alone are sufficient for the inhibition by DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Our structure suggests a bipartite DEPTOR binding mode, with one interaction involving the FRB, similar to the mTORC1 substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1, while the other interaction involves the DEPTOR PDZ domain binding to mTORC1’s FAT domain and is unique to DEPTOR. The PDZ binding site is remote from the active site and serves as an anchor moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), similarly to the TOS motif of the substrates such as 4EBP1 that anchor to the TOS-binding site on the RAPTOR subunit. We cannot discern any density spanning the two DEPTOR binding sites, and HDX-MS suggests that the long-linker is unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, an NMR-based secondary structure analysis of the isolated DEPTOR long-linker chemical shifts revealed no regions of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consequently, it is impossible to say whether DEPTOR spans the two mTOR binding sites on one molecule, on different mTOR subunits in the dimer or a combination of both of these modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>When the structures of free mTORC1 (PDB 6BCX), RHEB-bound mTORC1 (PDB 6BCU) and mTORC1 bound to DEPTOR are aligned locally on the C-lobe of the kinase domain, it is clear that the ATP-binding sites of the free mTORC1 and DEPTOR-bound mTORC1 are very similar and both are distinct from the RHEB-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Free mTORC1 is present in a continuum of conformations, ranging from an open conformation to a closed conformation that are both very different than the RHEB-bound, activated conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). It may be that the predominant conformation captured by cryo-EM for free mTORC1 corresponds to an inhibited conformation that is only capable of slowly turning over substrate and this same conformation is the one predominately bound to DEPTOR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DEPTOR PDZ domain binds to mTORC1 in a non-canonical manner</title><p>Typically, PDZ domains bind their targets via the C-terminal tail of the target protein binding in the PDZ αB/βB binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ernst et al., 2014</xref>). The cryo-EM density for the DEPTOR PDZ domain bound to mTOR suggests that binding occurs in a non-canonical fashion. The PDZ domain binds to helices in the mTOR FAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This unique type of interaction was further examined by an NMR-binding experiment using the non-labeled 1 MDa mTORC1 as a binding partner for the isolated <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N DEPTOR PDZ domain. Large protein complexes like mTORC1 would generally severely impair NMR studies due to increased linewidth caused by slower tumbling. The same would apply for any labeled interactor that binds tightly to the complex and shows a slow dissociation rate. Nonetheless, in case of a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> in the range of 0.1 µM to 1 mM and an excess of the interactor in the NMR experiment, the effects of binding can be imprinted onto the dissociated small interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maurer et al., 2004</xref>). In this case, binding effects on the small interactor can be observed in the bulk unbound and labeled protein. The DEPTOR PDZ/mTORC1 interaction showed ideal properties for this experiment and DEPTOR PDZ binding to mTORC1 could be successfully detected from the pool of free PDZ domain. Based on the line broadening, DEPTOR PDZ residues 338–342 and 358–362 form the interface with mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the region 338–342 involves the canonical binding residues, the region 358–362 is part of the PDZ βC/αA structural element and therefore outside the canonical αB/βB binding groove.

As it has been previously reported that DEPTOR’s long-linker is phosphorylated in an mTOR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>), we proposed that a region in the DEPTOR long-linker binds to the FRB.

The chemical shift perturbation of the DEPTOR long-linker (residues 228–323) bound to FRB vs. DEPTOR long-linker alone in <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY NMR experiments revealed four patches, each of five residues in the long-linker that were altered by FRB binding, residues 228–232, 244–249, 261–264, and 280–285 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, the regions of increased protection observed in full-length DEPTOR in the presence of the FRB in an HDX-MS experiment were in good agreement with the NMR result, as DEPTOR peptides 230–248, 270–288 and 276–296 were protected from solvent exchange in the presence of the FRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, both experiments suggested that there was not one unique FRB-binding motif in the long-linker, but multiple regions capable of interacting. This is not surprising, as it has previously been shown for the mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1 that the FRB-interacting region varies based on the substrate’s individual phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). This most likely also applies to DEPTOR, and many mTOR-dependent phosphorylation sites have previously been reported in DEPTOR’s long-linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). In the HDX-MS experiment, there is also protection in the DEPTOR N-terminal region (peptide 2–32 protected) that includes part of the DEPt. Because the linker-PDZ is sufficient for the inhibition of mTORC1, only this region was included in our NMR-based study of the interaction of DEPTOR with the FRB. Interestingly, a structure of the tandem DEP domains that was recently reported, which included a small segment (residues 228–235) of the long linker, showed that this segment forms an α-helix that interacts with the N-terminus of the DEP domain (residues 21–32), in a pocket between the two DEP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weng et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that the protection that we see in the N-terminal region of DEPTOR upon binding the FRB is due to an influence of the FRB on the rigidity of the long-linker, thereby stabilizing the interaction between the linker and the tandem DEP domain region.</p><p>All FRB interacting areas in the DEPTOR linker are within 45 residues of the PDZ domain, which could cover a distance of about 160 Å, if in an extended conformation. As most of the linker showed no indication of secondary structure elements, this length should be sufficient for a bipartite mTORC1 binding interaction involving the DEPTOR PDZ and the long-linker binding either a single mTOR subunit or across the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DEPTOR PDZ forms an interaction with the long-linker that controls domain stability and creates a unique surface on PDZ</title><p>Secondary chemical shift analysis of the isolated DEPTOR long-linker suggested that the long-linker has no residual secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the linker unexpectedly contributes significantly to the stability of the PDZ domain by interacting along the PDZ surface, following a patch of mostly uncharged and hydrophobic residues. This interaction could be detected due to a chemical shift perturbation for some PDZ domain residues in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY spectrum for a construct consisting of the long-linker PDZ when compared to the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY spectrum of the PDZ domain alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). By N-terminal deletion analysis of the long-linker-PDZ, we identified a small portion of the linker that is sufficient to stabilize the PDZ domain: a construct consisting of residues 305–409 (here referred to as short-linker PDZ) showed an increased melting temperature by about 10°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, NMR <sup>15</sup>N backbone relaxation experiments including T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and <sup>15</sup>N{1H} heteronuclear NOE analyses showed that the PDZ alone (PDZ-only, residues 324–409) has a high flexibility in the N-terminal region, encompassing the first β strand and the subsequent loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that the short-linker region significantly adds to the overall stability of the PDZ domain, but the short-linker-PDZ is not an mTORC1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>DEPTOR inhibits activated mTORC1 more strongly than basal mTORC1</title><p>Our structural analysis showed that DEPTOR PDZ binds close to a region on the mTOR FAT domain that undergoes a major conformational change induced by the RHEB-GTP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). This suggested that DEPTOR inhibition could be altered as a result of activation. To determine the effect of DEPTOR on activated mTORC1 in our reconstituted system, we tested DEPTOR inhibition of RHEB-GTP- or mutation-activated mTORC1. Surprisingly, the IC<sub>50</sub> for DEPTOR inhibition decreased about 400-fold in the presence of RHEB-GTP compared to mTORC1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting tighter binding of DEPTOR to the activated mTORC1. A similar reduction in DEPTOR IC<sub>50</sub> was observed for the cancer-associated mTOR mutant A1459P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, the EC<sub>50</sub> for RHEB-GTP activating wild-type mTORC1 was not significantly affected by the presence of DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Cancer-associated mutations clustering around C1483 were shown to involve structure-stabilizing residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). These mutations significantly lower the activation energy for the transition from ground state to the RHEB-GTP-bound activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The cancer-associated mutant A1459P is in the middle of a helix fα12 at the major intra-FAT hinge, and our cryo-EM structure of the A1459P mutant bound to DEPTOR (global resolution 4.7 Å) shows this helix becomes disordered (residues 1457–1470) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This disorder likely increases plasticity of the intra-FAT hinge, thereby improving DEPTOR binding. The structure of mutant mTORC1 bound to DEPTOR reveals a widening of the cleft between the mTOR N-heat and the PDZ-bound FAT domain, relative to this cleft in the structure of DEPTOR bound to wild-type mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This cleft widening might enable easier access for DEPTOR PDZ to bind to the FAT domain. Consistent with this proposal, we observe fast on/off kinetics for PDZ binding to the mTORC1 mutant A1459P with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.6 µM determined by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). For the wild-type mTORC1, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> is increased ten-fold (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 7 µM), and we observe slow on/off kinetics, which suggests that there is a rate-limiting conformational change within wild-type mTOR to facilitate binding of PDZ. Furthermore, a multibody refinement of the mTORC1/DEPTOR cryo-EM data set indicates that one of the major motions in the wild-type mTORC1/ DEPTOR complex lies in the N-heat domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Structurally, the interaction of DEPTOR PDZ with the FAT domain does not seem to be significantly altered between mutant and wild-type mTORC1.

In our kinetic analysis of the effect of DEPTOR on phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBP1 above, we used initial rates of mTORC1 before significant substrate depletion. However, under these conditions, there is also very little phosphorylated DEPTOR produced. To investigate whether mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of DEPTOR alters DEPTOR inhibition, we extensively phosphorylated DEPTOR with the activated mTORC1 mutant A1459P and assayed mTORC1 inhibition by this pre-phosphorylated DEPTOR. We found almost no inhibition of mTORC1 with pre-phosphorylated DEPTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This is consistent with results in cells showing that sustained serum stimulation results in less epitope-tagged, overexpressed wild-type DEPTOR being co-immunoprecipitated with RAPTOR compared with the 13 S/T→A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). Although previous results also have shown that DEPTOR phosphorylation leads to increased ubiquitylation by the F box protein βTrCP and subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>), our reconstituted system with no degradation machinery, formally establishes that phosphorylation of DEPTOR by mTORC1 results in decreased association of DEPTOR with mTORC1. This supports the previously-proposed mechanism of mTORC1 self-regulation of its inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). It suggests that the degradation that is observed in cells happens subsequent to loss of inhibition of mTORC1 by DEPTOR.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>mTORC1 directly controls the function of its negative regulators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DEPTOR pre-phosphorylated by activated mTORC1 (phospho-DEPTOR) shows no inhibition of mTORC1 activity.

(<bold>B</bold>) Negative feedback to PI3K (dashed lines) controls the activity of the two mTORC1 inhibitors PRAS40 and DEPTOR. If mTORC1 inhibition is high, PI3K is activated due to a loss of the negative feedback. Increased p-AKT results in decreased PRAS40 inhibition, with increased mTORC1 activity, which in turn reduces DEPTOR inhibition. mTORC1 activity alone is sufficient to reduce DEPTOR inhibition, without the necessity of DEPTOR’s ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This increased mTORC1 activity in turn induces negative feedback to PI3K and prevents an overactivation of this pathway, keeping activities balanced. (<bold>C</bold>) A model for DEPTOR interaction with mTORC1. Taken together, our work and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref> suggest that there are two possible modes of DEPTOR bipartite binding, with both modes having the PDZ domain bound to the PDZ-binding site, while the second interaction involves either: (1) the DEPTOR linker binding to the FRB (our work here) or (2) the DEPt binding to the DEPt binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>). The observed inhibition is a sum of the two modes. For the basal mTORC1, bipartite interaction with mTOR via linker and PDZ might predominate. For the RHEB-bound mTORC1, DEPt could play a predominant inhibitory role by preventing allosteric changes necessary for activation. Having two modes of inhibition ensures that the DEPTOR effectively inhibits both mTORC1 (inhibition with both modes) and mTORC2 (presumably only inhibition through the DEPt-PDZ mode), since the FRB site would not be accessible in mTORC2. It is possible that there are hybrid states of the DEPTOR-bound mTORC1. For example, RHEB binding could cause the PDZ binding site to switch to its high-affinity conformation, while the DEPt maintains the active site in its basal conformation.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><label>Figure 7—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Uncropped blots.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68799-fig7-data1-v1.ai"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata2"><label>Figure 7—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Data values for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-68799-fig7-data2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68799-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our structural and functional analysis of reconstituted mTORC1 inhibition by DEPTOR revealed a unique bipartite binding mechanism, involving an interaction of the DEPTOR PDZ with the FAT domain of mTOR and the DEPTOR long-linker interaction with the FRB. We further identified the long-linker-PDZ as a minimal inhibitory unit. However, our kinetic analysis suggests that the tandem DEP domain region also has a role in inhibition, and work by Wälchli et al. concurrently published with ours suggests a mechanism for this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, DEPTOR only partially inhibits mTORC1 phosphorylation of its two major substrates 4EBP1 and S6K1, independent of the mTOR activation state, while PRAS40 fully inhibits mTOR activity under the identical assay conditions. Partial inhibition of mTORC1 by DEPTOR in cells has been noted (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caron et al., 2018</xref>). Several previous reports have suggested that DEPTOR dampens mTORC1 activation, rather than fully inhibiting it, leaving a residual mTORC1 specific phosphorylation of S6K1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laplante et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2014</xref>). However, it has not been established previously that this is due to DEPTOR’s unique property of forming an inhibitory complex with mTORC1 that is capable of turning over substrate. This residual mTORC1 activity in the presence of DEPTOR explains why cells inhibited by rapamycin or by DEPTOR overexpression show different phenotypes and why deletion of DEPTOR has a lesser activating effect on mTORC1 in cells than the loss of TCS1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caron et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show that even for purified recombinant components, partial inhibition is an intrinsic property of DEPTOR and does not require additional cellular components.</p><p>There is evidence that multiple weak interactions may be preferred in biological systems to impart greater specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scheepers et al., 2020</xref>). Multi-site substrate interactions are a hallmark of mTORC1. Substrates such as 4EBP1 and S6K1 interact with both the mTOR FRB and the RAPTOR TOS-binding site to increase the avidity of mTORC1 for its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, simultaneous interaction the RAIP and TOS motifs of 4EBP1 with RAPTOR increase the avidity of the 4EBP1 for mTORC1 and control hierarchical phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhm et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the two distinct bipartite binding mechanisms of DEPTOR vs. PRAS40 allow a more finely-tuned regulation than single binding sites could provide. DEPTOR, which shares only the FRB-binding site with the substrates, allows for residual mTOR activity, while PRAS40, which shares both the FRB- and TOS-binding sites with the substrates, results in full enzyme inhibition. An additional layer of control is that the partial inhibition arising from the allosteric inhibition by DEPTOR establishes an upper limit on mTORC1 inhibition. This partial inhibition could be key for keeping the balance in the mTOR/PI3K signaling cascade and mimicking this aspect of DEPTOR might be an objective for design and selection of small-molecule inhibitors of mTORC1. Given that the PDZ domain alone is not sufficient for mTORC1 inhibition, it is likely that the unique partial inhibition that we have demonstrated for DEPTOR is due to an additional interaction made by DEPTOR. We have shown that the linker interacts with the FRB, and <underline>Wälchli and colleagues</underline> have shown that the DEPt also interacts with mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>). The role of the PDZ interaction with mTOR is to synergise with these interactions to increase affinity of the DEPTOR for mTORC1. We have shown that the DEPTOR linker interacts with a region on the FRB that partially overlaps with the FRB-binding regions of substrates 4EBP1 and S6K1 as well as the inhibitor PRAS40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The structure of a peptide from S6K1 bound to the FRB shows a much smaller contact with the FRB than the five helical turns from PRAS40 that were observed binding to the FRB. The density that we observe for DEPTOR bound to the FRB is more extensive than the S6K1 interaction, but less extensive (modelled as three helical turns) than what was observed previously for PRAS40. While the structures do not provide an unambiguous mechanism for partial inhibition, these differences in the extent of the interface with the FRB might contribute to DEPTOR being a partial inhibitor and PRAS40 being a full inhibitor. In addition, interactions of the DEPt with mTORC1 also may add to partial inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge in inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR pathway is the presence of numerous feedback loops that prevent therapeutic success and give rise to resistance against treatment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The use of mTOR inhibitors ultimately results in an overactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway due to accumulation of IRS1 and IGF-1R triggering a positive feedback loop which diminishes the therapeutic value of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britschgi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dibble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Reilly et al., 2006</xref>). Downregulating mTORC1 activity while maintaining negative feedback loops could be of therapeutic benefit. A more detailed understanding of mTOR function and ways of partially inhibiting some of the mTOR-dependent processes, while maintaining others might therefore be the key to render mTOR a suitable cancer drug target. DEPTOR is highly overexpressed in Multiple Myeloma cells, which protects these cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, small molecule inhibitors have been designed to interrupt the DEPTOR PDZ/mTOR interaction and have shown selective cytotoxicity against this type of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vega et al., 2019</xref>). Efforts like this could significantly benefit from the structural details of the unique non-canonical binding mode of mTORC1 and DEPTOR PDZ described in this study. The new structural insights are important steppingstones toward selectively targeting the mTOR/DEPTOR interaction by pharmacotherapy. In addition to the unique interface formed by mTOR/DEPTOR PDZ interaction, the short-linker/PDZ interface could serve as a second interface to be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, as this interaction has been uniquely observed in DEPTOR PDZ and stability of the PDZ domain is severely impaired when this interaction is lost. The unique features of the mTORC1/PDZ interaction described in this work could be essential for selectively targeting the PDZ domain, which is one of the most common scaffolding domains in the human proteome with about 270 existing versions present in 150 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The discrepancy between the previously reported observation in cells of reduced DEPTOR binding to activated cancer-associated mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grabiner et al., 2014</xref>) and our observation of a lowered DEPTOR IC<sub>50</sub> and increased affinity in our reconstituted system for activated mTORC1 might be explained by upregulated cellular processes in cancer cells. One key observation upon DEPTOR discovery was that DEPTOR inhibition quickly vanished after mTORC1 activation, several hours ahead of DEPTOR degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). Besides a reduction in DEPTOR expression levels and an increase in its degradation, there might be other factors that drive DEPTOR dissociation upon mTORC1 activation, such as a change in localization of proteins (mTORC1 translocates to lysosomes upon mitogen stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014</xref>), mTORC1 interactors that could outcompete DEPTOR binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>), or a change in the DEPTOR phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>), which could decrease mTORC1 affinity and/or increase DEPTOR affinity for other proteins. Grabiner et al. did not compare DEPTOR binding to mitogen stimulated wild-type mTOR with DEPTOR binding We have shown that a cancer-associated, activating mutation alone appears to increase DEPTOR binding﻿ by increasing the affinity of mTORC1 for the DEPTOR PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Taking into account the interactions that we see between the DEPTOR linker and the FRB, and the interactions shown between the DEPt and mTOR by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>, we propose that there are two binding modes of DEPTOR with mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In both modes, the C-terminus of DEPTOR is anchored by the PDZ/mTOR FAT interaction, while the N-terminal region is anchored by the DEPTOR linker interacting with the mTOR FRB in one mode or by the DEPt interaction with the mTOR FAT domain in the other mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wälchli et al., 2021</xref>). Both binding modes contribute to the inhibition of mTORC1 by DEPTOR.</p><p>We found that phosphorylated DEPTOR no longer inhibits mTORC1. These findings suggest that DEPTOR regulation is performed by mTORC1 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In light of mTORC1 remaining partially active in the presence of DEPTOR, it is clear that the kinase itself can release inhibition by DEPTOR. Future work will be necessary to determine the structural basis for this phosphorylation-dependent release of DEPTOR inhibition and how this release is related to the two types of bipartite interactions that DEPTOR makes with mTORC1. Our results show that an activated mTORC1 binds tighter to DEPTOR, but once it phosphorylates DEPTOR, it releases inhibition by DEPTOR. In contrast, PRAS40 regulation arises from phosphorylation by Akt. Nevertheless, despite the mechanistic differences in DEPTOR-mediated and PRAS40-mediated regulation, the negative feedback loop via p-S6K1 on the PI3K pathway introduces a balance to prevent either too much or too little inhibition by these mTORC1 regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

For unlabeled proteins, the cells were grown in 2xTY media at 37°C, induced at the OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.7 with 0.3 mM isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by 16 hr of growth at 18°C before harvest. To express proteins labeled for NMR studies, cells were grown in supplemented minimal media, as described in the ‘NMR sample preparation’ section of the detailed methods.

A description of the growth of constructs labeled for NMR can be found in the 'NMR sample preparation' section below. Two Complete EDTA-free inhibitor tablets (Roche), 500 µL of a 100 mM PEFA solution and 40 mg of lysozyme were added to the cell suspension, which was subsequently sonicated and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 35 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 3 mL equilibrated Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) for 45 min at 4°C, while rolling at 18 rpm. Sedimentation of the beads for 2 min at 600 g and the careful removal of the unbound fraction was followed by extensive washing with lysis buffer under gravity flow conditions. Bound DEPTOR was incubated with TEV protease overnight at 4°C. Cleaved DEPTOR protein was then collected and applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HEP-A buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP). After washing the column with 80 mL of HEP-A buffer, DEPTOR was eluted with a gradient using HEP-B buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 450 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP). DEPDEP was purified via a 5 mL HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) in place of the Heparin column using identical buffer composition. A final size-exclusion chromatography step on a S75 16/60 column was performed (50 mM HEPES pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP) and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DEPTOR-containing fractions were combined and concentrated to 23 mg/mL. The purified DEPTOR protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p><p>After cell lysis as described for DEPTOR (WT), the His-lipoyl-tagged DEPTOR PDZ was loaded onto a 5 mL NiNTA column and washed with 75 mL lysis buffer containing 10 mM imidazole prior to eluting the protein with 25 mL lysis buffer spiked with 300 mM imidazole. TEV cleavage was performed overnight as described above. The buffer salt concentration was diluted to 30 mM NaCl and the solution was flown through a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare) and a NiNTA column. The flowthrough was collected and concentrated before gel filtration as described for DEPTOR (WT). mTORC1 complexes were expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F cells grown in Expi293 media. A total of 1.1 mg DNA/L cells was co-transfected into cells at a density of 2.5 x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL using PEI (Polyethyleneimine ‘MAX’, MW 40,000, Polysciences, 24765, total 3 mg PEI/L cells). After 48 hr, cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Cell pellet from 2 L culture was resuspended in 200 mL of the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA), supplemented with six Complete EDTA-free protease-inhibitor tablets (Roche), 5 µL Universal nuclease (Pierce, 250 U/µL), and 400 µL of a 100 mM PEFA solution, using a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes, 100 mL, Pestle B, small clearance) on ice and sonication (2x 15 s ON at 40% amplitude). The cell lysate was spun at 15,000 rpm for 35 min in a Ti45 rotor, then filtered through Minisart 5 µm filter. Two tandem Strep-Trap HP columns (GE Healthcare 28-9075-48) were equilibrated with lysis buffer, then the filtered lysate was loaded onto the column at a flow of 2.5 mL/min. Extensive washes with lysis buffer (&gt;200 mL), with 50 mL lysis buffer supplemented with 200 mM Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and 50 mL of the TEV cleavage buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP) were performed prior to loading 0.1 mg/mL TEV protease onto the column. The cleavage reaction was performed on the column overnight. The protein was then eluted and the salt concentration was adjusted to 50 mM NaCl. The protein was then loaded onto a 5 mL HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and was eluted via a salt gradient. mTORC1-containing fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 100 kDa concentrator, spinning in 3 min intervals at 1000 rcf. Gel filtration was performed using a Superose 6 Increase (10/300) column in gel filtration buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP). mTOR complex fractions were pooled and again concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 100 kDa concentrator before freezing the protein.</p><p>Human RHEB was cloned into a pOPTG vector encoding an N-terminal GST-tag followed by a TEV cleavage site for proteolytic removal. The fusion protein was overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> C41(DE3)RIPL cells as described for DEPTOR. Cells were lysed in 30 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM TCEP, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5% glycerol, and GST-fused RHEB was purified by an affinity chromatography step on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads.

To obtain an unbiased verification of the placement of the PDZ domain we masked out all density due to mTORC1, leaving only density in the region between the FAT domain and the N-heat, and this density was about the size that we would expect for the PDZ domain. We used Chimera to do a global search of this density to find the optimal translation and orientation of the PDZ model in the density. We placed the NMR model in 100,000 initial orientations/translations and carried out a local search for each placement. The initial placements were random orientations and random translations, with the translations restricted so that the center of the PDZ model would be within 10 Å of the center of the putative PDZ density. The orientation/translation that yielded the highest correlation coefficient (0.86) corresponded to the placement that we chose when manually fitting the density. Among 100,000 trials carried out in the global search, this placement was located 4873 times. It is likely that this represents the global maximum correlation placement of the NMR model in the cryo-EM density, since the next most common placement had a lower correlation (0.82) and was reached only 874 times. The lowest correlation coefficient observed in the broad search was 0.73 (found one time in 100,000 trials).

In most cases the amide proton and nitrogen dimension were taken from the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY experiment: HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB, which were used as experimental pairs with 1024, 64 and 110 complex points in the proton nitrogen and carbon dimensions, respectively. Partial Hα, Hβ side-chain chemical shift assignments were obtained from an HBHA(CO)NH spectrum collected with 1024, 64, and 110 complex points in the proton, nitrogen and the second proton dimensions, respectively. Assignment of the carbon side-chain resonances was completed with HC(C)H- and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments (also collected with 1024, 64, and 110 points). These assignments enabled the analysis of a limited set of through space connectivities from <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C edited NOESY experiments both acquired with a mixing time of 120 ms and collected with 2048, 60/80, and 160 points in the proton, nitrogen/carbon, and second proton dimensions, respectively. All data were processed using Topspin 3.1 (Bruker, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014227">SCR_014227</ext-link>) and analyzed using NMRFAM-Sparky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2015</xref>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014228">SCR_014228</ext-link>). The backbone assignment was aided using MARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung and Zweckstetter, 2004</xref>). The assigned backbone chemical shifts were used to guide calculation of a structural model of the PDZ domain using POMONA/CS-RosettaCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen and Bax, 2015</xref>). Including a limited number of long-distance NOE restraints further refined the model; these restraints were curated so that they were from amino acids three or more residues apart as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Raman et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-10"><title>NMR dynamics characterization and binding experiments</title><p>The dynamic properties of the DEPTOR PDZ protein were investigated using standard Bruker <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>1</sup>H}NOE [heteronuclearNOE] experiments. T<sub>1</sub> relaxation times were calculated using delays of 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, and 2000 ms and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times with delays of 16.9, 33.8, 67.6, 101.4, 135.2, 169.0, 202.8, and 253.5 ms, collected with 3 s relaxation delays. Peak intensities and curve fitting were calculated using Sparky. The heteronuclearNOE experiment was collected as a pseudo 3D spectrum, using a 120° proton pulse train with a 5 ms delay for a total of 5 s, with interleaved on and off resonance saturation. The hetNOE values were calculated from peak intensities according to the equation I<sub>on</sub> /I <sub>off</sub>.</p><p>To observe the interaction of DEPTOR PDZ with mTORC1, 32 µM of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N DEPTOR PDZ was added to 3.2 µM of the mTORC1 complex, with the excess PDZ shifting the equilibrium towards a higher percentage of bound state. Here, binding is observed as a residual effect in the unbound pool of PDZ and is manifested as line broadening in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiment when compared to free DEPTOR PDZ only. The <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC experiment was used here instead of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY to avoid potential solvent exchange bias. Peaks heights were normalized to the signal of the C-terminal residue before the ratio calculated. Peaks that had reduced relative intensity define the interaction surface for the PDZ domain.</p><p>Structural differences between the DEPTOR PDZ domain and the DEPTOR linker-PDZ construct were first identified by chemical shift perturbations in <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N BEST-TROSY experiments.

FRB assignments were obtained at 293K and transferred to the 278K spectra using a temperature titration. The backbone assignment of the 70 µM FRB sample (residues 2015–2114) was completed using 3D HNCO, HN(CA)CO and HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH experimental pairs - all collected with 1024, 64, and 96 points in the proton, nitrogen and carbon dimensions respectively and with 20–40% non-uniform sampling (NUS).

A 140 µM <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C DEPTOR linker (228-323) construct was assigned using the same experiment pairs as above, supplemented with HN(COCA)NNH and HN(CA)NNH experiments (2048, 64, and 80 points in the proton, nitrogen, and carbon dimensions, and 25% NUS) to provide sequential N,N connectivities. Carbon-detect 3D experiments, in recent years established for the assignment of disordered proteins due to their superior resolution, allowed the completion of the sequential assignment including proline connectivities. Carbon-detect 3D experiment pairs (HCA)CON and (HCA)NCO were collected with up to 1024, 128, and 80 complex points in the carbonyl-carbon, nitrogen, and indirect aliphatic-carbon dimensions respectively, whereas the CBCACON and CBCANCO pair was acquired with 1024, 72, and 80 points in carbonyl-carbon, nitrogen, and indirect aliphatic-carbon dimensions.</p><p>Secondary chemical shift analysis to describe conformational preferences for the DEPTOR linker was based on a comparison of assigned backbone carbon α and β shifts with chemical shift values expected for a random coil protein with the same sequence and under the same experimental conditions (pH and temperature), calculated using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kjaergaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kjaergaard and Poulsen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwarzinger et al., 2001</xref>).

FRB residues involved in the binding were identified by the addition of up to 220 µM of unlabeled linker-PDZ to 40 µM of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled FRB. Similarly, DEPTOR linker residues involved in binding were identified by the addition of up to 320 µM of unlabeled FRB to a 40 µM <sup>15</sup>N-labeled DEPTOR linker sample.

For global exchange, a 5 µL solution of 5 µM DEPTOR (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP) was incubated for 3 s with 40 µL of ice-cold D<sub>2</sub>O buffer of identical composition (92.8% D<sub>2</sub>O), for a final concentration of 74.24% D<sub>2</sub>O. The reaction was quenched using 20 µL of 2 M guanidinium chloride and 2.4% v/v formic acid, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. For measurement of the incorporation of deuterium, samples were thawed and injected onto an M-Class Acquity UPLC with HDX Manager technology (Waters) kept at 0.1°C. Samples were digested on-line using an Enzymate BEH immobilized Pepsin Column (Waters, 186007233) at 15°C for two min, with peptides being eluted onto an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (Waters, 186002346), equilibrated in Buffer Pepsin-A (0.1% v/v formic acid), using a 3–43% gradient of Pepsin-B buffer (0.1% v/v formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile) over 12 min.

An aliquot of 5 µL was incubated with 45 µL of D<sub>2</sub>O buffer at room temperature for 3, 30, 300, and 3000 s, the reaction was quenched and treated as described, with the exception of using a 5–36% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% v/v formic acid for elution from Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column. Data were collected from 300 to 2000 m/z, and mass analysis was performed as described above. Deuterium incorporation was not corrected for back-exchange and represents relative, rather than absolute changes in deuterium levels. Changes in H/D amide exchange in any peptide may be due to a single amide or a number of amides within that peptide.

However, our assays were carried out in steady state conditions. This means that we are measuring initial rates during which there is no appreciable depletion of substrate and the appearance of product is linear with time. Under these conditions, there will be very little appearance of phosphorylated DEPTOR relative to unphosphorylated DEPTOR. It is for this reason that WT and the 13 S/T-A mutant of DEPTOR have similar steady-state properties. Under these conditions, the WT DEPTOR is not significantly phosphorylated. DEPTOR’s characteristics as an mTORC1 substrate are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This shows that after 15 min only a small fraction of DEPTOR is phosphorylated. Assays of inhibition of DEPTOR constructs by mTORC1-A1459P were performed over a 4 min time interval. In order to observe the loss of inhibition due to phosphorylation of DEPTOR, we had to pre-phosphorylate DEPTOR by incubating it with mTORC1 for a longer time. In order to circumvent any potential confusion, we have expanded our explanation regarding this point in the revised manuscript on page 17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

There are a number of different ways to report weighted chemical shifts in the literature (Shuker et al., 1996), and here we report the Euclidian distances as opposed to the average as suggested by Williamson (Williamson, 2013). There is a precedent in the literature for the minimal shift maps, and we have added these references to the manuscript (Muskett et al., 1998; Williamson et al., 1997). We feel that the minimal shift map is an important tool for describing differences between states where one state is not assignable. The complex spectra of the DEPTOR long linker-PDZ could not be assigned due to the different dynamic qualities of the folded and disordered parts of the construct. As the assignment of the PDZ alone is known, it is reasonable to assume that peaks shifted in relation to the long-linker PDZ protein are shifted as a result of a change in the local environment as a consequence of the presence of the long linker. The minimal map identifies the likely peak locations in the unassigned spectrum in a conservative approach that can only underestimate the maximal chemical shift perturbation. It is true that line broadened peaks are not identified in the minimal map, however, this analysis will highlight line-broadened peaks and as a result residues that are altered in the new sample conditions.</p><p>The analysis of CSP values in absolute terms in not straightforward due to the nature of the residues involved, and as a result, comparing the extent of CSP between systems is highly problematic. With this is mind we have not added the “Max” Std values to the CSP legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The zoom that shows residue M262 highlights that the peak position is unambiguous and so can be included in the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5C is confusing. The FRB domain of mTORC1 appears to protect surfaces from solvent exchange throughout full-length DEPTOR (and some regions more strongly than the putative linker binding region).</p></disp-quote><p>Our HDX-MS results show that in addition to the long-linker, the N-terminal region of DEPTOR (peptide 2-32) shows substantial protection from solvent exchange in the presence of the FRB domain of mTORC1. We did not comment on the changes in this region, since we know that they are not essential for either the DEPTOR-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 or the partial inhibition unique to DEPTOR. However, we can now provide a structural hypothesis for the origin of these changes in protection in the N-terminus of DEPTOR, since while our manuscript was in review, another manuscript describing the structure of the tandem DEP domains at the N-terminus of DEPTOR was published (Weng et al., JMB; 2021, PMID 33865870). In this structure, a short segment (228-235) from the beginning of what we refer to as the DEPTOR long linker (228-323) forms a short helix that interacts with residues in a segment 20-32 at the N-terminus of the first DEP domain. This N-terminal region becomes more protected upon interaction with the mTOR FRB. It is plausible that the FRB interacting with the long linker promotes ordering of the linker and thereby protection of the N-terminal 2-32 peptide, which contacts the long linker. This also might account for the lower IC50 of the full-length DEPTOR compared with the construct lacking the tandem DEP domains (Figure 2C). We have now briefly commented on this in the text on page 14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is concerning that the cryo-EM reconstruction of the A1459P mTORC1 mutant bound to DEPTOR failed to recover any putative linker density bound to the FRB helices (Figure 6C). Integrating all of the above, and in the absence of structure-based point mutants that impair linker binding to the FRB and partial kinase inhibition, the mechanism by which the linker tunes mTORC1 activity remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have a reasonable explanation for the absence of the DEPTOR linker density at the FRB for the mTORC1-A1459P construct bound to DEPTOR. The mTORC1-A1459P/DEPTOR sample was not cross-linked. When we do not cross-link, the apparent helical density bound to the FRB is not evident. This is not especially surprising given the weak affinity of this FRB site for DEPTOR and other substrates. The original cryo-EM study of the mTORC1 complex by Pavletich and his colleagues (Yang et al., Nature 2017) also showed no density on the FRB in the presence of the substrate 4EBP1, although the kinetic results in the same study show the importance of 4EBP1 interaction with the FRB for maximal rate. The structural demonstration of this interaction with the FRB was shown by fusing the substrate to the FRB and crystallising the fusion FRB construct (Yang et al., Nature 2017). The fusion construct was one way to capture experimentally the interaction. In our work with wild-type DEPTOR, we have captured this interaction by crosslinking. Although this is a weak interaction, it is a classic observation that weak interactions can have profound influences on the overall affinity of protein/protein interactions. This is clear from the thermodynamics of independent interactions, and there is strong evidence that multiple weak interactions may be preferred in biological systems to impart greater specificity. This has been nicely demonstrated by the recent work of Scheepers et al. (PNAS 117, 22690–22697; 2020, PMID 32859760).</p><p>It is not clear what the reviewer means by the statement “Integrating all of the above…” Our NMR study characterises the interaction of the DEPTOR linker with the FRB. The HDX-MS is also consistent with this interaction. We did not make point mutations in the DEPTOR linker, because it is clear from the NMR study that there are multiple regions in the linker that can interact with the FRB. We did, however, delete the linker and show that we lose all inhibition. We did not make mutations in the FRB, because it has been shown previously that this site is important for substrate interaction. Mutagenesis would have been far less informative than the extensive work we did to characterise the interactions between DEPTOR and the FRB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Both the long and short exposures are now presented, and this makes our conclusions more visually obvious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We garnered our initial assessment of residues interacting with the PDZ domain by examining the residues in the model that were closest to the mTOR after fitting the NMR-derived model of the PDZ domain into the cryo-EM density. Subsequent examination of CSP and line-broadening were consistent with this initial estimation. Although the resolution of the cryo-EM density is limited, the fit of the PDZ domain to the density is unique. To show this, we created a new map for the A1459P mutant in which we masked out all density due to mTORC1. This left density only in the region between the FAT domain and the N-heat, and this density was about the size that we would expect for the PDZ domain. We used Chimera to do a global search of this density to find the optimal translation and orientation of the PDZ model in the density. We placed the NMR model in 100000 initial orientations/translations and carried out a local search for each placement. The initial placements were random orientations and random translations, with the translations restricted so that the center of the PDZ model would be within 10 Å of the center of the putative PDZ density. The orientation/translation that yielded the highest correlation coefficient (0.86) corresponded to the placement that we chose when manually fitting the density. Among 100000 trials carried out in the global search, this placement was located 4873 times. The next most common placement had a lower correlation (0.82) and was reached only 874 times. Any random placement with the PDZ domain volume occupying the volume of the density will give a correlation coefficient that is statistically significant (different than zero), but they all have correlation less than the correct solution that is consistent with the NMR measurements. The lowest correlation coefficient observed in the broad search was 0.73 (found one time in 100000 trials). From this unbiased analysis, we believe that our model for the PDZ interaction with mTORC1 is unique and correct. We have briefly described this unbiased analysis in the methods on page 48.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In figure 2C it would be useful to see the WT DEPTOR plot. The western blot appears to show higher inhibition is achieved with the Linker+PDZ 13A domain as compared to WT DEPTOR or DEPTOR 13A. Do the authors have any models of what would give rise to this heightened effect with the minimal domain?</p></disp-quote><p>The IC50 is greater for the linker-PDZ 13A compared with full-length DEPTOR, suggesting that the truncated construct is a poorer inhibitor than the full-length construct. It is probably a poorer inhibitor because it binds more weakly to mTORC1 (perhaps due to a change in the order of the linker due to loss of its interaction with the tandem DEP domains as referred to in point 4 above). When we include the WT DEPTOR plot in Figure 2C as suggested by the reviewer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), it is not clear that the maximal inhibition of the linker-PDZ construct is significantly greater than the maximal inhibition of the WT DEPTOR. Only at the maximum concentration that we could achieve in the assay is the inhibition due to the linker-PDZ greater than the WT DEPTOR, and the error bars for the two plots overlap for this point. If we show all the data from 2C and 2D in a single panel, it would more cluttered and difficult to interpret, so we believe that presenting them side-by-side is clearer.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68799-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We do not have a complete structural understanding of how partial inhibition arises. We know only that it requires the linker and that it involves interactions with the FRB. Since the same region on the FRB is also involved in interacting with substrates and the inhibitor PRAS40, we have a rough idea of what it looks like structurally. However, because substrate turnover can still take place with DEPTOR bound (the definition of partial inhibitor), we know that it does not completely overlap with the substrate interaction site. We also know it is distinct from PRAS40, which is a complete inhibitor that prevents substrate binding. Given that we do not have a full understanding of the structural origin of DEPTOR’s partial inhibition, we kept the speculations about it to a minimum. However, in response to the reviewer’s question, we have added some speculation on page 19 in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
