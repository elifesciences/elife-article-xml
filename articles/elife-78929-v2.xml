Besides clathrin, these vesicles contain at least 100 different proteins although it is unclear how many are essential for the formation of the vesicle. Here, we show that intracellular clathrin-coated formation can be induced in living cells using minimal machinery and that it can be achieved on various membranes, including the mitochondrial outer membrane. Chemical heterodimerization was used to inducibly attach a clathrin-binding fragment ‘hook’ to an ‘anchor’ protein targeted to a specific membrane. Endogenous clathrin assembled to form coated pits on the mitochondria, termed MitoPits, within seconds of induction. MitoPits are double-membraned invaginations that form preferentially on high curvature regions of the mitochondrion. Upon induction, all stages of CCV formation – initiation, invagination, and even fission – were faithfully reconstituted. We found no evidence for the functional involvement of accessory proteins in this process. In addition, fission of MitoPit-derived vesicles was independent of known scission factors including dynamins and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), suggesting that the clathrin cage generates sufficient force to bud intracellular vesicles. Our results suggest that, following its recruitment, clathrin is sufficient for intracellular CCV formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>clathrin-coated vesicle</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>intracellular trafficking</kwd><kwd>pinchase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014013</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/L016494/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Küey</surname><given-names>Cansu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014013</institution-id><institution>UK Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V003062/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sittewelle</surname><given-names>Méghane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clathrin-coated vesicles can be made to form on intracellular membranes using a minimal molecular system, which defines the core vesicle budding machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) are major carriers for cargo transport in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Schmid, 2020</xref>). CCVs carry cargo in three pathways: plasma membrane to endosome, from endosome to endosome, and between endosomes and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Due to experimental accessibility, CCV formation during endocytosis at the plasma membrane has been studied extensively. To what extent this event is representative of intracellular CCV formation is an open question.</p><p>We have known since the mid-1990s that there are four core components for CCV formation in endocytosis: cargo, adaptor, clathrin, and dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robinson, 1994</xref>). Clathrin forms the cage but cannot detect cargo nor membrane. An adaptor – the heterotetrameric AP-2 complex – recognizes cargo and membrane, and this recognition allows clathrin to bind to the adaptor and for pit formation to begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). The pit invaginates accompanied by clathrin polymerization, assisted by the adaptor itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). Eventually, through the action of the large GTPase dynamin, the vesicle is pinched off from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damke et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>). In the intervening years, a number of other proteins were identified that can be recruited to the forming clathrin-coated pit (CCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>). Their structures were determined, their cellular dynamics analyzed and complex network diagrams were built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Traub, 2011</xref>). However, it is unclear how important many of these accessory proteins are to the CCV formation process. Which of these proteins are <italic>mediators</italic>, essential for general CCV formation, and which are <italic>modulators</italic>, whose activity may fine-tune the process or only be required for a minority of events? An example is proteins that induce membrane curvature, what is their contribution relative to clathrin polymerization in driving CCV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stachowiak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sochacki and Taraska, 2019</xref>)? These questions apply to CME but also to intracellular CCV formation, which has its own network of molecular players.</p><p>It has been assumed that anything we learn about CCV formation in endocytosis can be translated to intracellular CCV formation. Whilst there are many parallels, important differences in the core machinery are already apparent. The recognition of membrane by AP-2 is via PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> whereas for AP-1, the heterotetrameric adaptor complex for CCV formation at endosomes, this step is governed by PI4P and the GTPase Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, imaging studies have questioned the requirement for dynamin in the fission of intracellular CCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kural et al., 2012</xref>). In order to address these questions, we have developed a method to reconstitute CCV formation in living cells, from minimal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, a clathrin-binding ‘hook’ is recruited to an ‘anchor’ at the plasma membrane using chemical heterodimerization. Because the initial cargo selection and membrane recognition steps are bypassed, we termed this method ‘hot-wiring’. Using this method to trigger endocytosis at the plasma membrane led to de novo CCV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2017</xref>). However because the plasma membrane is the site of endogenous endocytosis, it was difficult to (1) assess the role of endogenous accessory proteins in the induced events and (2) delineate induced pits from endogenous CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2017</xref>). To overcome these difficulties and to study the mechanism of intracellular CCV formation, we set out to reconstitute intracellular CCV formation on-demand, using the same principle. We show that CCPs can be induced on intracellular membranes, including the mitochondrial outer membrane. All stages of CCV formation are recapitulated at mitochondria, including fission; which appears to occur without the action of a scission molecule. Our data argue that the clathrin cage, in the absence of other additional factors, is sufficient to generate CCVs on intracellular membranes; highlighting a fundamental difference between CME and formation of intracellular clathrin carriers. Our findings also suggest that CCV formation after initial clathrin recruitment can proceed without the plethora accessory proteins that have been described.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inducing CCP formation on intracellular membranes</title><p>Previously, we described a method for inducing clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For the clathrin hook, FKBP-β2-GFP was used which is composed of the hinge and appendage domains of the β2 subunit of AP-2 and an FKBP domain for inducible heterodimerization with FRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The clathrin hook was mostly cytoplasmic, upon rapamycin addition however, FKBP-β2-GFP became localized to the mitochondria within seconds and then small spots containing hook and anchor began to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). A clathrin-binding deficient β2 hook (FKBP-β2 Y815A/∆CBM-GFP) and a control hook, GFP-FKBP, showed mitochondrial localization but no spot formation following rapamycin addition, suggesting that the spots that form are CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We therefore termed these spots ‘MitoPits’.</p><p>According to our model, the MitoPits should be spatially organized as follows: mitochondrial matrix followed by mitochondrial membrane and anchor, then the clathrin hook. To test this, line profiles drawn through MitoPits perpendicular to the mitochondrial axis were taken on images where MitoPits had been induced and the cells stained for a mitochondrial matrix marker, PDHE2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Spatial averaging revealed a narrow distribution of FKBP-β2-GFP, consistent with the size of a CCP and a variable amount of mitochondrial anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ei–iii</xref>). The expected organization was evident with anchor and matrix preceding the hook by ~80 and ~180 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Eiv</xref>).</p><p>Induction of presumptive CCPs was also achieved at the ER, Golgi, and lysosomes using compartment-specific membrane anchors fused to mCherry-FRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sec61β, Giantin TM domain (3131–3259), and LAMP1 were used for ER, Golgi, and lysosome anchors, respectively. Rerouting to the target membrane was seen for all hooks upon rapamycin addition, but spots only formed when using FKBP-β2-GFP as a clathrin hook and not with FKBP-β2 Y815A/∆CBM-GFP nor GFP-FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The formation of presumptive CCPs at all four intracellular locations suggests that our anchor-and-hook system is a transplantable module that can be used to induce the formation of CCPs at various locations. The mitochondrial outer membrane differs significantly in composition to other membranes in the cell and does not support any coated vesicle traffic; making this an ideal organelle to answer fundamental questions about CCV formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MitoPits form preferentially at mitochondria ends</title><p>To begin characterizing MitoPits we first asked: do MitoPits form randomly over the mitochondrial surface? To address this question we recorded the location of MitoPits on 51 mitochondria from four independent experiments. A mitochondrial network can be described as a graph where edges are the cyclindrical surfaces, and nodes are either branchpoints or endpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We classified the frequency of MitoPits at these three locations in addition to Free MitoPits (not associated with a mitochondrion), which will be described later. Of the four locations, endpoints were the preferential site of MitoPit formation accounting for ~40% of the MitoPits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When only considering endpoints and edges, we found that 72.7% of MitoPits were at endpoints. This indicates a preference for endpoints when compared with an expected 50/50 localization (odds ratio = 2.66, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 61.4, df = 1, p = 4.7 × 10<sup>−15</sup>). However, this result is confounded by the fact that the mitochondrial network is dominated by edges. To correct for this, we computed mitochondrial graphs for six cells expressing MitoTrap and found that just 5.3% of the surface area is at endpoints versus 94.6% at edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Using this information, the corrected preference for endpoints over edges is 97.9% (odds ratio 47.3, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 541, df = 1, p &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). Endpoints have two axes of positive curvature, whereas edges only have one, which indicates a curvature preference for MitoPit formation. However, we note that branchpoints are a second-favored site of preferential formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and that a similar argument applies here. These sites are saddle shaped with two axes of curvature, but of opposing polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our results indicate that MitoPits do not form at random locations but instead preferentially form at surfaces with specified geometry.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MitoPits form preferentially at mitochondria ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a single-branched mitochondrion with representative micrographs of MitoPits that have formed at the indicated location in HeLa cells expressing FKBP-β2-GFP (green) and MitoTrap (red), treated with 200 nM rapamycin.

First, cells where MitoPits had been induced were stained for clathrin heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Automated colocalization analysis revealed that ~60% of MitoPits were clathrin-positive while ~30% of clathrin-coated structures in the cell were MitoPits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). The density of MitoPits is about one-half of that of clathrin-coated structures in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Second, depletion of clathrin heavy chain using RNAi completely inhibited the formation of MitoPits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Third, MitoPits could be formed using other clathrin-binding domains as clathrin hooks. FKBP-β1-GFP, FKBP-AP180-GFP, or FKBP-epsin-GFP were competent, like FKBP-β2-GFP, for MitoPit formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, FKBP-α-GFP or FKBP-β3-GFP were inactive as GFP-FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results, together with the observation that clathrin-binding deficient mutant FKBP-β2-GFP (Y815A/∆CBM) does not form MitoPits indicate that clathrin binding is essential for MitoPit formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MitoPits are clathrin-coated pits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal micrographs of HeLa cells expressing dark MitoTrap with either clathrin hook (FKBP-β2-GFP), clathrin-binding deficient mutant hook (FKBP-β2-Y815A/∆CBM-GFP), or GFP-FKBP.

MitoPits were readily observable in electron micrographs of ultrathin (80 nm) sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All morphologically defined stages of CCP formation were seen on the mitochondria from initiation through to shallow and deep invagination, including neck formation.

Although these deformations are technically <italic>evaginations</italic> of the mitochondria, we refer to them as <italic>invaginations</italic> (toward the cytoplasm) for consistency. MitoPits had an unmistakable electron-dense coat typical of a CCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To our surprise, we also imaged many examples indicative of fission: clathrin-coated double-membrane vesicles in close proximity to, but distinct from, a mitochondrion. These MitoPit-derived vesicles (MPDVs) were ~120 nm diameter on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>), and the space between inner and outer membranes in the MPDV was slightly larger than the mitochondrial intermembrane distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

We confirmed in the same cells that Dynole 34–2 treatment had impaired endocytosis of transferrin, showing that dynamin activity was successfully inhibited in the cells where MPDVs were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This result made us question whether something about our minimal system for inducing CCP formation precluded dynamin participation.

MitoPit formation was induced in cells expressing mCherry-Drp1 or a dominant-negative version (mCherry-Drp1 K38A) together with FKBP-β2-GFP and dark MitoTrap. Overexpression of WT or mutant Drp1 resulted in fragmented or hyperfused mitochondria, respectively, demonstrating that the Drp1 constructs worked as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). If Drp1 is responsible for MPDV budding, we would expect to see a reduction in free spots in cells expressing mCherry-Drp1 K38A; however, the percentage was similar to nonexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In fact, we measured a small <italic>increase</italic> in the percentage of MPDVs in cells expressing mCherry-Drp1 WT. This result can be explained by the fragmentation of mitochondria caused by overexpression of WT Drp1 giving rise to more mitochondrial ends, and our earlier observation that MitoPits form preferentially at endpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the lack of inhibition of MPDV formation with the dominant-negative Drp1 mutant suggests that Drp1 is not involved in the fission of MitoPits.</p><p>We also investigated a role for ESCRT-III or actin in MPDV budding, given their role in other membrane scission events, yet found no evidence that either were involved in fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The induction of MitoPits was of particular interest since mitochondria do not normally support clathrin-mediated traffic and they have a different composition to the plasma membrane, with 10-fold less PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> which is an important phophoinositide for the function of many endocytic accessory proteins. All stages of CCV formation were recapitulated, including fission, which occurred without the activity of known pinchases. Our findings suggest that, in this context, clathrin may act in the absence of accessory proteins to generate CCVs.</p><p>MPDVs were classified as MitoPit spots that were free from mitochondria (~20% of the total). This fraction was unchanged when the activity of four scission candidates was compromised. Interference with dynamin, Drp1, Vps4a, or the actin cytoskeleton, using a variety of approaches, had no effect on the proportion of free spots suggesting that fission of MPDVs does not require a scission molecule. A possible confounder to this result is that our analysis methods may detect free spots that are not MPDVs. First, small mitochondrial fragments may house a MitoPit giving the impression of a free spot. However, fragmented mitochondria are much larger than MitoPits, and are excluded by the upper limit of our detection method. Second, endogenous mitochondrially derived vesicles (MDVs) may conflate the analysis. MDVs are very rare, with only 5–7 MDVs per cell on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neuspiel et al., 2008</xref>), whereas our synthetic system creates hundreds of MitoPits per cell; therefore any contribution of MDVs to the quantification of MPDVs will be negligible. In any case, MitoPits form synchronously after induction and free spots can be seen to bud from the mitochondria later, which means the possibility of such misclassification is very low.</p><p>The apparent lack of scission factor for MPDVs is surprising given the canonical role of dynamin in CME and the involvement of Drp1 in MDV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, GTP-hydrolyzing scission molecules may not be essential for intracellular budding events generally. For example, the fission of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles does not require a specific scission molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolf et al., 2013</xref>) and imaging studies indicate that intracellular AP1/clathrin budding events might occur without dynamin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kural et al., 2012</xref>). There are many examples of vesicle budding events that do not require an active- or scission-based mechanism for fission to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Renard et al., 2018</xref>). Our model therefore is that the clathrin coat is sufficient to deform the membrane and also to cause its fission. If intracellular CCV formation does not require a pinchase, and this requirement is exclusive to the plasma membrane, an interesting question for the future is: what is special about the plasma membrane that means that a pinchase is required?</p><p>Out of three AP complexes and six endocytic accessory proteins, only Epsin-2 and FCHo2 were recruited to MitoPits. Epsin-2 recruitment was stronger, appearing at ~80% of MitoPits versus ~20% for Fcho2. This is explained by Epsin-2 potentially binding to the β2 appendage of the hook as well as clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Owen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drake et al., 2000</xref>), whereas Fcho2 is not known to bind directly to either, and is potentially recruited via Eps15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reider et al., 2009</xref>). We showed that Epsins and FCHO proteins are apparently bystanders: they were recruited to these sites of concentrated clathrin, but did not functionally participate in MitoPit formation. Their lack of function may be due to (1) being recruited later than their normal temporal window of function, (2) failure to engage with the mitochondrial membrane, or (3) lack of components to interact with in our minimalist system. The implication is that clathrin is the primary factor that deforms the mitochondrial membrane.</p><p>Clathrin, working as a Brownian ratchet, has been proposed to drive membrane bending during CCP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hinrichsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</xref>), although the contribution of membrane bending proteins in the process has been difficult to dissect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sochacki and Taraska, 2019</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that MitoPit formation is clathrin dependent: (1) colocalization of clathrin with MitoPits, (2) direct visualization of a clathrin coat by EM, (3) the absence of MitoPit induction when clathrin heavy chain was downregulated by RNAi, and (4) MitoPit formation could be initiated with a variety of hooks that can effectively bind clathrin such as β1, Epsin, and AP180-C. The clathrin hooks that we use all contain intrinsically disordered regions and such proteins have been shown to deform membranes via a phase separation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, a clathrin-binding deficient β2 hook which differs from the wild-type by only a few residues was unable to support MitoPit formation, arguing against a contribution from the hook alone via this mechanism. It is tempting therefore to conclude that curvature generation in the context of MitoPits is by clathrin alone. However, it is possible that the disordered region of the hook contributes to curvature generation in a manner that is organized by clathrin, i.e. that the clathrin lattice could spatially constrain the hook and, when concentrated, the disordered regions contribute to curvature. Separating these possibilities is difficult since both clathrin and hook are essential to make MitoPits. Whatever the mechanism, it seems that enough force is generated by our synthetic system to deform both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and even to pinch off the MitoPits.</p><p>Out of three AP complexes and six endocytic accessory proteins, only Epsin-2 and FCHo2 were recruited to MitoPits.

The energy per unit of membrane area required to form a spherical vesicle can be thought of as the sum of the bending energy (<italic>G</italic><sub>bending</sub>), membrane tension (<italic>γ</italic>), and cargo crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stachowiak et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>G</italic><sub>bending</sub> is described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>,<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>bending</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">π</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">κ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">π</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">κ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>κ</italic> is the bending rigidity, <italic>r</italic> is the vesicle radius, and <italic>G</italic><sub>bending</sub> is in units of <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> nm<sup>−2</sup> (where <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> is the thermal energy and is ~4 × 10<sup>−21</sup> J mol<sup>−1</sup> or ~4.3 pN nm).

The mitochondrial membrane is more fluid than the plasma membrane due to its low sterol and high cardiolipin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horvath and Daum, 2013</xref>), and it does not have the same osmotic imbalance and actin interactions which elevate <italic>γ</italic>.

Assembled clathrin can contribute an estimated 0.08 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> nm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stachowiak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">den Otter and Briels, 2011</xref>). Although the cost of cargo crowding has not been included, this suggests that clathrin assembly by itself would be sufficient to account for MPDV formation. However, cargo crowding may be substantial, and interactions between inner and outer membranes may also increase the cost significantly. This would invoke the need for clathrin-organized crowding of intrinsically disordered hooks to assist with curvature generation. Comparison between this calculation and the energetics of CCP formation at the plasma membrane is difficult due to a number of other factors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hassinger et al., 2017</xref> for a detailed analysis).</p><p>This calculation assumes the formation of a spherical vesicle from a flat sheet. We observed that MitoPits form preferentially at branchpoints or endpoints on the mitochondrial surface, likely indicating a geometry preference for clathrin assembly on dual curvature surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larsen et al., 2020</xref>). Even the MitoPits observed on mitochondrial edges are formed at a site of single curvature. The size of a CCP (<italic>r</italic> = 60 nm) is ~4 times smaller than a mitochondrial endpoint (<italic>r</italic> = 250 nm). So whilst considerable deformation is still required to form a vesicle at these precurved sites, the total energy requirement is lower than at a flat sheet. This preference for precurved sites echoes classic work showing CCPs forming at the curved edges of intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggeler et al., 1983</xref>), while a very recent study suggests that clathrin prefers precurved surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeno et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, cells grown on nanofabricated surfaces that induce inward curvature of the plasma membrane in ridges show increased CCP formation at these pre-curved sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cail et al., 2022</xref>). The ridges have widths of 75–500 nm, and significant enrichment of adaptors and clathrin is seen at 200 nm and narrower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cail et al., 2022</xref>). The width of a mitochondrion is ~500 nm, so the MitoPits that form on the edges of mitochondria in our study are not in the range where enrichment has been observed due to induced curvature at the plasma membrane. In addition, the pits formed in that study scale with the size of the precurved site whereas MitoPits and MPDVs are of a uniform size that has a tighter curvature than that of the mitochondrion surface. So while more extreme curvatures promote spontaneous (and clathrin-independent) vesicle formation at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cail et al., 2022</xref>) the situation for MitoPits is different, with formation being triggered by the experimenter and the curvature of the underlying mitochondrial membrane likely assisting MPDV formation, but not prespecifying their shape.</p><p>Which aspects of our work can translate to CCP formation at the plasma membrane during CME? Besides a scission requirement, there are three other differences between MitoPits and CME. First, the CCVs emerge from a flattened lattice that has the propensity to remodel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heuser, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>). It is unclear if flat lattices are formed at the mitochondria after clathrin is recruited; the mitochondrial outer membrane presumably lacks many key features of the ventral cell surface. However, the spontaneous remodeling of flat lattices occurs at the plasma membrane without added accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sochacki et al., 2021</xref>), which is consistent with our clathrin-centric model. Second, actin is actively involved in force generation in some circumstances at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hassinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), whereas we found no requirement for MPDV formation. Third, CCPs at the plasma membrane are spatially constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>), whereas MitoPits, particularly on mitochondrial edges, are motile. Despite these differences, CME at the plasma membrane can be triggered in an analogous way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2017</xref>) and previous in vitro work supports the idea of a minimal machinery for CCV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our work suggests that from the moment of recruitment onwards, clathrin is sufficient to form a vesicle. What does this mean for the network of accessory proteins associated with the core clathrin machinery? The clathrin-centric mechanism we describe suggests that none of these proteins are ‘mediators’ of vesicle formation, and instead they may act as ‘modulators’; enhancing vesicle formation, changing vesicle size or adapting it to certain conditions. It is important to note that in our system, we trigger the recruitment of clathrin to a precurved intracellular surface using a hook that may be active, and we are blind to potential mediators (cargo, lipids, and other proteins) acting earlier. However, since clathrin recruitment defines the first stage of CCV formation – initiation – the proposed mechanism accounts for almost the entire pathway. Given the differences between intracellular CCV formation and CME, the distinction between mediators and modulators at the plasma membrane may differ slightly.</p><p>Our system, of ectopic placement of a clathrin-binding domain and the subsequent action of endogenous clathrin, represents a transplantable module for CCP formation at potentially any membrane. As well as allowing fundamental questions about vesicle formation in cells to be addressed, this system may be used in the future to manipulate the size and composition of target organelles and dissect intracellular processes that are experimentally inaccessible.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-clathrin heavy chain (X22).

Plasmids for mCherry-Epsin-2 (#27673), mCherry-Fcho2 (#27686), Hip1r-tDimer-RFP (#27700), mCherry-Amphiphysin (#27692), and mCherry-Snx9 (#27678) (all mouse) were from Addgene.</p><p>To make the ER anchor FRB-mCherry-Sec61β, pAc-GFPC1-Sec61β (Addgene #15108) was inserted into pFRB-mCherry-C1 using BglII and EcoRI. The Golgi anchor FRB-mCherry-Giantin, was generated by excising Giantin (3131–3259) from pmScarlet-Giantin-C1 (Addgene #85050) with XhoI and BamHI and inserting into FRB-mCherry-C1. For the lysosome anchor Lamp1-mCherry-FRB, Lamp1 was amplified from LAMP1-mGFP (Addgene # 34831) and cloned in place of Tom70p in pMito-mCherry-FRB using EcoRI and BamHI.</p><p>The clathrin hook FKBP-AP180-GFP was made by amplifying residues 328–896 from rat AP180 (gift from E. Ungewickell) and ligating in place of β2 (616–951) in FKBP-β2-GFP using BamHI and AgeI.</p><p>Dynamin-1-mCherry and dynamin-1(K44A)-mCherry were made by replacing the GFP from WT Dyn1 pEGFP and K44A Dyn1 pEGFP (Addgene #34680 and #34681), respectively, with mCherry from pmCherry-N1 using AgeI and NotI. The plasmid to express mCherry-Drp1 K38A was made by site-directed mutagenesis of mCherry-Drp1 (Addgene #49152). Plasmids to express mCherry-Vps4a WT and mCherry-Vps4a E228Q were made replacing the GFP from GFP-Vps4wt and GFP-Vps4(EQmut), with mCherry from pmCherry-N1 using AgeI and BsrGI. Human AP1S1 and AP3S1 coding sequences with XhoI and BamHI ends, were synthesized as G-blocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned in place of σ2-mCherry to make σ1-mCherry and σ3-mCherry.</p><p>All plasmids developed as part of this work are available on Addgene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell biology</title><p>Wild-type HeLa cells (HPA/ECACC 93021013) or FCHO1/2 KO HeLa #64/1.E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Umasankar et al., 2014</xref>) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 100 U ml<sup>−1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin. Dynamin triple knockout (DNM TKO) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2013</xref>), a kind gift from Pietro de Camilli (Yale School of Medicine) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 3.5% sodium bicarbonate and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For conditional knockout, cells were treated for 48 hr with 3 µM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Merck) and then kept in 300 nM until experimentation. All cells were kept at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and checked monthly for mycoplasma contamination.</p><p>HeLa or DNM TKO cells were transfected with GeneJuice (Merck) or Fugene (Promega), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Anchor and hook plasmids were transfected in a 1:2 (wt/wt) ratio. For clathrin heavy chain knockdown, HeLa cells were plated out and then transfected with GL2 (control, <named-content content-type="sequence">CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA</named-content>) or CHC siRNA (target sequence, <named-content content-type="sequence">TCCAATTCGAAGACCAATT</named-content>) on days 2 and 4 using Lipofectamine2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Motley et al., 2003</xref>), with additional DNA transfection on day 4. Similarly for triple epsin knockdown, Hela cells were plated on cover slips and then transfected with a total of 600 pg of either a scrambled control siRNA oligo medium GC content (Invitrogen) or a mix of three siRNA oligos HSS121071 (Epsin-1), HSS117872 (Epsin-2), and HSS147867 (Epsin-3) (Invitrogen) on days 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>), followed by additional DNA transfection on day 4. Cells were seeded onto cover slips and used for experiments on day 5.</p><p>Induction of CCPs was done by manual addition of rapamycin (Alfa Aesar) to a final concentration of 200 nM for 10 min to 30 min before fixation. Previously, we reported that no CCPs formed on mitochondria using a related anchor, pMito-PAGFP-FRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2017</xref>). Using pMito-mCherry-FRB, we find MitoPits can be reproducibly induced in ~60% of cells expressing both constructs. We have verified that pits can also be formed using pMito-PAGFP-FRB, although the fraction of cells showing spots is lower, explaining our earlier report.</p><p>For transferrin uptake experiments, DNM TKO cells were serum starved for a total of 30 min in serum-free media. Then for rerouting, they were exposed to 200 nM rapamycin and 100 µg/ml Alexa Fluor 568- or 647-conjugated transferrin (Thermo Fisher) for the final 10 min of starvation. For HeLa cells, a dynamin inhibition step was added to the protocol where cells were treated with 30 µM Dynole 34–2, dynamin I and dynamin II inhibitor, or negative control Dynole 31–2 (Abcam, ab120474) starting from 15 min before rerouting and transferrin addition. For actin depolymerization, HeLa cells were treated with 1 µM Latrunculin B (Merck) or 0.02% vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) for 25 min, with addition of 200 nM rapamycin for the final 10 min. All incubations were done in serum-free media at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Dose–response relationships for Dynole 34–2 and Latrunculin B were determined empirically as the lowest concentration to inhibit transferrin uptake or disrupt actin, respectively; without affecting mitochondrial morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PEM buffer (80 mM piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES), 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 6.8) for 10 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were blocked in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 5% goat serum in PBS) for 60 min. Cells were then incubated for 60 min with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution as follows: mouse anti-Pyruvate dehydrogenase E2/E3 (PDHE2/E3, ab110333, Abcam, 1 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>); mouse anti-clathrin heavy chain (X22, 1:1000); rabbit anti-TOMM20-Alexa Fluor 647 (Abcam, ab209606, 0.5 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>); acti-stain 555 phalloidin (Cytoskeleton Inc, PHDH1, 1:1000). Where secondary detection was required, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher, A11031) or anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher, A21235) at 1:500 in blocking solution. After a final three washes with PBS, cover slips were then mounted using Mowiol. All steps were at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microscopy</title><p>For live cell imaging, HeLa cells were grown in 4-well glass-bottom 3.5 cm dishes. Growth medium was exchanged for Liebovitz L-15 CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium (Gibco) before imaging. For some experiments, MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Thermo Fisher) was added at 1:15,000 to visualize the mitochondria.</p><p>Imaging was done using a Nikon CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal system with SoRa upgrade (Yokogawa), 60 × 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective (Nikon) with ×4 SoRa magnification and 95B Prime (Photometrics) camera was used with excitation by 405, 488, 561, or 638 nm lasers. Images were acquired with NIS-Elements software (Nikon). For CHC knockdown experiments, cells were imaged using an Ultraview Vox system (Perkin Elmer) with 100 × 1.4 NA oil objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA-R2 camera with excitation by 488, 561, or 640 nm lasers, operated by Volocity 6.0 software (Perkin Elmer).</p><p>To correlate light microscopy with EM, HeLa cells were plated onto gridded glass culture dishes (P35G-1.5-14-CGRD, MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA) at 30,000 cells per dish, transfected the following day, and imaged on a Nikon Ti-U widefield microscope with CoolSnap MYO camera (Photometrics) using NIS-Elements software. Location of each cell of interest was recorded using the coordinates on the grid at ×20 magnification with brightfield illumination. Cells were imaged live with a ×100 objective while rapamycin was added as described, and then cells were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, 0.5% formaldehyde in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 1 hr and washed with phosphate buffer three times afterwards. Cells were stained with 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 hr, washed four times with distilled water for 5 min, stained with 1% tannic acid for 45 min, washed three times with distilled water for 5 min and stained with 1% uranyl acetate overnight at 4°C.</p><p>On day 6, cells were washed three times with distilled water for 5 min, dehydrated through ascending series of ethanol solutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100 %, 10 min each) and infiltrated in medium epoxy resin (TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd., Aldermasteron, UK) at 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 ethanol to resin ratios and finally in full resin, each for 30 min. Fresh full resin was added, and a gelatin capsule was placed over each grid that contained the cell of interest. Resin was left to polymerize at 60°C for 72 hr.</p><p>On day 9, the cell of interest was located, and then trimmed down. Next, 80 nm serial sections were taken using a diamond knife and collected on Formvar coated copper hexagonal 100-mesh grids (EM Resolutions). Sections were poststained in 2% uranyl acetate for 2 min and in 3% Reynolds lead citrate (TAAB) for 2 min, with intermediate washes in distilled water.</p><p>Electron micrographs were taken on a JEOL 2100Plus transmission electron micrograph operating at 200 kV using Gatan OneView IS camera with GMS3.0 and TEMCenter software. Cells were imaged at low magnification (×100–400) to locate and then high resolution images were taken at ×25,000 magnification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To analyze the spatial organization of MitoPits, a line perpendicular to the mitochondrial axis was drawn through the MitoPit (situated on mitochondrial edges). To eliminate distortion, all images were registered prior to analysis using images of 200 nm fluorescent beads with NanoJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laine et al., 2019</xref>). Intensity data for each channel as a function of distance were read into Igor Pro and a 1D Gaussian fitting procedure was used to locate the peak for each channel, offset to the peak for FKBP-β2-GFP, and generate an ensemble average.</p><p>Colocalization analysis of spots, formed by rerouting of FKBP-β2-GFP to dark MitoTrap, with another (mCherry-tagged) protein was done using the ComDet Plugin v0.5.5 in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katrukha, 2022</xref>). The maximum distance between spots of FKBP-β2-GFP and spots in the other protein’s channel to be accepted as colocalization was selected to be 2 pixels, and spot size was 3 pixels (corresponding to 135 nm). This method likely underestimates colocalization where the density of spots in one channel is higher than in another, which is the case for clathrin immunostaining due to the large number of endogenous non-MitoPit clathrin spots. For CHC knockdown experiments, total spots in a cell were counted in Fiji using ‘Analyze Particles’. Briefly, spots were isolated by applying manual threshold to images in the FKBP-β2-GFP channel, and analyzed particles with limits of 0.03–1.5 µm in size and 0.4–1.0 circularity, counting the number of spots for each cell.</p><p>For MitoPit location analysis, multiple square ROIs (150 × 150 pixels) that contained a single distinguishable mitochondrion were selected. Spots that were classified as free, or on the edges, or at nodes (branchpoints and endpoints) were counted using Cell Analyzer in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To calculate the surface area at edges and endpoints, Z-stacks (0.5 µm step size) of HeLa cells stably expressing MitoTrap were analyzed using MitoGraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Viana et al., 2015</xref>). Using R, the MitoGraph outputs were processed and the surface area of edges was calculated using the average width of mitochondria (2<italic>r</italic>) and the total length of edges (<italic>l</italic>) using <italic>l</italic>2<italic>πr</italic>. The surface area of ends was calculated assuming each was a hemisphere (2<italic>πr</italic><sup>2</sup>) and the number was derived from the fraction of nodes in the MitoGraph that were designated free ends.</p><p>Spot detection for efficiency measurements and free spot analysis was done either using NIS-Elements Advanced Research analysis software or an equivalent script in Fiji. The total number of spots for each cell was counted using the ‘Spot Detection Binary’ function (3 pixels, corresponding to 135 nm) using the FKBP-β2-GFP channel with a manual threshold. This measurement was normalized to the cell area to give the spot density per unit area. Mitochondria were recognized by the ‘Homogeneous Area Detection Binary’ function using the mitochondrial matrix channel with a manual threshold. The coincidence of detected spots with this segmented area represented the MitoPits, while those spots outside it were designated free spots. The equivalent script for Fiji is available (see below). To quantify the size and abundance of hot-wired endocytic vesicles upon dynamin inhibition with Dynole 34–2, custom-written code for Fiji and Igor Pro 9 was used. Briefly, a mask for each cell was made via thresholding using the IsoData algorithm. Then, these masks were analyzed using ‘Analyze Particles’ function in Fiji, with limits of 0–1 µm in size and 0.3–1.0 in circularity, counting the number of spots for each cell and measuring the area of the spots. Analysis was done with the experimenter blind to the conditions of the experiment. Figures were made with FIJI and Igor Pro, and assembled using Adobe Illustrator. Null hypothesis statistical tests were done as described in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>Data and code to analyze MitoPit profiles from light and electron microscopy images are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/quantixed/p057p034">https://github.com/quantixed/p057p034</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:3d7d5afb869576787c6abec97ce6f47e0af6f47e;origin=https://github.com/quantixed/p057p034;visit=swh:1:snp:570767529998ac75d200e077b5e945bc907d16b7;anchor=swh:1:rev:d01fe5cb80f9741bc83527def95790ffb049aba1">swh:1:rev:d01fe5cb80f9741bc83527def95790ffb049aba1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Royle, 2022</xref>).

The authors use an innovative approach to recruit clathrin to mitochondrial membranes, and observe the budding and fission of clathrin-coated vesicles.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers thought your article was interesting and innovative, with high-quality data. However, there was also a general consensus that some of your conclusions need to be tempered, and that some additional papers need to be cited.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The statement that &quot;our work suggests that from the moment of recruitment onwards, clathrin is sufficient to form a vesicle&quot; needs to be toned down. First, the mitochondrial membranes are already highly curved; your own studies show that the situation is different with a flat membrane. Second, the clathrin &quot;hook&quot; is a bulky disordered protein of the sort that can deform membranes, and the fact that this doesn't happen unless clathrin is added is likely due to the fact that the proteins don't cluster on their own. Thus, it is premature to conclude that all the other proteins associated with clathrin-coated pits are modulators rather than drivers of membrane bending. The reviewers' comments below give clear indications of how this part of the discussion needs to be rewritten.</p><p>2) A particularly pertinent paper is the recent preprint in bioRxiv from the Drubin lab. These authors came to somewhat different conclusions from yours, using cells grown on substrates that cause the ventral plasma membrane to bend. This discrepancy needs to be discussed. Other citations are also suggested; see the reviewers' comments.</p><p>3. Some of the biophysical calculations do not take the full situation into account and need to be revised; see below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As detailed below, I had a couple of comments about membrane fluidity and molecular crowding, which would be good to clarify.</p><p>I do have a few comments and questions for the authors to consider.</p><p>1. The authors discuss the flatness of the plasma membrane compared with intracellular membranes like the TGN and endosomes, and they highlight their very interesting observation that the MitoPits most often form on curved parts of mitochondria. It might be pertinent to cite a 1983 paper from Zena Werb's lab on unroofed cells, showing that clathrin-coated buds on intracellular membranes form from curved edges, either tubules or the rims of flat cisternae (see PubMed 6415067).</p><p>2. The authors discuss the fluidity of the mitochondrial membrane vs. the plasma membrane (page 8). I'm not a biophysicist, but I would have thought it would be more difficult to bend a double membrane than a single one. Perhaps the authors could comment on this.</p><p>3. The authors argue against a curvature role for the proteins with clathrin-binding domains that they use as hooks because they don't get MitoPits forming when they mutate the clathrin binding site. But I'm not sure they can completely rule out molecular crowding as a contributing factor. I take the point that clathrin is required, but if clathrin were acting as a crosslinker, bringing together multiple copies of their hooks, all of which contain disordered regions, couldn't both mechanisms be involved?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few comments which could be addressed with new text, analysis, or experiments. Specifically, a more thorough discussion of past work would be helpful for the reader. Finally, the screen of co-localized endocytic proteins was somewhat limited and lends the reader to wonder if other key factors, particularly eps15/R, might still be involved. It is, however, quite a beautiful study.</p><p>Comments for Authors to address:</p><p>1. Figure 2. The scale and degree of curvature encountered at the mitochondria by the assembling clathrin lattice is an important consideration in this work. To compare the current work to past work where clathrin assembly was enhanced by nanofabricated pre-curved surfaces, it would be helpful to generally quantitate the degree of curvature observed at the edges, branches, or ends of the mitochondria. The curvatures studied in past work (Zhao et al. NatNano2017, Cali et al. BioRxiv 2021) were fairly extreme and effects similar to those seen here. Can the authors please expand the discussion or provide some additional analysis of the types of mitochondria curvatures encountered in their thin section TEM images of these cells? Likewise, a discussion of how this work compares to a preprint showing that curved surfaces do not need clathrin would be helpful (Cali and Drubin bioRxiv 2021: Induced membrane curvature bypasses clathrin's essential endocytic function).</p><p>2. Figure 3. If only 60% of the FKBP2-Beta2-GFP spots have clathrin staining after rapamycin treatment, what are the other green spots? Do they have a very low (dim) level of clathrin on them? Are they something else? Please discuss.</p><p>3. Figure 6. The percent of Epsin/GFP-B2 hook co-localization is higher than clathrin/GFP-B2 hook co-localization. Can the authors explain this effect? Specifically, If clathrin is needed for epsin colocalization to mitopits, and only 60% of the mitopits have clathrin, why would 80% of the mitopits have a strong epsin signal? If the experiment with clathrin colocalization were done with CLC-mCherry and a dark-mitotrap, would the authors see a higher colocalization than the CHC antibody staining? Please address this issue in the text or with a new analysis.</p><p>4. &quot;Our work suggests that from the moment of recruitment on-wards, clathrin is sufficient to form a vesicle.&quot;</p><p>I believe the statement should be more nuanced. The authors show that clathrin alone can form at mitochondrial membranes. However, the fact that it occurs much more robustly at pre-curved membranes implies that other factors are likely needed at flat membranes. Likewise, the efficiency of the formation of the mitopits is not measured in this paper. Is it fundamentally slower or less efficient than what naturally occurs at the plasma membrane? These are important issues to consider. Please discuss.</p><p>5. &quot;the clathrin-only mechanism we describe suggests that none of these proteins are 'mediators' of vesicle formation, and instead they may act as 'modulators'&quot;…..</p><p>See the above comment. It is possible that other factors are needed (mediators) at the plasma membrane when the lattice grows on flat pieces of the plasma membrane. I think this distinction (mediator vs. modulator) in the context of CME is not necessarily addressed by this paper.</p><p>6. &quot;previously, we reported that no clathrin-coated pits formed on mitochondria using a related anchor, pMito-PAGFP-FRB (Wood et al., 2017). Using pMito-mCherry-FRB, we find MitoPits can be reproducibly induced in ˘60 % of cells expressing both constructs. We have verified that pits can also be formed using pMito-PAGFP-FRB, although the fraction of cells showing spots is lower, explaining our earlier report.'</p><p>This is an interesting finding. Can the authors explain these results? Why do only 60% of the cells show the effect, and why was assembly not seen with the other hook tethers? Please discuss.</p><p>7. What was the logic for choosing the accessory proteins to screen for co-localization with mitopits (Figure 6 and S5)? It would be interesting to test if Esp15/R is co-localized to mitopits. Eps15 binds espin and was pulled down in the mass-spec Beta2 pulldown experiments (Schmid et al. PLOSBIO 2006). The other major protein found in the mass-spec data was intersectin. In a similar vein, does Eps15 knockdown or Eps15 domain expression prevent mitopit formation? If Eps15 is strongly localized and has a functional impact on mitopit formation, these data would adjust the core findings of the paper and add an additional component along with clathrin that is necessary for mitopit formation. In the least, the authors should discuss this possibility.</p><p>8. I would recommend shifting to a magenta/green or similar color scheme for color-blind readers.</p><p>9. The paper could use some additional citations for consideration and discussion.</p><p>Hassinger et al. PNAS 2017</p><p>Heuser JCB 1989</p><p>Sochacki et al. Dev Cell 2021</p><p>Lin et al. JCB 1991</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A thorough rewriting of the discussion is necessary to remove unnecessary speculation and remove logical flaws in the authors' interpretation of the data:</p><p>1. The authors must acknowledge that their findings are exclusive to pre-curved membranes. The title should be amended to include that idea. &quot;Recruitment of clathrin to highly curved intracellular membranes is sufficient for vesicle formation&quot;</p><p>2. The authors must cite and discuss the Cail and Drubin paper, noting that adapters are also capable of functioning without clathrin.</p><p>3. The authors must either acknowledge that molecular crowding cannot be eliminated as a possible explanation for their findings or provide a detailed stoichiometric analysis as described above. Note this analysis must account for all of the proteins that reside under the clathrin coat, including epsin, fcho, etc. In this way, it may prove challenging to come to a definitive conclusion.</p><p>4. The authors should remove statements suggesting that all of clathrin's adaptor proteins are only &quot;modulators&quot; rather than &quot;drivers&quot; of membrane remodeling. This conclusion is clearly incorrect based on the Cail and Drubin work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78929.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The statement that &quot;our work suggests that from the moment of recruitment onwards, clathrin is sufficient to form a vesicle&quot; needs to be toned down.

In brief, the criticisms raised by the referee do not substantially alter the calculation that was in the paper. Briefly, in the opinion of Reviewer #3 the value we used for rigidity of the mitochondrial outer membrane was too low.

The Referee's other concern was about the energy barrier to curvature initiation, but we show below that this is negligible.</p><p>Please note, that our calculation is not a formal attempt to model the process of MitoPit formation, which should consider other aspects.

We have included a citation to this paper when discussing MitoPit formation at pre-curved sites.</p><p>“This preference for pre-curved sites echoes classic work showing clathrin-coated pits forming at the curved edges of intracellular membranes (Aggeler et al., 1983), while a very recent study suggests that clathrin prefers pre-curved surfaces (Zeno et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors discuss the fluidity of the mitochondrial membrane vs. the plasma membrane (page 8). I'm not a biophysicist, but I would have thought it would be more difficult to bend a double membrane than a single one. Perhaps the authors could comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>In our rough calculation, we factored in the difficulty of bending a double membrane <italic>versus</italic> a single one. This was done by simply taking two times the energy required to form a vesicle, i.e. <bold>2 ×</bold> (2<italic>κ/r</italic><sup>2</sup> + <italic>γ</italic>). It is possible that coupling between the two membranes decreases (or even increases) this requirement, but taking two times the energy seemed the most cautious approach. We have edited this part of the paper in light of comments from Reviewer #3 and now the double membrane issue is better signposted and explicitly mentioned as an unknown parameter which may affect the result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

It is difficult to separate the contributions of clathrin and molecular crowding to curvature generation; since clathrin <italic>and</italic> hook are both needed to make MitoPits. Our experiments rule out the possibility that hooks drive curvature <italic>alone</italic>, but the possibility that molecular crowding – organised by clathrin – contributes to curvature remains. We have edited this part of the discussion so that it now reads:</p><p>“The clathrin hooks that we use all contain intrinsically disordered regions and such proteins have been shown to deform membranes via a phase separation mechanism (Busch et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2021). Importantly, a clathrin-binding deficient β2 hook which differs from the wild-type by only a few residues was unable to support MitoPit formation, arguing against a contribution from the hook alone via this mechanism. It is tempting therefore to conclude that curvature generation in the context of MitoPits is by clathrin alone. However, it is possible that the disordered region of the hook contributes to curvature generation in a manner that is organized by clathrin, i.e. that the clathrin lattice could spatially constrain the hook and, when concentrated, the disordered regions may contribute to curvature. Separating these possibilities is difficult since both clathrin and hook are essential to make MitoPits. Whatever the mechanism, it seems that enough force is generated by our synthetic system to deform both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and even to pinch off the MitoPits.”</p><p>We have also edited the calculation to include this concession (details given below in response to Reviewer #3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few comments which could be addressed with new text, analysis, or experiments.

(now published in J Cell Biol PMID: 35532382) is very interesting indeed. The Reviewer is correct that the nanofabrication-imposed curvature in these studies is fairly extreme. They used ridges with widths of 75 nm to 500 nm, and see significant enrichment of adaptors at 200 nm and narrower, i.e. on the scale of a clathrin-coated pit. The width of a mitochondrion is ~500 nm, so the MitoPits that form on the edges of mitochondria in our study are not in the range where Cail et al. report significant enrichment.</p><p>We have measured the curvature in our thin section TEM images, as suggested. With the limitation that these are 2D views that could exaggerate curvature, and assuming that curvature in the unseen dimension has a fixed radius of 250 nm, the results allow a coarse comparison with the nano-fabrication work (<bold>Reviewer Figure 1</bold>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Estimated curvature at mitochondria bearing MitoPits.</title><p>Plot to show Gaussian curvature (K, product of two curvatures) versus total curvature (J, sum of two curvatures).

If only 60% of the FKBP2-Beta2-GFP spots have clathrin staining after rapamycin treatment, what are the other green spots? Do they have a very low (dim) level of clathrin on them? Are they something else? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We used an object-based colocalization method which works on the basis of spot detection. The level of colocalisation is therefore affected by the signal-to-noise level used for detection and by the density of spots. When we crank the clathrin channel we can see that many of these apparently FKBP-beta2-GFP-only spots do have a low level of clathrin on them. If we decrease the threshold for detection, the density of clathrin spots (MitoPits plus endogenous CCPs) tend to merge and then not get detected as spots due to their size. The value of 60% shouldn’t be fixated on as it is an underestimate. However, this approach is still useful to look at changes within an experiment, for example between wt and mutant hooks. We have added a note to this effect in the legend of Figure 3 and in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Having said all this, even with the clathrin signal cranked, there are some FKBP-beta2-GFP spots that are clathrin-negative. We assume that these are MPDVs that have uncoated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 6. The percent of Epsin/GFP-B2 hook co-localization is higher than clathrin/GFP-B2 hook co-localization. Can the authors explain this effect? Specifically, If clathrin is needed for epsin colocalization to mitopits, and only 60% of the mitopits have clathrin, why would 80% of the mitopits have a strong epsin signal? If the experiment with clathrin colocalization were done with CLC-mCherry and a dark-mitotrap, would the authors see a higher colocalization than the CHC antibody staining? Please address this issue in the text or with a new analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In continuation of our response above, we would be cautious about drawing connections between the 80% colocalization in these experiments with 60% in the other. For example, the density of epsin spots is lower than that of clathrin and so the apparent colocalisation is higher. We have imaged mCherry-LCa with FKBP-beta2-GFP and dark MitoTrap to see if the colocalisation improves and we found it similar to our results using CHC staining to detect clathrin.</p><p>We have explored alternative methods for these colocalisation analyses, with a view to improving these parts of the paper, but found that they have other limitations. So we have opted to stay with the current approach.</p><p>It is possible that the higher apparent colocalisation with epsin compared to clathrin is because epsin stays associated with MPDVs after they have lost clathrin. We wrote in the paper that we think that the higher colocalisation of Epsin2 vs Fcho2 at MitoPits may be due to Epsin's ability to bind beta2 and clathrin. The beta2 association may explain the difference the reviewer is asking about. In a test of this idea, we expressed FKBP-beta2-GFP with Y815A/Y888V mutation, which is unable to bind accessory proteins (Edeling et al., 2006 PMID: 16516836). Unfortunately, this mutation also affects the association with clathrin, so the total number of MitoPits is decreased. However, within this population, there are fewer Epsin-positive MitoPits (<bold>Reviewer Figure 2</bold>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>mCherry-Epsin2 recruitment to MitoPits.</title><p>Lower colocalisation is seen using a Y815A/Y888A mutant form of FKBP-beta2-GFP to form MitoPits compared to wild type.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78929-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;Our work suggests that from the moment of recruitment on-wards, clathrin is sufficient to form a vesicle.&quot;</p><p>I believe the statement should be more nuanced.

They are absolutely correct that more nuance was required to this and similar statements in the paper. By “clathrin alone” and “clathrin-only” we meant “no additional factors”, but this description overlooks the potential contribution of (i) membrane curvature and (ii) the hook used to recruit clathrin. A second issue is how our findings relate to CME at the plasma membrane.</p><p>We have removed all mentions of “clathin alone” and “clathrin-only” and refer only to a “clathrin-centric” mechanism. We really like the sentence highlighted by the Reviewer: “Our work suggests that from the moment of recruitment onwards, clathrin is sufficient to form a vesicle.” And couldn’t bear to change it. We have added nuance to this paragraph by stating two sentences later:</p><p>“It is important to note that in our system, we trigger the recruitment of clathrin to a pre-curved intracellular surface using a hook that may be active, and we are blind to potential mediators (cargo, lipids and other proteins) acting earlier. However, since clathrin recruitment defines the first stage of CCV formation – initiation – the proposed mechanism accounts for almost the entire pathway.”</p><p>The only place where we talk about clathrin-only is now the part where we specifically calculate whether clathrin alone could be responsible for vesicle formation. This section has also been significantly edited in response to the other Reviewers’ comments.</p><p>To tackle the second issue we have separated out the discussion of implications for CME from our calculations of MPDV budding and now have a distinct paragraph on this issue. Our previous discussion over-emphasised the “clathrin-centric” view and we realised it would be helpful to collate the differences between the two here. The paragraph continues:</p><p>“Given the differences between intracellular CCV formation and CME, the distinction between mediators and modulators at the plasma membrane may differ slightly.”</p><p>The Reviewer asks whether MitoPit formation is slower or less efficient than that which naturally occurs at the plasma membrane. We haven’t done a direct comparison to know for sure. Such a comparison is difficult perhaps the best way to do this would be <italic>indirectly</italic> with a lifetime analysis in TIRF of endogenous CME compared to hot-wired endocytosis and compare that data with MitoPit formation via confocal imaging and spot tracking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. &quot;previously, we reported that no clathrin-coated pits formed on mitochondria using a related anchor, pMito-PAGFP-FRB (Wood et al., 2017).

Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t fully understand why the efficiency is ~60%. Different hooks displayed a similar efficiency (beta1, AP180, epsin). It appears to be some combination of: (1) levels of transient expression of the FKBP and FRB containing proteins (our knocksideways experiments with knock-in of FKBP at the endogenous locus are higher efficiency); (2) cell state possibly affecting rapamycin accessibility to the cell (MitoPits can be triggered in mitotic cells, but the efficiency is ~30%); (3) experimenter-to-experimenter variability. The efficiency is sufficient to do our experiments and therefore we have not made a huge effort to increase it.</p><p>The anchor effect is strange. We have previously observed that the spacing of FRB from the mitochondria makes a difference for knocksideways experiments and although pMito-PAGFP-FRB is not very different from pMito-mCherry-FRB or pMito-dCherry-FRB, it is possible that this accounts for the difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. What was the logic for choosing the accessory proteins to screen for co-localization with mitopits (Figure 6 and S5)? It would be interesting to test if Esp15/R is co-localized to mitopits. Eps15 binds espin and was pulled down in the mass-spec Beta2 pulldown experiments (Schmid et al. PLOSBIO 2006). The other major protein found in the mass-spec data was intersectin.

In the least, the authors should discuss this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial motivation was to look for proteins that are reported to act upstream of dynamin in CME, e.g. amphiphysin, endophilin. We expanded to look at other accessory proteins, but it is clearly not a comprehensive survey. The question about Eps15 is interesting and we have now looked at this (<bold>Reviewer Figure 3</bold>). In short, we can see recruitment of endogenous Eps15 to MitoPits. If we express a dominant negative mutant known to inhibit CME (EH29, Benmerah et al. 1999 PMID: 10194409) which mislocalises endogenous Eps15, we still see the formation of MitoPits and MPDVs, which suggests that Eps15 is not essential for MitoPit formation. This fits with the general pattern that some accessory proteins, which can bind beta2 and/or clathrin, are forced to arrive at the MitoPIt even though they are not required; either because it is too late in pit formation, or that they cannot function at the mitochondrial outer membrane.</p><p>We have not included these new experiments in the paper, because we found that overexpression of WT Eps15-mCherry interferes with normal MitoPit formation (see large MitoPits, large endogenous Eps15 puncta and mitochondrial aggregates in <bold>Reviewer Figure 3</bold>). It's not clear to us if this artefact has any functional meaning. From these experiments though we can see that if we displace Eps15 with the dominant-negative mutant there is no effect on MPDV formation.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Eps15 recruitment to MitoPits.</title><p>(A) MitoPit formation in the presence of Eps15-mCherry or mutant EH29.

The authors must either acknowledge that molecular crowding cannot be eliminated as a possible explanation for their findings or provide a detailed stoichiometric analysis as described above.

The authors should remove statements suggesting that all of clathrin's adaptor proteins are only &quot;modulators&quot; rather than &quot;drivers&quot; of membrane remodeling.
