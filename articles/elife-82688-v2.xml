neuropsychiatric disorders. The diverse roles attributed to interactions between the BLA and PFC may reflect multiple circuits nested within a wider network. To examine these circuits, we first used retrograde and anterograde anatomy to show that the rostral BLA (rBLA) and caudal BLA (cBLA) differentially project to prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the mouse PFC. Using ex vivo whole-cell recordings and optogenetics, we then assessed which neuronal subtypes are targeted, showing that rBLA preferentially drives layer 2 (L2) cortico-amygdalar (CA) neurons in PL, whereas cBLA drives layer 5 (L5) pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in IL. We next combined in vivo silicon probe recordings and optogenetics to confirm that cBLA mainly influences IL L5, whereas rBLA primarily activates PL L2, but also evokes polysynaptic activity in PL L5. Lastly, we used soma-tagged optogenetics to explore the local circuits linking superficial and deep layers of PL, showing how rBLA can engage L2 CA neurons to impact L5 PT neuron activity. Together, our findings delineate how subregions of the BLA target distinct networks within the PFC and differentially influence output from PL and IL.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>circuits</kwd><kwd>cell types</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH085974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Adam G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 23 MH019524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manoocheri</surname><given-names>Kasra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The prelimbic and infralimbic prefrontal cortex (PFC) process distinct inputs from rostral and caudal basolateral amygdala (BLA), which engage different populations of projection neurons, via both direct connections and polysynaptic activity within the local network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Connections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate memory and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Etkin et al., 2011</xref>). Dysfunction of these connections contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilboa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McTeague et al., 2020</xref>). The BLA sends strong excitatory inputs to the PFC, which contact specific cell types to drive local activity and output to downstream brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheriyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>). However, previous studies have treated the BLA and PFC as monolithic entities, whereas each structure contains multiple subregions that may have distinct connections and functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDonald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hintiryan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The PFC is subdivided along the dorsoventral axis into the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van De Werd et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van De Werd and Uylings, 2014</xref>), which play different functional roles in behavioral paradigms like threat conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, the BLA is subdivided along the rostro-caudal axis into anterior (magnocellular) and posterior (parvocellular) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDonald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">OâLeary et al., 2020</xref>), which also play distinct roles in aversive and appetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Anatomical studies using transgenic mice suggest one population of cells in anterior BLA targets PL, while a separate group in posterior BLA targets IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent work suggests a more complicated relationship, with multiple projections from cells distributed along the rostral to caudal axis of the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hintiryan et al., 2021</xref>), which have an unknown influence on activity and output of the PFC.</p><p>In addition to contacting different subregions and layers, long-range inputs often make targeted connections onto specific cell types in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anastasiades and Carter, 2021</xref>). Recent studies suggest that glutamatergic projections from the BLA may differentially activate specific networks in PL compared to IL. BLA inputs to PL target layer 2 (L2) cortico-amygdalar (CA) neurons, which in turn project back to the BLA, forming a direct, reciprocal circuit under the control of local inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>). In contrast, BLA connections in IL can activate layer 5 (L5) pyramidal tract (PT) neurons, which project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and other brain regions to exert top-down control of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheriyan et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesize that these opposing findings reflect distinct connections from rostral BLA (rBLA) and caudal BLA (cBLA) onto specific cell types within PL and IL, reflecting two parallel networks that link these brain regions.</p><p>In addition to their direct connections, long-range inputs can evoke polysynaptic excitation and inhibition in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Connections within and across layers are understudied in PFC, but well explored in other cortices that lack layer 4 (L4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>). In motor cortex, layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons project to deeper layers and target L5 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirai et al., 2012</xref>), whereas L5 PT neurons predominantly target nearby L5 PT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006</xref>). Similarly, inhibition mediated by local interneurons is transmitted within and across layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">KÃ¤tzel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saffari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). By activating specific cell types in different layers, the BLA can evoke complex polysynaptic activity, but it is unknown how rBLA and cBLA inputs engage these circuits.</p><p>Here, we examine how the rBLA and cBLA target distinct subregions, layers, and cell types in the mouse PL and IL. We first use anatomy to show that rBLA primarily projects to PL, and cBLA mostly projects to IL, indicating distinct connections. We next use ex vivo recordings and optogenetics to assess cell type-specific connections, showing that rBLA preferentially activates PL L2 CA neurons and cBLA engages IL L5 PT neurons. We then combine in vivo recordings with optogenetics and find that while cBLA influences are restricted to IL L5, rBLA drives both PL L2 and evokes robust polysynaptic activity in PL L5. Lastly, using soma-tagged optogenetics, we establish that this local influence reflects connections from PL L2 CA neurons onto PL L5 PT neurons within PL. Together, our findings illustrate how rBLA and cBLA evoke activity in PL and IL, demonstrating how subregions of the BLA engage distinct cortical networks in the PFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct projections of rostral and caudal BLA to PL and IL PFC</title><p>To confirm if subregions of the PFC receive distinct and spatially segregated inputs from the BLA, we first injected retrograde viruses (AAVrg-tdTomato and AAVrg-GFP) into both PL and IL of the same animals, at offset anteriorâposterior coordinates to minimize potential overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed largely separate populations of PL and IL-projecting neurons across the BLA, with a smaller population of dual-projection neurons (PL = 583 Â± 59 cells, IL = 694 Â± 78 cells, dual = 246 Â± 30 cells, <italic>n</italic> = 3 animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We also found a similar gradient in experiments in which we injected AAVrg-tdTomato into PL or IL at the same anteriorâposterior coordinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Anatomically, we found that non-overlapping neurons in the rBLA and cBLA send distinct axonal projections to the PL and IL. In slices, connections are cell type specific, with rBLA primarily contacting and driving PL L2 CA neurons, and cBLA mainly engaging IL L5 PT neurons. In the intact brain, cBLA activates IL L5, whereas rBLA both activates PL L2 and generates a mix of excitation and inhibition across L5. In the local circuit, PL L2 CA neurons mediate polysynaptic responses at PL L5 PT neurons, allowing rBLA inputs to influence subcortical output. Together, our findings reveal several new levels of organization for parallel circuits linking the BLA and PFC.</p><p>The BLA is integral for emotional behaviors, with function varying across the rostro-caudal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Senn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>). We focused on the rostral and caudal poles of the BLA, which correspond to the anatomically segregated and functionally opposed anterior BLA and posterior BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pi et al., 2020</xref>). We found, rBLA projects to PL L2 and cBLA projects to IL L5, as had been described with the Rspo2-Cre and Cartpt-Cre transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). However, we also found that rBLA projects to IL L5, which was not seen in Rspo2-cre lines, and also evoked in vivo responses. This separate rBLA to IL L5 projection was also seen in a recent study of amygdalocortical connectivity, which defined multiple distinct projections from anterior BLA to PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hintiryan et al., 2021</xref>). Equivalent connectivity is also found in primates, with magnocellular BLA projecting to superficial layers of area 32, a primate analogue of rBLA projecting to PL, and parvocellular BLA projecting more diffusely to L5 of area 25, a primate analogue of cBLA projecting to IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>). This homologous circuit organization suggests that divergent rBLA and cBLA projections to the PFC are a conserved element of amygdalocortical connectivity. There is likely additional diversity in these circuits, as gradients in cell types and projection targets are also observed in the medial-lateral and ventralâdorsal axes of the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGarry and Carter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">OâLeary et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the intact brain, BLA activity can evoke both excitation and inhibition of PFC neurons in a valence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>). In our in vivo recordings, we found that stimulation of rBLA and cBLA also causes distinct patterns of activation and suppression across subregions and layers of the PFC. rBLA exerts broad influence over most of PFC, with strong activation of PL L2, but also suppression of PL L5 and IL L5. While we expected a delay between PL L2 and PL L5 given our ex vivo physiology, we did not see any significant differences in the latency to fire among activated units, although technical limitations such as being unable to record L2 and L5 in a single recording, combined with relatively few activated units in PL L5, could obscure more subtle differences in spike timing. In contrast, cBLA generates a mix of activation and suppression in IL L5, but has only minimal influence on either PL L2 or PL L5. This evoked activity does not reflect a simple gradient of rBLA to dorsal PFC and cBLA to ventral PFC, with the divergence of L5 responses highlighting how rBLA and cBLA are not merely parallel pathways from a single input. Interestingly, IL L5 is particularly important for threat processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukalo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloodgood et al., 2018</xref>), and we find it can be suppressed by rBLA but activated by cBLA inputs. In the future, it will be particularly important to determine how rBLA and cBLA projections to the PFC encode emotional valence, including threat processing.</p><p>Our slice physiology revealed cell type-specific connectivity, with rBLA primarily targeting reciprocally projecting PL L2 CA neurons, and cBLA almost exclusively targeting subcortically projecting IL L5 PT neurons that directly influence subcortical nuclei involved in threat responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloodgood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). These findings help reconcile previous studies, which showed how non-spatially restricted BLA inputs target PL L2 CA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>) and IL L5 PT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheriyan et al., 2016</xref>). While IL L2 CA neurons also receive input from both rBLA and cBLA, these connections are weaker than onto the primary targets of each input. Interestingly, PL L5 PT neurons receive no direct input from either rBLA or cBLA, even though they are strongly implicated in mediating threat detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, we found PL L5 PT neurons receive polysynaptic excitation from rBLA via PL L2 CA neurons, as well as inhibition via the local circuit. These findings provide a mechanism for how differences in cell type-specific targeting and activation from BLA to PL and IL arise from different presynaptic BLA subregions.</p><p>Several of our experiments indicate that rBLA and cBLA inputs evoke distinct patterns of excitation and inhibition across subregions and layers of the PFC.

In contrast, our slice recordings show cBLA evokes prominent excitation and inhibition only at IL L5 PT neurons, again consistent with our in vivo studies. In the future, it will be important to establish which interneurons mediate rBLA and cBLA-evoked inhibition in L5 across subregions of the PFC, and determine if they are similar to interneurons targeted by glutamatergic inputs from contralateral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>), thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades et al., 2021</xref>), or hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Repetitive rBLA and cBLA inputs generate cell type-specific firing in the PFC, allowing them to activate distinct output pathways either directly or via the local circuit. rBLA drives PL L2 CA neurons, consistent with previous work showing BLA engages in a reciprocal loop with PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGarry and Carter, 2017</xref>), which in turn evoke polysynaptic excitation and inhibition in PL L5 PT neurons. In contrast, cBLA strongly activates IL L5 PT neurons, has minimal influence on PL L2 CA, IL L2 CA, or IL L5 CA neurons, and evokes minimal polysynaptic responses in PL L5. Interestingly, evoked activity is different from ventral hippocampal inputs, which are another major afferent to IL and primarily engage L5 IT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). Our finding of minimal inter-subregion connectivity contrasts with prior work showing connections from IL L5/6 to PL L5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marek et al., 2018</xref>). One explanation is that communication is mediated by L5 IT neurons, which are poorly activated by cBLA inputs. In contrast, L5 PT neurons are a major output pathway across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Economo et al., 2018</xref>), and have relatively few connections locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morishima and Kawaguchi, 2006</xref>), consistent with the limited impact of cBLA activity on PL.</p><p>As a mechanism for how signals spread in the PFC, we found that PL L2 CA neurons project to PL L5 PT neurons and not neighboring PL L5 IT neurons. Interestingly, these connections bypass L3, reminiscent of superficial neurons crossing L4 when projecting to deeper layers of sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>). The extreme bias in targeting of L5 PT over L5 IT also agrees with targeted connectivity from superficial to deep layers observed in other parts of frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). It also suggests a fundamental difference in L2/3 connectivity within the local circuit between sensory and frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, our results are complemented by recent high-throughput circuit mapping of CA neuron local connectivity in PFC, which finds that CA neurons preferentially synapse onto other CA neurons, and that L2 and L5 CA neurons display distinct connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Printz et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that PL L2 CA neurons serve as a crucial node in a disynaptic feedforward circuit, which links rBLA input specifically to PL L5 PT neurons without significant input to L3 or other L5 neurons. Consequently, the influence of rBLA on PFC output will depend on the neuromodulatory state, which may alter the tightly balanced CA-evoked excitation and inhibition onto PL L5 PT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floresco and Tse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Long-range circuits involving the PFC exist in multiple motifs, including unidirectional connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>), âclosedâ reciprocal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>), and âopenâ reciprocal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2018</xref>). Our results confirm that rBLA participates in a rare example of a closed reciprocal loop with PL, contacting L2 CA neurons that in turn project back to the rBLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>). These connections are also under inhibitory control via local interneurons, which prevent recurrent excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>). In contrast, cBLA does not participate in a closed or open reciprocal loop with IL, instead making unidirectional connections onto L5 PT neurons. These connections differ from vHPC inputs, which are also unidirectional but instead contact IL L5 IT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>), and also differ from thalamic inputs that instead contact L2/3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2018</xref>) and the apical dendrites of L5 PT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, cBLA inputs appear most similar to callosal inputs from the contralateral PFC, which span multiple layers, but within L5 are also biased onto PT neurons, although not to the same degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anastasiades and Carter, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results determine how rBLA and cBLA make distinct projections to PL and IL, driving the activity of different output pathways via two unique circuits. Along with recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), our results contribute to a new framework to study the role of BLA-PFC circuits, with important implications for understanding the role of this circuit in behavior. For example, BLA to PL projections are necessary for expression of threat conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Senn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>), and because rBLA is the main input to PL, our findings are consistent with the rBLA playing a key role in aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pi et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, BLA to IL projections are involved in the extinction of threat conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Senn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klavir et al., 2017</xref>), and because cBLA is the primary input to IL, our findings are also consistent with cBLA being involved in this learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). What remains less clear is how these different streams of positive and negative valence may in turn bias PL toward encoding negative valence and IL toward encoding positive valence. Previous work suggests that PL and IL are functionally opposed on retrieval versus extinction of conditioned responses, respectively, regardless of the valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Otis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloodgood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2019</xref>). Further complicating this model of BLA function is recent work suggesting that there are neurons that encode both positive and negative valence within the rBLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), which means both PL and IL could receive signals encoding positive and negative valence from different sources in the BLA. In the future, it will be important to explicitly test these ideas by measuring activity in specific subcircuits of the BLA and PFC during different forms of motivated behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experiments involved P28âP70 wild-type mice on a C57 BL/6J background.

The St-ChroME virus was diluted 1:10 in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to injection. Simultaneous virus and tracer injections were mixed in a 1:1 virus:tracer ratio, except for experiments involving axonal stimulation evoked firing, which used a 3:2 virus:tracer ratio. Following injections, the pipette was left in place for an additional 10 min before being slowly withdrawn to ensure injections remained local. Retrograde-Cre experiments to label CA neurons were carried out in a similar manner, with injection of AAVrg-hSyn-Cre (Addgene 105553-AAVrg).

An AgCl reference electrode was implanted contralateral to the recording site, attached to an external gold pin. A multimode, 200 Âµm ID fiber optic connected to a 1.25-mm steel ferrule (Thorlabs) was implanted in either the rBLA or cBLA.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Rostral and caudal BLA engage distinct circuits in the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with members of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers find that the work is expertly performed and provides careful characterization of physiologically demonstrated connections between BLA and mPFC. However, they note that this is an active area of research, with many recent publications on connectivity between these regions, albeit mostly with anatomical approaches so far, thus somewhat reducing the novelty of the findings. Further, the reviewers felt that the proposed parallel circuit motifs would need broader experimental support. If the authors are interested, we would be interested in seeing a substantially revised new paper that addresses the criticisms outlined in the detailed individual reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Manoocheri and Carter describe two parallel circuits that originate from two subregions in the basal-lateral amygdala, rBLA and cBLA, projecting to two subregions in the prefrontal cortex, PL and IL in a cell type-specific fashion. The strength of the current work includes: the importance of obtaining the detailed circuits in order to understand the amygdala-PFC function; the slice physiology experiments, which is the main readout of the work, is expertly done; the finding that local circuits in PL mediate some of BLA input is interesting. The enthusiasm for the current work is greatly dampened because a series of previous studies already confirmed the major hypothesis that the current work aimed to test and there is significant overlap in the details of the finding, reducing the novelty of the work. The central statement that 'it remains completely unknown how this (BLA influences on the PFC) differs between rBLA and cBLA inputs' is not really accurate. For example, Kim et al. 2016 showed that anterior/rostral BLA projects to Pl and posterior/caudal BLA projects to IL and these two circuits are segregated at gene expression level, anatomical level, and behavioral and functional level. The major conclusion of the current work that there are parallel rBLA-PL and cBLA-IL circuits seems like a recapitulation of Figure 7B in Kim et al. Follow up work in Zhang et al. 2020 further illustrated the function of PL projecting BLA neurons in fear extinction. In addition, recent anatomy studies of comprehensive BLA projections (Hintiryan et al., 2021) confirmed the notion of differential projections from BLA to PL and IL and provided further refinement of the subregion specificity in the anterior BLA projects to the PL and IL, some of which appeared to be different from the current study. E.g., Hintiryan et al. showed that rBLA project to both PL and IL and the origins differ within the anterior BLA. These potential differences are not addressed in the current work. Such published circuit mapping, together with previous in vitro slice physiology work (including beautiful papers from the Cater lab) that described BLA inputs to L2 in PL, L5 in IL, and inhibitory network in IL allows the deduction of the significant amount of conclusion here.

There are strong presence of IL CA neurons located in L5 (Figure 3B) but their responses were not mentioned.

What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript Manoocheri and Carter describe two parallel circuits that originate from two subregions in the basal-lateral amygdala, rBLA and cBLA, projecting to two subregions in the prefrontal cortex, PL and IL in a cell type-specific fashion. The strength of the current work includes: the importance of obtaining the detailed circuits in order to understand the amygdala-PFC function; the slice physiology experiments, which is the main readout of the work, is expertly done; the finding that local circuits in PL mediate some of BLA input is interesting. The enthusiasm for the current work is greatly dampened because a series of previous studies already confirmed the major hypothesis that the current work aimed to test and there is significant overlap in the details of the finding, reducing the novelty of the work. The central statement that 'it remains completely unknown how this (BLA influences on the PFC) differs between rBLA and cBLA inputs' is not really accurate. For example, Kim et al. 2016 showed that anterior/rostral BLA projects to Pl and posterior/caudal BLA projects to IL and these two circuits are segregated at gene expression level, anatomical level, and behavioral and functional level. The major conclusion of the current work that there are parallel rBLA-PL and cBLA-IL circuits seems like a recapitulation of Figure 7B in Kim et al. Follow up work in Zhang et al. 2020 further illustrated the function of PL projecting BLA neurons in fear extinction. In addition, recent anatomy studies of comprehensive BLA projections (Hintiryan et al., 2021) confirmed the notion of differential projections from BLA to PL and IL and provided further refinement of the subregion specificity in the anterior BLA projects to the PL and IL, some of which appeared to be different from the current study. E.g., Hintiryan et al. showed that rBLA project to both PL and IL and the origins differ within the anterior BLA. These potential differences are not addressed in the current work. Such published circuit mapping, together with previous in vitro slice physiology work (including beautiful papers from the Cater lab) that described BLA inputs to L2 in PL, L5 in IL, and inhibitory network in IL allows the deduction of the significant amount of conclusion here. Although some new details added, the relatively large body of previous work further reduces the impact of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments, but we disagree with their assertion that âprevious studies already confirmed the major hypothesisâ of our study. It is true that previous anatomy studies have shown distinct rBLAÃ PL and cBLAÃ IL projections. For example, the cited Kim et al. 2016 paper shows two populations of neurons within the amygdala, and their Figure 7B is similar to our Figure 1B/C, whereas their Figure 7O/P is similar to our Figure 1E/F, which is all anatomy. However, we note that the follow-up work of Zhang et al. 2020 is a behavior study, which is focused entirely within the cBLA, and has no overlap with any of our experiments. The recent Hintiryan et al. 2021 paper is an elegant and rigorous anatomy study of amygdala neurons and their connections, including in the PFC. However, we disagree that our results conflict, as we also see direct rBLA projections to both PL and IL. That said, we agree that paper reveals additional anatomical details that we did not explore, including a model for further segregation of rBLA, and we delve into how our findings compare in our revised Discussion.</p><p>In contrast to these papers, our own work primarily focuses on the physiological impact of different connections at different cell types. As noted by the reviewer, we and others have found that BLA input targets L2 CA neurons in PL and L5 PT cells in IL. The current paper reconciles these findings by showing that PL L2 CA neurons and IL L5 PT cells are targeted and activated by rBLA and cBLA, respectively (Figures 2 and 3). It also moves well beyond those studies to look at the polysynaptic networks that are engaged within the PFC, providing a mechanism for how BLA inputs can ultimately influence PT output from PL without direct connections (Figures 5-7). Lastly, it also advances beyond prior slice physiology to show how networks are differentially engaged as a result of rBLA or cBLA stimulation within the intact brain (Figure 4). We are unaware of any other work showing the in vivo activity that occurs when specifically driving rBLA or cBLA inputs to PL and IL. The foundational work in Kim et al. 2016 and Zhang et al. 2020 does not relate rBLA or cBLA activation with downstream activity in PFC, so there is relatively little known about the actual physiologic role of these circuits. Therefore, while we agree Figure 1 recapitulates anatomical findings and validates our ability to specifically target rBLA and cBLA with viral injections, Figures 2-7 contain an abundance of new experiments. Finally, we note that previous papers looking at these circuits have not disambiguated rBLA and cBLA inputs to the PFC. In many cases, they have also not distinguished between the different populations of postsynaptic neurons in the PFC. Our work shows that considering both inputs and cell types is critical for understanding how the BLA and PFC interact with each other.</p><p>In our revision, we more clearly describe the previous anatomical and behavioral studies that motivated our experiments. However, we hope the reviewer now appreciates that our results help to fill an important gap between anatomy and behavior. We think our findings are an important advance, which be of broad interest and have a genuine impact on the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It will be important to show full injection sites (not just one section), particularly for targeting PL and IL since they are in close proximity. In fact, the example in Figure 1B looks like there is contamination in PL when targeting IL.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point about our anatomy, related to those raised by Reviewers #2 and #3. In our revision, we now include more injection site images in Figure 1B, and we include a new set of experiments to further validate our retrograde anatomy (Figures 1-S1 and S2), which also includes the injection sites from each animal. We do not think we have contamination in PL when targeting IL, as we see similar distributions when we target PL and IL in separate animals (Figure 1-S1). We also note that both of the retrograde experiments in Figure 1A-C are also substantiated by our anterograde experiments in Figures 1D-F. Together, we think these changes make our initial anatomy clearer and better motivate our other work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The projections shown in Figure1E suggest that axons of both colors have strong presence in the IL and PL, and in Figure1-supplent 1C axons of both colors have strong presence in PL. Is this different from the authors interpretation? These data actually are more consistent with the conclusions in Hintiryan et al. that PL actually receives both inputs from rBLA and cBLA. This might also explain the detected responses in IL when stimulating rBLA: there was significant number of neurons responded, although smaller population. Also, it might be useful to add quantification in Figure1-supplent 1C, similar to Figure 1F.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point and is correct that there are rBLA and cBLA axons in both PL and IL. While cBLA and rBLA provide different synaptic drive to PL and IL, there is quite a bit of axonal overlap, as described in Hintiryan et al. 2021. In our revision, we build on our initial axon anatomy in Figure 1 with new experiments in Figure1-S2 that shows how projections from PL- projecting rBLA neurons and IL-projecting cBLA neurons collateralize within the PFC. These findings motivated us to look at the physiological impact of these two BLA inputs to these two regions of the PFC. Using slice physiology, we first found these inputs target specific cell types in both PL and IL (Figures 2-3). Using in vivo physiology, we then found that rBLA and cBLA evoke different responses in PL and IL (Figure 4). Overall, we think our (brief) anatomical analysis in Figure 1 is generally in alignment with previous studies, such as seeing rBLA axon in both PL L2 and IL L5, which is similar to Hintiryan et al. 2021. However, we also think that our (much more thorough) and slice and in vivo physiology analysis in the other 6 figures provide a substantial advance over previous work. Importantly, we think our results argue that anatomy alone cannot show which networks are engaged, which is revealed using physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are strong presence of IL CA neurons located in L5 (Figure 3B) but their responses were not mentioned. According to the example images, it seems like CA neurons are predominantly located in the IL and PT neurons are predominantly located in the PL.

How would this impact Figure 6 diagram?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point, which was also noted by Reviewers #2 and #3, and which we now clarify in the text. We do not think that L5 PT cells are predominantly located in PL, as has been shown in multiple studies (Vertes, 2004; Gabbott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005) and we have now chosen a more representative image. There is known to be a population of L5 CA neurons in IL with physiological properties and axonal projections that overlaps with L5 IT neurons (Avesar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022), which we have already shown are not targeted by cBLA. As suggested by the reviewers, we now include several new experiments to show that cBLA and rBLA do not target these neurons (Figure 2-S1) and that cBLA does not drive IL L5 CA and IL L2 CA neurons, even when IL L5 PT neurons are activated (Figure 5-S1). Note that we do not think that our summary diagram is impacted, as neither rBLA nor cBLA appreciably targets these neurons. Overall, we thank the reviewer for making this point, but we hope that our response clarifies any misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We would note that the first figure shows the âfunctional anatomyâ of how rBLA and cBLA engage different cell types in PL and IL by restricting synaptic transmission to solely rBLA or cBLA terminals containing ChR2. In contrast, the latter figure shows the physiological responses, including the short-term dynamics, feed-forward inhibition, and evoked firing. These two data sets are complementary rather than overlapping, and together provide a comprehensive picture of how BLA engages PFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a solid, well-designed study that provides a new level of anatomical and functional dissection of the BLA-mPFC circuit and is an important contribution to the field.

In separate experiments, we further validated the differential axon projections by injecting AAVrg-Cre in PL or IL, followed by AAV-DIO-YFP in the BLA. These experiments show a very similar distribution of axonal projections as in Figure 1D-F, further validating the differences in rBLA and cBLA connectivity, as well as our ability to target these regions with anterograde viruses.

Please note we did these controls in Figure 6BandC, where patterned stimulation in L2/3 activated ChroME+ cells in L2/3 but not L5, and patterned stimulation in L5 activated cells in L5 but not L2/3, which allowed us to selectively activate L2/3. As described in the Methods, we chose conditions that allowed us to achieve selective activation of L2 CA neurons without activating L5 CA neurons at all.

We suspect there may have been some confusion about the nature of CA neurons, which we now clarify in the text. There are indeed CA neurons in L5 of IL, but these are IT cells that also project to the contralateral PFC and striatum (Avesar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Therefore, we already started to examine the cBLA inputs onto these cells in our original manuscript, in which we showed that cBLA makes much stronger connections onto IL L5 PT cells than IL L5 IT cells. We now supplement these experiments with new monosynaptic synaptic targeting recordings, which show a strong bias from cBLA axons onto L5 PT neurons over L5 CA neurons in IL (Figure 2-S1). In our revision, we also perform new experiments testing whether IL L2 CA and IL L5 CA cells are activated by polysynaptic responses following cBLA stimulation of IL PT cells (Figure 5-S1). We find no evidence of cBLA activation of either IL L2 or IL L5 CA neurons, even when responses are suprathreshold at IL L5 PT neurons. We thank the reviewer for raising this point, which our new experiments have now addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests the BLA are anatomically segregated based on molecular markers, axonal projection, and function.

We have also performed new anatomy experiments to assess the divergence of rBLA and cBLA inputs to PL and IL (Figure 1-S2). Lastly, we would note that superficial layers are not the main projection targets of cBLA, which sends axons to both L2 and L5 (Figure 1E), but mostly contacts L5 PT cells in L5 (as seen in Figures 2,3,4 and 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

It is true that there are subtypes of L5 PT cells, which we have noted in the discussion. It is also possible there may be several L2 and/or L5 CA cells, but we have no evidence of this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Recommendation #1:</p><p>Please add more detail regarding the injection sites (Figure 1 and Figure 1- S1 show one representative section in each animal). With the newly added soma sections in 1B, it will be interesting to state whether there are double-labeled neurons (magenta and cyan).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added additional injection site images for the dual AAVrg-XFP experiments (see Figure 1 â S1H and I) and have included more information about the injection site locations in the figure legends. Please note that we have already quantified the amount of overlap between IL and PL projecting, dual-labeled cells in the BLA and found relatively few of them across the R-C axis (see Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related, it will be good to explain in Figure1-S2 B experiment, whether the injection of AAVrg-cre mostly resides in L2 (Similar experiments in Figure 1-S2F nicely show that injection covers the entire IL). This will strengthen the observation that rBLA mainly projects to L2 in PL, and this is not due to that the injection only targets L2.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that we have already stated that the AAVrg-Cre injection does not reside in a specific layer. In general, we have found it is almost impossible to restrict AAVs to particular layers, and AAVrg certainly spreads too far (typical radius ~500 Âµm). In our revision, we have now added a plot of fluorescence vs laminar location of the PFC for all of the injections (Figure 1 â S2C and H). We found that both our IL and PL targeted injections of AAVrg-cre span L2 (180-220 Âµm from pia) and L5 (350-650 Âµm).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation #2:</p><p>Please add quantification in Figure 2A image for layer distribution which will help readers appreciate the cell distribution of the projection neurons, and also cite Ferreira et al., 2015 paper which has the same PAG and amygdala injection and quantified the distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now further quantified the distributions of cells across layer (Figure 2 â S1J). Please note that this kind of analysis has already been done in several previous papers, many of which we previously cited, and we have now also added the Ferreira et al., 2015 paper, as requested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
