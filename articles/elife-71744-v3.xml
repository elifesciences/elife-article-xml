The amount of morphogen that is taken up and initiates signaling did not change when the level of morphogen expression was varied between 50 and 200% (Hh) or 50 and 350% (Wg). Similar properties were observed for Dpp. We analyzed an area of 150 μm×150 μm that includes Hh-responding cells of the disc as well as overlying tracheal cells and myoblasts that are also activated by disc-produced Hh. We found that the extent of signaling in the disc was unaffected by the presence or absence of the tracheal and myoblast cells, suggesting that the mechanism that disperses Hh specifies its destinations to particular cells, and that target cells do not take up Hh from a common pool.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>wingless</kwd><kwd>decapentaplegic</kwd><kwd>cytoneme</kwd><kwd>dispersion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122548</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatori</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Delivery of Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic and Wingless to target cells in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc is regulated in both amount and destination, and is not dependent on constitutive release or uptake from a common pool.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signaling by morphogen proteins controls many aspects of development, homeostasis, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tabata and Takei, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taipale and Beachy, 2001</xref>). These signaling proteins are released from cells that produce them, and they distribute across the tissues they target, forming concentration gradients that induce signal transduction and activate gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. The importance of regulation by morphogen gradients to growth, cell fate, and patterning underlies the imperative to understand how morphogens disperse across tissues.</p><p>For more than a century, it was assumed that morphogens spread across tissues by passive diffusion in extracellular space (either ‘free’ or ‘restricted’), and both experimental observations and theoretical modeling have been offered in support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>). Spreading morphogen proteins have been proposed to exist in various forms, including as multimeric complexes or encapsulated in lipoprotein particles, exosomes, or micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christian, 2012</xref>). Implicit in these models are the ideas that signaling is proportional to amounts of signaling proteins produced by designated groups of cells, and that release creates an extracellular pool of signaling protein that distributes in extracellular fluid in ways that are dependent on interactions with substances that are encountered or until they are removed from the pool by degradation or by receptor-mediated absorption. The pool is assumed to be formed by constitutive release from producing cells.</p><p>An alternative mechanism of dispersion is direct exchange at cell-cell contacts, and the contrasts with diffusion-based modes of dissemination have been reviewed extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gradilla and Guerrero, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kornberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roy and Kornberg, 2015</xref>). Specialized filopodia called cytonemes are conduits that transport and transfer signaling proteins to target cells at synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">González-Méndez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kornberg, 2016</xref>). Evidence for the essential role of cytonemes in morphogen signaling includes many identified genetic conditions that impair cytonemes, reduce cytoneme contacts, and compromise signaling. Although their fine structure is not fully understood, cytonemes contain actin filaments, ribosomes, and proteins that confer voltage sensitivity, calcium dependence, and glutamatergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Junyent et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wood et al., 2021</xref>). These features, as well as the close apposition of pre- and postsynaptic membranes at cytoneme synapses, are also characteristic of neuronal glutamatergic synapses. Neuronal synapses have another key feature—signaling is titrated by frequency and quantity of neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles, and by efficiency of neurotransmitter clearance from the synaptic gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blakely and Edwards, 2012</xref>). It is not known if cytoneme synapses also store morphogen signaling proteins in synaptic vesicles and if morphogen signaling at cytoneme synapses is also dependent on regulated release and uptake.</p><p>Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt homolog Wingless (Wg), and Bone morphogenic protein homolog Decapentaplegic (Dpp) are evolutionarily conserved morphogen signaling proteins that have been implicated in organogenesis and stem cell maintenance, and their misregulation in mammals has been linked to inherited diseases and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). In the columnar cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc, Hh is expressed specifically and uniformly by posterior (P) compartment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the wing blade primordium of the wing disc, Hh released by P compartment cells is taken up by anterior (A) compartment cells within 30 μm (10 cells) of the anterior/posterior (A/P) compartment border. Transfers of Hh from the P to A compartment cells are cytoneme-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Hh in the A compartment distributes to form a concentration gradient that induces signal transduction and activates expression of target genes in partially overlapping stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). These domains of expression reflect graded responses to Hh, from highest and ‘short-range’ (<italic>engrailed</italic> [<italic>en</italic>]<italic>, patched</italic> [<italic>ptc</italic>], and <italic>dpp</italic>) to lowest and ‘long-range’ (<italic>cubitus interruptus</italic> [<italic>ci</italic>]).

To investigate this question, we asked if the Hh, Wg, and Dpp distributions are dependent and proportional to the amount produced. We also asked if the three target tissues that respond to disc-produced Hh take up Hh from a common pool. Our data show that the delivery of signaling proteins to target cells is regulated with respect to both amount and destination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Relationship between Hh production and Hh signaling in the wing disc</title><p>Neurotransmitters that are made, packaged, and stored in presynaptic compartments are functionally inert, their precisely controlled release and delivery for juxtacrine activation a signature property of synaptic signaling. In order to investigate whether the release of Hh might be regulated at cytoneme synapses, we analyzed Hh signaling in genotypes that express different amounts of Hh. We tested whether amounts of Hh and Hh signaling in recipient cells are proportional to Hh production, as might be expected of constitutive, unregulated release by producing cells, or if they are independent of production as might be expected of regulated release and delivery.</p><p>We first monitored Hh signaling in wing discs with genotypes that vary the number of wildtype (WT) <italic>hh</italic> genes and <italic>hh</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>hh</italic> transgenes were (1) BAC plasmids containing the WT <italic>hh</italic> transcription unit in a genomic fragment of 40 kb (HS) or 101 kb (HL), or HS-GFP, the 40 kb genomic fragment into which GFP has been recombined in frame (Hh:GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>); and (2) a Hh:GFP construct expressed under GAL4 control. Flies without a functional <italic>hh</italic> gene die as embryos, but haploid flies with one BAC transgene (encoding Hh [HS, HL, or HS-GFP]) had normal appearance and wing discs had normal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Hh:GFP encoded by this transgene is therefore presumed to be a functional surrogate for the normal, WT protein.</p><p>To investigate how the production of <italic>hh</italic> RNA and Hh protein in the wing disc scale with gene dosage, we measured amounts of <italic>hh</italic> RNA by qPCR and amounts of Hh protein by monitoring α-Hh antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Genotypes with 1 (1× WT), 2 (2× WT), 3 (2× WT, 1× BAC), or 4 (2× WT, 2× BAC) <italic>hh</italic> genes had amounts of <italic>hh</italic> RNA in wing discs which increased with gene dosage and scaled linearly. Hh protein in the P compartment (Hh-producing) cells of the wing blade primordium increased 2.9× in genotypes with 3 <italic>hh</italic> genes versus 1. These results show that in this range of gene copy number, both <italic>hh</italic> RNA and Hh protein are produced in direct proportion to gene dosage. We also measured <italic>hh</italic> RNA in wing discs with 2 WT <italic>hh</italic> genes and transgenes containing <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS-hh:GFP</italic>, and observed that the amount increased approximately 15× over WT.</p><p>To determine if different amounts of Hh expression change signaling, growth, and patterning, we examined several parameters which are sensitive to Hh signaling: expression of a gene targets of Hh signal transduction, and size and shape of the wing and wing disc. Expression of the <italic>ptc</italic> gene in the wing disc is upregulated by Hh signaling in a band of cells at the A/P compartment border. The width of this band decreases under conditions of reduced Hh signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molnar et al., 2011</xref>), and increases under conditions in which Hh signaling is elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang and Holmgren, 1999</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, the size of the Ptc band did not change in discs with 1, 2, 3, or 4 <italic>hh</italic> gene copies, despite the differences in <italic>hh</italic> RNA and Hh protein amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). In contrast, Hh overexpression driven by <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> changed both the size and shape of the Ptc band. Expression of Knot (Kn), which like Ptc expression is regulated by Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vervoort et al., 1999</xref>), did not change in genotypes with 1–4 <italic>hh</italic> gene copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We monitored wing size in the different genotypes by measuring the length (A/P border length from wing tip to wing base) and width (length of a line extending the posterior crossvein from anterior to posterior margin). These wing dimensions were not dependent on <italic>hh</italic> gene copy or expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). We monitored wing shape by comparing the length/width ratios of the different genotypes, and determined that only the <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>-driven (~15×) overexpression changed it significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). L3 wing discs were also similar in appearance except for the <italic>hhGal4</italic> genotype, which had an outgrowth anterior to the wing blade primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The only apparent change we noted to the adult morphology was the decrease in length/width ratio.</p><p>These findings indicate that the processes of production, maturation, secretion, transport, and uptake that disperses Hh in the wing disc generates a distribution in targets cells that is insensitive to changes in Hh amounts that 1–4 <italic>hh</italic> gene copies generate. The sensitivity to an excess of ~15-fold normal Hh generated by <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> reveals that the capacity of the process which buffers against changes in amounts of Hh production is limited. We do not know which step or steps in the process might be overwhelmed by the ~15× excess—if, for instance, Hh released in this overexpression condition is processed and modified normally, or if overexpressed Hh exits by the normal route. The important point is that there is a system that can compensate for different amounts of production. Previous studies characterized the robustness of Hh signaling to variations in either production or response, assuming that release from producing cells is constitutive and that robustness is solely an attribute of the signal transduction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We consider two possible alternatives.</p><p>If the amount of Hh taken up by the recipient, target cells are proportional to production, each recipient cell might scale the outputs of Hh signal transduction relative to its neighbors. This mechanism might adjust relative responses independently of absolute amounts, determining growth and pattern by the slope of the concentration gradient across a field of cells. This type of mechanism was proposed for the morphogen gradient of Dpp in order to model the effects of mosaic ectopic activation induced by the expression of a constitutively active Dpp receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rogulja and Irvine, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, the amount of Hh transferred from producing to responding cells might be regulated independently of the amount produced. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we quantified Hh in recipient cells of the wing blade primordium.</p><p>Quantification of Hh detected by antibody staining in the entire A and P compartments of the wing primordium of normal discs (2× WT) showed that approximately 5.2% was in the A compartment (n=7; standard deviation [SD]=1.2%). We next monitored Hh with α-Hh antibody in the small rectangular region composed of equal portions of the A and P compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in genotypes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 <italic>hh</italic> genes. As expected, Hh amounts were proportional to gene dosage in the P compartment portion of the rectangular region. The cells in this region produce Hh and this result is consistent with the analysis of the entire P compartment (described above) and the finding that Hh RNA and protein scale with gene dosage. Analysis of the anterior portion of the rectangular region revealed that Hh amounts were not detectably different in genotypes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 <italic>hh</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In sum, these results are consistent with the idea that most Hh produced in the P compartment is not taken up or retained by A compartment cells, and that Hh uptake is not linked directly to production. We also examined the intracellular localization of Hh to determine if it colocalized with Rab7, which concentrates in late endosomes. Association with Rab7 would suggest that a fraction of Hh produced in P compartment cells is destined for turnover, not release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hh delivery is constant in conditions that vary amounts of Hh production.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) α-Hh antibody staining in regions indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for indicated genotypes.

As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, α-GFP antibody staining of GFP-tagged Hh that is titrated with different amounts of untagged Hh distinguishes between constitutive and regulated delivery in these genotypes. If delivery of Hh to the A compartment is proportional to gene dosage and not regulated, Hh:GFP amounts in the A compartment are expected to be unaffected by co-production of untagged Hh, and Hh:GFP remains constant as gene dosage and production increases. However, if delivery is regulated, the fraction of Hh:GFP in the A compartment is expected to decrease as the fraction of untagged Hh increases in proportion to total gene copy and production.</p><p>Analysis of wing discs with one Hh:GFP BAC (BHS-GFP) and zero, one, or two WT <italic>hh</italic> genes shows that Hh:GFP in the producing cells of the P compartment was not diminished by the presence of <italic>hh</italic> genes that encode untagged Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).

In contrast, Hh:GFP amounts in the Hh-receiving cells of the A compartment decreased in proportion to number of <italic>hh</italic> genes that encode untagged Hh. This shows that Hh:GFP was diluted by the presence of untagged Hh, a result which is consistent with the amounts of Hh we detected in the A compartment with α-Hh antibody in genotypes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 <italic>hh</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

We stained wing discs with a high titer α-GFP antibody that detected BAC-encoded Hh:GFP, and analyzed genotypes with 1 or 3 genes that encode untagged Hh. For reference, total GFP fluorescence was determined in discs processed with our standard immunohistochemistry protocol that includes detergent permeabilization and formaldehyde fixation. GFP fluorescence increased in P compartment cells and decreased in A compartment cells in proportion to <italic>hh</italic> gene copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The extracellular staining protocol detected basolateral GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callejo et al., 2011</xref> who reported that Hh moves to the basolateral compartment prior to localization to basolateral cytonemes and export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>). Hh:GFP detected by the extracellular staining protocol was less than the total, as the fluorescence was visible only in the most basal optical sections and required higher laser power and gain settings (see Materials and methods), but direct quantitative comparisons are not possible because of the different protocols. Extracellular staining decreased in both P and A compartments in the presence of untagged Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that Hh exposed on the exterior of P compartment cells is gated.

To monitor different amounts of <italic>dpp</italic> expression, we compared wing discs with two or four <italic>dpp</italic> genes (two genes: +/+; four genes: +/+; <italic>BD/BD</italic>). First, to examine proportionality between <italic>dpp</italic> gene copy and Dpp protein, we stained wing discs with antibody that recognizes the prodomain of unprocessed Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Panganiban et al., 1990</xref>). Staining in cells that produce Dpp was approximately double in the four copy genotype compared to the two copy genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Second, we examined wing size, which is sensitive to different amounts of Dpp signaling. Mutant conditions that decrease Dpp signal transduction reduce wing disc growth and mutant conditions that elevate signal transduction cause overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capdevila and Guerrero, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spencer et al., 1982</xref>). We found that wing size did not differ between genotypes with two or four <italic>dpp</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Third, we asked if signal transduction increases with gene dosage and Dpp production. α-pMAD staining, a readout of Dpp signaling, forms a band that coincides with and straddles <italic>dpp</italic> expressing cells in WT discs. The width of the pMAD-staining band was not different in wing discs with two or four gene copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), indicating that increased Dpp production does not increase signal transduction. Similarly, expression of Spalt (Salm), which is regulated by Dpp signaling in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>), did not change in genotypes with two or four <italic>dpp</italic> gene copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Antibody-producing lymphocytes are examples of constitutive secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holodick et al., 2010</xref>). Examples of cells that regulate secretion include endocrine pancreatic cells that discharge hormones into the circulatory system, and neurons that pass signals to target cells at chemical synapses. The work reported here demonstrates that delivery of Hh, Dpp, and Wg to target cells is regulated and is not dependent on the amount of protein produced or on constitutive release—that differences in production as much as 4× for Hh, 2× for Dpp, and 7× for Wg did not change the amount of uptake or signal transduction. This work also reports that delivery of Hh to a tissue is not influenced by the complexity or size of the target fields—that the presence or absence of Hh-receiving tracheal cells and myoblasts was of no consequence to Hh signaling in the same region of the wing disc. The conclusion we draw is that the contours of Hh, Dpp, and Wg distributions are determined by controlled exchanges between producing and receiving cells, not by constitutive release from producing cells. This is an important, defining feature of the process that disperses these proteins across tissues.</p><p>Diffusion models of morphogen gradient formation are based on the idea that producing cells create a pool of secreted, extracellular signaling protein whose distributions are determined by interactions with extracellular components that non-producing cells contribute—such as receptors, ECM proteins, and negative regulators that absorb or bind passively diffusing protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Madamanchi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stapornwongkul and Vincent, 2021</xref>). Although these models assume that morphogen proteins are released constitutively from producing cells, our findings that the amount of signaling protein in a target field is a small fraction of the amount produced and is not proportional to production, do not explicitly invalidate them. Factors contributed by non-producing cells in the signaling domain might, in theory, feedback to compensate for variations in levels of protein in an extracellular pool. However, measures of expression of negative regulators of signal transduction for Hh (<italic>shf</italic>), Dpp (<italic>brk, sog, pent, cv-2</italic>), and Wg (<italic>Notum</italic>) detected no changes in the genotypes we analyzed that had different gene copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In late third instar larvae, the distal portion of the tracheal ASP commingles with mesenchymal myoblasts on the basal surface of the wing disc anterior to the A/P compartment border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All the ASP, myoblast, and disc cells that are within approximately 60 μm of the Hh-expressing, P compartment disc cells activate Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatori and Kornberg, 2020</xref>). Thus, despite the cell cycle, shape, constitution, and fate differences between the cells in this microenvironment, the primary determinant of Hh signaling appears to be distance from producing cells. If Hh were released into the extracellular space within this microenvironment and if the ASP, myoblast, and disc cells shared available Hh, we might expect that the distance over which Hh spreads and the extent of Hh signaling would depend on the number of recipient cells in this Hh target field. It does not, genetic conditions that reduced the number of cells in the target field did not increase the number of remaining cells in the microenvironment that activated Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This result shows that in the microenvironment, Hh uptake is not determined by either production levels, cell type, or number of other cells that also take up Hh. This finding is not consistent with the idea that Hh populates a shared extracellular pool from which different cells draw, a central tenet of diffusion models. Our interpretation is that this finding is consistent with cytoneme-mediated signaling and the idea that dissemination of Hh involves direct cell-to-cell exchanges between one producing and one receiving cell. Our results suggest that these cell-to-cell exchanges are regulated and are insensitive to modest increases or decreases in Hh production. The ~20× excess in production relative to amounts transferred to target cells may buffer the system and ensure that Hh is not limiting for the process that regulates its transfer. And because the exchanges are restricted to interactions between single pairs of cells, they are insensitive to increases or decreases in the number of other cells in the target field.</p><p>The idea that morphogen gradients form by diffusion originated before morphogens were discovered to be signaling proteins, and the first attempt to model gradient formation based on chemical and physical principles assumed that they were small organic molecules that diffuse freely into and out of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crick, 1970</xref>).

Hh, Dpp, and Bnl/FGF are visible moving along cytonemes that extend from producing cells and link with receiving cells, and are also visible after uptake colocalized with their respective receptors in cytonemes that extend from receiving cells and link to producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capdevila and Guerrero, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Torroja et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the evidence for cytoneme-based dissemination is direct and strong.</p><p>The process that distributes signaling proteins into concentration gradients that decline with increasing distance from source cells appears to have several components. One regulates the number of cytonemes that link producing and receiving cells. In the wing disc and ASP systems, the number of cytonemes linking producing and receiving cells correlates with signaling strength—cells far from signal sources and low signaling have fewer cytonemes than do cells close to signal sources and high signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). For Branchless/FGF signaling in the ASP, positive feedback that increases the number of relatively short cytonemes of cells that have high signaling levels and are close to source cells, and negative feedback that decreases the number of relatively long cytonemes in cells that have lower signaling levels and are farther from source cells. This system of regulation contributes to the formation of a spatial gradient of cytoneme number and concentration gradient of Branchless/FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2018</xref>). Similar feedback systems may sculpt the cytoneme gradients that disperse Hh and Dpp. Another regulatory mechanism involves feedback responses to signaling. Hh signaling, for example, enhances expression of Ptc, a receptor that binds and sequesters Hh, thereby reducing Hh dispersion and shaping the contour and extent of the Hh gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A third regulatory mechanism is reported here—the gating which releases constant amounts of Hh, Dpp, and Wg independently of levels of production. Although we did not identify the rate-limiting step or steps that set these amounts, we made several observations that are relevant. We found that the amount of Hh detected at the basal surface of producing cells was constant and independent of level of production, suggesting that placement at the basal membrane is gated. This idea is consistent with the observation that levels of extracellular Hh were less than total Hh in these cells, but the possibilities remain that release from producing cells and/or uptake by receiving cells may also be regulated. Our investigations of cytoneme biology have been guided by known features of neurons and neuronal signaling, and we have identified many features of cytoneme-mediated signaling that are analogous. These include spatially-specific signaling at synapses that link cells at distances of &lt;40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roy et al., 2014</xref>), synaptic localization of proteins such as the voltage-gated calcium channel and Synaptotagmin, essential roles for the glutamate receptor and glutamate transporter, and trans-synaptic stimulation of calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). And calcium-dependent release of glutamate is essential for both cytoneme-mediated signaling and for glutamatergic excitatory neuronal synapses. It remains for further investigations to determine how morphogen proteins are released from producing cells and are exposed to receiving cells, and if protein transfers at cytoneme synapses are controlled.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="middle">Cell line (<italic>Drosophila</italic>)</td><td><italic>hh</italic><sup><italic>ac</italic> </sup></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 1992</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Cell line (<italic>Drosophila</italic>)</td><td valign="middle"><italic>dpp<sup>H46</sup> </italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irish and Gelbart, 1987</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Cell line (<italic>Drosophila</italic>)</td><td valign="middle"><italic>wg<sup>RF</sup> </italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pérez-Garijo et al., 2009</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>40k Hh BAC</italic> </td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>40k Hh:GFP BAC</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>100k Hh BAC</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>Dpp BAC</italic> </td><td valign="middle">this study</td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>Dpp:Cherry</italic> </td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fereres et al., 2019</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>wg-Gal4</italic> </td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giráldez et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>1151-Gal4</italic> </td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roy and Vijay Raghavan, 1997</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>UAS-Wg:GFP</italic> </td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roy et al., 2011</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>btl-LHG</italic> </td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roy et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>lexO-Cherry:CAAX</italic></td><td valign="middle">from Konrad Basler</td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>UAS-Cut</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardiman et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>UAS-btl<sup>DN</sup> </italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reichman-Fried and Shilo, 1995</xref></td><td valign="middle"/><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Transfected construct</td><td valign="middle"><italic>UAS-mskRNAi</italic> </td><td valign="middle">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="middle">#27572</td><td valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Antibody</td><td valign="middle">α-Ptc</td><td valign="middle">DSHB, Apa1</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="middle">1/500</td></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Antibody</td><td valign="middle">α-Hh</td><td valign="middle">from Phillip Ingham</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="middle">1/500</td></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Antibody</td><td valign="middle">α-GFP</td><td valign="middle">Roche</td><td valign="bottom">#11814460001</td><td valign="middle">1/500;

neurotransmitters at chemical neuronal synapses. Specifically is the distribution of Hh, Wg, and Dpp dependent and proportional to the amount produced? The data suggest that delivery of these ligands to target cells is regulated in both amount and destination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71744.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. It has been already published (e.g. Matusek et al 2014) that over-expression of Hh through the UAS/Gal4 system in Hh producing cells is able to increase signalling activity, extending the Hh graded distribution. The authors should discuss it and/or offer an explanation of the resulting increase in cell signalling.</p></disp-quote><p>Done; please see revised text and revised Figures 1, 2 New data added to Fig. 1C, D, E, F, G, H.</p><p>p5: “We also measured hh RNA in wing discs with 2 WT hh genes and transgenes containing hh-Gal4 and UAS-hh:GFP, and observed that the amount increased approximately 15X over WT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the same line of thought it would be interesting to test whether this kind of over-expression in the wing imaginal disc, might change responses in the ASP.</p></disp-quote><p>Done; please see revised Figure 5 New data added to Fig. 5B,C.</p><p>p12: “In contrast, Hh over-expression driven by hh-Gal4 reduced the stalk and increased the extent of En expression. […] The sensitivity to hh-Gal4 driven overexpression indicates that the capacity of the ASP system to buffer against different levels of expression is limited.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should also present ex vivo staining of morphogens (extracellular levels at least for Hh and Wg), to control for possible effects coming from changes in the processing or degradation rate within producing or receiving cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see revised Figure 2 for Hh extracellular staining New data added to Fig. 2E,F.</p><p>p9: “Gene dosage dependence of extracellular Hh</p><p>We applied an extracellular staining protocol that detects antibodies bound to preparations of nonpermeabilized and unfixed cells (Strigini and Cohen, 2000). […] Bulk endocytic uptake by A compartment cells monitored by dextran uptake did not change with hh gene dosage (Fig. 2 Supplement 3).”</p><p>Please see revised Figure 4 for Wg extracellular staining. New data added to Fig. 4D.</p><p>p11: “We investigated the distribution of Wg using the extracellular staining protocol and detected low levels of basolateral Wg in Wg-producing (Fig, 4, Supplement2). […] This protocol does not distinguish between protein on either the cell surface or associated with cytonemes, but these results suggest that delivery and release to receiving cells from the basolateral membrane is rate-limiting.”</p><p>Also Methods:</p><p>p30: “The comparison between total and extracellular Hh is a relative estimate because fluors, antibodies, laser intensities, and gain settings were not the same for the two protocols. […] All measurements of intensity were with ImageJ.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To quantify the read out of the Hh, Wg and Dpp signalling gradients the expression of additional targets should be monitored, for instance, for Hh (En, Col, Dpp Ci), for Wg (Dll and Vg) and for Dpp (Brk, Spalt, Omb).</p></disp-quote><p>Done; please see Supplemental Figure 1-supplement 3 for Knot, Supplemental Figure 3-supplement 1 for Spalt, and Supplemental Figure 4-supplement 1 for Dll p6: Expression of Knot (Kn), which like Ptc expression is regulated by Hh signaling (Vervoort et al., 1999), did not change in genotypes with 1-4 hh gene copies (Fig. 1 Supplement 3).</p><p>p10: “Similarly, expression of Spalt (Salm), which is regulated by Dpp signaling in the wing disc (de Celis et al., 1996), did not change in genotypes with two or four dpp gene copies (Fig. 3 supplement 1).”</p><p>p11: “a-Dll antibody detects a region of expression that overlaps Wg-expressing cells (Zecca et al., 1996), and the pattern of Dll expression also was not different in these genotypes (Fig. 4 supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Regarding the methods used for image analysis, the authors should state the measuring method used for florescence, is it grey mean value? Was it adjusted for background signalling? Was the section used determined by the maximum width within the apico-basal planes? How was distance of fluorescence signal measured? Was it manually measured? Did it take into account the potential size differences between discs? How was Hh signal quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>Done p30: “Average intensity quantifications for projections of α-Hh, α-GFP, α-Cherry, and α-Wg staining were calculated for segments of optical sections spanning 20 from the most apical side of the wing pouch cells. […] Background measurements taken in equivalent areas distant from staining regions and were subtracted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Statistical analysis is adequate but ideally it would be helpful to include a &quot;power analysis&quot;, determining whether the N used is sufficient for a non-significant result. For instance, Ptc patterns in Figure 1 panel D do not look similar in different genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The images in the Fig 1D panels are single optical sections that were chosen to be representative, and the ones in the revised figure are better representations. The Fig 1E graph quantifies values from optical sections spanning 20 mm from the apical surface and more accurately reflect the Ptc domains. We are not familiar with the suggested “power analysis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The results shown in Figure 6B are difficult to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see revised Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In the results section, Expression of modulators of morphogen protein signalling, the sentence &quot;This insensitivity to Hh amounts suggests that Shf does not control Hh release&quot;.... should be changed as the fact that levels of shf expression are not modified by the doses of Hh does not imply that Shf does not have a role in controlling Hh release.</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been revised.</p><p>“We quantified shf expression in discs with one and four hh genes by quantifying shf transcripts with qPCR; no change in shf mRNA was detected in these genotypes (Fig. 6A,B). This insensitivity to the tested changes in Hh amounts suggests that Shf does not control Hh release. brinker (brk), pentagone (Pent; aka magu), short gastrulation (sog), and crossveinless-2 (Cv-2) negatively affect Dpp signaling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Regarding the possibility of cytoneme involvement in the regulated transport/release, can changes in the ASP number of cytonemes be expected by over-expression of Hh in the wing disc, in hhts mutants or in smo- or ptc- clones in the ASP?</p></disp-quote><p>Reference to relevant experiments in Hatori and Kornberg (2020) has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Would it be possible to regulate the number of cytonemes emanating from the ASP, for instance by increasing FGF signalling, and to look at the Hh signalling response in the ASP?</p></disp-quote><p>Revised Figure 5 includes new data showing increased signaling in conditions of Ihog over-expression.</p><p>Legend: “(F) Ectopic over-expression of Ihog in the ASP reduced the stalk and increased extent of α-En staining (green). (G) Width of α-Ptc staining band in the wing discs ectopically over-expressing Ihog in the indicated genotypes; differences between 1 and 2 hh copies statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) (Abbreviations as in Fig. 1.)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. In Figure 1 panel D, a profile of intensity and a reconstruction of a cross section would be very useful to visualise maximum intensity changes and how levels are distributed in the AP axis.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 Supplements 1 and 2 show Ptc cross sections and intensity profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Panel E. Ptc protein alone should not be used to quantify the read out of the Hh signalling gradient, En, Ci, Dpp and Col are also good targets to report it.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 Supplement 3 shows results for analyses of Knot expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2, panel A and B, should also show an apico/basal cross section of the wing discs. In addition, it should include, or present instead, quantification of ex vivo staining (extracellular levels), as the total Hh includes unprocessed Hh that cannot reach the plasma membrane to be released.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 Supplement 1 shows apico/basal cross section. Figure 2E,F shows results for extracellular staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 3 panel E, would be better to show the expression of other Dpp targets such as Spalt, Brinker or Omb.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 Supplement 1 shows results for analyses of Spalt expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 4 to better analyse the effect of GFP dilution, flies expressing endogenous wg-GFP are actually available, and extracellular staining of Wg in the basolateral part of the producing cells would show if the rate-limiting step occurs before or after release. In panel C, C' monitoring for low threshold targets such as Dll or Vg expression after changing Wg doses would be more adequate.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4 Supplement 1 shows results for Dll expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Authors also present evidence that changes in the number of target tissues does not alter the amount of morphogen that is received by the other tissues. In general, I do not have major comments on the manuscript. I can only congratulate authors for this very nice paper. However, I would like to suggest two major changes.</p><p>First, the discussion is too long, widespread and some paragraphs do not fit in the paper. Thus, I would suggest authors to improve it. Second, I would suggest authors to propose alternative models to explain their results, besides the cytoneme-driven model. I am sure authors might be able to do.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion has been revised to clarify its logic and reasoning. Although more complex alternative models that involve multiple different mechanisms of dispersion could be proposed (our data shows that signaling is cytoneme-dependent but does not rule out the existence of free, non-cytoneme associated morphogen), we try in the limited space available to explain the reasoning for the cytoneme model. We are not sure what alternatives the reviewer is seeking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor changes include explaining what ASP or myoblasts are in the results section, so that the general reader can understand the experimental settings,</p></disp-quote><p>Text revised. p12: “We first analyzed Hh signaling and cytoneme densities in the air sac primordium (ASP), a tracheal branch which is physically attached to the wing disc and which extends cytonemes to the disc that mediate the uptake of Hh, Dpp, and Bnl (Chen et al., 2017a; Du et al., 2018; Hatori and Kornberg, 2020; Roy et al., 2014).”</p><p>p14: “To characterize how signaling proteins are apportioned among the cells they target, we analyzed Hh signaling in a uniquely positioned group of Hh-responding cells near the Hh-producing cells of the wing disc notum primordium.

Kornberg describes the very interesting finding that the amount of produced morphogens does not alter the signaling strength of morphogen signaling. The experiments and hypothesis are nicely done and highly relevant, as it is a long standing and controversially discussed question.</p><p>By gene dosage of Hh, Dpp and Wg the authors can show that although protein levels increase in the producing cells, the amount of morphogens in target the signaling and the functional effects are not altered. It is a common understanding, that the imaginal wing disc is a robust system and can compensate for different manipulations in generating a functional wing. Yet, to see this demonstrate in experiments and especially the titration experiments with fluorescently tagged morphogens is really great.</p><p>My main point of criticism is concerning the lack of addressing endosomal trafficking in producing cells as a lever to the extracellular pool of morphogens:</p><p>Page 7 &quot;These results are consistent with the idea that most Hh produced in the posterior compartment is not released (and does not signal), and that Hh export is not linked directly to production.&quot; The authors argue that if the produced amount does not change the signaling strength than regulated delivery has to be the determining factor. As the number of cytonemes of receiving cells is unchanged, the authors should also consider that the rate of endocytosis in producing cells could change upon increasing production of morphogens by recycling and uptake assays. I would like to see the extracellular level of the morphogens and whether they change with gene dosage. What if producing cells, by morphogen signaling themselves, sense the relevant amount of morphogens that need to be presented on the surface?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and are also intrigued by the possibility that producing cells communicate with receiving cells in the process of cytoneme-mediated transfer, but would prefer not to speculate about such a process in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of endocytosis in producing cells in the regulation of morphogen signaling is a controversial subject for itself with some recent publications available: D’Angelo Dev Cell 2018, Hemalatha PNAS, 2016 Munthe et al, J Cell Sci 2020, Linnemannstöns et al, Development 2020, Witte et al., Development 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see Figure 2 Supplement 2 with new data showing that dextran uptake is not sensitive to Hh production.</p><p>p9: Bulk endocytic uptake by A compartment cells monitored by dextran uptake did not change with hh gene dosage (Fig. 2 Supplement3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some aspects of the manuscript can be improved to make it better:</p><p>In the discussion, I feel that two different ideas are mixed, comparison with the neuronal model (constitutive versus regulated release) and the question how morphogen delivery is modulated if not by the amounts produced. What if cytonemes and other forms of morphogens spreading coexist and are the delivery forms for different target cells. In that respect, the discussion is a bit to one-sided. This should be more precisely discussed in the light of the last figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion has been revised to clarify its logic and reasoning. Although more complex alternative models that involve multiple different mechanisms of dispersion could be proposed, data from our studies and the studies of others show that signaling to every known target cell for every signaling protein that has been investigated is cytoneme-dependent. These findings do not rule out the existence of free, non-cytoneme associated morphogen, but show that signaling is cytoneme-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last figure is not well enough described, because the set-up is more complex, more details are needed to follow through even more people from the wing disc field.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><p>Please see revised Figures 7 and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some unfinished sentences and double sentences in the manuscript.
