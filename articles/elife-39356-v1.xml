We here developed tiv-AFM, combining time-lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy with upright fluorescence imaging of embryonic tissue, to show that during development local tissue stiffness changes significantly within tens of minutes. Within this time frame, a stiffness gradient arose in the developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> brain, and retinal ganglion cell axons turned to follow this gradient. Changes in local tissue stiffness were largely governed by cell proliferation, as perturbation of mitosis diminished both the stiffness gradient and the caudal turn of axons found in control brains. Hence, we identified a close relationship between the dynamics of tissue mechanics and developmental processes, underpinning the importance of time-resolved stiffness measurements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39356.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons in the brain form an intricate network that follows a precise template. For example, in a young frog embryo, the neurons from the eyes send out thin structures, called axons, which navigate along a well-defined path and eventually connect with the visual centres of the brain. This journey requires the axons to take a sharp turn so they can wire with the right brain structures.</p><p>Axons find their paths not only by following chemical signals but also by reacting to the stiffness of their environment. In an older frog embryo for instance, the brain is stiffer at the front, and softer at the back. As neurons from the eyes make their way through the brain, they turn to follow this gradient, moving away from stiffer areas towards the softer regions.</p><p>Here, Thompson, Pillai et al. investigate when and how this stiffness gradient is established in frogs. To do so, a new technique was developed. Called time-lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy, the method measures how brain stiffness changes over time in a live embryo, while also taking images of the growing axons.</p><p>The experiments show that the stiffness gradient arose within tens of minutes, just as the first ‘pioneering’ axons from the eyes began to grow across the brain. These axons then responded to the gradient, turning towards the softer tissue. Changes in the number of cells in the underlying brain tissue governed the formation of the gradient, with rapidly stiffening areas containing more cells than those that remained soft. In fact, using drugs that stop cells from dividing reduced both the mechanical gradient and the turning response of the axons.</p><p>The technique developed by Thompson, Pillai et al. is a useful tool that can help elucidate how variations in stiffness control the brain wiring process. It could also be used to look into how other developmental or regenerative processes, such as the way neurons reconnect after injuries to the brain or spinal cord, may be regulated by mechanical tissue properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>atomic force

by tissue mechanics, including cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>), neuronal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>), and large-scale tissue remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Munjal et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, several approaches have recently been developed to measure in vivo tissue stiffness, including atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gautier et al., 2015</xref>), magnetic resonance elastography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sack et al., 2008</xref>), Brillouin microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scarcelli and Yun, 2012</xref>), and magnetically responsive ferrofluid microdroplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serwane et al., 2017</xref>). However, the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of tissue mechanics remains poorly understood, and how cells respond to changes in local tissue stiffness in vivo is largely unknown.</p><p>To enable time-resolved measurements of developmental tissue mechanics, we here developed time-lapse in vivo atomic force microscopy (tiv-AFM), a method that combines sensitive upright epifluorescence imaging of opaque samples, such as frog embryos, with iterated AFM indentation measurements of in vivo tissue at cellular resolution and at a time scale of tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A fluorescence zoom stereomicroscope equipped with an sCMOS camera (quantum yield 82%) was custom-fitted above a bio-AFM set-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which had a transparent pathway along the area of the cantilever. To cope with the long working distance required for imaging through the AFM head, the microscope was fitted with a 0.125 NA/114 mm WD objective. The AFM was set up on an automated motorised stage containing a temperature-controlled sample holder to maintain live specimens at optimal conditions during the experimental time course.

In the OT, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons grow in a bundle across the brain surface, making a stereotypical turn in the caudal direction <italic>en route</italic> that directs them to their target, the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFarlane and Lom, 2012</xref>). We previously demonstrated that by later stages of OT outgrowth (i.e. when axons had reached their target), a local stiffness gradient lies orthogonal to the path of OT axons, with the stiffer region rostral to the OT and softer region caudal to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>). This gradient strongly correlated with axon turning, with the OT routinely turning caudally towards softer tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore wanted to determine when this stiffness gradient first developed, whether its emergence preceded OT axon turning, and what the origin of the stiffness gradient was.</p><p>To answer these questions, we performed iterated tiv-AFM measurements of the embryonic brain in vivo at early-intermediate stages, that is, just before and during turn initiation by the first ‘pioneer’ OT axons. The apparent elastic modulus <italic>K</italic>, which is a measure of the tissue’s elastic stiffness, was assessed in an ~150 by 250 µm raster at 20 µm resolution every ~35 min, producing a sequence of ‘stiffness maps’ of the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The applied force (<italic>F</italic> = 10 nN) and cantilever probe (<italic>r</italic> = 18.64 µm) were chosen to measure the stiffness mainly of the top ~20–30 µm of the tissue, within which RGC axons grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 1987</xref>).

At the end of the experiments (i.e., at stage 37/38), OTs were labelled with DiI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wizenmann et al., 2009</xref>), and their elongation and turning angles measured. We did not find any significant differences between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that repeated AFM measurements do not affect axon growth.</p><p>We then performed tiv-AFM measurements of developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> brains. Early in the time-lapse sequence (i.e. prior to axon turning), the stiffness of the brain was similar on both sides of the OT. However, over the time course of the measurements a stiffness gradient arose, mostly due to rising stiffness of tissue rostral to the OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Visual inspection of the fold-change in tissue stiffness from one time point to the next indicated that significant changes in tissue mechanics were already occurring approximately 40–80 min after the onset of measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), that is before axons started turning caudally, suggesting that the tissue stiffness gradient was established prior to axon turning.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we quantified the temporal evolution of the stiffness gradient in a small region immediately in front of the advancing OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). At the beginning of each time point in the sequence of tiv-AFM maps, we calculated the angle through which axons turned (‘OT turn angle’). For each animal, minimum and maximum absolute values were rescaled to 0 and 1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The projected appearance of the stiffness gradient preceded the projected onset of axon turning on average by 18 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>), indicating that axons indeed turned after the stiffness gradient was established, which is consistent with a role for mechanical gradients in helping to guide OT axons caudally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the first time point at which we detected axon turning in each animal, our data suggested that a stiffness gradient of at least (0.9 ± 0.4) Pa/µm (mean ± SEM) was required for axons to change their growth direction. In line with this idea, RGC axons from heterochronic eye primordia transplants growing through <italic>Xenopus</italic> brains at stages before the stiffness gradient is established grow rather straight and do not turn caudally in the mid-diencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cornel and Holt, 1992</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that tissue stiffness scales with local cell body density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koser et al., 2015</xref>), and that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo brains local stiffness gradients at later developmental stages (39-40) correlate with a gradient in cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>). To determine if changes in cell densities are driving changes in tissue stiffness, and thus parallel the evolution of the stiffness gradient at earlier stages, we assayed cell densities using DAPI labelling of nuclei in whole-mounted brains with fluorescently labelled OTs, beginning at the morphological stage corresponding to the start of tiv-AFM measurements (33/34) and repeated for the two subsequent stages encompassing OT turning (35/36 and 37/38).</p><p>While at the first stage cell densities on both sides of the OT were similar, a clear difference in nuclear densities rostral and caudal to the OT developed at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

However, similar to control conditions, axons exposed to different concentrations of BI2536 grew significantly longer on stiff substrates compared to softer substrates.

These stiffness heterogeneities were largely governed by differential cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), which is in agreement with previously published correlations between cell body densities and tissue stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weber et al., 2017</xref>).

Perturbing cell division, on the other hand, might alter not only local tissue stiffness but also topological cues in the tissue, which may also provide important signals regulating axon growth. Having fewer cell bodies rostral to the OT might decrease the amount of steric hindrance and provide more space for axons to grow into, contributing to the reduction in OT turning angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of the correlation between local cell body density gradients and stiffness gradients suggests that other structures may contribute to the stiffness gradient as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), although perhaps to a smaller degree. Potential candidates include radial glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacDonald et al., 2015</xref>) as well as components of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moeendarbary et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Tiv-AFM allows simultaneous time-lapse measurements of tissue mechanics in vivo and optical monitoring of fluorescently labelled structures at the surface of otherwise optically opaque samples, at length and time scales that are relevant for developmental processes. It enabled us for the first time to trace the in vivo mechanical properties of the embryonic <italic>Xenopus</italic> brain as the embryo developed, and to relate changes in tissue mechanics to a key event in axon pathfinding. As in all other AFM applications, in tiv-AFM forces are applied to sample surfaces, restricting it to biological processes that occur within tens of micrometers away from the surface, such as OT elongation in developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. Mapping of the whole <italic>Xenopus</italic> brain at cellular resolution takes about half an hour, which defines the maximum temporal resolution that can currently be achieved. Future developments of alternative approaches may enable measurements within tissues at even higher rates. However, tiv-AFM in its current form revealed that significant changes in tissue stiffness occur in vivo within tens of minutes, and that these changes have significant implications for a biological process, the outgrowth of RGC axons along the developing embryonic brain.</p><p>More broadly, tiv-AFM can also be easily adapted for in vivo applications in other small organisms, or alternatively in tissues ex vivo. It can be used to study cellular responses to a range of mechanical stimuli via the AFM in vivo, such as sustained compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barriga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>), or to track the temporal mechanical response of tissues or organs to different pharmacological treatments (such as the mitotic inhibitor used here). Additionally, the setup is very versatile and can be further expanded, for example, by combining it with calcium imaging to investigate how cellular activity is regulated by changes in tissue stiffness during development and pathology. Tiv-AFM will greatly expand the range of bio-AFM experiments possible, allowing for more scope both for a detailed characterisation of in vivo tissue mechanics during development and disease progression, and for testing how mechanics shapes cell behaviour and function.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All chemicals and reagents were

The magnitude of the OT turn was calculated from each frame of these movies using the FIJI Angle tool. Three points were defined manually (chiasm, mid-diencephalic turn, and end of OT) such that the two lines drawn through these points ran through the centre of the OT. Each measurement was repeated three times, averaged, and subtracted from 180° to give the angle through which the OT had turned; a positive value denotes turning in the caudal direction.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5-4"><title>Analysis of OT elongation</title><p>Maximum projections were made across 10 µm confocal image stacks of wholemount brains with DiI-labelled OTs.

Elongation of the OT was calculated by the major-to-minor axis ratio using a previously described automated algorithm in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koser et al., 2016</xref>). In short, axes were determined by fitting ellipses, with the same normalized second central moment as the OT area, around the OTs.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5-5"><title>Cell body density measurements</title><p>Confocal image stacks of fixed brains (with fluorescently-labelled OT and nuclei) were imported into FIJI. For each brain, the image where the leading axons were in focus was selected. A maximum intensity projection was generated of this image and one image above and below it in the stack. Two 50 μm × 50 μm regions of interest (matching the size of regions of interest used in stiffness gradient analysis) were selected, rostral (<bold><italic>D<sub>R</sub></italic></bold>) and caudal (<bold><italic>D<sub>C</sub></italic></bold>) to the region corresponding to the OT caudal bend. Noise was removed with a Gaussian blur filter (sigma = 2.0). The resulting image was thresholded, with the threshold manually adjusted to capture all nuclei as accurately as possible. The image was binarised and the FIJI built-in function ‘Analyse Particle’ (size: 1–∞; circularity: 0.2–1.00) was used to determine the area in each region covered by nuclei. Relative cell body density was calculated by dividing the area occupied by nuclei by the total region area. Where required, gradients in relative cell body density were obtained using:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">R</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="bold">50</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">μ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s1-5-6"><title>Measurement of cross-sectional brain area</title><p>Confocal images taken with the 20 × air objective were imported into FIJI.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rapid changes in tissue mechanics regulate cell behaviour in the developing embryonic brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paola Bovolenta (Reviewer #1); Valerie Castellani (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers appreciated your efforts to probe how dynamic changes in tissue mechanics have a close relationship with developmental processes, here, with a focus on axonal growth. Your findings that the pathway that retinal ganglion cell axons follow in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> brain is influenced by relatively rapid changes in tissue stiffness on which the axons grow, and that increasing stiffness correlates with enhanced cell density/proliferation, are indeed novel. Your approach of simultaneously observing and quantifying tissue stiffness and cell movements using atomic force microscopy with fluorescence imaging is exciting and will appeal to the growing number of groups interested in tissue morphogenesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These experiments are considered necessary to strengthen the connection you make between proliferation, density, and tissue stiffness:</p><p>1) Coronal sections of control and BI2536 treated embryos showing nuclei (DAPI stained) and glial endfeet (GFAP or Nestin labelling).</p><p>2) Labelling sections with pH3 or other mitotic cell markers.</p><p>3) Effects of the BI2536 inhibitor: Additional movies are needed (Figure 2F, N= only 2 for the BI2536 condition).</p><p>4) Check whether RGC axons grow and sense stiffness normally in vitro in presence of BI2536 (for example, using the axon outgrowth assay described in Koser et al., 2016).</p><p>5) Calculate optic tract (OT) elongation in control and BI2536-treated conditions. Related to BI2536 treatment and turning in the optic tract: does BI2536 generally affect axon growth along the optic tract in vivo?</p><p>6) Demonstrate that repeated AFM measurements do not affect OT turning (by comparing with movies without AFM measures).</p><p>7) Confirm with a second drug that cell density controls brain stiffness and RGC axon turning.</p><p>The following points do not rely on additional experiments but should be addressed:</p><p>1) State in the text the optical resolution and the accuracy of the AFM measure relative to the surface distance (in other words, is AFM producing a measure of the stiffness of the tissues 10μm or 100μm below the surface scanned by the probe?).</p><p>2) Provide illustrations of the angle measurements (in the video in Figure 1, it seems that the turn is initiated at 37 minutes).</p><p>3) Show the ROIs used to quantify the stiffness gradient and the boxplot of the mean K values in rostral and caudal regions at different time points. In addition, using different ROIs along the OT would strengthen the specificity of the correlation between stiffness gradient and turning.</p><p>4) Show several examples of the stiffness changes to better appreciate the spatial stereotypy relative to OT development.</p><p>5) Figure 1D, related to text &quot;a stiffness gradient arose, mostly due to rising stiffness of tissue rostral to the OT&quot;. Some of the heatmap data (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 2C) suggests that there is decreasing stiffness on the caudal side, and relative cell density data (Figure 2D) suggests that there is decreasing cell density on the caudal side as well. Can the authors comment on the rostral-caudal stiffness v cell density? Is there some underlying biology to account for this?</p><p>6) Explain why only 3 time points are presented in the graph Figure 2A and G even though measurements are made every 35 minutes.</p><p>7) Figure 2B: According to the graph, it appears that the stiffness gradient is projected to form at 8-10 minutes. This suggests that it may begin to form prior to the beginning of the experiments presented (if the gradient forms linearly at those earlier times). Have the authors tried starting the experiments earlier? The manner in which the stiffness gradient forms (linearly or non-linearly) may have implications for the mechanism(s) initiating and influencing stiffness.</p><p>8) Specify the estimated delay between gradient stiffness establishment and OT caudal turn (15-18 minutes). Paired analysis of the onset times of stiffness gradient and turn for each video (ladder graphic) would strengthen the arguments. It would be interesting to have an estimate of the stiffness differences that would lead to axon turning. This would be helpful together with point 4 to make predictions and to enrich the model proposed in Koser et al., 2016.</p><p>9) Show a 3D reconstruction of the Z-stack used for Figure 2C and specify the total stack height.</p><p>10) Explain how &quot;cell body density gradients&quot; were calculated (Figure 2E) (only &quot;relative cell body density&quot; is described in the Materials and methods). The authors should take into account that quantification made on a Z projection will lead to loss of information that will decrease the sensitivity of the analysis. Figure 2E suggests that a more balanced conclusion should be drawn from the experiment, as part of gradient stiffness is independent of cell density gradient (gradient stiffness would thus be 0.4 for no cell density gradient).</p><p>11) Provide relative cell body density for the BI2536 condition, as done in Figure 2D for the control (indeed, the authors stated that &quot;cell density gradient was significantly decreased compare to controls, particularly at later stages (Figure 2C)&quot;).</p><p>12) The Materials and methods section indicates that relative density involves ratio of 2D area in the image occupied by nuclei over total area (this does not appear to be a cell count). This measurement could be affected by differences in nuclear size. Have the authors measured nuclear size over time? Does this change? Is nuclear size different in BI2536-treated embryos? Also, it is difficult to see nuclei on the caudal side of the optic tract in Figure 2C (control).</p><p>13) Again, related BI2536 and cell density measurements, over time for BI2536-treated embryos: It would be useful to know if the BI2536 caused apoptosis (leading to an overall reduction in density)? The nuclei look somewhat condensed on what appears to be the rostral side of the tract in the BI2536 sample by st. 37 (Figure 2C).</p><p>14) Show a different control movie in Figure 2F (OT trace looks the same as in Figure 1).</p><p>15) Justify the changes of presentation between Figure 2A and G.</p><p>16) Explain what BI2536 targets (inhibitor of polo-like kinase).</p><p>17) Explain differences between coefficient R<sup>2</sup>= 0.95 in Figure 2C and Pearsons coefficient in the text (p=0.97). Add scale bars in Figure 2C and F.</p><p>For consideration in the Discussion:</p><p>1) You suggest that the &quot;gradient in cell densities is responsible for the stiffness gradient&quot;. However, the opposite could be true, as changes in stiffness have been shown to promote proliferation (should be referenced). In addition, as you previously showed that ECM manipulation changes the tissue stiffness and axon trajectory (Koser et al., 2016), it would be welcome to discuss whether you have assessed whether changes in cell density correlate with changes in ECM deposit and if BI2536 impairs it.</p><p>2) In the last paragraph, you discuss applications of tiv-AFM to other possible contexts. Limitations of the system should be also mentioned.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39356.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These experiments are considered necessary to strengthen the connection you make between proliferation, density, and tissue stiffness:</p><p>1) Coronal sections of control and BI2536 treated embryos showing nuclei (DAPI stained) and glial endfeet (GFAP or Nestin labelling).</p></disp-quote><p>We have done the suggested experiments as far as possible. DAPI staining of coronal sections confirmed a decrease in overall cell numbers after treatment with BI2536 (Figure 4A, B). However, GFAP is not expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> brains at the early developmental stages we were interested in (Messenger and Warner, Development, 1989; Martinez-De Luna et al., Dev Biol, 2017; and our own data). Furthermore, we could not find a Nestin antibody with sequence similarities above 85% with <italic>Xenopus</italic> (we tested two commercially available antibodies, Abcam ab134017 Chicken polyclonal to Nestin and ab81462 Rat monoclonal [7A3] to Nestin on coronal sections anyway, but with limited success). We also stained for vimentin, which is another glial cell marker. While we obtained a good signal from that approach, we could not distinguish individual glial cell endfeet. As we cannot make any strong conclusions about the contribution of glial cells to the stiffness gradients and axon turning based on these data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), we now discuss their potential involvement in the main text.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39356.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Coronal brain sections of stage 37/38 <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos stained for DAPI (red) and Nestin (above) or Vimentin (below) (white).</title><p>Control animals (left) and BI2536-treated animals (right); the exposed side is on the right hand side of each image.

Ser10 phosphorylation begins in G2 and decreases upon exit from mitosis. We found that the BI2536 treatment successfully triggers mitotic arrest as the number of pH3-positive cells is significantly higher in treated compared to control brains. These data have been added to Figure 4A, C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Effects of the BI2536 inhibitor: Additional movies are needed (Figure 2F, N= only 2 for the BI2536 condition).</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated these experiments with 2 more biological replicates and updated the numbers in the paper (N = 4). The new sets of experiments fully agree with our previous data, confirming reproducibility of the experiments and that the stiffness gradients is almost completely abolished after BI2536 treatment (Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Check whether RGC axons grow and sense stiffness normally in vitro in presence of BI2536 (for example, using the axon outgrowth assay described in Koser et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We have done the suggested in vitroexperiments. Axons exposed to 50nM and 500nM BI2536 still sense and respond to the stiffness of their environment, suggesting that the main effect of the drug is through a modification of tissue mechanics. The new data have been added to Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Calculate optic tract (OT) elongation in control and BI2536-treated conditions. Related to BI2536 treatment and turning in the optic tract: does BI2536 generally affect axon growth along the optic tract in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We have calculated OT elongation as suggested and find differences between controls and BI2536-ând HUA-treated animals. In the treated animals, elongation is significantly reduced, which we now show in Figure 4G and Figure 4—figure supplement 2D. As brain tissue stiffness is decreased in treated animals with decreased nuclear densities (Figure 4E, F, Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, F), which is in agreement with an important role of cell body density in regulating tissue stiffness, a reduction in OT elongation is in line with our previous publication (Koser et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Demonstrate that repeated AFM measurements do not affect OT turning (by comparing with movies without AFM measures).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we conducted time-lapse AFM measurements (i.e. repeated AFM mapping over a time course of at least 3 hours) on a group of embryos while we exposed another group to the same conditions but did not do any force measurements. At the end of the experiments (i.e., at stage 37/38), embryos were fixed, optic tracts labelled with DiI, and their elongation and turning angles measured. We did not find any significant differences between the groups, suggesting that repeated AFM measurements do not affect OT turning. We have added the new data to Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and the fifth paragraph of the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Confirm with a second drug that cell density controls brain stiffness and RGC axon turning.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used a second mitotic inhibitor treatment, hydroxyurea/aphidicolin (HUA) (which has previously been used in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embyros in vivo: Harris and Hartenstein, 1991), which resulted in a very similar optic tract phenotype as seen in BI2536-treated brains, with significantly reduced OT elongation and brain stiffness. These experiments are now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following points do not rely on additional experiments but should be addressed:</p><p>1) State in the text the optical resolution and the accuracy of the AFM measure relative to the surface distance (in other words, is AFM producing a measure of the stiffness of the tissues 10μm or 100μm below the surface scanned by the probe?).</p></disp-quote><p>AFM is applied to the surface of a sample. The measured stiffness is a composite property of structures within the top layers of the sample, with a larger contribution of structures that are closer to the surface. The total depth that contributes to the measured value depends on the mechanical properties of the sample, the force applied, and the contact area between probe and sample. In our experiments, we indent the samples by ~3-4 µm. We estimate structures to contribute to the measured stiffness mainly within the top ~20-30 µm (see simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), which includes the region through which RGC axons grow (Holt, J Neurosci, 1989). We now mention this in the fourth paragraph of the main text.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39356.017</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Simulation of the propagation of tissue deformation during an AFM measurement of a tissue with an elastic modulus of K = 300 Pa with an applied maximum force F = 10 nN and a 37 µm bead as probe.</title><p>The sample is indented by 3.4 µm, tissue deformation propagates into deeper layers.

In addition, using different ROIs along the OT would strengthen the specificity of the correlation between stiffness gradient and turning.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the ROIs used to quantify the stiffness gradient and boxplots of the median <italic>K</italic> values in rostral and caudal regions at different time points in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. However, we have chosen the ROIs to be directly in front of the advancing OT axons because this is the region that growth cones will be sensing. Therefore, we would rather not include different ROIs along the OT to avoid confusion, as it is not clear whether these would contribute to axon guidance in any way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Show several examples of the stiffness changes to better appreciate the spatial stereotypy relative to OT development.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show two more examples of time-lapse stiffness maps in Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1D, related to text &quot;a stiffness gradient arose, mostly due to rising stiffness of tissue rostral to the OT&quot;. Some of the heatmap data (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 2C) suggests that there is decreasing stiffness on the caudal side, and relative cell density data (Figure 2D) suggests that there is decreasing cell density on the caudal side as well. Can the authors comment on the rostral-caudal stiffness v cell density? Is there some underlying biology to account for this?</p></disp-quote><p>We generally see a strong correlation between local cell body densities and tissue stiffness. Accordingly, tissue stiffness increases rostral to the OT, where cell density increases during development. Caudal to the OT, cell density decreases slightly in some but not all embryos, and accordingly we don’t see statistically significant differences in tissue stiffness caudal to the OT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Explain why only 3 time points are presented in the graph Figure 2A and G even though measurements are made every 35 minutes.</p></disp-quote><p>Our aim was to match the mechanics measurements to the three established developmental stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos encompassing the duration of our experiments (stages 33/34, 35/36, and 37/38), in order to enable meaningful comparisons with local cell body densities, which were assessed at these stages. Therefore, values from stiffness maps had to be pooled. We now justify this procedure in the caption of Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2B: According to the graph, it appears that the stiffness gradient is projected to form at 8-10 minutes. This suggests that it may begin to form prior to the beginning of the experiments presented (if the gradient forms linearly at those earlier times). Have the authors tried starting the experiments earlier? The manner in which the stiffness gradient forms (linearly or non-linearly) may have implications for the mechanism(s) initiating and influencing stiffness.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data indeed suggest that stiffness gradients may start forming a few minutes before the start of our measurements. However, our data strongly indicate that the stiffness gradient forms rather linearly during the following ~3 hours between stage 33/34, when the pioneering axons first leave the optic chiasm and enter the diencephalon, and stage 37/38, when axons have turned in the mid-diencephalon (Figure 2A). Measurements at earlier developmental stages would be technically highly challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Specify the estimated delay between gradient stiffness establishment and OT caudal turn (15-18 minutes). Paired analysis of the onset times of stiffness gradient and turn for each video (ladder graphic) would strengthen the arguments. It would be interesting to have an estimate of the stiffness differences that would lead to axon turning. This would be helpful together with point 4 to make predictions and to enrich the model proposed in Koser et al., 2016.</p></disp-quote><p>These are indeed excellent suggestions. We now specify the delay of 18 minutes in the seventh paragraph of the main text and in Figure 2E. Furthermore, we include a ladder graphic as suggested, in addition to our paired analysis of the onset times, in Figure 2D. We now also include an estimate of the minimum stiffness gradient that would lead to axon turning, which is (0.9 ± 0.4) Pa/µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Show a 3D reconstruction of the Z-stack used for Figure 2C and specify the total stack height.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the Materials and methods, we only recorded three optical planes in each stack to make sure we capture all nuclei in that region. Hence, a 3D reconstruction would not add to the information that is already provided. Moreover, the coronal sections that we now added (see experiment 1 above, Figure 4) contain information about the depth-distribution of nuclei, which we hope addresses this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Explain how &quot;cell body density gradients&quot; were calculated (Figure 2E) (only &quot;relative cell body density&quot; is described in the Materials and methods). The authors should take into account that quantification made on a Z projection will lead to loss of information that will decrease the sensitivity of the analysis. Figure 2E suggests that a more balanced conclusion should be drawn from the experiment, as part of gradient stiffness is independent of cell density gradient (gradient stiffness would thus be 0.4 for no cell density gradient).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this oversight and added an explanation of cell body density gradient calculations to the Materials and methods. As mentioned above, our Z projections consisted of three optical slices only that were spaced by 2 µm, so that we would expect the loss of information to be rather small.</p><p>The extrapolation of the fit in Figure 2E is an excellent point. When we force the fit through the coordinate origin (which would reflect a scenario in which the cell body density gradient is the only major contributor to the stiffness gradient), the R<sup>2</sup> value is still 0.74. However, we agree with the reviewer that other tissue components might very well also contribute to setting up the stiffness gradient to some degree, and we now tone our conclusions down and mention potential other sources including radial glial cells and the extracellular matrix. We would like to point out, however, that even if other cellular and/or extracellular components are involved in setting up an initial stiffness gradient (which would not be strong enough to cause axon turning), our experiments with two different mitotic blockers strongly suggest that the cell body density gradient is responsible for the development of this stiffness gradient to the point where it impacts axon turning, as perturbations of mitosis abolish the stiffness gradient almost completely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Provide relative cell body density for the BI2536 condition, as done in Figure 2D for the control (indeed, the authors stated that &quot;cell density gradient was significantly decreased compare to controls, particularly at later stages (Figure 2C)&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a relative cell body density count for the BI2536 condition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and rephrased our conclusion: ‘The inspection of the stage-dependent distribution of cells in the developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> brain suggested that in BI2536-treated brains, the nuclear density decreased particularly rostral to the OT (Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The Materials and methods section indicates that relative density involves ratio of 2D area in the image occupied by nuclei over total area (this does not appear to be a cell count). This measurement could be affected by differences in nuclear size. Have the authors measured nuclear size over time? Does this change? Is nuclear size different in BI2536-treated embryos? Also, it is difficult to see nuclei on the caudal side of the optic tract in Figure 2C (control).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we intentionally quantified the area occupied by nuclei rather than their number. Nuclei are usually much stiffer than, for example, cytoplasm. From a mechanical point of view (under the assumption that nuclear stiffness does not significantly vary with volume but rather with lamin A/C content, see for example Swift et al., Science, 2013), it does not matter whether the total nuclear area increases because of a change in nuclear size or number. The number of nuclei caudal of the OT is indeed very low, which likely explains (at least to some degree) why the tissue in that region is softer than cranial of the OT, where a significantly larger volume is covered by nuclei.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Again, related BI2536 and cell density measurements, over time for BI2536-treated embryos: It would be useful to know if the BI2536 caused apoptosis (leading to an overall reduction in density)? The nuclei look somewhat condensed on what appears to be the rostral side of the tract in the BI2536 sample by st. 37 (Figure 2C).</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot rule out that BI2536 caused some degree of apoptosis at the application site. However, again, from a mechanical point of view it does not matter much why nuclear density changes. The scope of this paper is to show that local tissue stiffness may change rather rapidly during development, and that these changes are largely governed by changes in nuclear densities. We would like to point out that retinal ganglion cells, whose axons grow along the optic tract, are located within intact eye primordia and are thus not exposed to the drug in exposed brain preparations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Show a different control movie in Figure 2F (OT trace looks the same as in Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We intentionally showed the same data in Figures 1 and 2, as we wanted to make a comparison easier (as Figure 1 shows absolute stiffness and Figure 2 relative changes in stiffness). However, we see the value of showing different time lapse data and added two more series to the supplement (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Justify the changes of presentation between Figure 2A and G.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2A (now Figure 2C), we show the stiffness gradients and turning angles normalised by the maximum values measured, which allowed us to extrapolate linear fits and determine the relative onset of both gradients and angles (leading straight to current Figures 2D, E). This normalisation is very useful as absolute values will vary slightly not only between individual animals but also between different AFM cantilevers. In Figure 2G (now Figure 3C), however, we wanted to compare treated embryos with controls. If we would follow the same normalisation process, the gradients of both groups would terminate at 1 and no differences would be visible. This problem was circumvented by normalising with respect to the first measurement in a time series (i.e., to the lowest value). This way, Figure 2G shows clearly that in controls but not in treated animals stiffness gradients and the turning angles are increasing over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Explain what BI2536 targets (inhibitor of polo-like kinase).</p></disp-quote><p>Done as suggested (main text, tenth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Explain differences between coefficient R<sup>2</sup>= 0.95 in Figure 2C and Pearsons coefficient in the text (p=0.97). Add scale bars in Figure 2C and F.</p></disp-quote><p>The R<sup>2</sup> value provides an estimate of the quality of fits to data distributions. Pearson’s correlation coefficient, on the other hand, provides a measure of the magnitude of correlation between the cell body density gradient and the stiffness gradient. We have added this information to the Methods. We have now increased the visibility of the scale bars in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For consideration in the Discussion:</p><p>1) You suggest that the &quot;gradient in cell densities is responsible for the stiffness gradient&quot;. However, the opposite could be true, as changes in stiffness have been shown to promote proliferation (should be referenced). In addition, as you previously showed that ECM manipulation changes the tissue stiffness and axon trajectory (Koser et al., 2016), it would be welcome to discuss whether you have assessed whether changes in cell density correlate with changes in ECM deposit and if BI2536 impairs it.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this comment. If cell density-independent changes in tissue stiffness would drive the growth of the stiffness gradient and independently lead to differential cell proliferation, interfering with cell proliferation should not diminish the stiffness gradient. However, our data show that the application of BI2536 almost completely abolishes the stiffness gradient, suggesting that it is rather unlikely that a cell density-independent stiffness gradient is responsible for the gradient in cell densities as suggested by the reviewer. However, the increase in cell density and thus tissue stiffness could provide a positive feedback signal, facilitating further cell proliferation as suggested by the reviewer. We have added this to the Discussion and provide a relevant reference.</p><p>We have not assessed whether changes in cell density correlate with changes in ECM deposition and if BI2536 impairs it. At the stages investigated in this study, there is very little ECM in the brain (in Koser et al., 2016, we added ECM to the tissue), and we would thus not expect a major effect either due to or impacting the ECM. However, we have added a potential contribution of the ECM to tissue stiffness in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the last paragraph, you discuss applications of tiv-AFM to other possible contexts. Limitations of the system should be also mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We now discuss explicitly limitations of tiv-AFM, which are mainly that the method is restricted to surfaces and the time each map takes, which currently limits whole-brain scans at cellular spatial resolution to a temporal resolution of about half an hour.</p></body></sub-article></article>
