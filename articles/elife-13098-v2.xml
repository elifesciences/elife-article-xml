Many bacterial and most eukaryotic ACs possess membrane anchors with six transmembrane spans. We replaced the anchor of the AC Rv1625c by the quorum-sensing receptor from <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> which has an identical 6TM design and obtained an active, membrane-anchored AC. We show that a canonical class III AC is ligand-regulated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. At 10 µM, the cholera-autoinducer CAI-1 stimulates activity 4.8-fold. A sequence based clustering of membrane domains of class III ACs and quorum-sensing receptors established six groups of potential structural and functional similarities. The data support the notion that 6TM AC membrane domains may operate as receptors which directly regulate AC activity as opposed and in addition to the indirect regulation by GPCRs in eukaryotic congeners. This adds a completely novel dimension of potential AC regulation in bacteria and vertebrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13098.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13098.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13098.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are surrounded by a membrane that separates the inside of the cell from the external environment. To communicate information across the cell membrane, cells often employ a relay system. In this system, receptor proteins on the surface of the cells sense information about the environment and trigger the production of a chemical signal inside the cell.</p><p>Certain receptors activate enzymes called adenylate cyclases, which reside just inside the cell, to produce a chemical signal. In some human and bacterial adenylate cyclases, about 40% of the protein is anchored in the membrane, far more than is necessary to hold the protein in place. It is therefore possible that this “membrane anchor” region plays an additional role, perhaps even detecting external signals.</p><p>A “quorum sensing” receptor protein that was recently discovered embedded in the membrane of a species of marine bacteria called <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> has a similar structure to the membrane anchor of adenylate cyclases. Beltz et al. have now replaced the adenylate cyclase membrane anchor with a <italic>V. harveyi</italic> receptor. This produced a hybrid protein that could both receive and translate signals from the membrane receptor.</p><p>A computational analysis of the membrane anchors of adenylate cyclases showed that they have striking similarities to quorum sensors. Furthermore, the membrane anchors of different types of adenylate cyclase have diverse structures that may have helped the cyclases to adapt to different environments and biological requirements.</p><p>Overall, Beltz et al.’s results suggest the adenylate cyclase membrane anchor is a new type of cell surface receptor. In the future it will be important to identify the environmental signal that activates adenylate cyclases, both in bacteria and mammals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13098.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13098.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>adenylate cyclase</kwd><kwd>quorum-sensing receptor</kwd><kwd>vibrio</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beltz</surname><given-names>Stephanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassler</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A canonical class III adenylate cyclase with a membrane anchor of six transmembrane spans is regulated by a receptor of similar design, the quorum-sensing receptor from <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1958 Sutherland and Rall reported the structure of a second messenger, cyclic 3‘,5‘-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which was generated upon incubation of a liver extract with the first messengers epinephrine or glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutherland and Rall, 1958</xref>). Since then cAMP has been demonstrated to be a universal second messenger translating a variety of extracellular stimuli into a uniform intracellular chemical signal. The enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of cAMP from ATP, adenylate cyclases (ACs), have been biochemically and genetically identified in most bacterial and eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khandelwal and Hamilton, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linder and Schultz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>). To date, sequencing has identified six classes of ACs. The small-sized class I (enterobacterial ACs), class II (toxin class) and the minor classes IV-VI are restricted to bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bârzu and Danchin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linder and Schultz, 2003</xref>). The class III ACs are ubiquitous, albeit with differing domain architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder and Schultz, 2008</xref>). The catalytic domains share sequence and structural similarities, yet minor, characteristic sequence peculiarities have resulted in a division into four subclasses, a-d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder and Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tesmer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tews et al., 2005</xref>). A fundamental difference between bacterial and eukaryotic ACs is that the former are monomers which require homodimerization for activity. The mammalian congeners, exclusively class IIIa, present themselves as pseudoheterodimers composed of two concatenated ‘bacterial’ monomers with slightly diverged, yet complementary domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, mammalian class III ACs are anchored to the membrane by two putative 6TM bundles, one in each of the concatenated repeats. Our knowledge about regulation of bacterial class III ACs is limited. Apart from a few soluble ACs which appear to be regulated by carbon dioxide or pH near to nothing is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kleinboelting et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steegborn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tews et al., 2005</xref>). The established regulation of the nine mammalian, membrane-delimited AC isoforms is indirect. Stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by extracellular ligands releases Gsα intracellularly which binds to ACs and activates. A potentially direct ligand-regulation of class III ACs via their large membrane anchors remains a genuine possibility.</p><p>The 6TM membrane anchors of bacterial ACs are obviously structural analogs of the 6TM bundles in mammalian ACs. In the past, we replaced the membrane anchor of the mycobacterial AC Rv3645 by the <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis receptors for serine, Tsr, and aspartate, Tar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanchan et al., 2010</xref>). Tsr/Tar and Rv3645 have a signal-transducing HAMP domain in common and both require dimerization. The chimeras were regulated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by serine or aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanchan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mondéjar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>), i.e. a 2TM receptor, Tsr or Tar, with an extensive periplasmic ligand-binding domain replaced a 6TM AC membrane anchor which lacks periplasmic loops. The data demonstrated that in principle direct regulation of a class III AC via an extracellular ligand is a possibility. The question whether also a 6TM receptor might directly regulate a 6TM AC remained open. This question is addressed here.</p><p>Membrane anchors with 6TMs are present in many proteins. Often they have short transmembrane-spanning α-helices and short connecting loops, e.g. in bacterial and mammalian ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupinski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linder and Schultz, 2003</xref>), in the cytochrome subunits of succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hederstedt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yankovskaya et al., 2003</xref>), ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang and Roth, 2001</xref>), in bacterial HdeD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mates et al., 2007</xref>), <bold>s</bold>ix <bold>t</bold>ransmembrane <bold>e</bold>pithelial <bold>a</bold>ntigen of the <bold>p</bold>rostate (STEAP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleven et al., 2015</xref>), or quorum-sensing (QS) receptors from <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> which have His-kinases as cytosolic effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng and Bassler, 2009</xref>). For the latter lipophilic ligands have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2010</xref>). This has opened the opportunity to replace the 6TM anchor of the mycobacterial class IIIa AC Rv1625c which is considered to be an ancestral form of mammalian ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2001</xref>), by the prototypically identical 6TM QS-receptor CqsS from <italic>V. harveyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, as a proof of principle, we demonstrate that a 6TM receptor not only substitutes a membrane-anchoring function, but also confers direct regulation of a class IIIa AC via an extracellular ligand with nanomolar potency. Taken together with a bioinformatic analysis the data indicate that the 6TM AC membrane anchors probably have an additional receptor function. This is a first and decisive step to add a novel dimension of direct regulation of class IIIa AC activities.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13098.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two-dimensional models of the canonical class IIIa adenylate cyclase Rv1625c from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (left) and the quorum-sensing receptor from <italic>V. harveyi</italic> (right) in the membrane.</title><p>Both proteins require dimerization to be catalytically active.

They comprise &gt;40% of the proteins. A function of these membrane domains beyond fixation in the membrane is unknown. Recently we became aware of the QS-receptors from <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic>, CqsS and LqsS, which feature a membrane anchor of an essentially identical design as the aforementioned ACs, i.e. minimal-length α-helices and short connecting linkers which presumably severely restrict conformational possibilities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a 2D representation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tiaden and Hilbi, 2012</xref>).

The QS-receptors from <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> are homodimers linked to histidine-kinases as cytosolic effector domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng and Bassler, 2009</xref>). This is comparable to bacterial class III ACs which are homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linder and Schultz, 2003</xref>). These superficial observations suggested that by swapping the membrane anchor/receptor between a 6TM AC and CqsS from <italic>Vibrio</italic> one might generate a 6TM AC which is regulated by the QS-ligand CAI-1. We chose the mycobacterial class IIIa AC Rv1625c for this investigation because of its similarity to the mammalian congeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2001</xref>) and the QS-receptor from <italic>V. harveyi</italic>.</p><p>The success of generating a functionally productive chimera between the AC and the QS-receptor hinges on the precondition that a suitable point of transition between both proteins can be found which allows signal propagation from the CqsS receptor to the AC effector. The cytosolic aa sequences exiting from the respective last TMs have no conspicuous complementarity which would indicate a self-evident point of connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, 15 different points of connection between the CqsS receptor and the catalytic domain of Rv1625c were probed. The first points of transition tested were the arginine residues present at the cytosolic membrane exit in both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The chimera CqsS<sub>1-168</sub>Rv1625c<sub>203-443</sub> was active (16.2 nmol cAMP·mg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>), but unregulated. The basal AC activity of this chimera was comparable to that of the membrane-bound Rv1625c holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2001</xref>), i.e. generally the two disparate domains were functionally fully compatible with each other. In the cyanobacterial class IIIa AC CyaG from <italic>Arthrospira platensis</italic> a distinct N-terminal domain that starts with RSEELL, was required for a functional interaction with the chemotaxis receptor Tsr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). A comparison between CyaG and Rv1625c AC sequences revealed a similar domain in Rv1625c beginning with RSEALL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, for the Rv1625c AC this point of transition to CqsS was chosen. In the CqsS His-kinase the auto-phosphorylated histidine is part of the canonical H-box (underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grebe and Stock, 1999</xref>). However, several chimeras of CqsS and Rv1625c linked in this region were unaffected by CAI-1. With transition points closer to the membrane exit of the CqsS receptor, e.g. at Val172, Ala181 or Gly185, AC activities were reproducibly stimulated by CAI-1 (not shown). For further experiments we linked Ala181 of the QS-receptor to Arg218 of the Rv1625c AC, generating CqsS<sub>1-181</sub>-Rv1625c<sub>218-443</sub> (abbreviated CqsS-Rv1625c; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) because it responded maximally. The chimera CqsS-Rv1625c was stimulated by 85% with 10 µM CAI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The response was concentration-dependent and the EC<sub>50</sub> concentration for CAI-1 was 400 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Discrimination between CAI-1 with a C9 and LAI-1 with a C11 lipid tail was absent. In both cases maximal stimulation at 10 µM CAI-1 and the EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These parameters perfectly matched the concentrations of 400 nM required to observe phenotypic responses from the CqsS-His-kinase in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13098.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stimulation of the chimera CqsS<sub>1-181</sub>-Rv1625c<sub>218-443</sub> by the QS-ligands CAI-1 or LAI-1.</title><p>Basal activity was 5.5 nmol cAMP·mg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>.

In CqsS from <italic>V. harveyi</italic> the corresponding residue is Phe166 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We examined its role by substituting it with all 19 proteinogenic amino acids. Substitutions by large flexible hydrophobic residues, i.e. Leu, Ile, or Met enhanced CAI-1 stimulation up to 480% compared to 185% with the parent Phe166 construct (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, a high discrimination between CAI-1 and LAI-1 was effectuated and the potency ratio CAI-1/LAI-1 at 10 µM increased from 1 to 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Evidently, the F166L CqsS sensor domain in the chimera shows high selectivity between CAI-1 and LAI-1. Our findings were in line with earlier results that the natural CqsS receptor preferably detects ligands with C<sub>10</sub> or C<sub>8</sub> but not shorter (C<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>) or longer (C<sub>12</sub>, e.g. LAI-1) alkyl tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tiaden and Hilbi, 2012</xref>). 3, 4-tridecanediol which has not been reported as a natural ligand stimulated by about 10% of CAI-1 at 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Other amino acid substitutions at position 166 of CqsS did not affect the extent of AC stimulation with the exception of tryptophan which abrogated stimulation (data not shown). Activation enhanced Vmax from 14 to 42 nmol cAMP·mg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> whereas Km for substrate ATP was not significantly affected (233 and 163 µM ATP, respectively). An up to 10<sup>4</sup>-fold activation of CqsS-stimulated reporter gene transcription was earlier observed in <italic>V. harveyi</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (21). The 5-fold activation of CqsS-F166L reported here appears comparatively small. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the amplification systems used differ profoundly. Earlier studies investigated the quorum-sensing system <italic>in vivo</italic> with a reporter gene transcription/bioluminescence read-out which is much more sensitive than an <italic>in vitro</italic> AC assay with isolated cell membranes used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the coupling of CqsS to its authentic effector might well be more stringent than that attainable in a chimera with an exogenous Rv1625c AC output domain.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13098.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Stimulation of the chimera CqsS<sub>1-181</sub>F166L-Rv1625c<sub>218-443</sub> by the QS-ligands CAI-1 or LAI-1.</title><p>Basal activity was 4 nmol cAMP·mg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>.

Here we examined whether dimerization of the QS-receptors is required for AC regulation. The CqsS receptor was connected to known inactive Rv1625c AC point mutants, Rv1625cD300A and Rv1625cR376A. These point mutants complement each other and the dimer is catalytically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, CqsS-Rv1625cD300A was inserted into pETDuet-3 alone or in combination with CqsS-Rv1625cR376A. When CqsS-Rv1625cD300A and CqsS-Rv1625cR376A were jointly expressed, robust AC activity and regulation by CAI-1 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This demonstrated that the membrane anchors of CqsS dimerize and allow individually inactive AC domains to form an active, ligand-regulated dimer. Expectedly, the expression product of CqsS-Rv1625cD300A was inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The experiment did not answer the question whether ligand binding requires a CqsS dimer. This was addressed by linking the inactive Rv1625c monomers to the 6TM anchors of either Rv1625c or the <italic>Legionella</italic> LqsS QS-receptor. First, CqsS-Rv1625cD300A and the full-length Rv1625cR376A were jointly expressed in pETDuet-3. AC activity was observed, yet CAI-1 did not regulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Second, the QS-receptor from LqsS was joined with the inactive Rv1625cR376A in a similar manner. CqsS-Rv1625cD300A and LqsS-Rv1625cR376A were concomitantly expressed. As before, AC activity was restored, yet regulation by CAI-1 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicated that the membrane anchors were close enough to enable productive heterodimerization; however, a regulatory ligand-binding site was absent. Possibly one ligand molecule binds at the interface of a receptor homodimer as is the case in the chemotaxis receptors Tsr or Tar or Ni<sup>2+</sup>-binding in PhoQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardina and Manson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanchan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mowbray and Koshland, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 1993</xref>).

At high cell density, CAI-1 is produced, released and binds to the extracellular CqsS receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). In a multistep intracellular process this results in reduced production of virulence factors and allows the pathogen to escape from the host, thus spreading disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rutherford and Bassler, 2012</xref>). Because extracellular loops for ligand binding are absent in CqsS and because of the lipophilicity of the ligand, CAI-1 may bind within the membrane segments of the receptor dimer. Therefore, the question whether CAI-1 stimulation is reversible was examined next. Membranes were stimulated with sub-saturating (300 nM) and saturating (10 µM) concentrations of CAI-1 for 10 min. The reactions were rapidly stopped by cooling to 0°C and the pre-stimulated membranes were re-isolated by ultracentrifugation. Those membranes were then stimulated again by CAI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Membranes pre-treated with 300 nM CAI-1 had an elevated ‘basal’ AC activity equivalent to the previous 0.3 µM CAI-1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, left). Accordingly, re-stimulation by 0.3 µM CAI-1 failed whereas addition of 10 µM CAI-1 activated to the maximal possible extent. Membranes which were initially exposed to 10 µM CAI-1 remained almost fully activated and were completely refractory to re-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this context we checked whether ligand was specifically binding at the receptor sites or remained unspecifically associated with the membranes. The supernatants of the ultracentrifugation steps of the pre-incubated membranes stimulated naïve membranes according to the previously tested CAI-1 concentrations. This excluded unspecific association of the lipophilic ligand with the membrane or adherence to the reaction vessels. Therefore, we can conclude that CAI-1 stimulation was irreversible. This is slightly reminiscent on the biochemistry of rhodopsin in the mammalian eye. There, retinal is even covalently bound into the membrane-segments of opsin, a GPCR with scant extra-membrane loops. After excitation receptor regeneration requires ligand removal by an enzymatic process and transport to the retinal pigment epithelium which, notably, contains exclusively adenylate cyclase type VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Völkel et al., 1996</xref>). How in <italic>Vibrio</italic> signal termination is accomplished remains to be investigated.

The functional membrane anchor replacement accompanied by a gain of a novel physiological function suggests that the Rv1625c 6TM anchor actually constitutes an orphan receptor, i.e. receptor without known ligand. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the QS-receptors and the 6TM AC membrane anchors by a focused bioinformatic approach.</p><p>From the Uniprot Reference Proteomes databank we obtained all class III ACs using the highly conserved catalytic domain for data mining (see Materials and methods). The catalytic domains were stripped; the putative 6TM domains were extracted and retained. Similarly, we extracted 6TM modules related to the CqsS quorum-sensing receptor. The combined data set comprising a total of 1616 6TM modules was subjected to a cluster analysis using the CLANS software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frickey and Lupas, 2004</xref>). In total, six distinct clusters were observed, five of which were interconnected to different extents, among them the cluster of QS-receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This clear-cut separation of 6TM modules is surprising and revealing. Transmembrane spanning α-helices have a strong predilection for hydrophobic residues with Leu, Ile, Val, Ala, Gly and Phe comprising two-thirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senes et al., 2000</xref>). Yet, the unequivocal clustering indicates a differentiated pattern of conserved 6TM variants which is at odds with an assignment of simply an anchoring device. We propose that the diversity of conserved patterned subtypes mirrors a succinct adaptation to particular physiological functions. By far the majority of 6TM modules were eukaryotic ACs, from the slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, the extant coelacanth up to man. The preponderance of eukaryotic sequences is, at least in part, due to the fact that in vertebrates nine distinct membrane-delimited pseudoheterodimeric AC isoforms exist, each with two TM modules, TM1 and TM2. The observed clusters were identified as follows: (<italic>1</italic>) An isolated, unconnected cluster of 30 bacterial class IIIb ACs is characterized by a ferredoxin between the membrane and the catalytic domain. A representative example is an AC from <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> (Uniprot Q132R4) which intracellularly appends to a ferredoxin module. The membrane anchors show sequence similarity to the cytochrome b subunits present in the fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase protein families to an extent that they can be matched by simple BLAST searches. These 6TM modules have four precisely spaced intra-membrane histidine residues which coordinate heme as an electron carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Einsle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hederstedt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kern et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2010b</xref>). It can confidently be predicted that the AC 6TM anchors of this cluster will turn out to contain two heme entities as prosthetic groups. (<italic>2</italic>) A cluster of 118 bacterial class IIIb ACs is characterized by a signal-transducing HAMP domain between membrane anchor and catalytic domain such as the well-studied mycobacterial AC Rv3645 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hulko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanchan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mondéjar et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, the structures of transmembrane domains of eukaryotic AC TM1, the bacterial class IIIa ACs such as Rv1625c, and QS-receptors of the CqsS type can be reasoned to possess overall structural similarities with that of cytochrome b561.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In 1989 the analysis of the first aa sequence of a mammalian AC suggested that the two membrane anchors, each consisting of six transmembrane segments, might carry a transporter or channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupinski et al., 1989</xref>). Since then, our knowledge concerning the membrane anchors has not advanced; to date no function for approximately 40% of a class IIIa AC protein sequence has been identified which goes beyond a mere membrane fixation. After 26 years we demonstrate for the first time that a canonical class IIIa AC with a 6TM membrane anchor is directly regulated by a membrane receptor of an identical design, yet with a known ligand, the QS-receptor from <italic>V. harveyi.</italic></p><p>Our data raise novel questions concerning the evolution of the regulation of class III ACs with 6TM membrane-anchoring modules. In absence of bacterial G-proteins bacterial class III ACs probably will turn out to be directly regulated via their prominent membrane anchors with the above mentioned <italic>R. palustris</italic> AC as an emerging example. In fact the membrane anchors of the class IIIa bacterial ACs are highly diverged whereas the catalytic domains are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that in bacteria the TM domains have evolved independently and very rapidly relative to the catalytic domains. This is in agreement with the general observation that mutations in upstream regulatory domains mostly are neutral and over time a variety of ligand specificities have evolved by chance mutations. At the same time even slightly detrimental mutations in downstream effector domains are not tolerated, thus resulting in sequence and functional conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schultz and Natarajan, 2013</xref>). In such an evolutionary scenario the mechanisms of signal transduction per se remain intact and allow revealing combinatorial diversity as demonstrated here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, in vertebrates the membrane-delimited ACs are regulated indirectly by GPCR activation which intracellularly results in release of Gα proteins. Is this the result of a loss of direct ligand regulation during evolution while indirect GPCR regulation evolved or has ligand regulation of mammalian ACs been missed so far? Because the AC membrane bundles of vertebrates are highly conserved in an isoform-specific manner from the coelacanth to man (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> as an example of mammalian AC_I and AC_II subtypes) one can reasonably assume that they have an indispensable physiological function. This could be a particular compartmentalized membrane localization e.g. described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crossthwaite et al., 2005</xref>) or, in our view more likely and in accordance with our findings an as yet hidden receptor function, as a direct ligand-binding module or in conjunction with an accessory membrane protein that operates as the true sensor. The second alternative would suggest that in vertebrates regulation of intracellular cAMP concentrations is subject to an interaction between direct, ligand-mediated and indirect GPCR-Gsα-regulated effects. A lasting receptor occupation by a ligand during different physiological states might well set the responsiveness of mammalian AC isoforms to a transient GPCR-Gsα activation. This would allow that lasting and transient physiological conditions converge via direct and indirect regulation in a central second messenger system, a situation absent in bacteria. This concept poses the questions whether in vertebrates suitable extracellular signals exist and whether the molecular provisions for a direct signal transduction through the 9 AC isoforms have been evolutionarily conserved. We are currently exploring these questions.</p><p>Recently we demonstrated that we could functionally replace the bacterial AC 6TM anchors by the <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis receptors for serine or aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanchan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). By analogy, the results supported the hypothesis of a receptor function for the AC membrane anchors. A less plausible interpretation would have been that the functional coupling might just be a manifestation of the modular composition of signaling proteins. The compatibility may only have required that a satisfactory domain order is maintained in such chimeras without invoking a functional relatedness. The data reported here add an entirely novel dimension to the working hypothesis that AC membrane anchors in bacterial homodimeric as well as in mammalian pseudoheterodimeric ACs function as ligand receptors. The 2D models of the membrane anchors of Rv1625c and CqsS are similar (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This should allow an almost isosteric replacement. Competent QS-receptor and cyclase chimeras were dependent on the point of linkage indicating that the connecting sites had been evolutionarily predesigned, were conserved and fully operational for signal transduction between functionally differing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schultz and Natarajan, 2013</xref>). Implicitly this supports the prediction that the 6TM anchors of such ACs have a receptor function for which stimuli have yet to be identified. Because the ligands for CqsS and LqsS are known, the direct regulation of AC activity then is no real surprise. Admittedly, based alone on the biochemical data one might again take pains to argue that the exchangeability of 6TM-anchors just extends the range of signaling modules which can structurally and possibly functionally replace each other. This alternative interpretation is rather implausible in our view. First mixing and matching TM domains of eukaryotic AC is impossible without loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seebacher et al., 2001</xref>). Second, the cluster analysis visualizes similarities between individual pairs of CqsS receptor type modules and membrane anchors from class IIIa ACs. Thus it supports the hypothesis that the membrane anchors of class III ACs, bacterial and mammalian alike have a function beyond membrane fixation. In this context cluster (<italic>1</italic>), which is unrelated to all other clusters, is particularly interesting. It demonstrates that comparable transmembrane architectures can result in significantly different sequence patterns notwithstanding the similar amino acid composition commonly shared by all membrane domains. Currently, it is impossible to speculate about or even predict the nature of ligands for the 6TM AC modules examined here. One might expect, however, that they will be closely associated with the intra-membrane space as extra-membranous loops for ligand-binding are noticeably absent in this type of 6TM bundles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>An <italic>E.coli</italic> culture containing the protein CqsS of <italic>V. harveyi</italic> was obtained from K.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers including Stephen Sprang, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>From the protein-engineering standpoint, your paper is an interesting and important contribution that should be of interest to a broad range of scientists who work in the area of signal transduction at the molecular level.</p><p>There are some points of concern that need to addressed. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> do not allow calculation of the maximum level of activation. Perhaps it is not possible to achieve ligand concentrations above 10 µM. Hence the ~6-fold activation of the CqsS<sub>1-181</sub>F166L-Rv1625c<sub>218-443</sub> chimera by CAI-1 may be an underestimate. Even so, this is considerably lower than the 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> to 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup>-fold activation of CqsS-stimulated reporter gene transcription observed at 0.01 µM ligand in <italic>V. harveyi</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (Ng et al., 2011). More than ligand-induced dimerization may be involved in the coupling between the CqsS TM/ligand-binding domain and its authentic effector, including allosteric and orientation factors, and they are clearly not retained when the TM domain is linked to an exogenous effector domain. Also, is anything known about the ability of CqsS to discriminate between the ligands used here? These points need to be discussed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is difficult to interpret. The IPTG strip was placed down the center of the dish, but the light/dark boundary is off to the left. Is the ligand only applied at the leftward vertical boundary?

Have you reproduced this experiment?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicates at least one connection between the quorum sensor domains and IIIa AC, and many connections with the IIIa eukaryotic AC TM1s. We assume that this means that there is actual sequence identity between them. This would be a strong case for divergence of CsqS regulatory and AC TM domains. The authors should address this either with a figure or by citing ranges of% amino acid sequence identities. If regions of identity are clustered, for example, near the effector-TM linker region, this would be particularly interesting.</p><p>Abstract (first sentence): We do not agree that all ACs convert extracellular stimuli. In particular in bacterial AC, there are often sensor domains for intracellular ligands.
