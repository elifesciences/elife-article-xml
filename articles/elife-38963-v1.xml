One theory spanning several fields of neuroscience proposes that their values are distilled to a single common neural currency, the calculation of which allows for rational decisions. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to play a critical role in this process, based on the presence of neural correlates of economic value in lateral OFC in monkeys and medial OFC in humans. We previously inactivated lateral OFC in rats without affecting economic choice behavior. Here we inactivated medial OFC in the same task, again without effect. Behavior in the same rats was disrupted by inactivation during progressive ratio responding previously shown to depend on medial OFC, demonstrating the efficacy of the inactivation. These results indicate that medial OFC is not necessary for economic choice, bolstering the proposal that classic economic choice is likely mediated by multiple, overlapping neural circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orbitofrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>economic choice</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoenbaum</surname><given-names>Geoffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inactivation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex using an optogenetic approach did not affect behavior in rats on an iconic economic choice task.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decision-making often requires us to make choices between biologically relevant goods that differ across many dimensions, including some whose value may be largely contextual (i.e. I value water most when I am thirsty) or even highly subjective (i.e. I like blue). How the brain accomplishes such comparisons, maintaining the relative values of disparate goods across time, while adjusting to reflect new situations and even contingencies, is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. Neuroeconomics holds that a major step in this process is the compression of the relevant features defining the different goods into a single dimension of value, so that disparate goods can be compared on a universal scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padoa-Schioppa et al., 2006</xref>). Single-unit and fMRI studies have typically assigned this process to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) based on the demonstration that neural activity there – identified either by single-unit or BOLD response – tracks value on this universal scale during economic choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGinty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plassmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie and Padoa-Schioppa, 2016</xref>). Yet these correlates are not ubiquitous; often single-units in orbitofrontal cortex do not seem to encode value independent of other information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennerley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kennerley and Wallis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McDannald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wikenheiser et al., 2017</xref>). Further, causal evidence to support a critical role for the OFC in economic choice is sparse, owing to the difficulty in doing such experiments in humans or monkeys, where economic choice is typically studied.</p><p>To address this, we recently duplicated in rats the economic choice task used in monkeys to isolate key neural correlates of economic value in the lateral OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Although rats’ behavior in this task exhibited all the core features of economic choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padoa-Schioppa et al., 2006</xref>), it was entirely insensitive to optogenetic inactivation of the lateral OFC, inactivation which was sufficient to disrupt devaluation-sensitive changes in Pavlovian responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gardner, 2017</xref>. Indeed recent work suggests that lateral OFC is not generally necessary for established choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While we interpreted our result as consistent with the parallel support of economic choice by a number of neural circuits, an alternative explanation is that the lateral OFC is simply the wrong part of OFC. The OFC is increasingly recognized as consisting of several subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heilbronner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Deutch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walton et al., 2011</xref>), and medial OFC is implicated in signaling common currency value by human imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plassmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>) and in mediating value-guided behaviors in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Münster and Hauber, 2017</xref>), monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>).

In this task, rats learned to choose between different numbers of flavored food pellets, providing the opportunity to precisely measure each rats’ relative preferences between different goods. On each trial within the task, an offer was displayed on a pair of 3.5’ touchscreens situated on either side of a central nosepoke. Each offer consisted of two symbols that conveyed two pieces of information: 1) the pellet flavors in the offer (banana, bacon, grain, chocolate, grape or cellulose), indicated by the shape of each symbol, and 2) the number of pellets of each flavor in the offer (1,2,3,4,6 and sometimes 8), indicated by the segmentations of each symbol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rats were required to nosepoke for 1s while the offer was displayed, after which they were able to make a choice by touching the screen with the preferred option. The chosen pellets were subsequently delivered in a food magazine situated on the opposite wall of the operant chamber. Each session consisted of 11 offers in which two food pellet flavors were presented in different ratios. Rats learned six visual cue –pellet pairings, and experienced the 15 possible pairings of the six pellet-types across training and testing.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38963.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inactivation of medial OFC on Economic Choice Behavior in Rats during the Cue Period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustrative example of a single trial on the choice task.

The shapes of the two displayed symbols signify the goods being offered (i.e. vertical bars and crescents), whereas the number of segmentations of the symbols indicate the number of pellets available for each good.

Within individual sessions, rats showed a clear change in preference for the two pellet-types across the range of offers given. The offer for which rats showed no preference for the two offer-types, referred to as the indifference point (IP), was used as an estimate of the relative valuation of the two pellet flavors. Notably, indifference points between particular pairs of food pellets for individual rats ranged widely from 1:1 to greater than 8:1, suggesting that the rats were choosing based on internal subjective values (only IPs &lt;= 6 were included in analyses). Further these indifference points were stable across sessions and exhibited transitivity across offer pairs with shared constituents, a property often taken as an indicator of rational decision making.</p><p>Given that medial OFC has been suggested to represent economic value, we expected that these hallmark features of economic decision making might be disrupted if it were taken offline in the critical choice phase of each trial. To that end, we prepared rats so that we could transiently inhibit neural activity in medial OFC using the optogenetic inhibitory protein, halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0). Rats (n = 6) were first trained on the task before undergoing surgery. AAV-CaMKIIa-eNpHR3.0-eYFP was then infused into medial OFC bilaterally, and fiberoptic probes were implanted just above each injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Following surgery and a 2 – 3 week postoperative recovery period, rats were retrained to pre-surgical performance levels (~5 weeks, see Materials and methods), then we began sessions in which we tested the effects of inactivating medial OFC.</p><p>This phase of the experiment, lasting ~8 weeks, was designed as follows: rats experienced three separate pellet-pairs for three consecutive days for a total of 9 test sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Rats experienced each pair in an initial warm up session that was followed by two test sessions in which they were connected to either a dummy cable, which was blocked at the ferrule to prevent light delivery to the brain, or a patent light-transmitting cable, which was unblocked at the ferrule allowing light to enter the brain. Cable type was counterbalanced across days. Each session was also separated into trials in which the laser was either on or off. During laser-on trials, green light (16 – 18 mW, 532 nm) was delivered to the fiberoptic cables. Laser onset co-occurred with the onset of the white noise that signaled that a trial could be initiated. The laser was terminated when the rat contacted one of the touch screens, and termination included a period of 300 ms during which the power was reduced linearly, a protocol which has been shown to minimize or prevent rebound excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>). Note, this design was identical to our previous experiment in which we inactivated the lateral OFC, except that we did not include a group injected with virus lacking the coding region of the halorhodopsin chloride pump. Because the behavior of the eYFP group in the prior study was identical to that of the experimental group and given the presence of both blocked-fiber control sessions and no-laser control trials, we deemed this third, between-subject control to be superfluous and hence unnecessary for the current experiment.</p><p>An initial examination of data from example sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, blocked and patent cable sessions from consecutive days on the same pellet pair) revealed very little difference in choice behavior between the laser-on and –off trials, and the averaged choice behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) supported this assessment. To look more closely, we quantified the effect of medial OFC inactivation on three separate primary behavioral measures: (1) the indifference point or relative preferences between pellet-types; (2) the steepness of the preference curves; and (3) transitivity or the consistency of preferences across multiple pellet-pairs experienced over a series of days.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38963.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects of Optogenetic Inhibition of Medial OFC on Economic Choice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Typical examples of observed behavior on the choice task during sessions with inactivation of medial OFC using halorhodopsin (patent fiber, right panel) or during control sessions (blocked fiber, left panel).

To determine whether this occurred with medial OFC inhibition, we ran a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA on 50 pairs of sessions with factors Laser (laser-on/-off) and Fiber (blocked/patent). This analysis revealed no significant main effects of either Laser (F(1,147) = 1.31, p=0.25) or Fiber (F(1,147) = 1.03, p=0.31) nor any significant effect of the critical interaction term Laser*Fiber (F(1,147) = 0.75, p=0.39). In addition, at the reviewers’ request, we also compared the current groups to eYFP controls, identically trained and tested in a prior experiment, and there were no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for ANOVA results)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). We also ran post-hoc simple effects comparing levels across each factor of the design. None of the four comparisons reached significance (paired t-test, n = 50, p&gt;0.14, β &lt;1e-10 for a shift to 1:1); this included the primary comparison of interest, laser-on vs laser-off trials in the patent cable condition (p=0.90). The indifference point increased by only 0.3% during the laser-on trials (mean IP for the patent fiber and laser-off trials: 1.649, mean IP for laser-on trials: 1.65), an effect which is well within the confidence interval (CI: [1.56 1.74], which corresponds ±10.6% shift of the IP). Importantly, our test would have found about a one-tenth change in the average preference significant.</p><p>Since rats do not have strong preferences between some of the pairs of food pellets, it’s possible that mild preferences close to 1:1 might mask a significant IP shift towards a 1:1 ratio with medial OFC inactivation. To test this possibility, we removed sessions within a conservative 1.45:1 preference based on an empirical distribution of variance (see Materials and Methods, 19 session pairs were excluded) and reran the two-way ANOVA. Despite our focus on sessions with strong preferences (mean IP for all conditions: 2.07), this analysis still found neither significant main effects (Fiber: F(1,90) = 1.57, p=0.21; Laser: F(1,90) = 1.19, p=0.28) nor any interaction (F(1,90) = 0.87, p=0.35). We again tested the simple effects of the design of which none were significant (4 paired t-tests, n = 31, p&gt;0.15, β &lt;1e-10 for a shift to 1:1) including the primary comparison, laser-on vs laser-off trials in the patent cable condition, (p=0.90). The mean IP increased 0.40% from 2.03 (laser-off) to 2.04 (laser-on) with a 95% confidence interval of [1.83 2.25] or ±17.2% of the mean laser-off IP. The exclusion of sessions with IPs close to the 1:1 can be visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> in which we progressively removed the closest IP to 1:1 from the dataset up to 90% of the sessions.

Although beginning 7–8 weeks after the initial viral injections, which should allow ample time for expression of the light-sensitive chloride pump, the effect of inactivation might have evolved over the course of the experiment. To test this we split the data into thirds, coinciding with the design for the test of transitivity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the average behavior for each of the three blocks of sessions. It is apparent from visual inspection of the plots that there was no effect of inactivation at any stage of the inactivation. A three-way ANOVA with factors Laser, Fiber and Time revealed no significant effect of the critical three-way interaction of Laser*Fiber*Time (F(2,141) = 0.08, p=0.92), nor any of the two-way interactions (Laser*Time: F(2,141) = 1.58, p=0.21; Fiber*Time F(2,141) = 0.35, p=0.70; Laser*Fiber (F1,141)=0.73, p=0.40). There was a main effect of Time (F(1,141) = 5.97, p=5.0e-3), which is likely due to the variations in the preferences across the three pellets used for each of the three time blocks.</p><p>Effects of time could also be manifest within each session. To determine whether an effect of inactivation was apparent at the beginning of a behavioral session, we included the minimum number of trials for each offer for which we could determine a reasonable estimate of the IP (n = 4 for each of the 11 offers, for both laser-on and –off trial-types, 88 trials total) which was on average, the first 29.9% of the session. We then reran the two-way ANOVA test on this early session behavior. Neither the critical interaction effect of Laser*Fiber nor the main effects displayed a significant effect of inactivation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for ANOVA results).</p><p>We next tested whether inhibition of medial OFC might be increasing the variance or uncertainty of the value assessment on individual trials.

In addition, at the reviewers’ request, we also compared the current groups to eYFP controls, identically trained and tested in a prior experiment, and there were no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for ANOVA results)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). Simple effects within and across factors also showed no significant differences (4 paired t-tests, n = 50, p&gt;=0.29).

A change well within the 95% confidence interval [0.76 0.91]. We again tested whether the slope might be more affected by inactivation during sessions in which the IP is reasonably distant from equal or 1:1 preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We used the same empirical threshold, 1.45:1, that we used for testing the IPs resulting in 19 fewer session pairs entering into the analysis. We repeated the ANOVA and again found no significant effects (Laser: F(1,90) = 0.19, p=0.66; Fiber: F(1,90) = 0.74, p=0.39; Laser*Fiber: F(1,90) &lt; 0.01 , p=0.98), and testing of the simple effects across conditions showed no effects as well (4 paired t-tests, n = 31, p&gt;0.55).

Again it is easily apparent from the figure that there was no emergent effect of inactivation over time. A three-way ANOVA with factors Laser, Fiber and Time revealed no significant effect of the critical three-way interaction of Laser*Fiber*Time (F(2,141) = 0.06, p=0.94), nor any of the two-way interactions (Laser*Time: F(2,141) = 0.04, p=0.96; Fiber*Time F(2,141) = 2.11, p=0.12; Laser*Fiber (F1,141)=0.27, p=0.61). Unlike the IP, there was no main effect of Time (F(1,141) = 0.44, p=0.64), further indicating this effect was due to variations in the preferences of the pellets used across the time blocks.</p><p>Finally, we looked at whether the slope was affected by inactivation just at the beginning of the session. As explained for the IP analysis, we narrowed our data to the first 4 trials of each offer (on average the first 29.9% of each session) and reran the two-way ANOVA test on this early session behavior. The critical interaction effect of Laser*Fiber was not significant. The main effect of Laser was significant. Further analysis revealed a significant difference in the simple effects between the laser-on and –off trials in the blocked fiber condition, but not in the patent fiber condition (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for ANOVA results).</p><p>After determining that medial OFC inhibition did not result in any observable within-session differences, we next examined whether medial OFC inhibition affected the stability and thereby transitivity of the rats’ economic choice behavior across sessions. Rats show transitive behavior on our task when choosing between multiple pellet-types across days. This implies that rats have a consistent and relatively stable value space onto which they map different goods in our task. Medial OFC inactivation could disrupt this mapping, resulting in stable behavior during single sessions but disrupted transitive behavior across sessions. To assess this, we plotted transitivity from 15 sets of 3 pellet-pairs presented across 6 sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). An example of the behavior for one transitivity measure, spanning 6 sessions, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Each point on the scatterplots represents the consistency of pellet preferences from a group of three sessions. The greatest of the three preferences is plotted on the y-axis, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and the product of the other two pairs are plotted on the x-axis, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Laser-on and laser-off trials from the same three-session pairs are connected by lines on the plot in order to visualize the effect of medial OFC inactivation on the same sessions. A comparison of these points for laser-on versus laser-off trials in blocked versus patent sessions demonstrates that the rats’ behavior was again generally transitive, with only small, seemingly random fluctuations between the laser-on and laser-off trial types. Critically the points and these small fluctuations were unaffected by whether or not the fiber was patent to allow inactivation. A table showing the IPs from all transitivity session sets is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. To confirm this, we performed a repeated-measures, two-way ANOVA comparing the single transitivity values; this analysis found neither main effects nor any interaction (Laser: F(1,42) = 0.54, p=0.47; Fiber: F(1,42) = 3.21, p=0.08; Laser*Fiber: F(1,42) = 0.54, p=0.47).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38963.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Transitivity Is Unaffected by medial OFC Inactivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of economic choice behavior from six sessions comprising one experimental unit of the test for transitivity.

A repeated measures ANOVA (rat and run were used as blocking factors) performed on the breaking point, corresponding to the number of pellets achieved, revealed a significant main effect of Fiber (F(1,10) = 9.97, p=0.01). This effect was robust with 7 of the eight blocked/patent pairs trending in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> left). An ANOVA with the same design yet performed on the total lever presses also revealed a significant main effect of Fiber (F(1,10) = 7.85, p=0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> right). Importantly prolonged inhibition did not result in decreased motor activity; Figure (7B top) shows histograms of the inter-press intervals (IPIs) for the two conditions in which there appears to be no discernable difference. A two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the cumulative distributions of the IPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> bottom) revealed no significant effect (D(1436,1045) = 0.028, p=0.74). Lastly, we checked whether medial OFC inhibition affected the animals’ motivation to consume the food pellets.

We found that transient optogenetic inactivation of medial OFC on randomly selected trials had no effect. Inactivation in the same rats altered performance on a progressive ratio task known to be sensitive to medial OFC manipulations, and post-mortem testing confirmed that medial OFC neurons in these rats exhibited viral expression and light-sensitive reduction in spiking activity. Together these data show that the medial OFC is not necessary for economic choice in well-trained rats.</p><p>The current study builds on our prior report that optogenetic inactivation of lateral OFC also had no discernable effect on economic choice in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). Inactivation of lateral OFC was motivated by influential reports that neural activity in lateral OFC correlates with value during economic choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGinty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie and Padoa-Schioppa, 2016</xref>), and the associated proposal that lateral OFC was central to normal decision-making in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>). Implicit in this proposal is that economic value is equivalent to the value revealed by devaluation underlying so-called model-based behavior. Such behavior typically depends on this part of OFC in both rats and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Machado and Bachevalier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pickens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">West et al., 2011</xref>). Yet we found that we could inactivate lateral OFC and abolish changes in behavior due to devaluation without any effect on economic choice behavior.</p><p>While this result did not support the lateral OFC as a critical, single bottleneck in which economic value is calculated, it left open whether other parts of the OFC might be performing this function. The OFC is now recognized to be a large area, potentially divisible into discrete subregions mediating discrete functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heilbronner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy and Deutch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walton et al., 2011</xref>). Within this framework, the medial OFC is increasingly associated with representing value. While neural correlates of economic value have famously been reported in the spiking activity of single units in lateral OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGinty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie and Padoa-Schioppa, 2016</xref>), human imaging studies tend to find common currency correlates in the BOLD signal in medial OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plassmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>). Further, lesions to medial OFC in monkeys disrupt value-guided decisions whereas lateral OFC lesions on the same behavior cause deficits in other more subtle functions, such as credit-assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>). Other studies have shown that medial OFC is necessary for appropriate valuation during acquisition of cue-outcome pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baylis and Gaffan, 1991</xref>), and also following selective satiation of one outcome during a choice task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011a</xref>). Damage to medial OFC in humans is associated with similar deficits, as well as changes in economic decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fellows and Farah, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the comparable part of OFC in rats, located along the base of the medial wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heilbronner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stalnaker et al., 2015</xref>), has recently been shown to be important for using information about outcomes to guide behavior when those outcomes are hidden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradfield et al., 2015</xref>), risky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stopper and Floresco, 2014</xref>), or temporally delayed, although there are conflicting results for this latter finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mar et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Yet despite the promising background data, we again failed to find any effect of inactivating the OFC on economic choice. Rats exhibited similar preferences among groups of flavored food pellets with or without medial OFC online, at least as indexed by indifference points, the steepness of the curves relating the two pellets, and the transitivity of the choices. This was true despite a reduction in the progressive ratio breakpoint in the same rats with inactivation, an effect that would traditionally be interpreted as an effect on valuation. These results show that medial OFC is also not the critical bottleneck for calculating a single common currency value to guide economic choice.</p><p>Instead, these and the prior data point strongly to the possibility that economic value and the resultant decision-making depend on parallel processing in multiple regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>). Such parallel processing would be predicted if the value judgement underlying economic choice, at least as assayed in this task, reflected a variety of associative information (e.g. Pavlovian and instrumental, model-based and model-free, habitual and goal-directed). This is likely because the economic choice task used here, and those employed in other settings, generally do not try to limit or control the associative information at play. Tasks that employ such controls have clearly demonstrated that these different types of associative information do not generally converge into a single common brain region, but instead are mediated by somewhat non-overlapping brain circuits, each capable of mediating behavior somewhat independently, particularly in simple or poorly-controlled settings. Our results are more consistent with this sort of distributed representation of value.</p><p>Of course, this does not mean that the processing demonstrated in this and similar tasks in lateral and medial OFC is not important for economic choice behavior. Rather it simply means that a better controlled form of the task is necessary in order to reveal the critical contributions these areas (and others) each make to the very general function of economic choice. For example, it has been suggested that orbital areas are critical when choices are novel, rapidly changing, or involve elements that have never been experienced – such as the evocative tea-jelly and snail-porridge prepared by Behrens and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baylis and Gaffan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fellows and Farah, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barron et al., 2013</xref>). Viewed in this light, the dissociation here (and also in our prior study) between economic choice and OFC-dependent behaviors, such as progressive ratio and Pavlovian devaluation for lOFC, occurs because these behaviors require a form of inference or estimation that is not necessary in a well-trained subject in the standard economic choice task like that used here.</p><p>Importantly, while this model of economic value takes us away from one in which all information is compressed into a single common currency value in a given brain area, this idea may return to be relevant in a more limited way once the precise type of information determining the role of these areas in the task can be isolated. Economic choices will depend on a particular region to the extent the choice emphasizes the processing dependent on that area. In this regard, the role of different subregions within OFC in economic choice behavior would be identical to their roles in other value-based behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Long-Evans Rat</td><td>Charles River</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2308852">RGD_2308852</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected <break/>construct <break/>(<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">AAV5/CamKIIa-eNpHR3.0-eYFP</td><td valign="bottom">UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">DAPI-Fluorescent- G</td><td>Electron Microscopy Services</td><td>Cat No. 17984–24</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">Triton X-100</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat No. X100- <break/>500ML</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Doric dual optical commutators</td><td>Doric Lenses</td><td>Cat No. FRJ_1 × 2i_FC-2FC_0.22</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>200 micron <break/>diameter fiber <break/>optic patch <break/>cable</td><td>Thor Labs</td><td>M72L01</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Fiber optic <break/>cannulae</td><td>Thor Labs</td><td>Cat No. CFM12U- <break/>20</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>ceramic zirconia <break/>ferrule bore 230 <break/>um</td><td>Precision Fiber <break/>Products</td><td>Cat No MM- <break/>FER2002S15-P</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>FC multimode <break/>connector</td><td>Precision Fiber <break/>Products</td><td>Cat No. MM-CON2004-2300-2- <break/>BLK</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>543 nm DPSS Laser</td><td>Shanghai <break/>Lasers</td><td>Cat No. GL543T3- <break/>100</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Arduino Mega</td><td>Adafruit Industries</td><td>Cat No. 191</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>3.5’ Resistive <break/>Touch <break/>Screen</td><td>Adafruit Industries</td><td>Cat No. 2050</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Raspberry Pi 3 B</td><td>Adafruit Industries</td><td>Cat No. 3055</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Six male Long-Evans rats (275 – 300 g, Charles River Laboratories), aged approximately 3 months at the start of the experiment, were trained and tested at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program (Baltimore, MD) in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines determined by the Animal Care and Use Committee.

The primary configuration of the box had touchscreens and accompanying wall mounts oriented at 30° from the plane of the left side wall to facilitate better viewing of the screen while the rats were nosepoking at the central port. A tall recessed food magazine (Med-Associates, Fairfax, VT) was placed on the center of the right wall opposite to the nosepoke and touchscreens. Pellets from two separate externally mounted feeders were dispensed into the food magazine.

Immediately following the choice, the pellets were delivered into the food magazine on the opposite side of the chamber. Rats then waited 6 – 16 s before the next trial started which depended on a random component as well as the number of pellets delivered on the prior trial. This was determined empirically such that rats were not waiting for longer periods of time for the next trial to start following trials in which only 1 or 2 pellets were delivered.

After rats showed discriminative behavior to the two visual cues, a central nosepoke was introduced to the box and rats were progressively trained to hold in the port for 2 s (1 s with no cues on and one second with visual cues displayed) when the white noise cue was turned on. Upon acquisition of the nosepoke, rats were introduced to the full task.

During this period of training, which required ~5 weeks, rats were given sessions in which the flavored pellets were paired with cellulose, to avoid additional over-training. Cables were constructed with blocking covers to reduce leakage of light into the box. However, it is impossible to completely eliminate light leakage. To control for effects of such light leakage during laser-on trials, ‘dummy’ patch cables were employed during retraining and testing. The ‘dummy’ patch cables were identical to the patent patch cables except that the optical fiber was blocked at the end of the cable and permitted no light transmittance into the brain. The ‘dummy’ patch cables were constructed identically to the patent cables with one exception; the optical fiber was terminated at the ferrule, or ~1 cm, from the animal-side terminal of the patch cable. A solid metal wire was inserted into the ferrule and epoxied into place in order to block. All ‘dummy’ cables were tested after construction as well as on a periodic basis using a Fiber Optic Power Meter (ThorLabs). After rats were familiarized with the ‘dummy’ patch cables and the laser being turned on for 50% of trials, inactivation testing was begun (~8 weeks after viral infusion). Testing proceeded in 9 day blocks in which rats were given each possible pair of three pellet-types for three days. The first day on an offer pair the blocked, or ‘dummy’, patch cables were used. The following two days on the pellet-pair rats had counterbalanced ‘dummy’ cable or patent cable providing a within-subjects control for light in the brain. Stepping through the pairs of three pellet types allowed for the collection of transitivity data across three different pellets which we refer to as a triplet. In a few cases in which rats removed the patch cable during a session, the three day period was thrown out and an additional three days were provided for the particular offer-pair at the end of the 9 days. In all sessions the laser was turned on for 50% of trials during the cue period of the trial. This experimental design was repeated three times for each rat. The specific pellets used for each of the three repetitions are as follows (Run 1: Bacon, Grain, Chocolate; Run 2: Banana, Grain, and Grape; Run 3: Banana, Bacon, Chocolate; see above for detailed description of the pellets). Lasers (532 nm, 16 – 18 mW; Laser Century, Shanghai China) were controlled by a microcontroller (Arduino Uno, Arduino) and were turned on concurrently with the white noise cue to indicate the availability to begin a trial. Lasers were turned off at the time of decision using a linear ramp over 300 ms to avoid the possibility of rebound excitation. To minimize the duration of the laser, the white noise and laser were on for 5 s before a timeout period occurred. Rats also had a maximum of 5 s to make a choice once nosepoke hold was fulfilled.

Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and superfused (2 – 3 mL/min) with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mM) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 21.4 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11.1 glucose maintained at 32 – 34°C. All solutions were continually oxygenated (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide). Glass pipettes (tip resistance 2 – 4 MΩ) were used for whole cell recordings and were filled with an intracellular solution containing (mM) 115 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>,. 025 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na-GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.2 – 7.3, ∼290 mOsm/kg).</p><p>Virus-infected (eYFP+) cells were identified using scanning disk confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1000), and differential interference contrast optics were used to patch neurons. Whole cell current clamp recordings were performed in visually identified neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex. For NpHR experiments, a 593 nM laser (OEM laser systems; maximum output 150 mW) attached to fiber optic cable was used to deliver light to the slice. Light intensity of 8 – 12 mW was used to stimulate NpHR in slice recordings. For experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,a</xref> 10 s light pulse was delivered to the slice. For experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, current pulses were injected (500 ms square pulse, 50 pA-600 pA). Half of the time, a 500 ms light pulse was given during current injection. Images were acquired using Olympus Fluoview software (version 3.0).</p><p>Electrophysiology data were acquired using an Axopatch 200 B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) in either voltage clamp or current clamp mode. Axograph X software (Axograph Scientific) were used to record and collect the data, which were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 4 – 20 kHz. Series resistance (Rs) was monitored with injection of hyperpolarizing current (−20 pA, 500 ms) and data were excluded if Rs changed &gt;20% during data acquisition. Recordings were discarded if series resistance or input resistance changed &gt;10% throughout the course of the recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Raw data was collected using custom written code in Python for both the economic choice task and for the progressive ratio task. All further analysis was performed using MATLAB. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>), in order to estimate a scalar relative value of two goods from a limited subset of all possible offers, an assumption must be made about the function relating the two goods in offer space. Here we assume a linear indifference curve (within a reasonable set of offer space) which entails that the ratio of the number of each good offered leading to indifferent behavior remains constant as the number of goods offered increases. In order to estimate the relative value of two goods from the choice behavior we performed a probit regression for each session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>), which uses the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution to predict the choice behavior given the log ratio of the offers. This provides estimated parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> of the fitted normal distribution, which were used as estimates for the log of the indifference point (<italic>IP</italic>) - the estimated relative value - and inverse slope parameter respectively. Sessions with relative pellet values outside of the offer range tested were not included in the analysis. This was done by excluding sessions (n = 4) with estimated indifference points <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>greater than a 6:1 ratio (non-preferred:preferred pellet).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Indifference Point and inverse slope</title><p>The average choice behavior across sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) was computed by subtracting the log indifference point from the log of the offer ratios for each session. The relative offer ratios were then binned into the intervals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. A probit regression was then performed on the aligned and averaged choice data for visual comparison. To test the effect of inactivation of medial OFC on the indifference point and the inverse slope, a fully balanced design was implemented with fiber-type (blocked/patent) and laser (on/off) as the factors in a two-way ANOVA. The number of repetitions of the design (n = 50) was used to match our previous paper of inactivation of lateral OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). As noted above, some sessions (n = 4) were dropped due to IPs exceeding a 6:1 ratio. Repetitions of the design were also used as a blocking factor due to the wide range of subjective indifference points for each rat and pellet-pair. This block factor had a main effect of p&lt;0.01 in all cases. This test was repeated on a subset of the sessions in which rats showed a significant preference for one of the pellets. In order to determine the threshold for indifference points sufficiently far from the 1:1, trials from sessions with the blocked fiber were randomly split into two separate groups. A bootstrap on the difference between the log of the indifference point for each group was used to determine a significance threshold (α = 0.05) for indifference point shifts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Transitive behavior</title><p>Assuming linear indifference curves, transitivity is defined as the log of the relative values of three goods A, B and C (in that preferred order) having the following relation, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>). In order to compare the transitive behavior during the inactivation experiment, the transitivity measure was compared in a two-way ANOVA with factors: laser (on/off) and cable-type (blocked/patent). The distance between paired points on the transitivity plot for laser-on and -off trials from the same sessions was also computed and compared using a two-way ANOVA with fiber-type and virus used as factors</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Progressive ratio task</title><p>A within-subjects design was implemented using four of the animals used in the economic choice task. The sample size (n = 8) was constrained by the number of rats used in the economic choice experiment and was ultimately chosen based on prior work showing a positive effect of medial OFC lesions on the PR task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Münster and Hauber, 2017</xref>). The number of ratios completed and the number of lever presses for each session were used as the measure of interest. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare sessions with the blocked and patent fibers with rat and run used as blocking factors. The same analysis was run for the consumption test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program at NIDA (GS).

includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal after it was made clear that the key issue was based on a misunderstanding of the course of training and was therefore unfounded]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Medial orbitofrontal inactivation does not affect economic choice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin Miller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in eLife. The overall conclusion is that this work is potentially of interest and could be worthy of publication in eLife in the future providing the concerns can be fully addressed.</p><p>The key issue is that the main result of the paper is a negative result and that it is not clear that you have sufficient evidence that the inactivation was effective. This is particularly important because the expression time, as far as we understand, was short for the test protocol, but long for the positive controls. This point is made most clearly in point 1 from Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The idea that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is central to computing and then comparing economic values has been one of the leading ideas about the function of this brain region. While a wealth of correlative functional imaging and neurophysiology abound, causal evidence for this hypothesis has, however, not been so clear-cut. For instance, deficits in the ability to update the value of outcomes in reinforcement devaluation task after OFC lesions have been taken as evidence for the OFC in economic choice, but this task requires a learning component muddying whether this paradigm is really assessing economic choice.</p><p>To get around this issue, Gardiner and colleagues developed a rodent version of the task that has classically been used by Padoa-Schioppa to demonstrate the role of OFC in economic choice behaviors. In single sessions, rats are offered choices between two stimuli associated with different amounts of flavored food pellets. Each day the rat's subjective equivalence curves are determined by systematically varying the number of each pellet available on each trial. Previously this group showed that inhibition of lateral OFC had no effect on performance of this task: rat's subjective equivalence curves did not change after inhibition. This is directly counter to the idea that OFC is required for economic choices. Here they tested whether another part of OFC, medial OFC might be the area required for economic choice. Prior work suggested that this area was required for comparing values, so maybe this is the critical computation/area for that their task is testing. Using precisely controlled optogenetic stimulation the authors show that inhibition of medial OFC does not alter economic choice behavior. Instead, inhibition is associated with a decrease in the number of competed trials in a progressive ratio test known to be sensitive to OFC inhibition.</p><p>This study is well motivated by the current state of the field, the experiments cleverly designed and the results are clear. It follows on from their previous work on OFC contributions to economic choice and is a strong compliment to that work. I only have a small comment for them about the interpretation of their effects as the paper exhaustively analyzes the data and there isn't much need for more in my opinion.</p><p>The null effect of medial OFC inhibition on economic choice task performance is very clear-cut, but this then raises the question of what makes medial OFC necessary for progressive ratio performance, which is a cost/benefit economic type decision. The authors touch on this a little in the Discussion, but I'm really interested to know why the authors think that medial OFC can be involved in some economic-like choices but not others? This question is motivated by the fact that a number of studies have shown that the medial OFC is required for economic type choices but only when the items compared have not been compared before (Baylis and Gaffan, 1991; Rudebeck and Murray, 2011; Fellows and Farah, 2007), are being affected by a bad other options that are constantly changing (Noonan et al., 2010; Chau et al., Nature Neurosci., 2014), or choices are between food combinations that are novel, like choosing between tea jelly and snail porridge (Barron et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2014).</p><p>So, there are two points here: 1) In the current design the type of pellets being considered on each trial are known to the animal, but at the start of the session the comparison is somewhat novel. If only the first few trials are looked at as opposed to the whole session, do the authors see any difference between the optogenetic inhibition trials and control trials? There may well not be enough power to properly run this analysis because the laser delivery is random from trial-to-trial, but I'm interested to know if there might be something there. It is also the case that as the first day of the three days that the animals get a specific pair of rewards is a control day the novelty of the comparison may have already passed, rendering the above futile. 2) Given the above literature on medial OFC in the comparisons of novel/changing options, I think it is worth noting how this factors into their multiple systems model of decision making that the authors highlight in the Discussion. Ultimately a rat may not need a medial OFC for this type of comparison because the available options are well learned and the decisions relatively automatic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a well-executed and careful study investigating the brain regions that are (or aren't) necessary for economic decision-making. In previous work, the authors developed a rat version of the iconic Padoa-Schioppa economic choice task, and demonstrated that inactivations of lateral OFC do not affect performance on this task. In this paper, they extend their approach to medial OFC, finding that this region also is not necessary for normal behavior on the task. The authors show that this is true across a variety of behavioral measures from a relatively rich task, and do a good job of validating their inactivation using manipulation checks. Extending their findings to mOFC represents an important contribution to the literature, and casts further doubt on the influential idea that OFC plays a key role in value-based decision-making. It is especially important given lesion data from monkeys and humans (Noonan, et al., 2010; Noonan et al., 2017) which has suggested a role specifically for mOFC, but not lOFC, in value-guided choice per se. Together with the literature, this study motivates the search for more nuanced and general theories about the role of the OFC and its subregions in value-guided behavior.</p><p>I have two relatively minor suggestions, which I believe would be straightforward to implement and would improve the paper:</p><p>1) In this study, the authors do not include a control group of animals injected with a YFP-only virus, as all comparisons necessary to support their claims are within-subject, and the control animals from their previous study showed no effect. This seems very reasonable. But why not present statistics directly comparing the rats from this study to the control rats from the previous study? If the task details are the same (my understanding is that they are) this should be a fair comparison, and would strengthen the claims made here.</p><p>2) The main findings of this paper are supported by a series of statistical tests which fail to reject their null hypothesis that mOFC inactivation does not affect behavior. The strength of these findings is therefore sensitive to the size of the dataset that was collected (failing to reject the null with thirty rats is stronger than failing to reject it with three). It seems to me that an important statistic to report in this case is the largest effect size that <italic>can</italic> be rejected based on the authors' dataset. For example, by eyeballing Figure 2B, it seems clear that the data rule out the hypothesis that inactivating mPFC drives the indifference point all the way back to 1:1. But do they rule out the hypothesis that it is driven halfway back? Five percent of the way back? Clearly there is some range of small (but nonzero) effect sizes that cannot be rejected by the authors' dataset – it would be helpful to compute and report this range. An alternative approach addressing the same concern would be to perform a Bayesian model comparison considering both the null and an explicit alternative hypothesis (see e.g. Gallistel, 2009, The Importance of Proving the Null; Wagenmakers et al., 2010, Bayesian Hypothesis Testing for Psychologists), and reporting the strength of evidence in favor of the null.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study the authors set out to determine whether the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) is responsible for computing and comparing the subjective value of choice options thus enabling economic decisions. Rats learned to choose between pellets that varied in both flavor and number to determine the indifference point (IP) for which the choice probability and, in turn, the subjective value between pellet options is equal. The authors demonstrate that bilateral optogenetic inhibition of mOFC during stimulus presentation has no effect on the IP or other choice metrics such as preference stability. The authors confirmed the efficacy of the inhibition protocol via slice electrophysiology and additionally showed that mOFC inhibition disrupted a progressive-ratio task. In conclusion, the authors demonstrate evidence that mOFC is not necessary for subjective-value comparisons in well-trained rats. This study contributes an important piece of evidence towards understanding OFC's role in economic decisions. The task allows for probing subjective-value comparisons and the authors convincingly argue that mOFC inhibition does not impact various aspects of the behavior. I have a few specific questions to be addressed in revision:</p><p>1) The main claim is a negative result and hence it is critical to establish that their inactivation worked. The authors state that behavior testing began 2-3 weeks after injection and implantation. This seems rather short to me for AAV-CaMKIIa-eNpHR expression. Do they have a demonstration of full efficacy of inhibition after this expression time? Ideally electrophysiological evidence should be provided that they managed to inactivate mOFC. Both 'positive controls' (slice and progressive-ratio test) were conducted weeks after the value task, i.e. with substantially longer expression times, hence they are expected to have larger effect size. They should first perform the progressive-ratio test before the economic decision.</p><p>2) In the progressive ratio task, the effect size of mOFC inhibition seems rather small (~2 trials), although consistent (Figure 7). What are comparable effect sizes reported in other manipulations? In reference to the PR task (Figure 7), where does the n=8 and F(1,10) come from?</p><p>3) It is not fully clear how disrupted economic choice would look like for specific behavioral metrics. What are the hypotheses regarding a disruption or changes in this task? For example, a change in IP would reflect a change in subjective value between choice options. Would inhibition of a value-computing area during parallel stimulus presentation expected to shift IP? Flatten IP function? Etc.</p><p>4) Has there been a demonstration that any manipulation can shift the IP?</p><p>5) Please clarify the pair contingencies in the Materials and methods section. Specifically, for 'transitivity' tests, how were the pellet flavor pairs chosen? What are the respective IPs for the chosen triplets for the six rats.</p><p>6) I did not fully understand the construction of the blocked-light patch cable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38963.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We have now clarified the training schedule to make clear that the critical testing occurred across a number of weeks, starting ~8 weeks after viral infusion and not 2-3 weeks as implied in the prior text.

As noted, we simply used progressive ratio as a confirmation, since mOFC in rats had been shown to be necessary for normal break points and this task does seem related to value and choice behavior. The idea that it might only be involved in comparisons between novel items is a point well-taken. Though if this were the case, it seems to us that mOFC would also not be necessary for progressive ratio, since this does not involve comparing new items. Unless the progressive omission of rewards is considered a novel option. It might be seen in this light. We now make this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So, there are two points here: 1) In the current design the type of pellets being considered on each trial are known to the animal, but at the start of the session the comparison is somewhat novel.

Though the rats are, of necessity, trained on the comparisons before the test, they may go a few weeks between experiencing a specific pair, so as the reviewer points out, once the animal re-experiences a pair, the decisions are ‘somewhat’ novel in that they have not chosen between the two particular pellets for a considerable time. So it is an interesting question of whether the differences might be there early. However actually looking at this is a bit difficult since the data is a series of Bernoulli trials spread across 9 offers – and so necessarily many trials are needed to get a reasonable estimate of the IP. We did perform this analysis using an n = 4 for each offer – on average this is equivalent to the initial 29.9% of the session. We again found no effect of inactivation, and these results are now reported in the paper.</p><p>Of course this is not a fair test of the general question. So we have adjusted our Discussion to better incorporate this idea, in the same place we address the same question about the progressive ratio impairment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have two relatively minor suggestions, which I believe would be straightforward to implement and would improve the paper:</p><p>1) In this study, the authors do not include a control group of animals injected with a YFP-only virus, as all comparisons necessary to support their claims are within-subject, and the control animals from their previous study showed no effect.

It does not change our conclusions, since there were no effects when we made this comparison. That said, I think it certainly adds strength to the argument when comparing to animals injected with a control virus. In order to be clear that the study was not designed with this as the plan, we have retained the original analysis and we now note this comparison to bolster the main result, with a supplementary figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The main findings of this paper are supported by a series of statistical tests which fail to reject their null hypothesis that mOFC inactivation does not affect behavior. The strength of these findings is therefore sensitive to the size of the dataset that was collected (failing to reject the null with thirty rats is stronger than failing to reject it with three). It seems to me that an important statistic to report in this case is the largest effect size that can be rejected based on the authors' dataset. For example, by eyeballing Figure 2B, it seems clear that the data rule out the hypothesis that inactivating mPFC drives the indifference point all the way back to 1:1.

Most importantly, we’ve reported confidence intervals for the critical comparison of the laser-on and laser-off conditions for the patent cable – basically the effect size for which we would reject the null hypothesis. We also took reviewer #2’s suggestion of putting this in terms of a percent change of the preference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I have a few specific questions to be addressed in revision:</p><p>1) The main claim is a negative result and hence it is critical to establish that their inactivation worked. The authors state that behavior testing began 2-3 weeks after injection and implantation. This seems rather short to me for AAV-CaMKIIa-eNpHR expression.

They should first perform the progressive-ratio test before the economic decision.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point the reviewer makes here. The statement that testing began 2-3 weeks after surgery was only meant to indicate the post-op recovery period. This is fairly standard for our lab. It was not meant to indicate the period between AAV infusion and actual inhibition of the OFC neurons. This period was substantially longer, not even beginning until 7-8 weeks following surgery. The intervening 4-5 weeks was spent food restricting the rats again, re-exposing them to each food pellet against cellulose, and acclimating them to the task with the patch-cables attached. Acclimatization is absolutely required to overcome effects of the cable on trial counts, so that we can obtain robust measures of IP, slope, and transitivity. We have adjusted the Materials and methods section to be more explicit about this period. Testing then progressed over another 8 weeks, and as we now show in the supplemental material, we do not see any effects of inactivation on behavior even when we subdivide this period into early, middle, and late periods. And of course the late sessions were about a week prior to the PR testing. We hope this new information, now better described in the revision, mitigates the concern that testing prior to successful expression is the reason for the negative effects in the economic choice task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the progressive ratio task, the effect size of mOFC inhibition seems rather small (~2 trials), although consistent (Figure 7). What are comparable effect sizes reported in other manipulations? In reference to the PR task (Figure 7), where does the n=8 and F(1,10) come from?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue as we feel we should add additional information for the behavior on the PR task. The procedures for the progressive ratio task are somewhat variable across labs in the amount of prior training and the schedules used. Results for the progressive ratio test can be reported as the final ratio reached – breaking point, or as total lever presses completed with both measures reported as the main measure in the literature. Many studies report the total lever presses, which is a finer measure of behavior – and presumably a more sensitive measure of comparison. We have added the total lever presses to our figure.</p><p>As for the degrees of freedom – As described in the paper, we ran four rats on the PR task, twice with the patent fiber and twice with the blocked fiber. For the analysis and in Figure 7A, we paired the first and second session and the third and fourth session (which were counterbalanced with both fiber-types) resulting in an n = 8. The degrees of freedom for the ANOVA are as follows: total df: 15 (4 rats x 2 fiber-types x 2 runs – 1); Fiber-type factor: 1 df; Rat factor (blocking factor): 3 df; Run factor (blocking factor): 1 df. Run being the first two sessions considered as a block and the latter two sessions considered as a block. The df for the error was 15 – (1+3+1) = 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not fully clear how disrupted economic choice would look like for specific behavioral metrics. What are the hypotheses regarding a disruption or changes in this task? For example, a change in IP would reflect a change in subjective value between choice options. Would inhibition of a value-computing area during parallel stimulus presentation expected to shift IP? Flatten IP function? Etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the proponents of this idea have not clearly specified what the effects of removing the “economic value generator” would be on behavior. We actually asked a number of neuroeconomists when we began this work and never got a straight answer. It seems to us that there are at least 3 principled potential effects: 1) The choices become completely random – this should result in a flattening of the slope 2) The specific or qualitative information of the value of the pellets is inaccessible – this should result in a shifting of the IP, presuming that valuing quantity is still intact. 3) The ability to appropriately determine the relative value across several goods is disrupted – this should disrupt the transitivity measure of three pellets. We test for all three effects, finding no evidence for any of them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Has there been a demonstration that any manipulation can shift the IP?</p></disp-quote><p>Not to the best of our knowledge. The main problem in this regard is that obtaining robust measures of IP, slope and transitivity – which are required to meet the criteria for “economic choice” – require the subjects to do a certain number of trials. This precludes or makes very difficult most of the ways one might get at this question, since if you do not deliver the food (typically required in devaluation), there are not enough trials to derive reliable measures of the economic value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please clarify the pair contingencies in the Materials and methods section. Specifically, for 'transitivity' tests, how were the pellet flavor pairs chosen? What are the respective IPs for the chosen triplets for the six rats.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Materials and methods section to be more explicit about this procedure, and we have included a supplementary table to go along with Figure 5 which contains all of the IPs. We also have updated Figure 5 to include an example of all data (6 sessions) which factor into one single measurement of transitive behavior. We hope this will make this figure more clear as to the nature of the data which enters into a single point. As for how we selected the pellet flavors: basically, we randomly chose which three pellets would be used for each of the separate repetitions of data collection for transitivity. We did make sure we sampled all of the pellets uniformly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I did not fully understand the construction of the blocked-light patch cable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the Materials and methods to better explain this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
