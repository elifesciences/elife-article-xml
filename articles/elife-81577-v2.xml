diseases and linked to altered TCR regulation and T cell activation. Here, we utilize Crispr/Cas9 gene editing with donor DNA repair templates in human cord blood-derived, naive T cells to generate <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk edited (620W), non-risk edited (620R), or knockout T cells from the same donor. <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk edited cells exhibited increased activation marker expression following non-specific TCR engagement, findings that mimicked <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO cells. Next, using lentiviral delivery of T1D patient-derived TCRs against the pancreatic autoantigen, islet-specific glucose-6 phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP), we demonstrate that loss of PTPN22 function led to enhanced signaling in T cells expressing a lower avidity self-reactive TCR, but not a high-avidity TCR. In this setting, loss of PTPN22 mediated enhanced proliferation and Th1 skewing. Importantly, expression of the risk variant in association with a lower avidity TCR also increased proliferation relative to <italic>PTPN22</italic> non-risk T cells. Together, these findings suggest that, in primary human T cells, <italic>PTPN22</italic> rs2476601 contributes to autoimmunity risk by permitting increased TCR signaling and activation in mildly self-reactive T cells, thereby potentially expanding the self-reactive T cell pool and skewing this population toward an inflammatory phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>Crisper/ Cas9</kwd><kwd>transgenic TCR</kwd><kwd>cord blood</kwd><kwd>PTPN22</kwd><kwd>SNP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP3DK111802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Warren</given-names></name><name><surname>Barahmand-pour-Whitman</surname><given-names>Fariba</given-names></name><name><surname>Linsley</surname><given-names>Peter S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cerosaletti</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name><name><surname>Buckner</surname><given-names>Jane H</given-names></name><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018762</institution-id><institution>Seattle Children's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Children's Guild Association Endowed Chair in Pediatric Immunology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009992</institution-id><institution>Seattle Children's Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Immunity and Immunotherapies</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009992</institution-id><institution>Seattle Children's Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Cell and Gene Therapy</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009992</institution-id><institution>Seattle Children's Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hansen Investigator in Pediatric Innovation Endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Benaroya Family Gift Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene editing to generate precisely matched primary human T cell populations demonstrates that the common autoimmune risk allele in the tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN22, promotes signaling in cells expressing a low-avidity, self-reactive TCR specific for a diabetes-associated self-antigen.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preventing inappropriate immune responses is critical to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and the prevention of autoimmunity. The risk of autoimmunity stems from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theofilopoulos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho and Feldman, 2015</xref>). While the greatest risk factor for most autoimmune disease is HLA haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Todd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonifacio et al., 2018</xref>), an individual’s total genetic risk is determined by a combination of gene variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotsapas et al., 2011</xref>), many of which cluster near genes responsible for regulating immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farh et al., 2015</xref>). A leading example of such an autoimmune risk variant is found in the gene protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (<italic>PTPN22</italic>).</p><p>While the phosphatase encoded by <italic>PTPN22</italic> can function to modulate a range of immune signaling programs, it has been best studied in lymphocyte antigen receptor regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2002</xref>). An arginine to tryptophan substitution (R620W) resulting from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2476601) within <italic>PTPN22</italic> is broadly associated with a large number of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tizaoui et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>PTPN22</italic> R620W, hereafter referred to as the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant, is one of the strongest, non-HLA, genetic risk factors for autoimmune diseases, nearly doubling a carrier’s risk of type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begovich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyogoku et al., 2004</xref>). As <italic>PTPN22</italic> plays a role in multiple autoimmune diseases, it has been argued that this SNP potentially highlights a common pathway that alters immune tolerance and might serve as a potential point of intervention to prevent and/or delay disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rawlings et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In T cells, PTPN22 functions to dephosphorylate key activating tyrosine residues within the proximal tyrosine kinase effectors, LCK and ZAP70, in the TCR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottini et al., 2004</xref>). This function is mediated in concert with activity through PTPN22’s binding partner, C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), which also regulates LCK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cloutier and Veillette, 1999</xref>). Co-association of PTPN22 and CSK results in residence of both proteins within the cytosolic plasma membrane of resting T cells through the association of CSK with another TCR inhibitory protein, PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simoncelli et al., 2020</xref>). The R620W substitution in <italic>PTPN22</italic> is located within a proline rich, C-terminal domain and reduces the interaction of PTPN22 with CSK leading to altered localization of PTPN22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottini et al., 2004</xref>). The functional outcome of disrupted PTPN22 protein interactions has led to significant debate as to the mechanism by which the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant contributes to altered T cell function and self-tolerance, namely whether the human <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant mediates a gain- vs. a loss-of-function impact on TCR regulation.</p><p>Primary T cells isolated from carriers of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant display significantly weaker responses to TCR engagement, as measured by calcium flux, cytokine release, and other metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arechiga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vang et al., 2013</xref>). However, in murine models, expression of the risk variant leads to enhanced TCR responses, as measured by the same metrics in addition to increased T cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, genetic ablation of <italic>PTPN22</italic> in both mouse and human primary T cells results in enhanced TCR signaling relative to <italic>PTPN22</italic> wild type cells; findings similar to murine risk model yet opposite of the phenotypes described in human carriers of the risk variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, genetic ablation of <italic>ptpn22</italic> in a fixed TCR murine model has shown that loss of PTPN22 preferentially impacts T cells responses to low-avidity antigens, but not high-avidity antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salmond et al., 2014</xref>); driving increased proliferation and skewing toward a Th1 phenotype in <italic>ptpn22</italic> KO T cells. While these observations suggest an important potential mechanism for how the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant promotes autoimmunity, this concept has not been tested in primary human T cells.</p><p>Both human carriers and murine models of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant share important traits. For instance, the risk variant is associated with an increase in memory lymphocyte populations and expanded pro-inflammatory/Th1 T cells and both exhibit increased risk of autoimmune manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it remains surprising that murine and human carriers exhibit these key similarities despite the published differences in the TCR signaling responses described human vs. mouse T cells. Notably, the murine and human T cell populations used for previous studies exhibit fundamental differences. First, most data for human <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant phenotype have utilized mature T cells isolated from adult donors, while T cells from murine studies utilize donor mice with minimal environmental exposures. Studies of <italic>PTPN22</italic> using human cord blood-derived T cells have been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rawlings et al., 2015</xref>). Also, murine models of the <italic>ptpn22</italic> risk variant are conducted in genetically homogenous, autoimmune-prone strains or models with a fixed TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maine et al., 2016</xref>), conditions difficult to mimic in a primary human T cell setting. Further, in vitro human T cell line models of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant lead to discrepant results, indicating that the impact(s) of the variant are context dependent, further complicating efforts to study the variant in human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zikherman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Crispr/Cas9 gene editing has allowed for precise manipulation of genetic loci in primary human T cells. Delivery of recombinant ribonucleoproteins (RNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Okamoto et al., 2019</xref>] containing Cas9 complexed with sequence specific guide RNA sequences) via electroporation into primary T cells efficiently mediates site-specific DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) near a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). Such DNA breaks trigger a series of events driving 5’ to 3’ exonuclease activity at the broken DNA ends as the cell prepares to mend the break through potential repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scully et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue and Greene, 2021</xref>). When DSBs are generated in the presence of a single stranded oligo deoxynucleotides (ssODNs) (co-delivered with RNP), DNA repair pathways can utilize regions of homology within an ssODN as a repair template for precise genetic modification by homology directed repair (HDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>). This approach has previously been used to integrate a premature stop codon in the <italic>PTPN22</italic> locus of primary human T cells with high efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we utilized a combination of HDR-based gene editing and TCR co-delivery in naïve cord blood T cells to establish a platform to better understand the role of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant in primary human T cells. Through Crispr/Cas9 gene editing we find the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant T cells mimicked <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO T cells, with enhanced expression of surface activation markers in response to TCR stimulation. Further, using transgenic TCR stimulation in concert with gene edited cells, we found that the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant accentuates the response of low-avidity primary human T cells to antigen, implying a key role for these events in the progressive loss of T cell tolerance in human autoimmune diseases associated with this risk allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of PTPN22 risk and non-risk edited T cells with Crispr/Cas9 gene editing</title><p>In this study, we sought to identify methods to utilize HDR-based gene editing to study alternative <italic>PTPN22</italic> alleles within identical populations of primary human T cells. Notably, previous work has shown that altering expression levels of <italic>PTPN22</italic> and/or its regulatory proteins can produce potentially contradictory results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zikherman et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, <italic>PTPN22</italic> contains several splice variants that might modulate the impact of the risk variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ronninger et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we sought to utilize an editing platform that would permit us to introduce either a control, risk, or knockout (KO) sequence via direct modulation of the endogenous SNP locus, without the addition of exogenous promoters or selection agents that may alter natural <italic>PTPN22</italic> expression. To accomplish this goal, we expanded on previously reported methods to generate <italic>PTPN22</italic> gene disrupted primary human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>) to establish an HDR-based editing platform. We combined delivery of Crispr/Cas9 with ssODN HDR templates designed to alter the coding region of exon 14 of <italic>PTPN22</italic>. Use of Crispr/Cas9 RNPs with short ssODN repair templates to alter the DNA of primary cells has been shown to be highly efficient, provided the nuclease cuts near the desired edit site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meitlis et al., 2020</xref>). A naturally existing Crispr/Cas9 gRNA PAM site is positioned in exon 14 of <italic>PTPN22</italic> to allow an RNP induced DSB immediately 5’ of the SNP nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Also, previous work has shown that homology arm design of ssODN repair templates may impact editing rates when used with a Crispr/Cas9 RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). We tested several ssODN repair template designs with our <italic>PTPN22</italic> RNP for optimized introduction of a 2 bp coding alteration to generate the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, this 2 bp edit blocks subsequent binding of the RNP, preventing cleavage of the repaired locus. We found that in adult peripheral blood CD4 T cells, a 120 bp ssODN design with a long 5’ homology arm (ssODN V3, 5’ arm 89 bp/3’ arm 29 bp) efficiently introduced the desired coding sequence alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). Using this design, we created three ssODN repair templates that worked efficiently in association with the <italic>PTPN22</italic> RNP to produce three gene editing outcomes: non-risk edited <italic>PTPN22</italic>, risk edited <italic>PTPN22</italic>, and a <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO ssODN that seamlessly introduces a stop codon into all three reading frames of the RNP cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene editing protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (<italic>PTPN22</italic>) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in cord blood CD4 T cells produces comparable populations.</title><p>CD4 T cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood for Crispr/Cas9 gene editing.

Thus, human T cells isolated from subjects with the risk variant are likely to be previously impacted by diverse developmental, age-related and environmental exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rawlings et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that using naïve, cord blood-derived CD4 T cells isolated from non-risk human donors, which are minimally impacted by previous environmental events, would provide the most relevant cell population for our study and generate the most informative dataset with respect to impact(s) of the variant on human T cell function. Using our <italic>PTPN22</italic> RNP and ssODN repair templates with a gene editing workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we edited human cord blood-derived naïve CD4 T cells from multiple <italic>PTPN22</italic> non-risk donors to concurrently model the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant, control edited, and KO edited cells. Comparing edited populations to mock edited cells (which received Cas9 without gRNA and <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO ssODN), all gene edited populations showed similar viability, regardless of editing reagents used, with a slight reduction in viability observed in all T cell populations receiving electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis demonstrated nearly identical gene editing rates in cells edited with the <italic>PTPN22</italic> non-risk vs. risk ssODN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both edited populations exhibited average HDR rates of ~50%, and no detectable editing was present in mock edited populations. HDR rates in <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO edited cells were slightly higher, likely due to a lack of nucleotide mismatches between the ssODN template and the digested <italic>PTPN22</italic> locus. As expected, beyond HDR events, NHEJ events accounted for most of the remaining editing outcomes in cells modified in the presence of ssODNs. NHEJ events were absent or dominant, in mock and RNP-only edited populations, respectively. Western blot analysis confirmed that, <italic>PTPN22</italic> non-risk and risk edited populations retained equivalent expression levels of <italic>PTPN22</italic> (with a reduction in total PTPN22 protein compared with mock edited cells reflecting the NHEJ-mediated loss of protein expression in the absence of successful HDR).

RNP based editing can induce large deletions that may bias sequencing of editing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosicki et al., 2018</xref>), making accurate single cell profiling challenging. As HDR rates in our approach were identified using probe based ddPCR detection, this data is resistant to this type of bias. With ~50% HDR rates and ~50% NHEJ rates, the edited populations would, at a minimum, be 50% biallelically edited and 50% full <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO. Of note, previous single cell studies in primary cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mocciaro et al., 2018</xref>) including primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mocciaro et al., 2018</xref>), demonstrate that monoallelic HDR is far more frequent than biallelic HDR. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the predominant editing outcome in our studies is hemizygosity with an undetermined frequency of biallelic editing events. However, as an independent edited control population is utilized in all our analyses, the effects of <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO alleles (monoallelic or biallelic) are accounted for when <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk edited cells are compared to non-risk edited populations.

Recent work has also shown that gene edited primary human T cells can be rendered antigen specific through the lentiviral delivery of TCRs prior to electroporation with RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). To study the impact of PTPN22 loss of function on antigen specific TCR responses, we transduced human cord blood CD4 T cells with lentiviral vectors (LV) encoding for alternative TCRs that respond to the same 20mer epitope of IGRP when presented by HLA-DRB1 04:01; and subsequently modified these LV transduced populations using HDR-based gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Addition of LV transduction prior to gene editing did not impact gene editing outcomes or rates of HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Transgenic TCR chains were engineered to utilize the murine constant regions allowing staining with murine TCR specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerosaletti et al., 2017</xref>) and limiting potential cross pairing with endogenous TCR chains. To track LV transduced cells, constructs were modified to express cis-linked GFP simultaneously with TCR expression. LV transduction was performed using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 in an effort to transduce &lt;25% of the T cell population. This approach led to an average of 5–15% marking (depending on donor and LV product), ensuring low viral copy number per transduced cell and similar levels of TCR expression within experimental groups. After gene editing, expansion, and rest, gene edited/TCR+ T cells were stimulated via addition of irradiated PBMCs from an allogeneic HLA-DRB1 04:01 donor that had been pre-incubated with cognate IGRP peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Following stimulation of TCR+ cord blood T cells with peptide loaded APCs, the alternative self-reactive TCRs responded to IGRP peptide at markedly different magnitudes. The two TCRs, that we term: ‘lower avidity TCR’ or L-TCR, and ‘higher avidity TCR’ or H-TCR, triggered different rates of proliferation over 3 days (based on either dye dilution or direct cell counts), consistent with their reported avidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linsley et al., 2021</xref>).

Thus, to control for levels of HDR edited vs. gene disrupted <italic>PTPN22</italic> alleles, we designed our experiments to assess the functional outcome of TCR engagement within a pool of risk vs. non-risk edited cells. To achieve this comparison, cord blood T cells were LV transduced to deliver the L-TCR and subsequently edited (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to generate <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk edited or non-risk edited populations, each expressing L-TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

This gene editing approach should be applicable to many cell types and broadly applicable to study the impact of candidate disease associated alleles (identified by GWAS or other sequencing strategies) within primary human cell populations. Notably, our data clearly demonstrate that <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant expressing T cells exhibit a phenotype similar to <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO T cells, leading to increased expression of TCR induced activation responses markers. Further, using transgenic TCR delivery and cognate peptide-mediated activation, in tandem with our gene editing platform, we show that PTPN22 deficiency predominantly impacts T cells activated in response to low-avidity TCR engagement. In contrast, PTPN22 function is largely dispensable in T cells receiving a high-avidity TCR signal. Together, these data suggest that the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant may contribute to autoimmune responses, at least in part, by selectively expanding the pool of lower avidity, self-reactive T cells and skewing such cells toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Our findings are consistent with previous work in a fixed TCR murine model that also found loss of ptpn22 to preferentially impact low-avidity TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salmond et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, our study models function of the PTPN22 regulatory pathway in a fully human gene edited primary cell setting.</p><p>Our editing platform utilizes a designer nuclease that generates a dsDNA break in close proximity to the target site for HDR editing. This combined approach allows for: (a) generation of edited cells with high rates of HDR; (b) equivalent HDR rates for alternative coding changes within the target gene via use of a series of ssODN donors; and (c) achieving editing outcomes while controlling for the overall HDR/NHEJ ratio. An additional strength is that the location and small editing footprint allows for physiological expression via use of the endogenous promoter, local enhancers, and 3’ UTR. Also, editing in this location is unlikely to disrupt the formation of natural <italic>PTPN22</italic> splice variants. Of note, <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk and non-risk ssODNs, while producing identical HDR rates, demonstrated reduced HDR relative to editing using the <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO ssODN. This modest difference likely reflects the requirement to replace endogenous nucleotides immediately 5’ and 3’ to the DNA cut site to achieve risk or non-risk edits, while the KO ssODN only required insertion of new nucleotides. These minor differences aside, our editing platform should be readily adaptable for the study of multiple loci across the genome in future studies of human primary cell populations.</p><p>We demonstrate that expression of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant can increase proliferation of primary human T cells expressing a low-avidity TCR, findings that mimic <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO T cells. Furthermore, we show that loss of PTPN22 regulation promotes the development of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in T cells using a low-avidity TCR. These combined findings are consistent with in vivo functional impacts observed in human and mouse studies. Indeed, while previous human data and mouse models have led to contradictory conclusions regarding the impact of the risk variant on proximal TCR signaling, both humans and mice with the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant exhibit expanded memory T cell and Th1 populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salmond et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, <italic>PTPN22</italic> is expressed in multiple immune and hematopoietic subsets and has been shown to have multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rawlings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stanford and Bottini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armitage et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, our dataset informs on a single signaling program and <italic>PTPN22</italic> may contribute to autoimmune disease via other pathways.</p><p>While our editing design provides a useful means to address questions related to TCR engagement, this approach has limitations including assessing early intracellular signaling events. While gene edited cells exhibited proximal phosphorylation changes in response to antibody-based stimulation, biochemical changes were not detected until 24 hr post peptide-based stimulation. Future work may find a path around this technical challenge allowing better insight into early signaling events. Also, while our findings provide an important bridge between inconsistencies connecting <italic>PTPN22</italic> to autoimmune risk in previous mouse vs. primary human cell data, it should not be viewed as a replacement for mouse models. Our study relies on ex vivo culturing of T cells, outside of optimal physiological conditions and supportive niches, features that may have key impacts on protein tyrosine phosphatase functions. Also, though our gene KO model reached 100% as measured by ddPCR, western quantification data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) may suggest residual expression of <italic>PTPN22</italic>, a consideration not of relevant for mouse models. Finally, as our model is restricted to peripheral mature T cells, it is inadequate to assess the role for PTPN22 in T cell development. For example, while mouse models suggest that the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant alters thymic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2013</xref>) others have shown that <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO has no impact on the TCR repertories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hasegawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salmond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maine et al., 2012</xref>). Because our study shows the risk variant functions similarly in human T cells in comparison with published murine models, it suggests that returning to these models to investigate specific contexts where PTPN22 might impact selection and tolerance is likely to be informative and critical for full understanding of this variant.</p><p>While T cells expressing a lower avidity TCR were primarily impacted in our studies, we cannot eliminate potential alternative impacts of the TCRs studied in our models. The TCRs evaluated exhibited distinct differences in both EC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linsley et al., 2021</xref>) and triggered proliferative response to an identical IGRP derived peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linsley et al., 2021</xref>). However, while these data points support a working hypothesis of TCR avidity determining the functional impact, we cannot rule out the role for possible differences in TCR disassociation rates and/or overall duration of TCR engagement. Further, while our approach provides a robust system to assess the impact of the risk variant in primary human T cells, our findings are derived from a comparison of only two specific TCRs. The identification of similar pairs of ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ avidity TCRs recognizing identical self-peptides will be useful in assessing our model and its interpretation across a broader pool of TCR interactions. Notably, in this study we explored the impacts of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant and KO specifically in cord blood CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells were chosen for this study based on well-documented use in gene editing models and likely key roles in <italic>PTPN22</italic> associated autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Cord blood was used to minimize differences in environmental impact between T cell donors. Although previous work has revealed similar findings regarding the phenotype of <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO in adult T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>), it remains possible that similar risk variant editing experiments using adult peripheral blood may yield different results.</p><p>Consistent with our findings, recent work using lentiviral-based overexpression in primary human T cells also revealed hypomorphic function of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perry et al., 2021</xref>). Further, that study and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanchez-Blanco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burn et al., 2016</xref> have suggested that PTPN22 may modulate pathways other than the TCR including LFA-1-mediated integrin signals, stabilizing immunological synapses that promote T cell proliferation and Th1 skewing. Our data using low dose CD3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) support the conclusion that both the variant and <italic>PTPN22</italic> KO can impact T cell activation through altered regulation of the TCR. Notably, our CD3 studies were performed in the absence of co-stimulation to better mimic sub-optimal TCR engagement. Thus, the relevance of our findings based on endogenous-level expression compared to lentiviral-based <italic>PTPN22</italic> over-expression in association with CD3/CD28 co-stimulation are difficult to compare. Together, our findings that the risk variant preferentially modulates low avidity TCR engagement, with the observations of these previous studies suggests that the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant may exert its impact on T cells both via altering TCR signaling and by modulating additional signals including LFA-1 pathway regulation.</p><p>Through gene editing we demonstrate that <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant expression in human T cells mediates at least a partial loss of function phenotype that mirrors findings derived from mouse models. This data, however, does not explain the marked differences in T cell responses described in mouse models vs. natural carriers of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant. Natural carriers of the risk variant exhibit hyporesponsive T cells, with reduced TCR induced activation, and reduced cytokine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vang et al., 2005</xref>). In previous work, we showed that loss of function in another key negative regularity pathway in T cells leads to overexpression of functionally related proteins to maintain homeostasis. For example, KO of the IL-2 regulatory gene, <italic>PTPN2,</italic> in primary human T cells results in a transient increase in IL-2 signaling, but expansion of PTPN2 KO cells in high cytokine media leads to reduced IL-2 responses due to overexpression of the regulatory protein SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Similar compensatory events may be operable in T cells in carriers of the <italic>PTPN22</italic> risk variant, where reduced proximal negative regulatory events might lead to expression of alternative regulatory proteins. Recent work using optogenically controlled TCR signaling has shown that T cell activation is dynamic, requiring optimal frequencies of TCR engagement relative to cessation of signal to mediate CD69 expression and subsequent activation; however, events that limit T cell responses may be more static, with expression of TIM3, for example, increasing regardless of signaling frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O’Donoghue et al., 2021</xref>). As loss of PTPN22 function specifically augments low-avidity TCR signaling, it is possible that tonic TCR signaling is also impacted and may drive additional events that function to limit TCR signals in carriers of the risk variant over time. Finally, it is important to highlight the environmental differences between murine models and primary human T cell donors. As opportunity for exposure to antigen increases, this may drive T cells from human carriers toward a reduced responsiveness to TCR engagement via impacts that are not operative in SPF murine models.</p><p>In summary, the data presented within this study supports a model where the <italic>PTPN22</italic> R620W risk variant impacts human T cell function via a reduction in negative regulation of TCR signaling; findings similar to murine models, but in contrast to the T cell signaling phenotype in carriers with the risk variant. In association with previous human studies, our findings suggest that the impact of the risk variant on T cell function is likely dynamic, leading to the generation of populations of hyperresponsive T cells, but also allowing for secondary impacts on T cell gene expression that may lead to hyporesponsive T cells over time or after environmental exposures. This would help explain how <italic>PTPN22</italic> could influence risk of diverse autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, diseases with distinct ages of onset and tissue targets. Taken together, these observations suggest that <italic>PTPN22</italic> contributes to autoimmunity by establishing temporal windows of risk for specific diseases that coincide with periods of altered T cell responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary T cell isolation and culturing</title><p>PBMCs were collected from whole (peripheral or cord) blood of consenting donors and cryopreserved.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Cope (Reviewer #1); Andrew C. Chan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two issues need to be addressed. First, some additional assessment of intracellular signaling parameters to distinguish between total or hypomorphic LOF. Second, as Reviewers 1 and 3 note, ligand titration of the high-affinity TCR is needed to better support the lack of phenotype for PTPN22 loss for high-afifnity interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This reviewer commends the authors on the near Hereculean efforts undertaken to generate the range of genetically modified cord blood T cells for study.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>It might be worth mentioning the specificity of the TCRs in the abstract just to give the story context. It took this reviewer a while to find this info, buried in methods. The Results section reads a bit like a discussion or even review paper, focused on the nuances of gene editing. This reviewer would suggest keeping the narrative of the results focused on describing the experimental findings, and confining technological limitations and challenges to the discussion. This is a somewhat stylistic issue, but would make for a better read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this conclusion is well funded based on the experiments shown, with only a few issues or questions (see below).</p><p>1) In the figures the different symbols represents different donors, which is clearly marked. However, the data in all experiments are from different experiments, it would be helpful if it could be marked also which symbols belong to which experiment (maybe using different colors) to get a grip on the interexperimental variation ( I understood the values are not normalized?).</p><p>2) The reference list is dominated by reviews. It is important to refer to original publications not only because it is more fair but also to prevent false statements going into circuits. Pls take away most, or preferably all, of these references and replace with original when needed.</p><p>3) In the discussion regarding different outcomes in mouse versus human it is pointed out that the mouse is in SPF conditions and are genetically more homogenous. This is true but there are likely even more important issues regarding experimental settings. Just to mention taking out T cells from their normal biological context, put them in an incubator with atmospheric oxygen pressure represent a shock and dramatically changes the context. This is of particular importance for PTPs, including PTPN22, which are profoundly redox regulated. There are numerous differences and usually the most important differences are the experimental settings and I think it should be pointed out and discussed in a better way. For future studies, the mouse is absolutely needed, for example, the lymphocyte selection, both T and B, needs to be addressed and I guess experimental mice are critically needed to solve this. Thus, the main conclusion from this paper is that it provides good arguments to improve the animal models to solve the functional genetics of PTPN22 (and most likely other SNPs).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work employs an experimental system that minimizes human donor heterogeneity and developmental skewing. The authors demonstrate that PTPN22 plays an inhibitory role on TCR regulated effector functions in low, but not high, avidity TCR interactions. The work builds on a report by Salmond et al. (Nature Immunology, 15:875, 2014) using the murine OT-I TCR system that PTPN22 restrains TCR signaling induced by lower affinity agonists (T4 or G4 peptides) than the higher affinity N4 agonist. In the present work, the authors demonstrate further in human T cells that PTPN22 KO or SNP edited cells demonstrate similar enhanced TCR-mediated functions when compared to PTPN22 wildtype T cells. The authors should consider the following:</p><p>1. As the highest peptide dose was utilized in the signaling studies in Figures 4-6 since this dose produced efficient proliferation, the authors should consider performing a dose-titration with the H-TCR studies to fully support their conclusion that there are no differences in H-TCR signaling in the presence or absence of PTPN22.</p><p>2. Page 19, line 439- the level of TCR expression in the transduced cells should be shown.</p><p>3. The conclusions of the Salmond et al. study mentioned above describing differences in low vs high affinity agonists should be provided greater description as background.</p><p>4. The authors should also discuss how their conclusions compare with the recent study of Perry et al. (Journal of Immunology, 207:849, 2021) where using an overexpression system, they conclude that the PTPN22(620W) SNP is hypomorphic in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rather than a full loss-of-function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81577.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two issues need to be addressed.

Below we discuss our attempts to assess intracellular signaling in T cells with total or hypomorphic loss of PTPN22 function.</p><p>We agree that differences in intracellular signaling events between <italic>PTPN22</italic> WT and <italic>PTPN22</italic> LOF cells using our TCR/antigen specific model would be useful and informative. However, use of antigen presenting cells for peptide stimulation demonstrated a delayed and muted phosphorylation response in comparison with antibody-based activation (likely due to differences in TCR/ MCH binding kinetics relative to that of anti-CD3, with or without anti-CD28 antibodies).</p><p>We have tried to investigate the pathways suggested by the reviewers (pErk and pAKT) with limited success. Importantly, we argue that the key finding in our study reflects the critical role for PTPN22 in low avidity (or perhaps low antigen density) TCR signaling in naïve T cells. Thus, we focused on signaling assays using peptide loaded APCs as a stimulant. We first attempted to find ideal timepoints in stimulation that would accentuate any differences in the kinetics of these pathways between <italic>PTPN22</italic> edited cells.</p><p>Early time course testing using CD3/CD28 beads on gene edited /TCR+ T cells suggested that optimal timing for measuring differences in pErk occurred between 15-30 minutes post activation when using CD3/28 crosslinking.

However, repeating these experiments over a 6 hr time course, addition of peptide to the APCs did not lead to increased pErk relative to cells stimulated with APCs alone. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>. Consistent with failure to observe pERK activation, similar inconclusive data was generated using pAKT and total pTyr intracellular staining (not shown).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81577-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We next assessed a longer stimulation timeline (24 hrs). In that setting, we observed increased pErk in response to peptide stimulation in T cells expressing the H-TCR, but not with L-TCR transduced cells. However, in keeping with our findings described in the manuscript, we observed no differences between H-TCR stimulated cells, with respect to PTPN22 status. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81577-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As use of peptide loaded APCs limited our ability to assess proximal signaling in our model, we next elected to investigate the impact of the PTPN22 on pS6 and p4-EBP1. At a 24-hour timepoint, we observed a modest increase in pS6 in PTPN22 KO cells transduced with L-TCR relative to PTPN22 WT cells and a similar trend in p4-EBP1. Incorporating PTPN22 non-risk and PTPN22 risk edited cells in these assays produced responses similar to activation marker data shown in Figure 2 in our study. However, these data did not reach statistical significance for the risk variant allele. Based on the Reviewer and Editor’s comments, we have added these pS6 and p4ebp1 data to the revised manuscript as Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.Finally, as we have been unable to adequately assess differences in early intracellular signaling pathways, we agree that this represents a weakness of this model. We have revised the Discussion section to point out this limitation of our work (Lines: 440-444).</p><p>(2.) Response to the comment that additional ligand titration of the high-affinity TCR is needed to better support the lack of phenotype for PTPN22 loss in high-affinity interactions.</p><p>We appreciate the request to include more data to show a lack of phenotype between PTPN22 WT and KO in H-TCR stimulated cells across a range of peptide concentrations. We previously generated these data to convince ourselves that the PTPN22 LOF phenotype was only evident under L-TCR stimulation and did not just represent a missing optimized condition for assessing H-TCR stimulation. See Figure 3 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><p>We had chosen to streamline the figure in the initial manuscript for ease of communication. However, we agree that this data is informative in verifying our conclusions, and we have now included it in the final manuscript. We used “XY” graph to replace the previous plot in Figure 3C and relabeled the new plot figure 3D and we have included the t tests of the area under the curve (AUC) in new Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><p>Of note, we utilized AUC in lieu of ANOVA to analyze differences between peptide dose titrations as we found it to be the better test for communicating our findings. Using ANOVA to analyze this data, we observed significant increases in proliferation for PTPN22 KO cells using L-TCR at the 2 highest peptide doses while an ANOVA test for the H-TCR titrations failed to identify difference at any peptide dose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This reviewer commends the authors on the near Hereculean efforts undertaken to generate the range of genetically modified cord blood T cells. for study.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>It might be worth mentioning the specificity of the TCRs in the abstract just to give the story context.

The antigen specificity of the TCRs utilized in our study is now included in the abstract (Lines: 32-33), methods (Lines: 561-564), and results (Lines: 266-267) to provide the requested context.</p><p>Also, we have tried to revise the Results section to limit our technical discussion. However, as this remains a highly technical paper, we want to assure that the steps taken are clear to diverse audiences who may find this paper relevant and that hope to design related studies in other cell models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this conclusion is well funded based on the experiments shown, with only a few issues or questions (see below).</p><p>1) In the figures the different symbols represents different donors, which is clearly marked.

Summary flow data is presented as either raw MFI or percent positivity. This approach was used based upon input from coauthors expressing a desire for the data to be presented in as unmanipulated a fashion as possible. If there are key data that the Reviewer feels should be shown in a normalized format, we would be happy to provide that. It should be noted, however, that for all figures if a donor is used, then all gene edited versions of that donor’s cells are also used in the same assay (Example: Figure 2 was generated in 2 experiments, with 2 donors per experiment. For each donor in an experiment, we used all 4 genotypes, PTPN22 wt, non-risk, risk, and KO). This approach was used to control for potential batch effects. The only instance where this is not the case is the cytokine secretion data in the updated figure 5, where we added to previous data with new datapoints and increased genotypes studies to address reviewer requests.</p><p>Regarding reformatting figures: As this work was primarily done with cord blood derived samples, which provide variable and limited cell numbers, the use of multiple donors was required. After editing and lentiviral transduction, cells were frozen and banked and some used for multiple experiments, but we had insufficient cell numbers to use the same donors for all experiments. Over the course of the study, we used &gt;10 cord donors. Unfortunately, we do not believe there is a satisfying and clear way to symbolize all different T cell donors simultaneously if that is the desired request. Such labeling would generate a large variety of colors and symbols and complicate what we believe to be an already complex study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reference list is dominated by reviews.

The cellular responses to DNA breaks is complex; with primary data including hundreds of publications spanning decades, and beyond the scope of this study. These reviews were used to help to provide context on how ssODNs integrate into the DNA of primary cells post Crispr cleavage.</p></list-item></list><p>All other reviews have been replaced with references to the primary research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the discussion regarding different outcomes in mouse versus human it is pointed out that the mouse is in SPF conditions and are genetically more homogenous.

Yes, the experimental settings for such studies are sub-optimal for PTP function, but such work has none-the-less spurred questioning the propriety of mouse models to study this pathway.</p><p>We believe mouse models represent a critical system for studying PTPN22 and show here that in an ex-vivo human model (using genetically homogenous/ environmentally naive primary T cells), a similar phenotype is generated (implying that previous work may be confounded by various factors including environmental, genetic and/or experimental design, that deserve consideration).</p><p>We hope our changes have satisfied this point, but if we missed the mark or more elaboration is needed, we are open to revising this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work employs an experimental system that minimizes human donor heterogeneity and developmental skewing.

Page 19, line 439- the level of TCR expression in the transduced cells should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the manuscript we utilized an MOI of 5 for gene transfer using TCR expression lentiviral vectors. This approach was used to achieve transduction while limiting the viral copy number per cell allowing for consistent levels of TCR expression. To complete our work, we utilized a series of viral preparations generated within our laboratory and series of human donors. This resulted in a range of transduction rates for both the L-TCR and H-TCR cultures. As an example, the left bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> show the range of transduction for L-TCR (~5-25%) across 5 human donors based upon expression of the cis-linked GFP marker. Similar results were obtained for the H-TCR. Importantly, lentiviral transduction was performed prior to gene editing; and, as predicted, we observed nearly identical levels of GFP expression and GFP MFI (right bar graphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>) across each editing condition for each donor (each symbol indicates an independent donor). Thus, there is very little variance across different PTPN22 edited cell populations transduced with L-TCR after in vitro expansion and prior to experimental use.</p><p>We have revised the description of our LV transduction methods in our methods/results. However, we elected not to add this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>) to our manuscript as we felt that it might be distracting to the information flow. In the results, we updated the text to state: “LV transduction was performed at an MOI of 5 to transduce less than 25% of the culture, with an average of 5 to 15% marking (depending on donor, TCR sequence, and lentiviral lot) designed to ensure low viral copy numbers per transduced cell to achieve similar levels of TCR expression in all transduced cells.” (Lines: 279-283). If Editors or Reviewer prefer, we could add <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> to our supplemental materials.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81577-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>If more or different data is requested, we will be happy to provide that to the best of our abilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The authors should also discuss how their conclusions compare with the recent study of Perry et al.
