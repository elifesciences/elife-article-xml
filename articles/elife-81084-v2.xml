Single zeitgebers entrain circadian rhythms, but few studies have addressed how multiple, simultaneous zeitgeber cycles interact to affect clock behavior. Misalignment between zeitgebers (‘sensory conflict’) can disrupt circadian rhythms, or alternatively clocks may privilege information from one zeitgeber over another. Here, we show that temperature cycles modulate circadian locomotor rhythms in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, a model system for cnidarian circadian biology. We conduct behavioral experiments across a comprehensive range of light and temperature cycles and find that <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s circadian behavior is disrupted by chronic misalignment between light and temperature, which involves disruption of the endogenous clock itself rather than a simple masking effect. Sensory conflict also disrupts the rhythmic transcriptome, with numerous genes losing rhythmic expression. However, many metabolic genes remained rhythmic and in-phase with temperature, and other genes even gained rhythmicity, implying that some rhythmic metabolic processes persist even when behavior is disrupted. Our results show that a cnidarian clock relies on information from light and temperature, rather than prioritizing one signal over the other. Although we identify limits to the clock’s ability to integrate conflicting sensory information, there is also a surprising robustness of behavioral and transcriptional rhythmicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Almost all living things exhibit circadian rhythms – internally driven biological processes – which regulate important bodily functions, including sleep and wake cycles, over a roughly 24-hour period. Circadian clocks govern these rhythms by receiving information from the environment that allows them to tell what time of day it is. Two of the most important environmental signals, known as ‘zeitgebers’ – meaning ‘time giver’ – are light and temperature.</p><p>In nature, circadian clocks must integrate information from multiple zeitgebers simultaneously. Typically, over a 24-hour period, temperature increases and decreases with the light cycle, getting warmer during the day and colder at night. However, artificial light pollution and circadian disruption – such as shift work – can impact the natural relationship between light and temperature. This ‘sensory conflict’, where two zeitgebers provide conflicting information about the time of day, can impact ecosystems such as coral reefs; and is also linked to poor health in humans. How circadian clocks behave in complex multi-zeitgeber environments and specifically, whether they prioritize one zeitgeber over another is not fully understood.</p><p>To investigate how cnidarians – a group of marine animals including corals and jellyfish – respond to sensory conflict, Berger and Tarrant varied the relationship between light and temperature cycles using the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> as a model system. <italic>Nematostella</italic> is a nocturnal cnidarian, meaning it moves most at night. First, Berger and Tarrant kept <italic>Nematostella</italic> in dark conditions with 24-hour temperature cycles – starting cold, increasing to a peak in the middle of the day before decreasing towards the end of the day. Monitoring <italic>Nematostella</italic> movement revealed that they moved most during the cold phase, showing that temperature cycles alone can maintain rhythmic behavior. Similarly, when temperature and light cycles were aligned such that both rose and fell together, nocturnal behavior was preserved. However, when large misalignments between light and temperature cycles were introduced – such that temperature decreased during light periods and increased in the dark – nocturnal behavior was almost completely lost. This suggests that both light and temperature interact to produce complex patterns of circadian behavior, with neither signal being prioritized over the other.</p><p>Additionally, Berger and Tarrant investigated how sensory conflict impacts the activity of <italic>Nematostella</italic> genes. While many genes remained rhythmic, suggesting some gene expression persists when behavior is disturbed, others that were rhythmic became arrhythmic. In contrast, a selection of genes that do not normally display rhythmic behavior gained rhythmic expression. Genes related to protein metabolism and other energy-intensive processes were particularly disrupted.</p><p>In an increasingly 24/7 society, it is important to understand how complex multi-sensory environments impact circadian rhythms and as a result, health and fitness. The findings show that certain light and temperature regimes severely disrupt <italic>Nematostella</italic> behavior and could be useful in predicting how other organisms might respond to disruptions such as light pollution. In the future, such information could be used to design optimal light regimes for ecosystems in which the relationship between light cycles and other environmental signals is disrupted by human behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic></kwd><kwd>cnidarian</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>zeitgeber</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005991</institution-id><institution>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ocean Ventures Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Cory A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Misalignment between light and temperature cycles leads to disrupted circadian behavior and a substantially altered rhythmic transcriptome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly all organisms use circadian clocks to synchronize their behavior, physiology, and metabolism to ∼24 hr environmental cycles. Factors that synchronize circadian clocks are called zeitgebers, and can include light, temperature, and food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aschoff, 1960</xref>). In nature, clocks must integrate information from many zeitgebers simultaneously to infer coherent clock outputs, although most of our knowledge of circadian clocks comes from single-zeitgeber experiments. During ‘sensory conflict’, when zeitgebers give conflicting information to the clock, circadian rhythms can either be disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2016</xref>) or preferentially follow a single zeitgeber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harper et al., 2017</xref>). By defining conditions under which normal clock output is possible or disrupted, studies of sensory conflict help us understand how environmental information is transmitted into rhythmic behavior, which is a central goal of circadian biology (reviewed for insects in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rivas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Somers et al., 2018</xref>). The behavior of clocks under conflicting zeitgeber regimes is particularly relevant to human society, where factors such as shift work and artificial light regimes are connected to a wide range of metabolic and neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehlers et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2016</xref>), and in the context of artificial light pollution impacting natural ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaston et al., 2013</xref>). However, few studies in any animal have comprehensively characterized clock function in multi-zeitgeber systems, and in general we do not understand how animals behave during sensory conflict.</p><p>We use the phrase ‘sensory conflict’ to refer to a situation in which two environmental signals provide different phase information, as compared to a control in which both signals are aligned in phase. In this narrow sense, there is a small literature of sensory conflict experiments that have examined conflicting light and temperature cycles in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyasako et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Watari and Tanaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nikhil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rivas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaniewska et al., 2020</xref>), vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Firth and Kennaway, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Valenciano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Firth et al., 1999</xref>), protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce, 1960</xref>), and cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). There have also been studies of light and time-restricted feeding in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sánchez-Vázquez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Challet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reierth and Stokkan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lague and Reebs, 2000</xref>). However, many of these studies did not compare more than two possible phase relationships between zeitgebers, precluding characterization of the potentially non-linear relationship between an entrained rhythm and two entraining cues. There is a larger literature concerning interactions of other entraining factors such as tidal and lunar rhythms (e.g. in marine invertebrates, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connor and Gracey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wuitchik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertolini et al., 2021</xref>), and it is clear that rhythmic cues often interact to produce complex patterns of behavior and gene expression. There is a need for experiments to comprehensively assess phase relationships between zeitgebers to understand the sensitivity of clock outputs to environmental conditions.</p><p>Another critical knowledge gap is how sensory conflict affects rhythmic gene expression, which ultimately underlies rhythmic physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yeung and Naef, 2018</xref>). Animal clocks function via transcription-translation feedback loops in which transcription factors activate the expression of their own repressors, and also regulate transcription of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Partch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>). Although one study measured the expression of individual clock genes during sensory conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rivas et al., 2018</xref>), the effects on downstream gene expression are unknown. In general, interactions between rhythmic factors can produce wide variation in gene expression and impact a variety of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connor and Gracey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wuitchik et al., 2019</xref>). Animals exposed to arrhythmic conditions, such as mice in feeding experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenwell et al., 2019</xref>) or cavefish over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mack et al., 2021</xref>), often simply express fewer rhythmic transcripts. Transcriptome-scale studies are needed to test whether sensory conflict similarly disrupts expression of core clock genes or of downstream clock-controlled genes, resulting in a general loss of rhythmic gene expression.</p><p>We address these questions with the model system <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, the starlet sea anemone. Studies of circadian rhythms in Cnidaria, the sister group to Bilateria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simion et al., 2017</xref>), are broadly important for understanding how clocks have evolved and diversified in animals. Specifically, cnidarians provide an intriguing system for circadian sensory processing because they lack a central nervous system. In bilaterians, researchers often distinguish central clocks in the brain and peripheral clocks in other tissues, with the central clock acting to synchronize peripheral clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>). Certain phase relationships between light and temperature cycles disrupt the central clock in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2016</xref>), but not peripheral clocks, which preferentially entrain to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harper et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, sensory conflict might disrupt organism-level behavior because of the differential entrainment of central and peripheral clocks. Cnidarians lack this distinction and therefore provide an important and complementary framework to bilaterian models for studying sensory conflict. <italic>Nematostella</italic> exhibits nocturnal rhythms in locomotion that entrain to artificial light-dark cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref>) and to natural environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarrant et al., 2019</xref>). This species inhabits shallow salt marshes at temperate latitudes and can experience daily temperature swings of more than 20 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarrant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sachkova et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that temperature may be a relevant entraining cue. Although temperature cycles are a nearly-universal zeitgeber (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Somers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lahiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hart et al., 2021</xref>), no studies have yet investigated thermal entrainment in a non-bilaterian animal.</p><p>Here, we show that environmentally realistic temperature cycles drive rhythmic behavior and affect the circadian clock in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, producing activity profiles similar to light-driven rhythms. We then comprehensively test different combinations of light and temperature cycles and show that aligned cycles drive normal rhythmic behavior, while behavior becomes arrhythmic under large degrees of misalignment. In particular, we demonstrate the disruption of free-running rhythms, indicating changes to the endogenous clock itself. Using RNA sequencing, we find that sensory conflict substantially alters diel gene expression patterns. This includes both the loss and gain of rhythmic genes, the disruption of co-expressed gene modules related to cellular metabolism, and an overall weakening of correlations between rhythmic genes. However, much of the transcriptome remained rhythmic and in-phase with the temperature cycle. This study extends our understanding of temperature entrainment and integration of multiple environmental signals to a non-bilaterian model animal, showing that light and temperature interact to synchronize clock outputs, with neither cue totally dominating the other. Thus, normal organismal rhythms are only possible under certain environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temperature cycles drive circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic></title><p>We first showed that gradual, environmentally-relevant temperature cycles drive rhythmic locomotor behavior and influence circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic>.

In published studies in other taxa, organisms entrained to zeitgeber periods half the length of their endogenous period often display two behavioral components, one with a 12 hr period corresponding to a directly driven component and one with a circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merrow et al., 1999</xref>). The circadian component can only be observed if the short period synchronizes an endogenous circadian pacemaker. Therefore, we used periodograms to assess the relative contributions of 12 hr and 24 hr components to the behavior of <italic>Nematostella</italic> in short-period cycles. To validate this approach, we first demonstrated that 24 hr behavior occurs during 6:6 light cycles (LD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). During 6:6 LD, we found that 8/12 animals had a significant circadian component (LSP, p&lt;0.01) and 6/12 had a circatidal component (4 had both), suggesting that 6:6 LD cycles can entrain circadian behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We noticed that although most animals had circadian behavior, their activity did not line up within 12 hr windows and thus the mean time series did not have a 24 hr component. In other words, because the 6:6 LD cycles are identical, the animals did not all perceive the same 12 hr window as ‘day’ or ‘night’. We therefore aligned all animals by dividing them into two groups based on the 12 hr window in which they had the highest activity. After shifting one group by 12 hr, the new mean time series had a strongly circadian component (LSP, p&lt;0.01). We conclude that 6:6 LD cycles entrain circadian behavior in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, which is expected because light is a strong zeitgeber. We then repeated the experiment using temperature cycles with a 12 hr period (17–23 °C, 1 degree per hour; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We found that 10/23 animals had a circadian component and 6/23 had a circatidal component. Once again, after aligning animals within 12 hr windows, the mean behavior profile had a clear 24 hr period and only a weak 12 hr component, suggesting that short-period temperature cycles synchronize circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><p>We used qRT-PCR to measure the expression of several core circadian genes (<italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Cry1a</italic>, <italic>Cry1b</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>, and <italic>Helt</italic>) over 48 hr of the 8–32 °C temperature cycle, and also during free-run.

Anemones were transferred from aligned cycles to one of 6 offset regimes (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hr offsets) and acclimated for at least two weeks. Within each zeitgeber regime, we recorded the behavior of separate groups of animals during entrainment and free-running conditions, resulting in a total of 14 experimental groups including aligned conditions. In these experiments, ZT0 always refers to lights-on. We use the following notation to refer to experimental groups: Off6-cycle refers to a 6 hr offset between zeitgebers, recorded during the cycles; Off6-FR refers to behavior recorded during free-run. We quantified the strength of rhythmicity using several metrics: the maximum power of Lomb-Scargle periodograms; the amplitude of mean time series; the number of individuals with significant 24 hr rhythms above a strict cutoff (eJTK p&lt;0.001); the relative synchronization (circular variance) of the phases of rhythmic individuals; and the difference in activity between light and dark phases.</p><p>Large degrees of misalignment profoundly disrupted rhythmic behavior. During the largest possible misalignment (Off12-cycle) the normal activity pattern was visibly disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and 24 hr rhythmicity was only weakly detectable in the mean behavior profile (eJTK, p=4.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The power and amplitude of the mean time series were lower than Aligned-cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; Dunn test, p&lt;0.05; CircaCompare, p&lt;0.05), and the difference in activity between dark and light phases was also severely reduced in terms of both time active (linear mixed effects model; LMM, p=1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) and distance moved (LMM, p=2 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Although 13/36 individuals (36%) were rhythmic (eJTK, p&lt;0.001), their phases could not be distinguished from a circular uniform distribution (Rayleigh test, p=0.8), indicating desynchronization. Behavioral rhythms were also visibly disrupted and quantitatively weaker in Off10-cycle compared in Aligned-cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), including reduced power (Dunn test, p&lt;0.05), amplitude (CircaCompare, p&lt;0.05), and dark:light activity ratio (LMM p=0.013). The phase of the mean time series in Off10-cycle was also advanced by 1.5 hr (CircaCompare, p=5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The reduced dark-light activity ratios during Off10-cycle and Off12-cycle were specifically due to increased activity during lights-on (LMM, p&lt;0.05), with no difference in activity during lights-off (LMM, p&gt;0.1).</p><p>Weakened locotomor rhythms in Off10-cycle and Off12-cycle were caused both by a weakening of the rhythms of individual animals, and a lack of synchronization between the remaining rhythmic individuals. The percentage of rhythmic individuals declined monotonically with increasing misalignment, from 83% in Aligned-cycle to 36% in Off12-cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and the LSP powers of animals in Off10-cycle and Off12-cycle were lower than during Aligned-cycle (Dunn test, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, under severe sensory conflict (SC), individual <italic>Nematostella</italic> were less likely to exhibit rhythmic behavior, and less likely for that behavior to synchronize with other individuals.</p><p>Anemones exhibited robust diel behavior under smaller degrees of misalignment (0–8 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The Off2-cycle, Off4-cycle, and Off8-cycle groups exhibited rhythms similar to those in Aligned-cycle, with no significant phase shifts or reductions in rhythm strength. The Off6-cycle group also showed 24 hr rhythms, but the mean phase of rhythmic individuals was delayed by 3.6 hr relative to Aligned-cycle (Watson test, p=0.0046); the mean behavior profile was also delayed (CircaCompare, p=4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). The dark:light activity ratio was reduced (LMM, p=0.024) in Off6-cycle, and there was a marginally significant circatidal (10–14 hr) component (LSP, p=0.006). We confirmed that <italic>Nematostella</italic> exhibited normal diel behavior under a broad range of zeitgeber regimes using clustering analysis. We quantified distances between the 14 mean time series based on their spectral properties using wavelet transformation followed by principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering (see Materials and methods). The Aligned-cycle, Off2-cycle, Off4-cycle, Off6-cycle, and Off8-cycle groups formed a single cluster with high support based on the approximately unbiased (AU) test, corresponding to normal rhythmic behavior, whereas Off10-cycle and Off12-cycle fell into different clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s diel behavior was therefore robust up to an 8 hr misalignment between light and temperature, although there was a detectable phase delay specifically in Off6-cycle.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Clustering analysis of mean behavior profiles based on wavelet transformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis of wavelet transformation distance matrix.

Mean behavior in Off12-FR was rhythmic (eJTK, p=7 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), but the power and amplitude of the mean time series were reduced compared to Aligned-FR (Dunn test, p&lt;0.05; CircaCompare, p&lt;0.05), there were fewer rhythmic individuals, and the variance of the phases of rhythmic individuals was larger (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the clustering analysis, Aligned-FR, Off2-FR, and Off8-FR formed one cluster with moderate AU support, while Off4-FR, Off10-FR, and Off12-FR formed a cluster that also included Off10-cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The final cluster was strongly supported and consisted of Off6-FR and Off12-cycle, two groups with severely disrupted rhythms.</p><p>Behavioral patterns during free-running differed from patterns during entrainment conditions. In fact, Off12-FR was more strongly rhythmic than Off12-cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, antiphasic zeitgeber cycles weakened, but did not abolish, endogenous circadian rhythms, and behavior was further disrupted during entrainment conditions. Conversely, while endogenous rhythms were severely disrupted during Off6-FR, light and temperature cycles were able to drive rhythmic behavior during Off6-cycle (albeit with quantitative differences from Aligned-cycle). Additionally, disruptions of free-running rhythms did not increase linearly with the degree of offset. Behavior in Off6-FR was arrhythmic, but Off4-FR and Off8-FR exhibited clear rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Disruption of free-running behavior was due primarily to a lack of synchronization among rhythmic animals, rather than weakened rhythms of individual animals. Only Aligned-FR had a significant non-uniform phase distribution (Rayleigh test, p&lt;0.05). Mean powers of behavioral rhythms did not differ across free-running groups (Dunn test, p&gt;0.05), nor was there a clear trend in the number of rhythmic individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Phases of free-running rhythms differed in some groups, but not according to an obvious pattern. The phase of Off2-FR was advanced by 1.8 hr relative to Aligned-FR, Off8-FR was advanced by 4.4 hr, and Off12-FR was advanced by 4.3 hr (CircaCompare, p&lt;7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). Period length was not affected by SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Relative strengths of light and temperature cycles</title><p>To gain insight into the relative influence of light and temperature on behavioral rhythms, we compared the phases of rhythmic individuals against the offset between light and temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In isolation, temperature and light each drive rhythms that peak at roughly ZT18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref>), which we plot as the black and grey lines in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), respectively. If the phase of a rhythm were determined entirely by light, it would be close to the black line; if determined by temperature, it would be close to the grey lines. The phases of Off4-cycle and Off8-cycle groups were significantly closer to the light-entrained (black) line (paired Wilcoxon rank tests, p&lt;0.05). All other groups were approximately equidistant between zeitgebers, including every free-running group. This illustrates that light exerts strong direct control on behavior, although light and temperature interact to set the phase of circadian behavior. When cycles were close in phase (Aligned and Off2), they acted together the set the phase of locomotor rhythms, while at larger offsets phases were either determined primarily by the light cycle, or were intermediate between light and temperature. On the other hand, we found no evidence that the phases of free-running rhythms were primarily determined by either light or temperature, with the caveat that this test had less power for free-running groups due to the numbers of rhythmic animals. Thus, although light has strong direct effects on behavior, temperature also influences the phase of entrained rhythms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sensory conflict alters transcriptome-wide patterns of rhythmic gene expression</title><p>We used 3’ tag-based RNA sequencing (Tag-seq) to characterize the effects of SC on gene expression.

The correlation of log-fold changes of the 277 shared genes was negative (Pearson’s r=-0.59), meaning that genes upregulated in the light under Aligned conditions were generally downregulated in light under SC, and vice versa. Consequently, only 25 genes were DE between light and dark samples when averaged across both time series, and 1747 genes differed in their response to light across conditions. Using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), we confirmed that genes distinguishing light and dark samples under Aligned conditions failed to do so during SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). When light and dark SC samples were plotted on the discrimnant axis that maximized the variance between light and dark Aligned samples, the light SC animals were closer to the dark Aligned animals, showing that the diel expression of many genes was reversed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sensory conflict alters patterns of rhythmic gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) demonstrates shifts in diel gene expression under SC.

However, light-responsive genes notably included three putative circadian transcription factors (<italic>PAR-bZIP-a</italic>, <italic>PAR-bZIP-c</italic>, and <italic>Helt</italic>). Temperature-responsive genes were enriched for gene ontology (GO) terms related to transcription factor binding and oxidoreductase activity; genes with a significant condition:light interaction were also enriched for terms related to transcription factor activity. This suggests that the temperature cycle had widespread effects on transcription during light-dark cycles and modulated the expression of transcription factors. The mean expression level of 90 genes significantly differed between Aligned and SC time series. These genes were not enriched for any GO terms, but included one of the aforementioned PAR-bZIP proteins and a cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP) previously implicated in circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref>), along with two other CYPs and a SOX-family transcription factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Many genes (1898) displayed a linear change in expression with time, presumably because animals were not fed during the experiment.

To define condition-specific rhythmic genes, we excluded genes that were marginally significant in the other condition (p&lt;0.1); by this metric, 1225 genes lost rhythmicity during SC (Align-specific) and 921 gained rhythmicity (SC-specific). The promoters of shared rhythmic genes were enriched for bZIP transcription factor binding sites (p=1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), while the promoters of Align-specific and SC-specific rhythmic genes were not enriched for any motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>To understand how functional categories of rhythmic genes were affected by SC, we used a sliding window approach for functional enrichment of rhythmic genes (see Materials and methods). This revealed dramatic changes to the expression of genes that mediate macromolecule, protein, and RNA metabolism during SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Most terms that were enriched among aligned rhythmic genes were not enriched at any time during SC, and only a single GO or KEGG term, ‘Spliceosome’, was enriched at the same time of day in both groups. Under aligned conditions, terms related to macromolecule and protein metabolism were enriched in early morning (ZT0-3) and lost enrichment under SC, while ‘RNA transport’ and ‘ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis’ were enriched in early night (ZT13-14) and lost rhythmicity under SC. Other terms shifted from day to night during SC, including ‘transcription factor activity’, ‘vacuolar transport’, ‘hydrolase activity’, ‘autophagy’, ‘mitophagy’, ‘ABC transporters’, and ‘mRNA surveillance pathway’; ‘protein processing in ER’ shifted from ZT10 to ZT4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4">Figure 5—source data 4</xref>).

Genes with phases during the two peaks (ZT0-6 and ZT12-18) were less likely to lose rhythmicity during SC (38% lost rhythmicity compared to 53% of other genes; chi-squared test, p&lt;2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>), suggesting that rhythmic gene expression during these windows was somehow more robust. The phase distribution under SC was also bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), although the two distributions were not identical (Rao’s test for circular homogeneity, p=0.046).

Four of these modules peaked in expression in the light phase during aligned conditions and shifted to dark-phase expression during SC. These modules were enriched for terms related to autophagy and endocytosis (Turquoise); transcription factor activity (Brown); ATP hydrolysis and ABC transporter activity (Tan); and serine-type endopeptidas activity (Salmon).

Modules that lost rhythmicity during SC were enriched for terms related to RNA metabolism, protein transport, and regulation of gene expression (Green); and sphingolipid metabolism (Pink).

However, <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s behavior became severely disrupted and arrhythmic on average when light and temperature cycles were offset by 10–12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Free-running rhythms were also disrupted, depending on the specific phase relationship. This shows that both light and temperature interact to set the phase of <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s clock, and that neither cue dominates the other. As a consequence, normal rhythmic behavior is only possible under certain relationships between environmental signals. The disruptive effects of sensory conflict (SC) were not acute responses to transient conditions, but chronic changes measured after weeks of exposure and acclimation.</p><p>Gene expression rhythms were also dramatically altered by SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Surprisingly, few genes remained in-phase with the light cycle across different temperature cycles, whereas several hundred genes followed the temperature cycle regardless of light. Rather than simply reducing the number of rhythmic transcripts, SC caused turnover in the identities of rhythmic genes and altered the relative timing of expression between them. This resulted in widespread perturbation of the temporal expression of metabolic processes and an overall weakening of rhythmic co-expression patterns. Nonetheless, many genes were robustly rhythmic during SC, and other genes even gained rhythmic expression. These patterns differed between functional categories. For instance, genes related to autophagy and endocytosis shifted in phase following the temperature cycle, while genes related to ribosome and protein metabolism lost rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Simultaneous light and temperature cycles produce complex behavior</title><p>Rhythmic behavior is the net result of endogenous and exogenous signals, leading to potentially complex behavioral outcomes. Direct effects of environmental cues can mask endogenous rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aschoff, 1960</xref>), and, conversely, circadian rhythms can constrain or ‘gate’ acute environmental responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Salter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fowler et al., 2005</xref>). During simultaneous light and temperature cycles, we found that behavior was increasingly disrupted up to the largest degrees of misalignment (10 hr and 12 hr offsets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). However, behavioral patterns during entrainment conditions did not directly mirror the corresponding free-running behavior, indicating that direct effects of light and temperature interacted with and masked endogenous behavior. Our data illustrate two contrasting scenarios for the relationship between endogenous and exogenous cues. During the 6 hr offset, endogenous rhythms were strongly disrupted, but behavior during entrainment conditions was roughly normal. In this case, light and temperature directly drove rhythmic behavior, although the underlying clock output was arrhythmic. On the other hand, during the 12 hr offset, endogenous rhythms were relatively robust, but behavior during entrainment conditions was arrhythmic. In this case, misaligned light and temperature cycles masked endogenous rhythms.</p><p>Studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> have noted similarly complex patterns of behavior depending on the relationship between light and temperature cycles. Rhythmic locomotor behavior and molecular oscillations in the fly central clock were disrupted at intermediate (5–7 hr) offsets, but the phase of behavior followed either light or temperature at smaller and larger offsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, peripheral clock oscillations appeared to preferentially entrain to light over temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harper et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Nematostella</italic> lacks this central-peripheral distinction. In a sense, <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s circadian behavior was more similar to the central clock outputs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> than to peripheral clock oscillations, because rhythmic behavior was disrupted under certain offsets instead of following a single zeitgeber. We also observed prominent non-linear dynamics in free-running behavior, with phase differences of as little as two hours between light and temperature resulting in completely different behavioral outcomes. Free-running rhythms were most strongly disrupted at the 6 hr and 10 hr offsets, and somewhat weakened at the 12 hr offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). However, rhythms were robust at the 4 hr and 8 hr offsets.</p><p>The underlying reasons for these specific behavior patterns depend on how the circadian clock receives and processes information from light and temperature. The bilaterian central clock is physically located in the brain and consists of multiple neuronal subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, some neurons preferentially entrain to temperature cycles, while other neurons only entrain to light cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyasako et al., 2007</xref>). Recent work has identified additional subsets of neurons that act as thermosensors, and current data support a model in which separate sets of clock neurons receive warm and cold information; these neurons then integrate temperature with additional cues to regulate clock outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alpert et al., 2022</xref>). Although the organization of cnidarian clocks probably fundamentally differs from that of bilaterians due their lack of a central nervous system, it is likely that <italic>Nematostella</italic> has neurons dedicated to specific sensory tasks; other neurons may act as clock neurons and coordinate rhythmic gene expression in other cells. Indeed, single-cell studies show that <italic>Nematostella</italic> has a diverse population of neurons with distinct transcriptional profiles; these neuronal subtypes differ in their expression of clock genes and genes involved in sensory processing, such as cryptochromes and opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Steger et al., 2022</xref>). Whether cnidarian clock neurons receive environmental information directly or from dedicated sensory neurons, and whether there is anything analogous to a ‘central’ clock that coordinates rhythmicity throughout the body via neurotransmitter or hormone signaling, is unknown. Related to this is the question of whether the disruptive effects of SC are due to effects on a single pacemaker clock, or due to the desynchronization of multiple clocks in different tissues. Both scenarios are plausible—dissociation of clock gene expression can occur even within single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmal et al., 2019</xref>), and differential synchronization of spatially distinct clocks might contribute to organism-level disruptions. Cell-level studies are needed to localize neurons with rhythmic gene expression or possible roles in thermal and light sensing, and to determine whether <italic>Nematostella</italic> possess multiple spatially distinct clocks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for the cnidarian molecular clock</title><p>The molecular architecture of circadian clocks is understood in bilaterian model systems, but is largely unknown in Cnidaria. <italic>Nematostella</italic> possesses orthologs of the core circadian transcription factors <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Cycle</italic>, but not of the canonical repressor of CLOCK, <italic>Period</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reitzel and Tarrant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reitzel et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that there are major differences in clock architecture between bilaterians and cnidarians (although some bilaterians also lack <italic>Period</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stanton et al., 2022</xref>). We identified binding motifs enriched in the promoters of rhythmic genes, suggesting that bZIP, and possibly SOX, family transcription factors may regulate circadian gene expression in <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). Proline and acidic amino acid-rich bZIP (PAR-bZIP) and SOX-family proteins regulate circadian clock outputs in bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cyran et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gachon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>Nematostella</italic> PAR-bZIP and SOX genes were robustly rhythmic during aligned and SC conditions in our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Our results also support existing hypotheses about the roles of cryptochrome proteins in the <italic>Nematostella</italic> clock, and raise new questions about the role of the <italic>Clock</italic> gene in this animal.</p><p>Our data support the hypothesis that the cryptochrome protein <italic>Cry2</italic> is involved in the core clock, possibly as a negative regulator of <italic>Clock</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reitzel et al., 2013</xref>), while <italic>Cry1a</italic> and <italic>Cry1b</italic> are photosensors. <italic>Cry2</italic> expression was driven by both light and temperature cycles, while rhythmic expression of <italic>Cry1a</italic> and <italic>Cry1b</italic> appears to be driven only by light cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Other genes suspected to have central roles in the cnidarian clock, including <italic>Helt-like</italic> (<italic>Helt</italic>), <italic>CIPC</italic>, and two PAR-bZIP transcription factors (<italic>PAR-bZIP-a</italic> and <italic>PAR-BZIP-c</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reitzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarrant et al., 2019</xref>), were strongly rhythmic in our study. Misalignment between light and temperature cycles did not disrupt oscillations of these putative clock genes, as (except for <italic>Cry1b</italic>) they were all strongly rhythmic during both aligned and SC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). <italic>CIPC</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>, and <italic>PAR-bZIP-c</italic> advanced in phase by 5–8 hr under SC, while <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Helt</italic>, and <italic>PAR-bZIP-a</italic> remained in-phase with the light cycle. Thus, although temperature was a stronger driver of rhythmic gene expression than light overall, light probably controls rhythmic expression of some core clock components.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA did not oscillate during a temperature cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and was one of only two dozen genes to directly follow the light cycle. Our data, together with evidence that <italic>Clock</italic> expression is induced by blue light and not green light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leach and Reitzel, 2020</xref>), suggests that rhythmic <italic>Clock</italic> expression is entirely blue light-driven and is not required for rhythmic behavior. This would be unusual, as we are not aware of any other system in which <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA oscillates in response to one zeitgeber and not another: <italic>Clock</italic> oscillates during both light and temperature cycles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darlington et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glossop et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boothroyd et al., 2007</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lahiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Rosa et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>Cycle/Bmal</italic> does the same in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chun et al., 2015</xref>). This may suggest that temperature cycles do not entrain circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic> in the same way as light. Strictly speaking, we do not even know whether <italic>Clock</italic> is required for circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, but it is possible that <italic>Clock</italic> exhibits temperature-driven rhythms in a subset of cells, or that temperature acts on <italic>Clock</italic> activity at a level other than transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Global patterns of gene expression during SC</title><p>Work in corals has shown that diurnal gene expression can differ between different constant temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wuitchik et al., 2019</xref>); we show that temperature cycles also interact with light cycles to affect rhythmic gene expression in cnidarians. To our knowledge, this is the first study of transcriptome-wide gene expression during antiphasic light and temperature cycles in any organism. Because 12 hr SC disrupted rhythmic locomotion, we had expected that <italic>Nematostella</italic> might simply express fewer rhythmic genes in these conditions. Instead, while many genes did lose rhythmicity during SC, several hundred genes in turn became rhythmic, and 7% of the transcriptome remained rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, a substantial portion of the transcriptome was rhythmic even during conditions that severely disrupted rhythmic behavior. Genes that gained rhythmicity during SC had lower mean expression than Align-specific rhythmic genes, although their amplitude did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is unclear whether the cycling of SC-specific genes is unimportant, deleterious, or serves some sort of homeostatic function. Gain or loss of rhythmic RNA abundance does not necessarily imply changes to rhythmic transcription, but could be due to rhythmic variation in splicing, degradation, or any other post-transcriptional process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lück et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we observed widespread changes to the expression of genes that regulate RNA metabolism and splicing during SC, possibly affecting the rhythmic abundance of many other transcripts. Post-transcriptional processes, including mRNA processing and translation, have also been implicated in the regulation of rhythmic processes in corals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wuitchik et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a general role for post-transcriptional regulation of rhythmicity in cnidarians.</p><p>A large portion of <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s transcriptome seems to be regulated by diel temperature cycles, consistent with observations in other ectotherms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boothroyd et al., 2007</xref>). Our data do not allow us to distinguish direct, clock-independent effects of temperature from possible influences of temperature on clock-dependent gene expression, and both processes almost certainly contribute to the changes observed here. Some physiological processes, such as autophagy, may be robustly rhythmic because they are strongly synchronized by ambient temperature. However, the amplitude of temperature-responsive genes was reduced during SC, suggesting that some temperature-responsive genes are also either regulated by light or by the clock itself. Furthermore, temperature-responsive genes were enriched for processes known to be under clock control in other animals, including autophagy, ABC transporter activity, and mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardin and Panda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pácha et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><italic>Nematostella</italic> experienced dramatic perturbations to metabolic gene expression during SC. For instance, genes that mediate ribosome biogenesis, one of the most energy-intensive cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Warner, 1999</xref>), lost rhythmicity, as did other genes related to RNA and protein metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Some genes related to glucose metabolism gained rhythmic expression during SC, suggesting that clock dysregulation altered the expression of glucose regulatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Even genes that remained rhythmic and followed the temperature cycle, such as those related to endocytosis, vacuolar transport, and autophagy, changed their temporal expression in relation to time of feeding and thus to the period of peak energy availability. Desynchronization of metabolic processes likely has bioenergetic consequences, as circadian clocks regulate metabolic homeostasis and optimize metabolism for periods of high and low energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thurley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hurley et al., 2018</xref>). Disruption of clock function is linked to various metabolic diseases in mammalian models and human health (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Turek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nedeltcheva and Scheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2016</xref>), and antiphasic light and temperature cycles can substantially reduce growth in plants—possibly because changes to the phase and amplitude of rhythmic gene expression disrupt the coordination of growth-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bours et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, we suggest that the disruption of coordination between genes regulating metabolism likely has deleterious consequences for <italic>Nematostsella</italic>. Future work should connect these results to other physiological endpoints, such as rhythms in respiration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maas et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Ecological implications</title><p><italic>Nematostella</italic> are small, translucent animals that inhabit salt marshes along the eastern seaboard of North America and, invasively, in Northern Europe; they therefore experience wide fluctuations in salinity, temperature, and water chemistry on tidal, diel, and seasonal scales. The anemones live in shallow water (typically 20–30 cm for our local population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarrant et al., 2019</xref>) and burrow in sediment with their oral end and tentacles exposed. Although <italic>Nematostella</italic> live in a tidally-influenced environment, circadian rhythms in behavior and gene expression are much more prominent than circatidal rhythms, even among animals entrained to natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarrant et al., 2019</xref>). We do not know the adaptive significance of <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s circadian behavior, but it may be that nocturnality provides protection from predators or UV radiation.</p><p>It may be the case that temperature is not a true zeitgeber in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, since the signal for temperature-entrained free-running rhythms was weak and we did not observe free-running molecular rhythms in core clock genes. However, it has been noted that circadian rhythms of cnidarians are ‘weaker’ than those of bilaterian model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoadley et al., 2016</xref>) because behavioral free-running rhythms are often noisy and variable among individuals, and most gene expression rhythms appear not to persist during free-running (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leach and Reitzel, 2019</xref>). Therefore, the apparent weakness of temperature-entrained free-running rhythms in our study may not be surprising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The observed weakness of circadian rhythms could be biological, implying that cnidarians rely more on direct responses to the environment than on entrained rhythms, or technical in nature (e.g. due to use of a noisy behavioral endpoint, or bulk RNA-seq that masks rhythmic gene expression by averaging). Future work with more sophisticated behavioral endpoints may provide stronger evidence for temperature entrainment of circadian rhythms in this animal. In any case, we demonstrate for the first time that diel temperature cycles influence circadian rhythms in a cnidarian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with broad effects on gene expression and circadian behavior. Our data provide strong, but not definitive, evidence that temperature cycles, by themselves, entrain circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><p>We have used the phrase ‘sensory conflict’ to refer to a situation in which two environmental signals provide different phase information, as informed by experiments with only one signal or the other. This framework emphasizes the two cues as independent sources of information about time of day, which can therefore be placed into an irreconcilable relationship from an information content standpoint. Sensory conflict is perhaps most useful as a framework for experimental design, but is of limited utility when interpreting the full range of possible interactions between zeitgebers. For instance, the choice of a reference time series, in which light and temperature are aligned, is somewhat arbitrary (i.e. is the 2 hr offset between light and temperature ‘less aligned?’—after all, light and temperature cycles do not line up exactly in nature). More generally, zeitgebers can combine in an infinite number of ways, especially when one cue (in this case temperature) varies continuously rather than according to an on/off binary. It is thus appropriate to consider our experimental groups simply as different situations in which light and temperature interact, not necessarily as greater or lesser degrees of conflict. In an ecological context, the shapes of natural light and temperature cycles are much more complex and variable than artificial cycles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yoshii et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vanin et al., 2012</xref>), and there are many other temporal signals—including food availability, redox state, and tidal and lunar cycles—that all influence organismal behavior and physiology and can interact with one another in complex ways. Although this complexity is challenging to address experimentally, it is important to characterize clock behavior in multi-zeitgeber systems in order to predict how organisms will respond to anthropogenic changes to zeitgeber regimes, for example due to artificial light at night (ALAN). ALAN alters the relationship between light and other signals in the environment and is increasingly affecting ecosystems such as coral reefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaston et al., 2013</xref>). ALAN impacts the behavior and physiology of many organisms through direct effects of light as well as disruption of circadian rhythms, but we know little about what the consequences might be for any given species. Sensory conflict specifically addresses the effects of phase mismatches between zeitgebers, which is one possible effect of ALAN.</p><p>We found that <italic>Nematostella</italic>’s behavior during entraining conditions was ‘normal’ (i.e. nocturnal) over a wide range of temperature offsets (up to 8 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This may indicate that behavioral rhythms are likely to remain in phase with light in most realistic scenarios. On the other hand, behavior was disrupted at the most extreme offsets, indicating that light does not strictly override temperature and there can be interactions between light and temperature cycles that prevent or weaken rhythmic activity. More work could be done to see how light pollution scenarios (e.g. different periods of light, or dim light throughout the night) interact with naturalistic temperature cycles, with the ultimate goal of managing human impacts by implementing minimally disruptive light regimes. Such studies should also consider sublethal effects on gene expression and metabolism that may impact organismal fitness, as we observed substantial changes to gene expression during SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In general, our results illustrate that disruption of circadian rhythms is not an all-or-nothing situation. Some individuals maintained rhythmic behavior even when behavior was severely disrupted on average, and SC did not abolish rhythmic expression of core clock genes. Instead, SC caused clock outputs to become weaker and less coordinated among individuals. Our findings highlight the need for multi-zeitgeber studies to employ fine temporal resolution across a variety of conditions in order to understand how animal behavior and physiology vary according to the interactions of multiple environmental signals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The laboratory population was originally collected from Great Sippewissett Marsh, MA USA and maintained in the laboratory for several generations. <italic>Nematostella</italic> were kept in glass water dishes containing half-strength 1 µm-filtered seawater (from Buzzards Bay, MA), diluted 1:1 with distilled water to a salinity of approximately 16. Water was changed weekly. Prior to acclimating to experimental conditions, anemones were kept at room temperature (18 °C) and fed brine shrimp nauplii four times per week.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>Anemones were acclimated to a given light and temperature regime for at least two weeks prior to behavioral monitoring. They were fed during the acclimation period, but not during behavioral monitoring. A schematic of the experimental design is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. For all experiments, animals were randomly selected from the full acclimated group.</p><p>In the first set of experiments, <italic>Nematostella</italic> were kept in gradually changing (ramped) 24 hr temperature cycles in constant darkness. Incubators were programmed such that the water temperature reached the desired temperature on the hour, which was monitored with HOBO temperature loggers. Temperature cycles were either 14–26 °C (changing 1 degree per hour) or 8–32 °C (2 degrees per hour). Animals were fed with the aid of a dim red-light headlamp <italic>Nematostella</italic> behavior is most sensitive to blue light and least sensitive to red light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reitzel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leach and Reitzel, 2020</xref>). Animals were transferred to the Noldus chambers at ZT6 (14–26 °C), or ZT8-10 (8–32 °C). Trial lengths ranged from 69 to 73 hr. For the 14–26 °C cycle, the free-running temperature was 20 °C, which was held constant beginning at ZT6. For the 8–32 °C cycle, the free-running temperature was 24 °C, beginning at ZT8. We also conducted light and temperature cycle experiments with short periods (12 hr): a 6:6 light-dark cycle at 20 °C, and a 17–23 °C temperature cycle changing by 1 degree per hour.</p><p>For sensory conflict (SC) experiments, animals were acclimated to the 14–26 °C temperature cycle and a 12:12 light-dark cycle. The population of anemones was maintained in an incubator with ‘aligned’ light and temperature cycles, such that ZT0 corresponded to lights-on and the coldest temperature. In addition to Aligned-cycle, 6 light and temperature regimes were tested in which the phase of the temperature cycle was delayed relative to the light cycle in 2 hr increments, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Anemones in these groups were transferred from the aligned incubator to a second incubator where the temperature cycle was shifted relative to the light cycle. Behavioral monitoring was performed for separate groups of animals during entrainment and free-running conditions, resulting in 14 total groups.</p><p>After acclimation, behavior was monitored using Noldus Daniovision observation chambers equipped with infrared-sensitive cameras (DVOC-0040, Noldus Information Technology). Anemones were fed the day before each behavioral trial. A few hours after feeding, 12 anemones were transferred to individual wells of two 6-well plates and left in the incubator overnight. This was done to avoid directly handling the animals at the start of the experiment. At the start of each trial, plates were placed into two Noldus chambers. We chose a minimum sample size of n=24 anemones per group because this is twice the sample size (n=12) at which we regularly detect rhythms in LD; we thus tested four 6-well plates per group (except Off12-cycle, which had a sample size of n=36). A custom flow-through water system was used to control the temperature. A separate tank was heated and cooled using an aquarium heater and cooler connected to a programmable temperature controller, and water was flowed around the plate inside the observation chamber using aquarium pumps. Water temperature was monitored with iButton temperature loggers. Each trial began at ZT6, and was recorded for 78h. Free-running trials begain at ZT12, 6h after the start of recording, and thus had a length of 72h. To avoid suddent jumps in temperature, it was necessary to release groups into constant temperature (20°C) at different times (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; the beginning of free-run per se, meaning lights-off and 20°C, was the same for every group). Videos were recorded with a framerate of 2 frames per second.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Anemones were maintained in a 8–32 °C temperature cycle in constant darkness and sampled every 4h over 48h (13 time points), beginning at ZT12. In parallel, another group of animals was moved to constant temperature (24 °C) at ZT8 and sampled at the same time points. Four biological replicates were sampled at each time point, and each replicate consisted of three pooled individuals. Total RNA was extracted using the Aurum Total RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue Kit (Bio-Rad) following manufacturer’s protocol with DNAse treatment. RNA quality and concentration were checked with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Libraries with low 260/230 ratios (&lt;1.8) or low concentration were re-purified using an RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo). RNA libraries were diluted to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>20</mml:mn><mml:mtext/><mml:mrow><mml:mi class="ltx_unit">ng</mml:mi><mml:mtext/><mml:msup><mml:mrow class="ltx_unit"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">µ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and reverse transcription was performed with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Primers for five genes—<italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Cry1a</italic>, <italic>Cry1b</italic>, <italic>Cry2</italic>, and <italic>Helt</italic>—were ordered from Thermo Fisher and diluted to 10μM. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The 20μL reaction mixture consisted of 10μL Supermix, 8μL nuclease-free water, 1μL cDNA, and 0.5μL each of forward and reverse primers. All samples for a given primer pair were performed on a single 96-well plate. Annealing temperatures were tested with a gradient for each primer pair followed by a melt curve analysis. 60°C was chosen as the annealing temperature because it resulted in the lowest C<sub>q</sub> values with specific amplification. The thermocycler was programmed as follows: 95° for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95° for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mtext/><mml:mi class="ltx_unit" mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and 60° for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn><mml:mtext/><mml:mi class="ltx_unit" mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, followed by a melt curve analysis.</p><p>Quantitative PCR data analysis was performed with LinRegPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruijter et al., 2009</xref>). We excluded a total of three samples from further analysis because several genes failed to amplify. Gene expression was normalized using the NORMA-Gene algorithm, which uses a least-squares approach to minimize variation within treatments rather than relying on reference genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heckmann et al., 2011</xref>). Rhythmicity was tested with Lomb-Scargle periodograms (LSP) implemented in the R package ’lomb’ v2.0, with periods between 20 and 28 hr. Significance was assessed with n=2000 permutations, with a slight modification to the default ’randlsp’ command. Since each time point contained replicates, all 49 data points (3–4 replicates x 13 time points) were shuffled, and then the mean time point values were re-calculated for the permuted data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA extraction and sequencing</title><p>Anemones were either maintained in Aligned-cycle or Off12-cycle conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

Each time point contained three biological replicates of five pooled individuals each, with the exception of one library that consisted of three pooled individuals. This was because the initial five-animal pool produced a low yield, so a new pool was constructed from three remaining animals from that treatment group. RNA was extracted using the Aurum Total RNA mini kit following the manufacturer’s instructions, except we incubated the RNA lysis buffer on ice for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn><mml:mtext/><mml:mi class="ltx_unit">min</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> following tissue homogenization. Concentrations and quality were assessed with a Nandrop spectrophotometer and a Qubit fluorometer.

Each video with footage of six individual anemones was cropped into six videos to be analyzed separately. A training dataset was constructed from 3699 images, in which we manually labeled the center-point of individual anemones. The DLC algorithm was trained on this dataset for 600,000 iterations using default settings and the ‘resnet_50’ neural network. DLC output files were analyzed using R code derived from the DLCAnalyzer Github package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/DLCAnalyzer">https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/DLCAnalyzer</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sturman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">von Ziegler and Roessler, 2023</xref>); custom code used for this paper is available at this github repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/caberger1/Sensory-Conflict-in-Nematostella-vectensis">https://github.com/caberger1/Sensory-Conflict-in-Nematostella-vectensis</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger, 2023</xref>).

For each animal, distance moved was summed into hourly bins based on real-world clock times and normalized to that animal’s maximum hourly movement. This corrects for differences in overall activity due to for example body size (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tarrant et al., 2019</xref>). For each experimental group, we averaged the hourly time points to produce a mean time series, which we analyzed alongside the individual time series.

The first was a Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) implemented within the R package ‘lomb’, with periods restricted from 20 to 28 hr and significance assessed by permutation (n=2000). The second test, the empirical JTK method, was implemented within the BioDare2 web portal (‘eJTK Classic’; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk/">https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk/</ext-link>). This approach fits a series of cosinor waves with 24 hr periods, thus testing for periods of exactly 24 hr. An LSP test with periods from 10 to 14 hr was used to test for circatidal rhythms. In all cases, p-values were adjusted by Benjamin-Hochberg correction, and we chose a conservative FDR cutoff of 0.001 because we were only interested in time series that could confidently be identified as rhythmic. The ’mFourFit’ method implemented in the BioDare2 web portal was used to calculate periods and phases of time series. This is a curve-fitting procedure that is generally the most accurate of the available methods for short time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zielinski et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The R package ’CircaCompare’ v0.1.1 was used to test for differences in amplitude and phase of mean time series. CircaCompare uses a cosinor curve-fitting approach and thus gives different estimates of phase and amplitude than those calculated by MFF; however, CircaCompare allows for formal hypothesis testing. The Rayleigh test for circular uniformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rayleigh, 1880</xref>) was used to test whether phases were distributed non-uniformly (implemented in the R package ’circular’ v0.4). A bootstrapped version of Watson’s non-parametric test (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pewsey et al., 2013</xref> and implemented in the R package ’AS.circular’ v0.0.0.9) was used to test whether phase distributions differed in their mean direction; significance was assessed with 9999 bootstraps. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons were used to test for differences in non-circular means between groups (implemented in R packages ’stats’ v4.0.3 and ’dunn.test’ v1.3.5). Levene’s test was used to test for differences in variance (’car’ v3.0), and paired Wilcoxon rank tests (’stats’ v4.0.3) were used to test for differences in distance to expected light and temperature phases. Unless otherwise noted, p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.</p><p>Linear mixed effects models were used to test for differences in (un-normalized) activity levels between groups, considering two measures of activity: percent time active, and total distance covered. Each hour of activity for each individual was considered a separate observation. We accounted for baseline differences in activity between individuals using random intercepts, and for autocorrelation of residuals using a correlation structure of AR(1); using more complex correlation structures did not affect the results. Mixed models were implemented in the R package ’nlme’ v3.1, and post-hoc testing was done using ’emmeans’ v1.6.2.</p><p>Time series clustering analysis was done by decomposing smoothed mean time series using wavelet transformation in the R package ’biwavelet’ v0.20.21, with the smallest scale (period) set to 2 and the largest scale to 36. The ’wclust’ command was used to construct a distance matrix of the 14 wavelet series, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the distance matrix with ’FactoMineR’ v2.4. Hierarchical clustering was performed in principal component space with the ’HCPC’ command using complete linkage. The AU test was used to quantify uncertainty in clustering in the pvclust v2.2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki and Shimodaira, 2006</xref>) with 1000 bootstraps, and clustering and PCA analyses were visualized with the ’factoextra’ package v1.0.7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis, gene expression</title><p>Raw reads were trimmed using Cutadapt v3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martin, 2011</xref>) with a minimum length of 25 and quality cutoff of 5, and mapped to the Simrbase Nvec200_v1 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zimmermann et al., 2020</xref>) using Salmon v1.5.1 with ‘selective alignment (full)’ (SAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Srivastava et al., 2020</xref>), a k-mer size of 21, and no length correction (as Tag-seq reads do not have length bias). Tximport v1.16.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soneson et al., 2016</xref>) was used to import counts into R; counts were then TMM-normalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) and expressed as counts per million on a log2 scale. Raw reads from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref> were re-analyzed in the same way as above, except they were length-corrected.</p><p>Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed using limma-voom 3.44.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Phipson et al., 2016</xref>) with quality weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), using the following model: ‘Condition * Light +Temperature + hour’, allowing for linear effects of temperature and total time in the experiment. Low counts were filtered using the command ’filterByExpr’ in EdgeR v3.30.3 grouped by time point and condition, which retained 12,294/15,290 genes. Rhythmic gene expression was tested using RAIN v1.24.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thaben and Westermark, 2014</xref>), ECHO v4.0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Los Santos et al., 2020</xref>), and DryR v1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weger et al., 2021</xref>). In RAIN, search was performed for waveforms with 24h periods and asymmetries in 4h increments. p-Values were corrected using the Bonferroni procedure. Phases and amplitudes of rhythmic genes were calculated using CircaCompare. Rao’s two-sample test for homogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jammalamadaka et al., 2021</xref>) was used to test whether groups of phases were drawn from the same distribution (R package ’TwoCircular’ v1.0), and significance was assessed with 10,000 Monte-Carlo replications. Discriminant analysis of principal components was conducted with the R package ’adegenet’ v2.1.4 and code modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>.</p><p>Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed with the GO_MWU R package with default settings (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU">https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matz, 2022</xref>). GO annotations were downloaded from the SimrBase website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://simrbase.stowers.org/analysis/294">https://simrbase.stowers.org/analysis/294</ext-link>, NVEC200.20200813.gff). KEGG enrichment was performed with ’clusterProfiler’ v3.0.4. To annotate KEGG pathways, protein sequences from an earlier <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome assembly (Nvec1, JGI) were downloaded from the KEGG website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>) and queried against the SimrBase transcriptome using TBLASTN. SimrBase genes were annotated with the KEGG term of their best-scoring hit in each pathway, using an e-value cutoff of 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> and requiring &gt;75% sequence identity. Sliding window enrichment analysis was performed to identify GO and KEGG terms enriched at certain times of day in each treatment. In each 4 h sliding window (e.g. ZT0-4, ZT3-6), p-values were calculated (using GO_MWU for GO, and clusterProfiler for KEGG) by comparing genes with phase in that window against all other genes. The enrichment score of a gene at each hourly bin was calculated by averaging the -log10 adjusted p-values from the three sliding windows that overlapped the time point (e.g. the score at ZT3 averaged the sliding windows ZT0-4, ZT1-5, and ZT2-6), and a gene was considered enriched if the score at any time point was greater than -log10(0.05).</p><p>Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis v1.70 (WGCNA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Langfelder and Horvath, 2007</xref>) was used to cluster rhythmic genes. For the full network constructed from all genes rhythmic in either time series, a soft-thresholding power of 5 was used, and a power of 8 was used for both the Align- and SC-specific networks. In all cases, a signed hybrid adjacency matrix, a minimum module size of 20, biweight midcorrelation (‘bicor’), maxPOutliers = 0.2, and mergeCutHeight = 0.25 were used. Eigengene rhythmicity was assessed using LSPs with 2000 permutations (periods 20–28 hr). Enriched GO terms were calculated for each module using GO_MWU with module membership (’kME’) as input and all other genes as background. KEGG enrichment was performed using a hypergeometric test within ’clusterProfiler’, as above.</p><p>Putative promoter sequences 1 kb upstream of transcription start sites were searched for enriched motifs using the HOMER motif discovery tool (findMotifs.pl), searching for motifs of lengths 6, 8, 10, and 12, retaining the top 15 motifs, and using all other promoters as background. Motifs were considered enriched at a p-value of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for ‘known’ motifs, or 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> for de novo motifs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81084-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw RNA-seq data have been uploaded to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), Bioproject PRJNA826898.

Log p-values of ECHO and RAIN were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic>=0.85). DryR does not calculate p-values, but instead uses model selection to cluster genes based on their expression profile. Briefly, 81% of genes assigned rhythmicity in either time series by DryR were rhythmic in that time series based on RAIN (p&lt;0.01), and 93% had a RAIN p-value less than 0.05; 73% of rhythmic RAIN genes (p&lt;0.01) were assigned to the corresponding cluster(s) in DryR. Thus RAIN and DryR also showed good agreement, although RAIN tended to identify additional rhythmic genes not clustered by DryR.

This study provides a reference for genes exhibiting rhythmic expression under a light-dark cycle at constant temperature. They used a Fourier analysis to identify 180 genes with rhythmic diel expression, which included putative clock genes <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Helt</italic>, <italic>CIPC</italic>, <italic>Cry1a</italic>, and<italic>Cry2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref>). Using RAIN on their re-analyzed data, we identified 1498 rhythmic genes at <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 (560 genes with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01); we used a less stringent p-value cutoff here because their sample size was much smaller than the sample size in our current study. Despite the differences in genome assembly and statistical methodology between the original paper and our re-analysis, we recapitulated some of the most prominent rhythmic genes in their dataset, including the principal genes hypothesized to play a role in the cnidarian clock (Clock, Cry1a, Cry2, Helt-like, and CIPC). The phases of clock genes in these two experiments are shown in 3.</p><p>This re-analysis of this previously published LD experiment demonstrates that core clock gene expression is comparable between an LD cycle at constant temperature, and our study of an LD cycle with an aligned temperature cycle. The phases of putative clock genes (Clock, Helt, CIPC, Cry1a, and Cry2) were approximately the same in the aligned time series and in Oren et al. (within 4 h), as were the phases of two PAR-bZIP genes. The only exception was Cry1b, which was rhythmic in the current study and not in the re-analyzed dataset (<italic>P</italic>=0.2).</p><p>However, the overlap of all rhythmic genes between these studies was small. Only 477/1498 (32%) genes rhythmic in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) had a rhythmic p-value less than 0.05 in the current study (345 had <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). Of these 477 shared genes, just 224 (47%) had phases within 4 h of each other, and 108 (23%) shifted by at least 8 h. However, there was no overall difference between the phase distributions (Rao’s test, <italic>P</italic>=0.5). Functional enrichment of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oren et al., 2015</xref> dataset revealed few similarities with the current study—only a single GO/KEGG term, &quot;Spliceosome&quot;, was expressed at the same time (ZT12-18; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).

The authors view these interactions in terms of a framework called 'sensory conflict', which sets in motion a logical conflict in the way I view the results. I do not see why the 'sensory conflict' framework is required at all, and the fact all data are explored in such a rigid manner leads me to feel that the real interactions that may be important to Nematostella biology could well be lost. Another factor to consider is that there are many environmental cycles in the natural world in addition to the two explored here, including, but not limited to the lunar cycle, tides/currents, salinity, nutrition, UV/DNA damage, oxidation/reduction cycles… do they all cause conflicts? If they did, nothing would happen. Some may synergize or interact in an entire suite of different manners. The interaction would be the interesting element.</p><p>I am not sure you are looking at desynchronization at all. If both entraining signals have independent peaks, and you shift their alignments, you would have more peaks, e.g., more than one peak per 24 hours, one for light and one for temperature. Given the noise of the readout, two peaks may just look like noise/desynchronization. In fact, my explanation fits the data in 3A 12 hour offset quite well. You in fact recover a peak rapidly when going into constant darkness, so going back from two nonaligned inputs to one input, dark, which supports locomotory behaviour. I'd encourage you to think of the two entertainers shifting their alignments, and the consequences on your readout.</p><p>I'd argue that every statement that assumes the framework of 'sensory conflict' is a real thing in the animal and that the data show how this sensory conflict is impacted is not grammatically correct. I read the results carefully a number of times and thinking about the results simply as phase shifting does not in any way make the data more difficult to understand, and in fact makes it easier. If the phases of two different inputs were exactly aligned, for example temperature and light, they would still interact. If the phase of one were shifted so that the peak were now at a different point in a 24 hour cycle, they would still interact, presumably in a different manner. Is one conflict and the other not? In my mind they are just different examples, not one being a conflict and the other not a conflict.</p><p>L24. &quot;Existing studies are limited in the range of tested zeitgeber relationships, and also in their taxonomic breadth, which is restricted to insects and vertebrates among animals. &quot; This is clearly incorrect. There are in fact papers going back over a decade looking into many interacting entraining factors in the same cnidarian phylum, e.g., PMID: 31294494 and quite a volume of papers looking at interactions between two different light entrainers, daylight and moonlight, e.g., PMID: 17947585. There are also some very good papers on tide and light interactions in molluscs (PMCID: PMC3179051), season and temperature and tide (PMID: 33736335), lots on marine isopods, polychaete worms and I'm sure many, many others. PMID: 31294494 even looks at interactions between multiple entrainers, including temperature and light at the transcriptome level. These may not have applied the authors 'sensory conflict' framework, but they look at interactions between inputs, and seem more likely to be biologically relevant in my view. The authors do indeed have some interesting results and have done experiments not covered in the literature just mentioned, but they should look at their new results in light of these previous analyses.</p><p>Where the results in Figure 3 replicated? These are the core data that are the foundation of the manuscript. As the results do not align well with the authors' own previous constant temperature experiments, this replication would seem particularly important. I may have simply missed this somehow.</p><p>These two statements both occur in the legend to Figure 1: ZT0 refers to the coldest time point AND ZT0 always refers to lights-on. Which is true?

What was the feeding regimen of the animals, and could it impact the results? What was changed, and when, is not clear from the figure at all.

While the study reports a large number of intriguing results, the sheer volume of information makes it difficult to follow the results and discussion. This manuscript would benefit from additional streamlining that could help the flow and readability of the results. For example, the Discussion section of this manuscript is only three pages long, with no references back to individual figures or panels to help readers understand the authors' logic for the conclusions that have been drawn. In contrast, the Results section is roughly seven pages (not including figures) and much of it is extremely difficult to follow. This is particularly challenging given the large number of experiments and parameterizations that are utilized to explain the results. This discrepancy between results and discussion makes me wonder if all the results are indeed discussed, or if some may be better placed in supplemental information, allowing room for more in-depth discussion of the key results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sensory conflict disrupts circadian rhythms in the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Rutz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved significantly, Reviewer 2 however, raised some remaining aspects that we ask you to address, as they are particularly relevant for the chronobiological interpretation of your work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors did an excellent job addressing my concerns and suggestions and I think the quality of the manuscript has improved considerably. I have only a few minor remarks listed below. My main concern that temperature cycles cannot by themselves entrain the Nematostella circadian clock has been addressed by an additional frequency demultiplication experiment. The results of this experiment are convincing: Animals kept in 6h : 6h temperature cycles display a main rhythmic component with a ~25 h period, showing that the rhythm is not simply driven by temperature. Since the animals also show no free-running circadian rhythms after temperature entrainment, it can also be ruled out that the observed 25 h period simply reflects free-running behaviour one would expect under constant conditions. Nevertheless, I still don't think it is fair to say that temperature cycles entrain the circadian clock of Nematostella. In my view the authors show that temperature cycles clearly influence or modulate the clock, but they do not entrain it. By definition, true entrainment must fulfil two criteria. First, the period of the observed rhythm must equal the period of the entraining cycle (here the temperature cycle) and establish a stable phase relationship to each other. Second, after release into constant conditions, the observed rhythm must continue with the same phase established during the entrainment cycle (e.g., Dunlap et al. 2004; Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping, Sinauer Associates). None of these criteria are fulfilled (1: no stable phase relationship-the animals fall into two groups, and 2: no rhythm observed in free running conditions after the entrainment cycle), and there are also no molecular rhythms observed in any of the clock genes after temperature cycles. For these reasons I think the authors need to tone down their claim that temperature cycles entrain the Nematostella circadian clock. On the other hand, I think the sensory conflict experiments convincingly show that temperature cycles do influence behaviour and molecular rhythms in combined LD and TC conditions, but again this only demonstrates that temperature cycles influence or modulate the circadian clock. The text should be changed accordingly to reflect these differences.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81084.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improvement of the clarity of the presentation of the work: There are multiple comments on this in the individual reviews, which the authors need to consider, but especially: Figure 1 is not intuitively understandable; the whole network analysis part/ Figure 6 needs reworking; and the use of the terminology of 'sensory conflict' requires clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to improve clarity, including an overhaul of the conceptual Figure 1, and we have revised the section on network analysis and Figure 6.

Briefly, we found that animals maintained in a temperature cycle with 12h period (i.e. half the length of a circadian period) had a clear 24h component to their behavior, in addition to (and stronger than) a 12h component. This “frequency demultiplication” is a property of some circadian oscillators entrained to short zeitgeber periods, because the clock essentially perceives every other cycle as a new day. If temperature only drove behavior directly, it would be impossible to observe a 24h behavioral pattern. We also show that this holds for 6:6 light cycles, as expected.

Upon reflection, we agree that the phrase “sensory conflict” may be too simplistic, in terms of understanding the many possible relationships between different zeitgebers. We use sensory conflict to refer to a situation in which light and temperature provide different phase information, as informed by experiments with only light and only temperature. This is most useful when thinking about experimental design with two extreme offsets, such as our “aligned” and 12h offset time series—so “conflict” refers to a mismatch in the phase information provided by the individual zeitgebers. We still think this concept is useful because it asks what happens when two signals provide conflicting information about time of day---does the clock prioritize one signal over the other, or do they interact in some more complicated way? However, it’s true that there are many possible relationships between light and temperature that cannot be categorized as “conflict” or “not conflict.”</p><p>In any case, we have revised the Introduction and Discussion to discuss these points in some detail, although we have chosen to keep the paper’s title and to use “sensory conflict” when referring to the extreme misalignment of light and temperature. We no longer refer to intermediate offsets as “degrees of sensory conflict.”</p><p>When discussing our results, we use the term “desynchronization” to refer to a lack of synchrony between different rhythmic individuals (L192). We are not postulating a mechanism. We simply observe that with large offsets (e.g., in Figure 3A 12h offset), behavior is largely arrhythmic which is caused both by a weakening of the rhythmicity of individual animals as well as a lack of synchronization between the remaining rhythmic individuals (L199-208). Regarding the suggestion that we might expect two behavioral peaks within 24h, we did not observe clear circatidal rhythms in any group, or consistent multiple behavioral peaks in any group or in the behavior profile of any individual. We do in fact discuss the observation that we “recover a peak rapidly when… going back from two nonaligned inputs to one input… which supports locomotory behaviour”—this is the concept of masking that we discuss in L453-467.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L24. &quot;Existing studies are limited in the range of tested zeitgeber relationships, and also in their taxonomic breadth, which is restricted to insects and vertebrates among animals. &quot; This is clearly incorrect.

As you say, our original focus was on papers that explicitly compared 2 or more phase relationships of 2 different zeitgebers with 24h periods—so “sensory conflict” in a somewhat narrow sense. There is certainly a larger literature about interactions between multiple entraining cues in general, and we have revised this section to acknowledge this. That said, in our view many of these studies are not directly relevant to our work; for example, PMID: 31294494 considers the interaction of light cycles with different constant temperatures and does not consider temperature as a zeitgeber. Many of these are field studies and thus do not isolate individual entraining cues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where the results in Figure 3 replicated?

The text should be changed accordingly to reflect these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>After considering your points, we agree that we should soften our interpretation and have revised the manuscript to reflect the language that temperature cycles modulate the clock, without necessarily entraining it. In several places, we have changed “entrain” to “influence” or “zeitgebers” to “environmental signals,” etc., and added an explicit discussion of the limitations of our data in terms of temperature entrainment (L603-618).</p><p>However, we also believe that our evidence of temperature entrainment is perhaps stronger than you have suggested. Our data do in fact support the first entrainment criteria for 24h temperature cycles (our Figure 2)—anemones have 24h behavioral periods and a stable phase relationship with the temperature cycle. In our interpretation, the fact that phases fall into two groups during the 6:6 temperature (and light) cycles does not invalidate this. Individuals do have a stable phase relationship TO THE CYCLE, it’s just that the cycle itself is a 12h period. This is explained in the text in L142-149.</p><p>It's true that our evidence for free-running rhythms is more ambiguous—although, again, we note that several individual animals did have temperature-entrained free-running rhythms, and there were statistically detectable free-running rhythms on average (L120, L128). In our opinion, the main difficulty is the noise of behavioral readouts in this system. We suspect that new behavior assays might provide a stronger signal for the phase of individual animals and free-running rhythms.</p><p>For these reasons, in our revised manuscript we acknowledge the limitations of our data but still suggest that our results provide evidence that temperature cycles entrain circadian behavior—even if it is not strictly conclusive.</p><p>The major changes are outlined below:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>L14-19. Here, we show that temperature cycles modulate circadian locomotor rhythms in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, a model system for cnidarian circadian biology. We conduct behavioral experiments across a comprehensive range of light and temperature cycles and find that<italic>Nematostella</italic>’s circadian behavior is disrupted by chronic misalignment between light and temperature, which involves disruption of the endogenous clock itself rather than a simple masking effect.</p><p>L22-24. Our results show that a cnidarian clock relies on information from light and temperature, rather than prioritizing one cue over the other.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>L45-47. We use the phrase &quot;sensory conflict&quot; to refer to a situation in which two environmental signals provide different phase information, as compared to a control in which both signals are aligned in phase.</p><p>Results:</p><p>L110-111. We first showed that gradual, environmentally-relevant temperature cycles drive rhythmic locomotor behavior and influence circadian rhythms in Nematostella.</p><p>L254-256. To gain insight into the relative influence of light and temperature on behavioral rhythms, we compared the phases of rhythmic individuals against the offset between light and temperature (Figure 3d).</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>L429-441. We show here that ecologically relevant temperature cycles drive rhythmic behavior and influence circadian rhythms in the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, and explore how the relationship between simultaneous light and temperature cycles affects rhythmic behavior and gene expression. Given that white light exerts strong direct effects on behavior in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, including masking free-running locomotor rhythms (Oren et al., 2015; Tarrant et al., 2019), we thought behavior might simply synchronize to the light cycle to the exclusion of temperature. However, <italic>Nematostella</italic>'s behavior became severely disrupted and arrhythmic on average when light and temperature cycles were offset by 10-12h (Figure 3a). Free-running rhythms were also disrupted, depending on the specific phase relationship. This shows that both light and temperature interact to set the phase of <italic>Nematostella</italic>'s clock, and that neither cue dominates the other. As a consequence, normal rhythmic behavior is only possible under certain relationships between environmental signals. The disruptive effects of sensory conflict (SC) were not acute responses to transient conditions, but chronic changes measured after weeks of exposure and acclimation.</p><p>L476-478. We also observed prominent non-linear dynamics in free-running behavior, with phase differences of as little as two hours between light and temperature resulting in completely different behavioral outcomes.</p><p>L531-543. Surprisingly, we found that Clock mRNA did not oscillate during a temperature cycle (Figure 2c), and was one of only two dozen genes to directly follow the light cycle. Our data, together with evidence that Clock expression is induced by blue light and not green light (Leach and Reitzel, 2020), suggests that rhythmic Clock expression is entirely blue light-driven and is not required for rhythmic behavior. This would be unusual, as we are not aware of any other system in which Clock mRNA oscillates in response to one zeitgeber and not another: Clock oscillates during both light and temperature cycles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Darlington et al., 1998; Glossop et al., 1999; Boothroyd et al., 2007) and fish (Lahiri et al., 2005; Di Rosa et al., 2015), and Cycle/Bmal does the same in mammals (Chun et al., 2015). This may suggest that temperature cycles do not entrain circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic> in the same way as light. Strictly speaking, we do not even know whether Clock is required for circadian rhythms in Nematostella, but it is possible that Clock exhibits temperature-driven rhythms in a subset of cells, or that temperature acts on Clock activity at a level other than transcription.</p><p>L603-618. It may be the case that temperature is not a true zeitgeber in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, since the signal for temperature-entrained free-running rhythms was weak and we did not observe freerunning molecular rhythms in core clock genes. However, it has been noted that circadian rhythms of cnidarians are “weaker” than those of bilaterian model organisms (Hoadley et al., 2016) because behavioral free-running rhythms are often noisy and variable among individuals, and most gene expression rhythms appear not to persist during free-running (e.g. Leach and Reitzel, 2019). Therefore, the apparent weakness of temperature entrained free-running rhythms in our study may not be surprising (Figure 2a). The observed weakness of circadian rhythms could be biological, implying that cnidarians rely more on direct responses to the environment than on entrained rhythms, or technical in nature (e.g. due to use of a noisy behavioral endpoint, or bulk RNA-seq that masks rhythmic gene expression by averaging). Future work with more sophisticated behavioral endpoints may provide stronger evidence for temperature entrainment of circadian rhythms in this animal. In any case, we demonstrate for the first time that diel temperature cycles influence circadian rhythms in a cnidarian (Figure 2), with broad effects on gene expression and circadian behavior. Our data provide strong, but not definitive, evidence that temperature cycles, by themselves, entrain circadian rhythms in <italic>Nematostella</italic>.</p><p>L619-631. We have used the phrase “sensory conflict” to refer to a situation in which two environmental signals provide different phase information, as informed by experiments with only one signal or the other. This framework emphasizes the two cues as independent sources of information about time of day, which can therefore be placed into an irreconcilable relationship from an information content standpoint. Sensory conflict is perhaps most useful as a framework for experimental design, but is of limited utility when interpreting the full range of possible interactions between zeitgebers. For instance, the choice of a reference time series, in which light and temperature are aligned, is somewhat arbitrary (i.e. is the 2h offset between light and temperature “less aligned?”—after all, light and temperature cycles do not line up exactly in nature). More generally, zeitgebers can combine in an infinite number of ways, especially when one cue (in this case temperature) varies continuously rather than according to an on/off binary. It is thus appropriate to consider our experimental groups simply as different situations in which light and temperature interact, not necessarily as greater or lesser degrees of conflict.</p></body></sub-article></article>
