effectively guide decision-making declines in older adulthood. Such declines have been theorized to emerge from either impairments of striatal reinforcement learning systems (RL) or impairments of recurrent networks in prefrontal and parietal cortex that support working memory (WM). Distinguishing between these hypotheses has been challenging because either RL or WM could be used to facilitate successful decision-making in typical laboratory tasks. Here we investigated the neurocomputational correlates of age-related decision-making deficits using an RL-WM task to disentangle these mechanisms, a computational model to quantify them, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to link them to their molecular bases. Our results reveal that task performance is worse in older age, in a manner best explained by working memory deficits, as might be expected if cortical recurrent networks were unable to sustain persistent activity across multiple trials. Consistent with this, we show that older adults had lower levels of prefrontal glutamate, the excitatory neurotransmitter thought to support persistent activity, compared to younger adults. Individuals with the lowest prefrontal glutamate levels displayed the greatest impairments in working memory after controlling for other anatomical and metabolic factors. Together, our results suggest that lower levels of prefrontal glutamate may contribute to failures of working memory systems and impaired decision-making in older adulthood.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>computational modeling</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>PFC</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00AG054732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nassar</surname><given-names>Matthew R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99AG054732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nassar</surname><given-names>Matthew R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF2020844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Anne GE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Apparent age-related differences in learning are best accounted for by rapid decay of information in working memory, which is associated with levels of prefrontal glutamate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>People and animals undergo a number of cognitive changes across healthy aging, and while some of these changes reflect improvements emerging from an extended lifespan of continual learning, others are characterized by declines in function with advanced age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cattell, 1943</xref>). In particular, recent work has highlighted age-related deficits in decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in situations where decision outcomes are learned through experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eppinger et al., 2013</xref>). While such deficits could have critical importance for both aging individuals and society, the exact mechanisms underlying these deficits remain unclear. One possibility is that such impairments stem from an inability to retain the task-relevant information (i.e. working memory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salthouse and Babcock, 1991</xref>), whereas another possibility is that such impairments stem from failures to learn state action values through reinforcement (i.e. reinforcement learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>). These different cognitive processes are supported by different neural systems. Understanding how they contribute to impairments in decision-making across lifespan could also help shed light on biological age-related mechanisms of impaired decision-making.</p><p>Previous work has shown that working memory declines with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salthouse and Babcock, 1991</xref>). Such declines have been shown in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and across a range of working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salthouse and Babcock, 1991</xref>). Working memory is thought to be implemented through persistent activation of neural firing in similarly tuned neurons within recurrent excitatory networks in prefrontal and parietal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Buneo, 2002</xref>). Within such networks, successful maintenance of activity over a delay period depends on glutamatergic signaling, and in particular activation of NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durstewitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Vugt et al., 2020</xref>). In aged monkeys, such persistent activations in prefrontal cortex are diminished and can be restored through local pharmacological manipulations that affect intrinsic neural excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). While the mechanisms by which persistent activity deteriorates with age are not fully established, observed reductions in synapses and dendritic spines on aged prefrontal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumitriu et al., 2010</xref>) suggest that they result at least in part from an overall reduction in glutamatergic signaling. Thus, if age-related behavioral deficits stem from diminished working memory functions, they may result from reductions in glutamate signaling in prefrontal and parietal regions that support working memory.</p><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) systems are also thought to decline across healthy aging. Evidence for such declines comes from behavioral impairments in tasks where participants learn to map stimuli onto rewarded actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eppinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank and Kong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hämmerer et al., 2011</xref>). Learning in such tasks is thought to occur through reinforcement of associations between stimulus and action in the striatum driven by dopamine reward prediction error signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins and Frank, 2014</xref>). Such reward prediction error signals are blunted in healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samanez-Larkin et al., 2014</xref>) supporting the accounts of age-related decline in RL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eppinger et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref> found that boosting dopamine signaling with dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) led to restoration of RPEs and recovery of learning performance in older adults. The results from these studies appear to indicate that neural mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning are impaired in older adults; however, a number of other studies have suggested that RL systems are intact in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radulescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grogan et al., 2019</xref>). Some of the discrepancy in these results may stem from inconsistencies in the tasks used to measure RL across different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckstein et al., 2022</xref>) as many tasks that could be solved through incremental learning in the striatum according to reward prediction errors (RL) could also be solved using other cognitive systems, working memory systems being one of particular importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoo and Collins, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Typical reinforcement learning tasks require identifying the best action to choose when confronted with a given stimulus based on previous feedback. While RL models of such tasks assume that action values are learned incrementally, as if through adjustment of synaptic weights in the striatum, it is also possible for participants to achieve success on such tasks through short-term storage of recent trial information in working memory. Recent work has used task designs that can dissociate these potential contributors to goal directed behavior, along with models that can quantify them, to show that behavioral deficits previously thought to reflect reinforcement learning were actually attributable to working memory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2014</xref>). The reinforcement learning–working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Frank, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins and Frank, 2018</xref>) is a simple stimulus–response association learning task with a format that is commonly observed in RL studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank and Kong, 2008</xref>). However, this task includes a WM manipulation – varying the number of stimulus–response actions (set size) participants need to learn. This manipulation targets WM as a capacity-limited, short-term process since increasing set-size increases both load and average duration between stimulus repetitions. Thus, varying the set size can shift contribution of RL/WM to performance and help tease apart which of the two participants are relying on when performing the task. This task has yielded important mechanistic insights into general as well as clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Frank, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Master et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we combined cognitive, computational, and neural approaches to address the question of (1) how the age-related deficits in making decisions from experience emerge from RL and WM computational mechanisms and (2) how the differences in these mechanisms relate to age-related changes in relevant neural systems. To this end, we administered an RL-WM task to young and older adults and modeled their behavior using computational model that can distinguish between deficits in RL and WM systems. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure levels of glutamate and GABA in regions thought to support working memory (prefrontal/parietal cortices) and reinforcement learning (striatum).</p><p>We found that older participants performed worse in the RL-WM task than younger adults. Group comparison of model parameters revealed that older participants had a more rapid decay of task relevant information in working memory. Older adults also had reduced glutamate levels, particularly in prefrontal and parietal cortices where glutamate is thought to support the persistent activation that underlies working memory. Furthermore, reductions in prefrontal glutamate were correlated with working memory decay across individuals – such that those with the lowest levels of prefrontal glutamate had the most rapidly decaying working memories. Taken together, our results suggest that age-related working memory differences likely contribute to decision-making deficits in older adults, and that such deficits may result from failures of recurrent excitatory networks to sustain persistent representations due to reduced levels of glutamate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>42 older (age mean [SD] = 68 [8.5]) and 36 younger (age mean (SD) = 21 [4.4]) participants were enrolled in a two-session study. Age-normed total <italic>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status</italic> (RBANS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Randolph et al., 1998</xref>) scores were similar in both groups (mean [std] younger: 106.4 [12.0], older: 109.0 [10.8]), suggesting that our cohorts reflected comparable samples of the population with respect to overall cognitive ability. Furthermore, all participants scored in cognitively healthy range (younger adults range: 83–140; older adults range: 81–141) since cognitive impairment is defined as score 70 or below. The first session required performance of an RL-WM task designed to dissociate the contributions of working memory and reinforcement learning to decision-making under uncertainty. The second study session included an MRI session in which MRS was used to measure glutamate and GABA in key regions thought to support working memory (middle frontal gyrus [MFG] of prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus [IPS]) and reinforcement learning (striatum).</p><p>In the RL-WM task, older and young adults were required to learn correct stimulus–response (key press) associations, with the goal of earning as many points as possible. After the stimulus appeared, the participants had 1 s to make their response, following which they received deterministic feedback. Each stimulus appeared nine times in a block, pseudo-randomly interleaved with other stimuli, allowing the participants to learn correct associations from feedback. The task has a common RL experiment structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2004</xref>), with an important difference: the number of associations varied (either three or six) between different, fully independent blocks. This enabled us to manipulate the degree to which working memory (WM), a capacity-limited system, might contribute to behavior by storing recent stimulus–action–outcome information. In particular, previous computational and empirical work using this task suggests that working memory will contribute less to decisions in the high set size condition (six associations), but that slower learning in high set size paradoxically leads to better retention relative to learning in a surprise ‘test phase’ in which learned associations are tested in the absence of feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results; model-independent</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Learning</title><p>Both age groups learned to make accurate responses in the learning phase and did so more quickly in blocks with fewer interleaved stimuli, but younger adults learned more successfully than their older counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The learning curves reveal patterns that are consistent with RL and WM involvement in young adults (early spike in accuracy for lower set size that is absent for larger set size and that is considered a marker of fast/one-shot learning characteristic of WM but not RL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Frank, 2012</xref>). This pattern is less clear in older adults. The average accuracy of individuals in the young and old groups was 0.74 (SD = 0.01) and 0.60 (SD = 0.01), respectively (ANOVA for group difference: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>76</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>45.42</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.71</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>09</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).

The mean decay rate for the younger group was 0.174, indicating that an association would decay to 83% of its original strength after a single trial, whereas in older adults the decay of 0.324 would lead to working memory degradation about twice as fast.</p><p>Next, we focused on the relative WM reliance parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. We were interested in exploring whether the WM reliance might follow the similar pattern observed in group-related difference in the WM decay. For instance, if older participants’ WM module is markedly more forgetful, they would accordingly rely less on the association weights stored in WM to guide their action selection. In our analysis, we observed that the relative reliance on WM over RL — as captured by the set size-dependent policy mixture parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:msup><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> — depended heavily on the set size in both groups.

Thus, older and young adults showed similar patterns in WM reliance, contingent on the set size.</p><p>The model fits revealed very little indication of group differences in parameters specific to the RL system.

Our model did have a learning rate asymmetry parameter that affected both RL and WM systems, and allowed the model to capture a consistent trend toward higher learning from positive relative to negative outcomes in both groups.

This asymmetry differed across groups, such that negative learning rates were higher in the young adult group compared to the older adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mrow><mml:mpadded width="+5pt"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mpadded><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> = <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.016</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.002</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.032</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). This suggests that older adults neglected negative feedback even more relative to young adults. This result is inconsistent with the previous work, suggesting that older adults exhibit bias in learning from negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank and Kong, 2008</xref>). However, this finding has not been consistent across studies, and in our paradigm a bias toward learning from positive outcomes could be viewed as an adaptive strategy when resources are limited, in that positive outcomes perfectly prescribe the correct future action, whereas negative ones only rule a single response out.</p><p>Importantly, the noise/random lapse parameter did not differ between the two age groups (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mpadded width="+5pt"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mpadded><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.011</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.047</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), which suggests it is unlikely that the observed differences in accuracy are due to older adults simply having noisier data.</p><p>To demonstrate the impact of their higher decay rate on older adults’ learning, we again simulated older adults’ behavior from the fitted model, except we used the young adults’ group-level decay rate in place of every older adult’s individual-level decay rate. To do this, we used the same procedure as was used to generate the posterior predictive plots (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; see ‘Methods’), except with the aforementioned parameter swaps. This demonstration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>) suggests that the older adult’s higher decay rate could potentially account for most of the difference in learning behavior between the age groups.</p><p>Our behavioral results revealed that older adults performed more poorly in set size 6, in which performance is more driven by RL than in set size 3, due to capacity limitations of WM. However, our modeling revealed that WM parameters, specifically WM decay <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf97"><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, show greatest group differences, rather than RL parameters. Simulation results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>) provided some insight into this finding by showing that decreasing the working memory decay in older adults improves training performance most notably in the set size 6 condition. The primary explanation for this is that higher set size assumes increased delay between successive presentations of the same stimuli. Longer delays, in turn, make differences in WM decay more pronounced. Furthermore, a WM impairment can have an indirect effect in RL, in that frequent failure to select correct action through WM leads to reduced ability to train RL on encoding correct responses (especially earlier in training, when the incremental RL has not ‘caught up’ yet), and thus worse performance overall. Thus, our behavioral and modeling results are not incongruous and simply highlight the importance of modeling as it allows us to identify the mechanisms that drive behavioral patterns with greater specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radulescu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Frank, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>Linking MRS measures, model parameters, and behavioral performance</title><p>Thus far, our results suggest that (1) there is a significant difference in performance between two age groups, and (2) that this difference is best explained by working memory deficit in older group (most significantly WM decay, and marginally reliance on WM in smaller set size condition). Next, we aimed to test how these age-related differences relate to metabolic changes affecting brain neurochemistry. We used MRS to measure neurotransmitters (glutamate and GABA) that support working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>) in regions important for both reinforcement learning (striatum [STR]) and working memory (middle frontal gyrus of prefrontal cortex [MFG], intraparietal sulcus [IPS]). To control for larger structural changes that may covary with differences in glutamate and GABA levels, we included gray volume, white matter volume and cortical thickness (in caudal middle frontal [CMF], superior frontal [SF], and rostral middle frontal [RMF]) cortex in our analyses and to control for nonspecific metabolic changes we included measures of N-acetylaspartate (NAA).</p><p>In order to understand how differences in performance and their computational mechanisms relate to the neural measures. we took a data-driven multistep analysis approach. First, we constructed a GLM to explain overall learning performance according to structural measures collected as part of our high-resolution anatomical MRI scans (white matter, gray matter, cortical thickness), as well as neurochemical measures from MRS (glutamate, GABA, NAA). Given the correlations in our neurochemical measures across brain regions, we attempted to maximize power to detect relationships in our initial linear model by aggregating neurochemical measures across brain regions. Specifically, we averaged the MRS measures across regions (i.e. average glutamate was the average of glutamate measures from medial frontal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, and striatum). Anatomical specificity of significant predictors was then examined in follow-up analyses. We set up a linear model predicting average learning performance using the following z-scored predictors: average GABA, glutamate, NAA, gray matter, white matter, and cortical thickness in caudal middle frontal (CMF), superior frontal (SF), and rostral middle frontal (RMF) areas (cortical thickness measure was not averaged across the three areas because these measures were selected a priori from a Freesurfer parcellation and are unrelated to the voxels; see ‘Methods’ for details). The best model identified through a regularized and cross-validated fitting procedure (see ‘Methods’) included the following predictors: GABA, glutamate, NAA, CMF cortical thickness, and SF cortical thickness (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf98"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.41</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf99"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>7.8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf100"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, variance inflation factors: [1.16, 2.06, 1.76, 2.71, 2.37]).

These predictions can be thought of as projections of behavioral learning performance onto the axis of brain measures most closely related to it. We then fit a linear model that regressed the brain-predicted performance onto an explanatory matrix that contained all parameter estimates from our behavioral model in order to determine which computational elements are most tightly linked to the neural fingerprint of performance (or performance failures).

The visualization of this depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> suggests that older adults have lower glutamate levels and higher decay, whereas inverse is true for younger adults. Since age was negatively correlated with glutamate and positively correlated with decay, there is a possibility that age alone could fully explain the correlation between glutamate and WM decay. To address this question, we (1) ran a model predicting WM decay using MFG glutamate and age, as well as age-by-MFG glutamate interaction, and (2) correlation between MFG glutamate and WM decay in the two age groups separately. The interaction was not significant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf175"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf176"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.69</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.48</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), and the main effects of glutamate and age were not significant when entered together in the model (age: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf177"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.14</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf178"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.24</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.21</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; glutamate: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf179"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.02</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf180"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.03</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), likely due to the fact that glutamate and age are correlated.

Finally, we used a formal mediation model to examine whether the relationship between age and working memory decay was weakened after accounting for glutamate.

Importantly, this result held even when simultaneously accounting for RL contributions to behavior, which have also been theorized to be impacted by cognitive aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank and Kong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>). As shown by examples of previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radulescu et al., 2019</xref>), it is important to consider the interactions between neurocognitive systems rather than studying them in isolation as this could lead to an incorrect attribution of observed behavioral patterns. Our behavioral modeling results are complementary to those of another recent study that leveraged varying delay between training and testing to examine contributions of working memory, and concluded that older adults engaged WM less than young adults during the short delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Vijver and Ligneul, 2020</xref>). Our results indicated that older adults had more rapid decay of task relevant working memories, but did not substantially reduce their deployment for selecting actions. Thus, across studies, there is converging evidence that working memory deficits in older adults can negatively impact decisions from experience, perhaps providing insight into why decisions from description are relatively spared by the cognitive aging process as such decisions do not typically require working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2015</xref>). However, our results imply that older adults did not compensate for their unreliable memory system by using working memory less, thereby increasing the impact of working memory deficits on behavior. Though our framework provided an ideal setup to disentangle contributions of learning and memory to decisions, one limitation of our task is that it does not provide any behavioral information about why working memory systems fail. For example, higher working memory decay in our model could reflect failures to appropriately prioritize storage of task-relevant information, including susceptibility to interference effects such as have previously been proposed to play a major role in cognitive aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amer et al., 2022</xref>), but could also be explained by a gradually increasing failure to retrieve previously stored information. Thus, although our computational approach was able to show that much of the age-related decision-making impairment previously attributed to learning is actually attributable to failures of working memory, we rely on future work to better understand the exact computational nature of those failures.</p><p>Our conclusion that age-related performance deficits were attributable to WM rather than RL is in conflict with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank and Kong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hämmerer et al., 2011</xref>) suggesting age-related impairment of RL systems. Previous work on aging and RL, however, has yielded mixed conclusions, with some results suggesting that RL is not impaired in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grogan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radulescu et al., 2016</xref>). Placing our study in the context of the existing literature, we believe that inconsistent results might have occurred due to a failure to separate and account for additional processes (WM, attention, etc.) that might contribute to performance deficits in older populations. This in particular reflects our motivation for conducting this study as quantifying contribution of cognitive processes to performance should not be studied in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radulescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radulescu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Frank, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 2018</xref>).</p><p>On the biological side, our results suggest that age-related differences in working memory, but no other age-related behavioral changes, were associated with reductions in levels of glutamate in prefrontal cortex. Previous work has noted structural changes in the aging brain, including reduced brain volume and specific reductions in gray matter in certain brain regions, including prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">West, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckner et al., 2004</xref>). While we did note some structural differences between younger and older participants, these structural changes were not related to decision-making, and instead the best neural predictions of task performance relied primarily on neurochemical levels, in particular, glutmate. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and in prefrontal cortex, is thought to support local recurrent signaling that supports the active maintenance of information in cortical neural networks. An enticing interpretation of these results is that our noninvasive MRS measures, which provide regional quantification of glutamate, may provide a readout of changes in the local synaptic architecture (e.g. decreased density of excitatory synapses) that play a causal role in the cognitive aging process.</p><p>Nonetheless, our study is limited in the support that it can provide for this idea. We found a relationship between glutamate and the working memory decay parameter that explained age-related differences in task performance. However, the bulk of this relationship was driven by the group differences in levels of glutamate and working memory decay, with only a trend-level correlation between the factors existing in the older adult group. Furthermore, formal mediation modeling was unable to confirm that glutamate mediates the observed relationships between age and working memory decay. There are several potential explanations for the remaining causal ambiguity, one being that our study was not particularly well powered to see within group relationships between biological variables and behavior (24 older participants with both brain and behavioral measurements), making the observed correlation in older adults (<italic>r</italic> = −0.39) difficult to interpret one way or the other. Mediation analysis typically requires very large samples to ensure reasonable power levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritz and Mackinnon, 2007</xref>) and has an additional obstacle in our case that we cannot measure our hypothesized mediating factor directly and instead rely on a noisy proxy measurement (MRS glutamate), potentially muddying the interpretation of mediation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westfall and Yarkoni, 2016</xref>). An alternative explanation would be that age really is the causal factor driving both metabolic changes in glutamate and, separately, cognitive declines in working memory that affect performance on learning tasks. While we are unable to conclusively arbitrate between these possibilities in this study, we hope that our results inspire future work with larger samples of older adults that can effectively do so.</p><p>Our study is also limited by the MRS methodology that we employed. A major limitation of MRS is that we are unable to verify that the age-related differences in glutamate that we measure are localized to synapses, or even to neurons. The chemical specificity of our findings lends some support to the idea that glutamate is playing a functional role rather than simply serving as one of many markers for the metabolic changes that occur over healthy aging, yet additional work leveraging animal models would be necessary to verify this idea and fully elucidate a causal mechanism. Beyond specificity, our MRS methodology limited the breadth of neurochemical measurements we could make. We did not measure levels of dopamine (DA), which is a critical biological marker of learning by reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), and could further inform our understanding of the age-related changes in neurochemistry, and its effect on cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäckman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, dopamine also might modulate WM in addition to RL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Reilly and Frank, 2006</xref>). Thus, the role of dopamine in RL-WM interaction in the aging population would be an interesting topic to explore in future research.</p><p>A third limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design. Specifically, we compared a group of young and older adults, without directly observing age-related changes within subjects (i.e. a longitudinal design). As such, the observed age group differences in performance could have been, in part, attributed to cohort effects (e.g. young adults being more comfortable with technology and computer games compared to old adults). Despite this theoretical limitation, several aspects of our data suggest that the differences we observed are related to age rather than other factors that differed across our young and older cohorts. First, we collected RBANS scores, which revealed that our two groups reflected similar samples of their age groups with respect to overall cognitive function. Second, task performance decreased with age within the older adult group rather than simply across the two groups.</p><p>To analyze our results, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical RL-WM model that captured qualitative trends in both training and testing performance as well as group differences. However, our model validation revealed that the RL-WM model predictions deviated from older participants’ data in set size 6 learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further inspection revealed that this occurred because in some set size 6 blocks some older participants learned a correct response for only a subset of stimuli, while entirely neglecting to learn correct responses for the remaining stimuli in the set. One interpretation is that older adults might have used this as a strategy to minimize the difficulty of the high set size condition (ignoring some stimuli to effectively make it a smaller set size), leading participants to deviate from our model, which learned from all stimuli. This interpretation was supported by model predictions for older adults who did not exhibit such selective learning, which displayed reduced model misfit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Thus, our hierarchical modeling not only captured core trends in behavior, but it also highlighted a previously undocumented discrepancy between RL-WM model predictions and learning behavior in specific individuals due to alternative strategies (e.g. neglecting stimuli). While we were unable to further characterize or quantify these strategies in our dataset, we hope that this observation inspires future work to design tasks better positioned to do so.</p><p>We have focused on testing healthy older adults in order to isolate the aging as dimension along which we tested the differences in RL and WM. In the future, it would also be valuable to examine these changes in clinical populations (e.g. individuals with mild cognitive impairment or individuals with Alzheimer’s disease/dementia). Testing how neural mechanisms in these neurodegenerative disorders relate to RL/WM would further expand our understanding of the underpinnings of dementia-related symptoms. Furthermore, recognizing the signs of specific impairments at different stage of dementia development could inform cognitive-training programs that have been used to mitigate/delay cognitive symptoms in these neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clare et al., 2003</xref>). One interesting related question is that of the dynamics of age-related differences, in particular as to whether the measured age-related neural/cognitive changes are gradual or characterized by a sudden onset at a critical time point in lifespan? Based on the absence of age-related correlation with performance in young adults and negative correlation with age within the old group, it seems that the relationship between age and cognitive functions might not be linear and instead begin to decline more rapidly at older ages. Future work employing longitudinal studies could address this question and potentially link nonlinear declines in neural and behavioral measures to protracted onset of age-related disease.</p><p>In summary, we show that age-related differences in the ability to make decisions from experience are reflected in the age group variability in working memory decay. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by changes in neurochemistry, most notably reductions in prefrontal glutamate levels, that map specifically onto computational markers for working memory impairment and tend to increase with age. These findings suggest that a major component of age-related differences in decision-making could result from old adults experiencing reductions in prefrontal excitatory signaling that impair working memory systems necessary to translate recent information into appropriate action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 78 participants in total (42 older adults – age mean [SD] = 68 [8.5]; 36 young adults, age mean [SD] = 21 [4.4]) for a two-session study. Older adults were recruited from the community. Young adults were recruited from the Brown University participant pool or from the community. Recruitment targeted young adults (18–30) and older adults (60–80); however, the inclusion criterion was broader and only required participants to be at least 18 y of age. Visual exclusion criteria for enrollment in the study included (1) direct report of color blindness or poor performance on Ishihara color plates, (2) a best-corrected visual acuity less than 20/40 in both eyes at distance or near, and (3) abnormalities in peripheral vision determined by confrontation visual field testing. Additional exclusion criteria related to the safety of MRI imaging excluded participants with contraindication to MRI including claustrophobia, pregnancy, or metal implants.</p><p>During the first session, all participants completed an RL-WM behavioral task as well as additional cognitive testing using the RBANS. We consider the RBANS to be a fitting choice for this as, to our knowledge, compared to alternative measures such as MMSE or dementia rating scale, the RBANS does not have ceiling effect issues and is designed to increase sensitivity to small cognitive differences. During the second session, participants underwent MRS and completed additional behavioral testing. Out of 36 young adults, 6 did not complete the MRS session; out of 42 old adults, 18 did not complete the MRS session. These participants were omitted from the analyses that linked behavioral/modeling data and neural measures. The two sessions were separated by a maximum of 7 d. Participants received monetary compensation for participating in the study. All participants provided a written informed consent prior to beginning the experiment. All procedures were approved by the Brown University Institutional Review Board under protocol #0812992595 (behavioral session) and #1203000583 (MRS session).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Task</title><p>A general format of reinforcement learning experiments assesses subjects’ engagement of the feedback-dependent learning process, which enables them to store rewarding stimulus–response associations. The RL-WM task employs the same logic, while simultaneously manipulating the working memory (WM) involvement by varying the number of stimulus–response associations participants are required to learn in a given block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Frank, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins and Frank, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the previous work, this manipulation yielded a way to disentangle the contribution of WM and RL to the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Master et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that WM is capacity limited and susceptible to decay, participants are more likely to have stored in working memory an informative stimulus–action association for a given trial when there are fewer items to store. Since WM enables fast, albeit short-lasting and limited, storage, we expected the accuracy to asymptote within very few trials – if the number of associations is within the capacity bounds. On the other hand, if the number of associations participants are required to store exceeds their WM capacity, they would be more likely need to use a more incremental but more robust system to make a choice (RL). Therefore, having two conditions (small and high set size) enabled us to dissociate the contribution of these two learning systems.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Learning phase</title><p>Before starting the actual task, participants received detailed task instructions and a brief practice phase. They were told that the goal of the experiment was to learn a correct key press in response to the given images in order to earn as many points as possible. We provided participants with trial examples during which they were presented with a stimulus on the screen – they had 1 s to press one of the three keys and were subsequently given a 1 s deterministic feedback. If they selected a correct response, participants received a point (+1); if they selected a wrong response key, they received 0 points. Participants advanced to the next trial following the feedback termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Points were translated to an incentive payment at the end of the study.</p><p>Participants learned in 10 independent blocks, 6 with small set size (three stimuli per block) and 4 with high set size (six stimuli per block), each block with a novel set of images. There were more small-set size blocks due to the fact that learning fewer stimulus–response associations provides a noisier assessment of the learning performance. In each block, each stimulus had a correct associated action that the participant needed to discover through trial and error (e.g. action 3 is correct for stimulus 1) and appeared nine times during the block. The stimulus order was pseudo-randomized to ensure a uniform distribution of delay between two successive presentations of the same stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins, 2018</xref>). We counterbalanced correct stimulus–response mappings across the blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Testing phase</title><p>After the training phase, participants completed an unrelated 20 min task (probabilistic selection task [PST]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2004</xref>) that was visually distinct from the RL-WM task and served to introduce an extended delay between training and the test phase. After completing the PST task, participants were again tested on their knowledge of the stimulus–response associations learned in the RL-WM training blocks. However, unlike in the training phase, feedback was omitted to prevent new learning. Therefore, participants could only be informed by feedback received at least 20 min prior to the test phase. Thus, compared to the learning phase where WM highly contributes to performance, the test phase reflects better isolated slow, long-term learning processes (RL). Specifically, due to (1) a 20 min delay and (2) omitted feedback, WM memory involvement in test phase is effectively eliminated since WM cannot be engaged in new learning (due to absence of feedback), and the time delay over which information stored in WM has decayed. Investigating test phase performance in comparison to learning phase performance allows us to see how learning within the RL process is impacted by the use of WM during learning. If our prediction is correct, we should observe a larger decrease from training to testing performance in set size 3 (which could be learned via WM) compared to set size 6 condition (that exceeds the WM capacity and is more likely to be learned via RL that is more robust across increased delay intervals). In our task (and model), we assume that the test phase performance is supported solely by RL in the absence of WM. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that it could also reflect the contribution of an alternative long-term storage system, such as episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bornstein and Norman, 2017</xref>), but this task is not designed to identify it.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Computational model</title><p>In order to understand the cognitive factors that drive age-related differences in behavior, we used a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM) model (RL-WM).

This Bayesian implementation is a novel extension of the RL-WM model, allowing for the inclusion of domain knowledge directly in the model (via carefully developed priors) and the incorporation of theoretically meaningful hierarchical structure. A hierarchical Bayesian approach to model fitting offers many benefits, including the ability to quantify the uncertainty in each parameter estimate and the regularization of extreme estimates with respect to the group (for an introduction, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We compared three versions of the Bayesian RL-WM model with different hierarchical structures. First, we defined a non-hierarchical model by specifying a prior for each unobserved parameter of the RL-WM model’s data-generating process (as described above). This would be equivalent to fitting the model separately to each participant’s data, were it not for our simplifying assumption that the same value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf232"><mml:msup><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mtext>L</mml:mtext></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> is used for all participants. Next, we considered a hierarchical extension of the model over participants, such that all <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf233"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> participants’ parameter values (e.g. all 78 learning rates, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf234"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">…</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) are assumed to be drawn from a group-level distribution (e.g. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf235"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Beta</mml:mtext><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo rspace="7.5pt" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∀</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). Finally, we considered a model with separate hierarchies over the participants within each age group. This version of the RL-WM includes different hyperparameters for each age group (e.g. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf236"><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mtext>young</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf237"><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mtext>young</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> vs. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf238"><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mtext>older</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf239"><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mtext>older</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>), which would allow us to make inferences about group-level differences in each dynamic of the RL-WM process.</p><p>For each version of the model, we specified priors for participant-level parameters and hyperpriors for group-level hyperparameters that were mildly to moderately informative. The priors and hyperpriors used to specify the winning two-group model are detailed in Appendix 1. Prior predictive checks and other simulation-based procedures were used to confirm that the set of prior distributions and the RL-WM model likelihood taken together specified a reasonable model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baribault and Collins, 2023</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Model fitting</title><p>For each of the three candidate models, we used Stan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 2017</xref>) to estimate the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. After running a model with four chains of 500 warmup iterations and 1500 kept iterations each, we performed a series of diagnostic checks in accordance with current best practices for MCMC methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vehtari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betancourt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gelman et al., 2013</xref>). We required an <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf240"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> value of ≤ 1.01 and an effective sample size of ≥ 400 for all parameters, a BFMI of ≥ 0.2 for all chains, and that no divergences were observed. Only kept iterations from model output that met these criteria were used for analysis.</p><p>We used the (widely applicable or Watanabe–Akaike information criterion [WAIC]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe, 2010</xref>) as our model comparison metric as it is fully Bayesian, invariant to parameterization, and straightforward to compute. Because response data from successive trials of the RL-WM task are not independent, we consider one block of data from one participant as the smallest unit of data when computing log likelihood for WAIC. As WAIC is an estimate of out-of-sample prediction error, lower WAIC values indicate a better model. Our final model selection was further supported by posterior predictive checks of the models’ relative descriptive adequacy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). In the model-based analyses reported here, all intervals are 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrI) unless otherwise specified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MRS procedure</title><p>Glutamate and GABA levels were measured in three brain regions (striatum [STR], middle frontal gyrus [MFG], and intraparietal sulcus [IPS]) using MRS. First, structural images of the participant brain were acquired using a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence (MPRAGE, TR/TE/TI = 1900/3.02/900ms, 9° flip angle, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel resolution) with a 64-channel RF receive coil array on a 3T MRI scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma). Next, we manually placed voxel bounding boxes in each brain region for MRS data acquisitions. The striatal voxel was 18 × 24 × 15 mm and was placed such that the anterior portion of the voxel started at the anterior extreme of the head of the caudate and that it extended posterior to maximize the inclusion of caudate and putamen and minimize inclusion of ventricular space. A 20 mm cubic voxel was placed in the right MFG immediately anterior to the precentral sulcus and immediately inferior to the superior frontal sulcus. A 20 mm cubic voxel was placed to be centered at the anterior-ventral section of the left IPS. Representative images of voxel placements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>For each voxel, we acquired measures of GABA using a MEGA-PRESS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2013</xref>) (TR = 1500 ms, TE = 68 ms, average = 192) with double-banded pulses, which were used to simultaneously suppress water signal and edit the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf241"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-CH2 resonance of GABA at 3 ppm. Linear and second-order shimming was used to achieve typical linewidth (∼14 Hz). Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the signals obtained from the selective double-banded pulse applied at 1.9 and 4.7 ppm (’Edit on’) from those obtained from the double-banded pulse applied at 4.7 and 7.5 ppm (’Edit off’). Glutamate scans were conducted using the PRESS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hancu, 2009</xref>) (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 30 ms, 90° flip angle, average = 64). A variable pulse power and optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR) technique was used in both sequences to achieve water suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tkác et al., 1999</xref>). While MRS data were collected, participants completed a simple task that required them to push a button whenever a fixation point changed color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibata et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Glutamate was quantified using LC-model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Provencher, 2001</xref>) that attempts to fit the average signal in the frequency domain using a linear combination of basis functions. Separate basis functions were used to quantify glutamate and glutamine, a molecule that has similar spectral characteristics to glutamate in the PRESS sequence. The reliability of glutamate quantifications was indicated by the Cramer–Rao lower bounds, and a criterion of 20% was chosen to reject low-quality signal; however, no measurements were rejected due to this criterion.</p><p>GABA was quantified using a custom peak integration process implemented in MATLAB. This quantification procedure was used because it produced higher split half reliability on our dataset than standard GABA quantification software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edden et al., 2014</xref>). Raw data were obtained from the Siemens Prisma scanner in the form of the so-called ‘twix’ file that contains the (complex) individual signals from each receive channel for every average. Signals underwent phase shifting to equalize the starting phase of all of the receive channel signals prior to combining for each signal average. Signals were combined using weighting factors based on individual signal amplitudes. Starting with the highest amplitude signal, channels were added until there was no further increase in NAA peak SNR. Free induction decays were averaged separately for ‘off’ and ‘on’ pulse conditions and subtracted to produce a difference signal. The difference signal was transformed into frequency space with a fast Fourier transform and frequencies were converted to parts per million, where 1 PPM is equal to 123.255 MHz, and relative to a water reference of 4.8 PPM. The GABA peak was quantified by integrating chemical shifts ranging from 2.9 to 3.1 ppm and subtracting out the integrated signal in a surrounding reference window (2.8–2.9, 3.1–3.2 ppm). This procedure was validated through split half correlations in which the entire procedure was performed separately for odd and even acquisition volumes, and resulting GABA measurements for odd and even acquisitions were correlated with one another to yield relatively high reliability for MFG and IPS measures (<italic>R</italic> = 0.80 for both regions) and moderate reliability for striatal GABA measures (<italic>R</italic> = 0.68; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Freesurfer 6.0 was used to reconstruct T1 anatomical scans from DICOM images collected using the MPRAGE sequence following the recon-all -all pipeline. The initial pial surface outputs were manually corrected for brainmasks that included skull tissues as described in the Freesurfer quality control documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://freesurfer.net/fswiki">https://freesurfer.net/fswiki</ext-link>). Next, partial volume fractions for gray matter (cortex + subcortical), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were computed as voxel maps using the mri_compute_volume_fractions Freesurfer command based on the edited T1 reconstruction. Then, masks for the three brain regions (striatum, MFG, and IPS) measured with MRS were constructed using the Gannet 2.1 toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edden et al., 2014</xref>) based on the voxel bounding boxes manually placed during the MRS acquisition. Gray/white matter volumes in each region were computed by summing partial volume voxel maps with masking. Similarly, anatomical measures within each region were obtained by summing tissue maps with masking using the mri_segstats Freesurfer command on labelled parcellation of the cortex using the Desikan–Killiany atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>) and automatic segmentation of the subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischl et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>To visualize participants’ learning trajectory, we created learning curves by collapsing participants’ accuracy at each stimulus iteration. This enabled us to separate early learning and asymptotic performance (late learning accuracy). Trials with missing responses (i.e. where participants did not respond within the time limit) were excluded from analyses.</p><p>While learning curves are useful for visualizing learning trajectory, they cannot be used to make inferences about trial-by-trial contribution of different factors (i.e. related to RL or WM) to participants’ accuracy. Thus, to quantify performance in terms of factors related to RL and WM, we ran a trial-by-trial analysis using a mixed-effects general linear model (GLM), predicting accuracy (coded as 0 or 1 on each trial). Specifically, the predictors in the logistic regression consisted of the following: set size (the number of associations), delay (number of intermediate trials between two successive rewarded stimulus representations), and reward history (stimulus-dependent cumulative reward history). We also added trial and block number predictors to control for overall improvement across the task. We used participants’ coefficients to predict their respective age using a linear model in order to draw a relationship between age and RL and WM-related factors’ effect on performance. We excluded coefficients from two participants as these coefficients were over 2 SD above the mean following the approach implemented in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Master et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data-driven approach to identifying best MRS predictors</title><p>To examine the effect of brain measures on the parameters and task performance, we first had to reduce the dimensionality of highly correlated MRS data by identifying the best set of MRS predictors in explaining participants’ learning performance. We focused on learning performance because unlike the test phase the learning phase contains signatures of both WM and RL (see ‘Task description).</p><p>First, we averaged all measures that were sampled from multiple regions across those regions (e.g. glutamate predictor in the model was an average of glutamate measures across three regions it was sampled from). The only measure that was not averaged was cortical thickness (from CMF, RMF and, SF) because these three regions were selected a priori from a Freesurfer parcellation (see ‘MRS methods’) and are unrelated to the voxels. We averaged the predictors in order to reduce the number of predictors in the model in a meaningful way (e.g. instead of three different glutamate features we would have only one) and because our power would have suffered massively due to collinearity in our predictors. As a result, we used the following features to construct a GLM: gray matter, white matter, and cortical thickness in SF, CMF, and RMF cortex (structural measures), glutamate, GABA, and NAA (neurochemical measures). Next, we implemented a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf242"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-fold cross-validation approach (a commonly used method in machine learning) to identify the best configuration of predictors that minimizes the loss (mean squared error) in out-of-sample prediction. Specifically, we randomly sampled 4/5 of the data to train the model, leaving out the remaining 1/5 of the data for validation, and repeated this process 200 times. On each of the 200 iterations, we stored the best configuration of predictors that minimized the loss of the model’s prediction of the out-of-sample performance. We also added the regularization term, which represented a combination of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf243"><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf244"><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> penalty (i.e. elastic net; with alpha = 0.5 such that ridge (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf245"><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) and lasso (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf246"><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) optimization are weighted equally; regularization coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf247"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was set to default – lasso sets the maximum value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf248"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> that gives a non-null model) to help us eliminate the predictors that did not significantly contribute to performance and might lead to overfitting. We reasoned that this data-driven approach was a principled way of analyzing highly colinear measures that would allow us to reduce the dimensionality of our data as well as the number of hypothesis tests required to draw conclusions. After our machine learning model comparison, we fit our winning neural model using a standard regression and performed significance testing on individual beta estimates to identify the neural measures that were significantly associated with training performance within the best model.</p><p>Once we obtained the best set of features based on the cross-validation approach, we used this model to generate the brain-based performance prediction. The brain-based predicted performance represented a mapping between neural measures and behavior – that is to say, based on our brain measures, what level of training performance might be expected? Next, we regressed brain-based performance predictions onto the fit parameters from our RL-WM model in order to test which parameters were most closely related to the dimension of performance that we could identify using neural measures. This step also allowed us to measure the relationships between model parameters (i.e. decay, learning rate) and the brain-based performance predictions while controlling for all other model parameters, thereby improving the specificity with which we could map neural correlates of performance onto specific computational processes. Significance testing was performed to identify which parameters were associated with brain-based performance measures.</p><p>Follow-up analyses were conducted on neural measures with significant associations to performance and model parameters with significant associations with brain-based performance predictions. Each model parameter with a significant relationship was regressed onto anatomically specific neurochemical measures that were significantly associated with performance. In practice, this follow-up analysis was only applied to the decay and set size 3 WM weight parameters, which were regressed onto glutamate concentrations in MFG, IPS, and STR.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants provided a written informed consent prior to beginning the experiment.

Thus, while we were unable to reject the null hypothesis (that glutamate does not mediate the effects of age on working memory), we are also not confident in our ability to rule out a causal mediation effect.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85243.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gillan</surname><given-names>Claire M</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02tyrky19</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Ireland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" object-id-type="id" object-id="10.1101/2022.11.28.518237" link-type="continued-by" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.28.518237"/></front-stub><body><p>This important study combines behavior, computational modelling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a cross-sectional design to address the question of whether age-related differences in learning are driven by changes in working memory decay or deficiencies in the reinforcement learning (RL) system.

We believe that this is largely a semantics issue, and we fully agree that we should make our wording more clear. The confusion pertaining to our claims of WM explaining performance deficits may arise because the term “RL” (confusingly) refers to three different concepts: (1) the RL task/behavior, (2) the RL process component of the model, and (3) the neural RL mechanism. Our task is what the literature calls an RL task (participants learn correct stimulus-action associations from rewards), with an added manipulation targeted at revealing WM. We observe a deficit in behavior in older adults, the “RL” deficit, where RL refers to “behavior in an RL task”. Our model separates two processes, RL and WM, that simultaneously contribute to the task behavior. This allows us to determine if the observed patterns of behavior in the RL task should indeed be attributed to an RL process, or to an alternative process (WM; Collins and Frank, 2012). We observe an impairment in the WM process primarily, such that we can conclude that WM memory deficits (not RL process deficits) underlie the RL behavior deficit. We believe that there is a distinction between RL behavior (learning from rewards), and what RL means in the context of our model. Specifically, the RL algorithm means to capture incremental learning that is not capacity limited, analogous the RL thought to be implemented by dopaminergic processes in the brain. Therefore, while on the surface level the deficit in behavior may appear as RL-driven (e.g. slower learning from rewards), there may <italic>not</italic> be an impairment in the underlying RL algorithm and its neural basis, as indicated by our model We have adjusted the language in the paper to make these points more clear, and to reflect the suggestions of the reviewers.</p><p>We agree that we cannot make broader claims regarding all types of RL behavior, as different RL tasks may recruit different underlying processes, including RL and WM. Indeed, our recent work (Eckstein et al., 2022) shows limited generalizability across RL tasks. We now include this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A mediation analysis is desirable to strengthen the contention that glutamate changes are responsible for WM deficits in older adults.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestion. We have understood from 2 reviewers that two different kinds of mediation approaches would be of interest. First would apply to running a mediation analysis including WM decay, age, and glutamate with the goal of testing how much of the effect of age on WM performance is mediated by glutamate (suggested by Reviewer 1). Second, we would consider how much glutamate mediates WM effects on performance (suggested by Reviewer 2).</p><p>In response to the first question, we have run the mediation analysis looking at whether the effect of age on WM decay is mediated by glutamate. We found that the average direct effect (ADE), which is a direct effect of age on WM decay, accounting for the indirect effect of glutamate was significant (ADE = 0.063, p = &lt;2e-16; ADE is equal to the β<sub>1</sub> coefficient from the following model: decay = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>Age + β<sub>2</sub>Glutamate). The average causal mediation effect (ACME), was not significant (ACME = 0.009, p = 0.28), with proportion mediated estimated at.13. ACME is equal to the product of coefficients β<sub>1a</sub> and β<sub>2b</sub> from the following 2 models:</p><p>Glutamate = β<sub>0a</sub> + β<sub>1a</sub> Age and Decay = β<sub>0b</sub> + β<sub>1b</sub>Age + β<sub>2b</sub>Glutamate; both coefficients are negative because age is inversely correlated with glutamate, and decay is inversely correlated with glutamate, thus providing a positive ACME. One possible conclusion from our failure to reject the null hypothesis is that age can lead to a global deterioration of the brain, that is in part reflected in the age-related glutamate difference, and that subsequently impacts WM mechanisms. However, this interpretation is muddied by the fact that mediation analyses, like other tests that involve statistically controlling for variables, are critically sensitive to the measurement noise on those variables (Westfall and Yarkoni). In our case, we have accurate measures of age, but are relying on indirect measures of glutamate that involve considerable noise. This concern is further amplified by general power considerations for mediation analyses (Fritz and MacKinnon, 2010). Thus, while we were unable to reject the null hypothesis (that glutamate does not mediate the effects of age on working memory) we are also not confident in our ability to rule out a causal mediation effect. With these things in mind, we have now included these results in our paper, along with the interpretation above and our concerns with that interpretation.We have also gone back to carefully change language in places where our previous manuscript implied a mediation effect. It is noteworthy that an alternative version of this mediation model where age is used as a mediator would violate the core assumption of mediation analysis – the sequential nature of the relationship between predictor, mediator and the outcome (X -&gt; M -&gt; Y; Cole and Maxwell, 2003), because age precedes both glutamate and WM decay (M -&gt; X and M -&gt; Y) and thus would not be appropriate. We include this information because we were not exactly sure what mediation analysis was requested and it is possible that this is the model that the reviewer was looking for.</p><p>In response to the second suggestion, we have run a second mediation model that tests whether/how much glutamate mediates the effect of WM on performance. We have entered WM as a predictor, glutamate as mediator in a model predicting average task performance. The results show that ADE (effect of WM on performance while controlling for effect of glutamate) was significant (ADE = -.014, p &lt;2e-16). ACME (product of β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> coefficients from following 2 models: Glutamate = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>WMdecay and performance = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>WMdecay + β<sub>2</sub>Glutamate) was also significant (ACME = -.01, p = .008), with proportion mediated estimated at.19. This suggests that glutamate mediates the effect of WM memory decay on performance.</p><p>However, we would like to note an issue with this analysis: WM decay is estimated from task performance – thus, WM decay and task performance share signal as well as noise. We repeated the mediation analysis, but substituted WM decay with participants’ immediate memory score from RBANS battery, in order to use a RL-WM task and model independent index of WM. However, this analysis approach was limited by the fact that the working memory measures extracted from the RBANS were not tightly linked to task behavior. In this model, ADE and ACME were both not significant (ADE = 2.09e-02, p = .06; ACME = -5.93e-05, p=.96). We also ran a mediation analysis with total RBANS score instead of immediate memory, as previous work showed correlation between WM and total RBANs score (Gold et al.,1999). But again, neither ADE or ACME from this mediation were significantly different from zero (ADE = .005, p = .70; ACME = .01, p=.14). Note that immediate memory and total score from RBANS likely capture WM aspects such as capacity more than WM decay (which highlights the utility of computational modeling for specific effects), which could explain the absence of direct effect of these metrics on performance, even when mediator is not included.</p><p>Again, it is worth highlighting the power limitation of our data; mediation analysis requires a considerable sample size to achieve adequate power (Fritz and MacKinnon, 2010), with reliable mediation results requiring well over hundred participants. Therefore, the conclusions we can draw from our mediation results are limited. Nonetheless, we have now included the discussion of the age-related mediation approach in Appendix 1, results and discussion, because we have strong concerns with the two versions of the mediation that test whether glutamate mediates WM effect on performance(in version 1, because performance was used to attain WM measures, in version 2, because there was no direct effect of WM measures on performance to mediate).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All reviewers queried the strength of the evidence for a working memory deficit – there was a change in decay but not deployment – can the authors support the interpretation of this as a deficit in efficient deployment of WM?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We think of working memory as a multifaceted cognitive function, that is defined by multiple components – resource or capacity (e.g. how much information/ how many items can be stored in WM), decay of information held in WM, deployment of WM in service of the task, etc. As such, WM impairment need not be global some components of WM may be impaired while others remain intact. In our case, the deployment of WM was preserved, while decay was larger in older adults. We now further elaborate on this on lines 351-353 in the Discussion section. We also acknowledge that the title of our manuscript may have contributed to this confusion (implying impairment in deployment WM, while results reveal intact deployment and impaired decay), and we propose changing the title of the manuscript to “Age-related differences in prefrontal glutamate are associated with increased working memory decay that gives appearance of learning deficits”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>With respect to the computational modeling results, it would be helpful to explain to the reader (and me) a bit more about how the older adults can have faster decay of memory but it does not influence the trade-off with RL (ω parameter). Is that interpreted as – given their poorer memory / faster decay, they weight 'what they have' just as well as others. And if the model did not feature a decay (or fixed it), one would presume a difference in the weight would then be apparent. Is this the correct way to think about that result?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. As mentioned in the response to essential revisions, our model formalizes WM as a multifaceted process defined by multiple parameters (here decay and WM-reliance parameter). It is plausible for some aspects of WM to be impaired (in this case decay), white others remain intact. Your interpretation is correct – if we excluded WM decay from the model (or fixed it), then indeed the group difference might shift to other WM parameters (or may be absorbed by RL parameters). However, we have confirmed that WM decay and WM weight are separable using model parameter recovery (see figure below; we have now included it in Appendix 1).</p><p>Furthermore, we showed that by fixing WM decay in the old adults group (by setting it to the mean decay of the young adults group) and simulating synthetic datasets we can fix the observed performance deficit (see Appendix 1 – Figure 5). Put another way, the impaired performance of older adults in the task was best fit by considering them to use a less reliable working memory system, but relying on it to a similar degree as the younger adults. We have now tried to make this point clear in our results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It appears to be a limitation that older adults were from the community while younger adults were from the Brown University participant pool. I understand the RBANs was taken, but absent major cognitive decline this is a coarse instrument (i.e. has ceiling effects in healthy samples).

To our knowledge, RBANS is extensively used to evaluate individuals with normal cognition (Cooley et al., 2015; Duff and Ramezani, 2015; Thaler et al., 2015), and is not known to have ceiling effect issues, which is more common in measures such as MMSE or MoCA on which cognitively healthy individuals tend to perform at near ceiling. The RBANS was designed to increase sensitivity to small cognitive differences. The RBANS total score, which we compared across groups, is highly correlated with IQ (R=0.77, Gold et al., 1999). Age normalized RBANS data from our participants show no signs of ceiling level performance, indeed the distributions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, indicate a relatively normal distribution and no clear differences across groups. Thus, while we do not deny that cohort differences exist across our groups, we do not believe that our cohorts reflect different population samples in terms of overall cognitive ability.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85243-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section where the best fitting model is used to generate brain based predictions of performance was a bit hard to follow.

We focused on identifying <italic>the best model</italic> that included neural measures to predict behavioral performance; the model with glutamate and additional factors generated better out of sample predictions than the model that only contained glutamate – thus we generated the performance predictions based on this full model. Once we had identified the best predictive model, we then examined which predictors were significantly different from zero within the model, and found that this was only the case for glutamate. Put simply, we first identified the best model, then looked to see what factors in that model were doing the heavy lifting, and identified glutamate. We then focused on glutamate alone to explore the anatomical specificity of the relationship between glutamate and model parameters. For completeness, we now also have run a model predicting WM decay with the set of all predictors from the best model, and found that none of the predictors related to WM when controlling for glutamate (GABA t = -.60, p = .55; NAA t = – 0.94, p = .34; CMF cortical thickness t = -0.90, p = 0.37; SF cortical thickness t = -.78, p = .43).

The interaction was not significant (β = -.01,t = .69, p=.48). We found that glutamate did not correlate with WM decay in young adults (r=.11, p = .54), but there was a trending correlation between glutamate and WM decay in older adults (r = -.36, p = .08). While our inability to detect a significant interaction might be in part driven by the limited sample size, we consider that inverse correlation between glutamate and WM decay across the sample, along with trending negative correlation between glutamate and decay within old adults suggest that prefrontal glutamate levels are lower in older adults group relative to young adults group, and thus contribute to age-related differences in working memory that may account for observed learning impairments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The paper could benefit from a better description of the rationale for how RL versus WM contributions to learning are disentagled. The statements about the interpretation of set size difference Mentioned in the public review seem surprising in light of their little role in the papers conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now included more detailed comments on how the model helps us disentangle RL and WM in the Computational model part of the methods section. With regards to your comment about the set size difference and how it relates to our results that indicate the difference in WM, as stated in the earlier response: higher set size assumes increased delay between successive presentations of the same stimuli. Longer delays, in turn, make WM forgetting more pronounced. Therefore, the modeling results are not necessarily inconsistent with the greater age group difference in set size 6 condition compared to set size 3 condition. This simply underscores the importance of modeling, as it allows us to identify the mechanisms that drive behavioral patterns with greater specificity. Furthermore, we simulated data from parameters estimated for older adults, with one key difference – WM decay was set to the group mean value of the younger adult group. The simulated performance shows that fixing WM decay to a smaller value in older adults rescues performance – primarily in the set size 6 condition (See Results section and Appendix 1 – Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1a. The authors do not statistically test the age-by-condition difference, which would be important to know. Judging from the plots, age differences in learning performance by condition seem biggest in the set size 6 condition, suggesting that in fact gradual RL computations are impaired quite markedly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested for group difference in set size, (2-sample t-test set size 3: t(76) = 4.71, p = 1.05e-05 ; 2-sample t-test set size 6: t(76) = 7.03, p = 7.61e-10 – see the Results section). Furthermore, we tested the age effect on the difference between set size conditions, which also showed that the difference between set size 6 and set size 3 performance is greater in old adults (t(76) = 4.12, p = 9.55e-05), which also supports the reviewer’s interpretation that age difference in learning performance by condition are bigger in set size 6. This, however, does not necessarily mean that RL computations are more impaired in the older adults group, even though on the surface it may appear to be the case (hence the need for computational modeling). As stated in the response to the previous point, fixing WM decay in old adults by setting it to the group mean value of younger adults (thus effectively reducing WM decay) for each older adult participant rescues their performance in set size 6 condition (see results lines 235-240 and also Appendix 1 – Figure 5). Thus, while aging impairments were numerically larger in the large set size condition where RL typically has a larger role, they were best explained computationally by a working memory impairment, and “fixing” this impairment was sufficient to rescue large set size task performance in our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The rationale for emphasising the difference between learning and test performance was unclear too me. Doesn't the 20 min delay between learning and test suggest that what we see there is related to LTM consolidation, rather than WM capacity? In addition, the set size 3 vs 6 condition difference by age was marginal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. First, in regards to the second point, the reviewer is correct that WM cannot support performance in the test phase, where no new information is provided (no feedback), and past information is too far in the past (delayed by the irrelevant task participants perform between learning and testing). We hypothesize that the test phase reflects stimulus-action associations encoded in a long-term fashion by the brain’s RL system; however, it is possible that other forms of long-term storage of information (such as episodic memory) also play a role (Bornstein and Norman,2017). We address this in the task section of the methods.</p><p>In regards to the rationale for the test phase: As explained above, compared to the learning phase where WM highly contributes to performance, the test phase reflects better isolated slow, long-term learning processes. Investigating test phase performance in comparison to learning phase performance allows us to see how learning within the RL process is impacted by use of WM during learning. We replicate the previous finding that using WM during learning speeds up learning at the cost of decreasing long term retention in RL, showing an interaction between the two learning processes. We agree that this interaction effect is not significantly different between age groups, and consequently we do not conclude that the WM impacts learning within the RL processes differently. We have now clarified these points in the methods and referenced previous work that has gone into greater detail with respect to set size and test phase manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The statical approaches could be better explained and motivated. It was unsure why the analysis of model parameters didn't include p values or test statistics. Likewise, the motivation behind the analysis that investigates the factors that relate to the brain/MRS predicted task performance was unclear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have not reported p-values or other frequentist statistics in model-based analysis, because we have relied on a Bayesian approach to estimate the differences in parameters between age groups. In Bayesian statistics, using p-values as measures of evidence is not recommended (Kruschke, 2014); therefore, we used credible intervals instead. As is common in the Bayesian cognitive modeling literature, we interpret credible intervals that exclude 0 as support for a conclusion that the estimated difference in parameter values is not zero.</p><p>With regards to our data-driven approach in linking MRS measures to model parameters and behavior, we outline each step and the motivation behind each step below. The main motivation for implementing this approach was to reduce the dimensionality of our highly-correlated data, as well as the number of statistical tests we’d otherwise need to perform for different measures/model parameters. A more detailed description is now included in the methods section, as well as the relevant Results section.</p><p>Step 1: Average measures across regions, for all measures that were sampled from multiple regions (Motivation: reduce the number of features in a meaningful way – e.g. glutamate is an average of only glutamate measures from all the areas glutamate measures were sampled from).</p><p>Step 2: Implement cross-validated model selection (Motivation: cross-validation is a commonly used method in machine learning, used to select a model with features that maximizes accuracy of out-of-sample predictions, and model selection allows us to narrow brain measures to only those that can contribute usefully to behavioral predictions).</p><p>Step 3: Generate performance predictions based on the set of features from the best model from Step 2, and then regress model parameters onto this prediction (Motivation: the prediction represents the projection of brain measures onto a single learning behavior and the alternative approach of correlating <italic>each</italic> brain measure with performance would increase the number of tests, and thus our expected rate of false positives)</p><p>Step 4: Identify which parameters within “best” model of behavior take values that differ significantly from zero (Motivation: identify most promising parameters to avoid running multiple tests for all parameters, even those explaining a small amount of variance; this also allowed us to estimate the effect of each parameter in predicting the brain-generated performance prediction, while controlling for other parameters).</p><p>Step 5: Identify the significant brain measure predictor from, and explore how anatomically specific measures relate to model parameters from Step 4 (Motivation: once we have narrowed down the explanatory brain measures and model parameters, we can explore the anatomical and computational specificity of the observed relationships).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The task could be described in a bit more detail, in particular the test phase. The fact that this is only binary feedback rather than a</p></disp-quote><p>It seems like the reviewer’s comment was cut here. In case the reviewer was asking about the difference between binary feedback and a random number of points as feedback we have now clarified this in the paper. In response to the first point, we have reviewed and extended the test phase task description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Does the fitting of β on the group level disadvantage one of the age groups? Or was this done separately for each group?</p></disp-quote><p>The latter is correct. Our model specification included two separate learning phase β parameters, one for the young age group and one for the older age group. (Estimates are shown in the second to last panel of Figure 2C.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Which regressors were part of which model in the MRS analysis remained unclear. I was wondering in particular about issues of collinearity, which can impact the ability to interpret the β coefficients (which the paper relies on, rather then the model comparisons)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have now modified the Results section to list regressors for each of the models we ran in MRS analysis in a more clear way. To address the collinearity concern, the cross-validation approach in which we first averaged each measure across the regions they were sampled from was implemented with an intent of reducing the number of collinear measures. To demonstrate this, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> we report the variance inflation factors (VIF, which quantifies how much the variance of estimated coefficients is inflated due to collinearity , with large VIFs indicating increased inflation/collinearity) for the set of predictors prior to passing them through the cross validation pipeline (each has 3 areas, all were included for the purpose of computing variance factors) :</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">IPS</th><th valign="bottom">MFG</th><th valign="bottom">STR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GABA</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.82</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.57</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.43</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Glutamate</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4.60</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3.24</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.50</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">NAA</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4.53</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.85</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2.07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gray matter</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12.70</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20.78</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">28.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">White matter</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10.27</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">17.11</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">28.98</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">CMF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RMF</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortical thickness</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3.98</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4.01</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5.44</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>As we can see, the VIFs for predictors are very high. Thus, if we had simply put all of our biological variables into a single behavioral regression, our power would have suffered massively due to collinearity in our predictors.

In the section investigating the relation between age, WM decay and glutamate, it be useful to see how strong the relation between glutamate and WM is after age has been factored out.</p></disp-quote><p>We have run the model that includes an interaction (WM decay ~ 1 + MFG glutamate * Age), and did not find a significant interaction (interaction β = -.01, p = .48; likely in part due to sample size limitation). Furthermore, the main effects of MFG glutamate and age are also not significant when entered in the same model (MFG Glutamate β = -.02, p = .30, Age β = .14, p = . 21) because age and glutamate are correlated (r=-.59,p=2.93e-06).
