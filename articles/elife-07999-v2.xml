Here we used stable isotope labeling and isotopomer analysis to trace sterol flux through the two pathways in mice. Surprisingly, no tissue used the canonical K–R pathway. Rather, a hybrid pathway was identified that we call the modified K–R (MK–R) pathway. Proportional flux through the Bloch pathway varied from 8% in preputial gland to 97% in testes, and the tissue-specificity observed in vivo was retained in cultured cells. The distribution of sterol isotopomers in plasma mirrored that of liver. Sterol depletion in cultured cells increased flux through the Bloch pathway, whereas overexpression of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) enhanced usage of the MK–R pathway. Thus, relative use of the Bloch and MK–R pathways is highly variable, tissue-specific, flux dependent, and epigenetically fixed. Maintenance of two interdigitated pathways permits production of diverse bioactive sterols that can be regulated independently of cholesterol.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07999.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07999.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07999.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cholesterol is important for animals, both as an essential component of the membrane that surrounds cells and as a building block to make hormones and other biologically important molecules. However, cells limit how much cholesterol they make because an excess of this fatty molecule can cause serious health problems, including heart disease and stroke.</p><p>Cholesterol is made via a complex process that involves more than 30 different steps, which can be organized into two biochemical pathways (named the Bloch pathway and the Kandutsch–Russell pathway). The enzymes that carry out the steps in these pathways have been characterized in detail. Less is known about which of the two pathways is actually used in different cells and tissues, or how much cholesterol each pathway produces. This is partly because it is difficult to distinguish between the closely related intermediate molecules that are formed in each pathway.</p><p>Mitsche et al. have now used mass spectrometry and isotope labeling techniques to analyze the relative contributions of the two cholesterol-making pathways in both cells grown in the laboratory and in mice. The experiments show that many cells use the Bloch pathway. However, no cells were found to use the Kandutsch–Russell pathway as it was originally described. Rather, some of the cells used a hybrid pathway where the production of cholesterol was started using the Bloch pathway and then after a certain number of steps, the process switched to using part of the Kandutsch–Russell pathway. Mitsche et al. referred to this mixed system as the ‘modified Kandutsch–Russell pathway’.</p><p>Mitsche et al. next examined the flow of molecules through these two pathways in different tissues and observed that the Bloch pathway is exclusively used in the testes and adrenal glands, which produce high levels of cholesterol. In contrast, the skin and brain use the modified Kandutsch–Russell pathway. In some tissues, a fraction of the building blocks that can be used to make cholesterol were instead diverted to make other products. This suggests that animals have maintained the two pathways over the course of evolution to enable them to generate a variety of products, which can be used to carry out different biological processes. One challenge following this work will be to use the newly developed methods to analyze other complex biochemical pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07999.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07999.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>isotopomer</kwd><kwd>deuterium</kwd><kwd>stable isotope</kwd><kwd>cholesterol metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37HL72304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitsche</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Jeffrey G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jonathan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 HL20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitsche</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Jeffrey G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jonathan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01GM109317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitsche</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobbs</surname><given-names>Helen H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Clayton Foundation for Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Jeffrey G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells use two interdigitated biosynthetic pathways that can be regulated independently to produce diverse bioactive sterols.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential structural component of vertebrate cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maxfield and Tabas, 2005</xref>) and a precursor of vital end products such as bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Russell, 2009</xref>) and steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sih and Whitlock, 1968</xref>). First identified as a crystalline component of gallstones more than 200 years ago, cholesterol consists of a rigid, planar tetracyclic nucleus and a flexible, iso-octyl side-chain at carbon 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nes, 2011</xref>). The molecule is synthesized entirely from acetate through a complex series of over 30 enzymatic reactions that are clustered into four major processes: condensation of acetate to isoprene, polymerization of isoprene to squalene, cyclization of squalene to lanosterol, and finally the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07999.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the Bloch and Kandutsch–Russell (K–R) pathways for the enzymatic conversion of squalene to cholesterol.</title><p>The Bloch pathway, indicated by solid black arrows, is shown on the left.

The two pathways use the same catalytic steps and are distinguished by the stage at which the double bond at C24 in the side chain is reduced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al. (1965)</xref> proposed that reduction of the double bond in the side chain (Δ24) is the last reaction in the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, black arrows). Thus, in the Bloch pathway, cholesterol synthesis proceeds via a series of side-chain unsaturated intermediates to desmosterol, which is reduced by DHCR24 to cholesterol. Subsequently, Kandutsch and Russell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kandutsch and Russell, 1960a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">1960b</xref>) reported that the preputial glands of mice synthesized dihydrolanosterol and other side-chain saturated intermediates that were different from those in the Bloch pathway. They proposed an alternative pathway, the Kandutsch–Russell (K–R) pathway, in which the Δ24 bond of lanosterol is reduced and the conversion of dihydrolanosterol to cholesterol proceeds via 7-dehydrocholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, red arrows) using the same enzymes as the Bloch pathway. Later studies showed the presence of saturated side chain intermediates in brain, skin, and eventually in all tissues examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schroepfer, 1982</xref>). The catalytic mechanisms and regulation of the enzymes that catalyze the Bloch and K–R pathways have been extensively investigated but much less is known about their relative use and physiological significance. Cholesterol biosynthesis is usually measured using radioisotope methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dietschy and Spady, 1984</xref>) that are highly sensitive but do not provide information about the turnover of intermediate sterols in the biosynthetic pathway. Flux through the Bloch and K–R pathways has not been systematically studied in cultured cells or in vivo. Therefore, the relative use of the two pathways and their responses to changes in cholesterol availability are not known. The reason why both pathways have been maintained is also not known. The biosynthetic intermediates of the two pathways have powerful, but distinct, effects on cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lange et al., 2008</xref>), fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spann et al., 2012</xref>), and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spann et al., 2012</xref>). Varying the concentrations of specific cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates by differential use of the Bloch and K–R pathways may thus contribute to regulation of diverse cellular processes.</p><p>The analytical challenges associated with distinguishing the multiple closely related sterol intermediates in each pathway, and interpreting the complex patterns of isotope enrichment generated by in vivo labeling have been major obstacles to in vivo studies of the Bloch and K–R pathways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kelleher and Masterson (1992)</xref> demonstrated that stable isotope methods and isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) could be used to measure the flux of cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates such as lathosterol in cultured cells and in living animals using gas chromatography–MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lindenthal et al., 2002</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDonald et al. (2012)</xref> developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to determine steady-state concentrations of most of post squalene cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates of the Bloch and K–R pathways in biological fluids. Here we combined these approaches to examine the flux of substrate though the Bloch and K–R pathways in cultured cells and in vivo in the tissues of mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Applying stable isotopes to measure sterol biosynthesis rates</title><p>As a first step towards characterizing the flux of precursor sterols through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, we used LC-MS/MS and deuterium oxide (D<sub>2</sub>O) labeling to analyze the turnover of a representative sterol, lanosterol, in immortalized human skin fibroblasts (SV-589 cells).

In the unlabeled sample, the fraction abundance of M = 0 is 0.74 (we will call this M0<sub>n</sub>); for the labeled sample, it is 0.23 (M0<sub>t</sub>). If we sample a sterol as the pool is turning over, the fractional abundance of M = 0 (M0<sub>m</sub>) will decrease from 0.74 to 0.23. The corresponding values of M2<sub>m</sub> will increase from 0.04 to 0.29. Using this data, the fraction of molecules that are newly synthesized (g) can be estimated using isotopic spectral analysis (IA). Using IA, the value of M0<sub>m</sub> has two components: (1) M0<sub>n</sub> times the fraction of molecules not labeled (1 − g). (2) M0<sub>t</sub> times the fraction of molecules newly synthesized (g). These two values can be summed to get the value of M0<sub>m</sub>. This same analysis can be done for any of the peaks. Then, by solving for g, the fraction of molecules newly synthesized can be determined based on M0<sub>m</sub>, M0<sub>n</sub>, and M0<sub>t</sub>. M0<sub>m</sub> is the measured value that is obtained from MS. M0<sub>n</sub> is determined from an unlabeled sample or from a natural abundance calculator. M0<sub>t</sub> can be determined from samples exposed to label long enough to ensure turnover of the entire pool, or using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hellerstein and Neese, 1999</xref>).

Incorporation into the downstream Bloch intermediates dehydrodesmosterol and desmosterol was minimal, but robust labeling of 7-dehydrocholesterol was observed, indicating a crossover from the Bloch to the K–R pathway between t-MAS and dehydrodesmosterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The methylated biosynthetic intermediates between lanosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol in the K–R pathway (i.e., dihydrolanosterol, dihydro-ff-MAS, and dihydro-t-MAS) did not turnover at comparable rates to either lanosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol, suggesting that the classical K–R pathway was not used to synthesize cholesterol in these cells. Instead, the cells used a hybrid pathway that we will refer to as the modified Kandutsch–Russell (MK–R) pathway. In this hybrid pathway, intermediates proceed down the Bloch pathway until demethylation of the sterol nucleus is complete, and then they undergo reduction of the double bond at C24 to enter the K–R pathway.</p><p>The step at which sterol synthesis crosses over from the Bloch to the K–R pathway could not be pinpointed in this experiment since some intermediates (shown in light gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) could not be measured due to either isobaric interference with cholesterol or because the levels were below the detection limits of the assay (see ‘Material and methods’). Our data suggest that in SV-589 cells, sterols are demethylated via the Bloch pathway and then undergo Δ24 reduction upstream of desmosterol. Therefore, in cultured fibroblasts the cross-over to the MK–R pathway occurs at either zymosterol, dehydrolathosterol, or dehydrodesmosterol.</p><p>These experiments confirmed the conclusion of Kandutsch and Russell that significant differences exist between cells of different types in the pathways utilized for cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kandutsch and Russell, 1960a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">1960b</xref>); however, they did not provide evidence that the K–R pathway as originally conceived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, red arrows) is utilized, at least in these two cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pathway utilization and cholesterol biosynthesis</title><p>To interrogate the factors that determine the relative utilization of the Bloch and MK–R pathway, we examined two cell culture systems in which rates of cholesterol biosynthesis were altered.

Second, cholesterol synthesis was examined in a mutant line of CHO-7 cells (SRD13A cells) that lack SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP), a protein required to activate the transcription of cholesterol biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rawson et al., 1999</xref>). SRD13A cells have no active SREBPs and thus exhibit low rates of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rawson et al., 1999</xref>). In WT CHO-7 cells, the Bloch pathway accounted for ∼90% of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

When cells were grown for 16 hr in cholesterol-depleted serum (NCLPPS) to stimulate cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol turnover doubled. Essentially all of the increase occurred via the Bloch pathway: flux through the MK–R pathway did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, open bars). Therefore, cholesterol depletion shifted the relative utilization of the two pathways such that approximately equal amounts of lanosterol were metabolized via Bloch and MK–R intermediates.

Despite a significant increase in Bloch pathway utilization in the cells that were grown in NCLPPS, no corresponding changes were observed in expression of the post-squalene cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, including DHCR24. Thus, the increase in flux through the Bloch pathway cannot be attributed simply to changes in the expression of SREBP-2 and the coordinated transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding enzymes in the pathway. Next, we examined the relationship between the level of expression of DHCR24, which desaturates the side-chain of the sterol, and the relative use of the Bloch and MK–R pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DHCR24 expression and pathway utilization</title><p>To determine if changing DHCR24 expression altered the relative use of the Bloch and MK–R pathways, we expressed recombinant mouse DHCR24 in human embryonal kidney cells (HEK-293 cells).

To circumvent this problem, we incubated HEK-293 cells with synthetic isotopomers of lanosterol and zymosterol (d<sub>6</sub>-lanosterol or d<sub>5</sub>-zymosterol) that have isotopic distributions not found in natural sterols. By monitoring the conversion of these synthetic isotopomers into other sterols we were able to resolve all of the stable biosynthetic intermediate sterols in their labeled forms. In this experiment we were also able to examine cholesterol biosynthesis from desmosterol and from 7-dehydrocholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue bars).</p><p>The design of these experiments differed from those shown previously. Here the labeled sterol was added to the medium and the distribution of label among the sterols of the two pathways was determined at a single time point (5 hr). In cells expressing vector alone, the d<sub>6</sub> label appeared in unsaturated side chain sterols of the Bloch pathway, with little to no label appearing in the MK–R intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, open bars in upper panel).

Instead, the label appeared in the demethylated saturated side chain sterols along the MK–R pathway (zymostenol, lathosterol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol). These data suggest that zymosterol is the crossover point between the Bloch and MK–R pathways in these cells under these conditions, and that the methyl sterols upstream of zymosterol are poor substrates for (or do not have access to) DHCR24. Under both conditions, the majority of the labeled sterol remained as d<sub>6</sub>-lanosterol. Overexpression of DHCR24 did not increase the formation of d<sub>6</sub>-dihydrolanosterol or of d<sub>6</sub>-cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper panel), suggesting the DHCR24 is not rate-limiting for the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol.</p><p>To confirm the crossover point between the Bloch and K–R pathway, HEK-293 cells were incubated with d<sub>5</sub>-zymosterol.

A small amount of label was measured in lathosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, but not in other K–R intermediates. In cells transfected with DHCR24, only a small fraction of the label was detected in intermediates of either pathway, presumably because they are rapidly converted to cholesterol. We found no label incorporated into dehydolathosterol or desmosterol. This result may reflect quantitative conversion of zymosterol to zymostenol, or rapid conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Label was detected in the downstream MK–R pathway intermediates zymostenol, lathosterol, and 7-dehydrocholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, closed bars in lower panel). These findings are consistent with those using labeled lanosterol and support the hypothesis that zymosterol is the first substrate for DHCR24 in the MK–R pathway used by these cells.

Essentially no synthesis of dihydro-ff-MAS was detected. This result suggests that a fraction of hepatic lanosterol was converted to dihydrolanosterol but did not proceed down the K–R pathway.

The flux from lanosterol proceeded via the Bloch pathway intermediates ff-MAS and t-MAS without any detectable incorporation into the corresponding saturated side chain sterols (dihydrolanosterol and dihydro-ff-MAS).

Remarkably, immortalized cells in culture retained the specific pathways used by their tissues of origin. Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis was achieved almost exclusively by changes in flux through the Bloch pathway. Our study reveals a strikingly varied pattern of sterol synthesis from lanosterol that allows for the generation of multiple, tissue-specific end-products in addition to cholesterol.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07999.011</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A modified Kandutsch–Russell (MK–R) model of post squalene cholesterol biosynthesis.</title><p>In this model, cholesterol biosynthesis proceeds from lanosterol to t-MAS.

Those authors hypothesized that the physiological pathway for conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol did not correspond to either the Bloch or the KR pathways, but rather to a reaction sequence in which C24-reduction occurred after demethylation but before the final Δ5-dehydrogenation and Δ7-reduction of the sterol nucleus. This proposal was not assessed in vivo and did not gain wide acceptance. The present data provide in vivo evidence for 24-reduction of zymosterol, but the predominance of the Bloch pathway in most tissues with high rates of cholesterol synthesis indicates that desmosterol is a major physiological substrate for the enzyme.</p><p>Reduced cellular cholesterol content selectively upregulated the Bloch pathway in cultured CHO7 and HuH7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Genetic ablation of SCAP, which is required for SREBP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rawson et al., 1999</xref>), dramatically reduced flux through the Bloch pathway, but had virtually no effect on the MK–R pathway. Similarly, depletion of cellular cholesterol by incubation in NCLPPS resulted in a major increase in flux through the Bloch pathway with no detectable change in flux through the MK–R pathway. These findings suggest that the MK–R pathway is constitutively active and that the Bloch pathway is used preferentially for regulated cholesterol biosynthesis in response to fluctuations in cholesterol availability and demand. Upregulation of the Bloch pathway also increases the synthesis of regulatory sterols that limit cholesterol accumulation in the cells: desmosterol activates LXR, which promotes cholesterol efflux from cells, and acts as a feedback inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis by inactivating SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The testes and adrenal glands synthesized cholesterol predominantly via the Bloch pathway, but the fate of sterols moving through the pathway in the two organs differed markedly. In the adrenal glands, lanosterol was quantitatively converted to desmosterol, and then presumably to cholesterol, which provides the substrate for adrenal steroidogenesis. In contrast, only one-third of the lanosterol synthesized in the testes was converted to desmosterol, and virtually none entered the MK–R pathway. In this tissue, lanosterol was quantitatively converted to ff-MAS and then to t-MAS, but more than two-thirds of the t-MAS was diverted from the pathway before zymosterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The metabolic fate of t-MAS in the testes is not known. t-MAS and its immediate precursor ff-MAS have been implicated as meiosis-activating sterols in the formation of male and female germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byskov et al., 1995</xref>); however, the role of these precursor sterols remains controversial. Germ-cell specific ablation of <italic>Cyp51a1,</italic> the enzyme that converts lanosterol to ff-MAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), markedly reduced testicular t-MAS concentration but had no effect on reproductive function in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keber et al., 2013</xref>). The reduction in flux from t-MAS to zymosterol that we observed in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) may be due to t-MAS being converted to another sterol (or steroid hormone), or to the secretion of t-MAS from the testes.</p><p>The liver was the only tissue in which we observed appreciable dihydrolanosterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Approximately 5–10% of the lanosterol synthesized in the liver was converted to dihydrolanosterol, but not to downstream intermediates in the K–R pathway. In contrast to other sterol intermediates synthesized in the liver, labeled dihydrolanosterol did not appear in the plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is possible that dihydrolanosterol is rapidly excreted from the liver via the bile. Although we did not include biliary sterols in our flux studies, we have found that the concentration of dihydrolanosterol in bile is not enriched relative to the liver (data not shown). This finding is not compatible with selective biliary excretion of dihydrolanosterol. Taken together, our data indicate that at least some of the dihydrolanosterol that is formed in the liver is converted to another sterol, the identity of which remains unknown.</p><p>The function of dihydrolanosterol in the liver is also not known. Previous studies have demonstrated that dihydrolanosterol can promote degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lange et al., 2008</xref>). This effect is specific to dihydrolanosterol: neither cholesterol nor the other biosynthetic intermediates tested, including lanosterol and lathosterol, showed this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lange et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, one function of the dihydrolanosterol (or a metabolic derivative thereof) synthesized in the liver may be to provide rapid feedback inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis through post-transcriptional regulation of HMG-CoA reductase. If this model is correct, then our data suggest that this regulation is likely only significant in liver.</p><p>Three tissues predominantly used the MK–R pathway: brain, skin and preputial gland. Our finding that skin and preputial gland produced high levels of saturated side chain sterols is compatible with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kandutsch and Russell (1960b)</xref>. The utilization of the MK–R pathway in the skin ensures a constant supply of 7-dehydrocholesterol for vitamin D synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeLuca, 2008</xref>). Why the MK–R is the predominant pathway in preputial gland is less clear. The major function of this gland is thought to be the synthesis of pheromones. The chemical nature of these pheromones has not been fully defined but squalene and cholesterol were the most abundant lipids identified in a GC/MS analysis of preputial glands from male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, cholesterol, or one or more of its biosynthetic precursors may be used for pheromone synthesis. In the present study, a loss of sterol between lanosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol was not observed, but we cannot exclude the possibility that some 7-dehydrocholesterol is diverted from cholesterol synthesis to pheromone synthesis.</p><p>In contrast to skin and preputial gland, the brain has very low DHCR24 activity and was predicted to predominantly use the Bloch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nes, 2011</xref>). Although the brain is among the most cholesterol-rich organs, turnover, and hence synthesis of brain cholesterol is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lund et al., 2003</xref>). Our data indicate other tissues with low rates of cholesterol synthesis, such as heart and skeletal muscle also predominantly used the MK–R pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These tissues are largely post-mitotic and do not synthesize steroid hormones or vitamin D. If the MK–R pathway is constitutive in vivo, as it appears to be in cultured cells, then predominant use of this pathway may ensure a constant rate of cholesterol synthesis in tissues that experience little variation in their cholesterol requirements.</p><p>The relative utilization of the Bloch and MK–R pathways in cultured cells was strikingly similar to that observed in vivo in the tissue of origin. These findings suggest that the factors governing pathway selection are epigenetically fixed. Relative pathway utilization is presumably a function of the relative activities of the two enzymes at the branch point, which is tissue dependent. The relative function of the two enzyme could be determined by myriad factors including those that act directly on enzyme activity (e.g., transcription, post-translational modification), the expression of auxiliary proteins (co-factors, inhibitors, proteins that present or sequester substrate) or factors that affect the relative proximity of the enzymes to their substrates.</p><p>Since DHCR24 activity is a major determinant of relative pathway utilization, cell-type specific control of pathway utilization may involve epigenetic control of DHCR24 expression. The pattern of DHCR24 expression in tissues was an imperfect predictor of relative pathway utilization. For example, the brain used the MK–R pathway despite low DHCR24 expression and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tint et al., 2006</xref>) while liver and kidney predominantly used the Bloch pathway, despite relatively high expression of DHCR24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). DHCR24 is phosphorylated at multiple sites and may be regulated at the post-translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luu et al., 2014</xref>). The activity and substrate specificity of the enzyme may also be influenced by its intracellular location. Brown and his colleagues reported that DHCR7 and DHCR24 co-immunoprecipitate in CHO-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24a">Luu et al., 2015</xref>). Those authors proposed that the formation of a complex between the two proteins favors the efficient conversion of 7-dehydrodesmosterol to desmosterol, and then to cholesterol. This hypothesis is consistent with our finding that the Bloch pathway is predominantly used in steroidogenic cells. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanistic basis for the wide differences in DHCR24 expression among tissues, and to identify other factors that govern the route of flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>The patterns of deuterium enrichment of biosynthetic precursor sterols in plasma were similar to those seen in the liver, but distinct from those observed in extrahepatic tissues. This finding indicates that the cholesterol pool in extrahepatic tissues is relatively isolated from the cholesterol in circulating lipoproteins. This hypothesis is supported by data from Dietschy and colleagues, who reported that 80% of cholesterol biosynthesis in mice takes place in extra-hepatic tissues, while 80% of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol is taken up by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osono et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, most extrahepatic tissues obtain cholesterol primarily from de novo synthesis, with little contribution from circulating lipoproteins. This conclusion suggests that the effects of dietary and pharmacological interventions on cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver can be inferred from measurements of isotopic enrichment in the plasma.</p><p>If extrahepatic tissues contribute little to the plasma sterol pool as shown in this study, how are sterols synthesized in peripheral tissues transported to the liver (or gut) for excretion? The route by which cholesterol is transported from the peripheral tissues to the liver, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Glomset, 1968</xref>), remains to be fully defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hellerstein and Turner, 2014</xref>) One possibility is that peripheral tissues release cholesterol, but not the biosynthetic precursor sterols, into the circulation. In this case we would fail to capture flux of peripheral tissue cholesterol since we did not measure cholesterol isotopomers in these experiments. An alternative possibility is that cholesterol from the periphery is transported in the circulation by cells rather than lipoproteins or other plasma components. Careful quantification of cholesterol fluxes in vivo will be required to elucidate the relative contributions of cellular and plasma elements to the centripetal transport of peripheral tissue cholesterol.</p><p>The approach used in this study could potentially be confounded by the presence of two pools of an intermediate in the pathway that turn over at different rates. This problem would be particularly acute if a small pool of intermediate turns over rapidly while a second, larger pool sequestered from the biosynthesis pathway turned over slowly. Under these conditions the larger pool may significantly reduce the labeling of the total intermediate isolated from the cells resulting in falsely low estimates of flux. The observation that multiple independent intermediates showed essentially identical kinetics argues against this possibility, but we cannot formally exclude it.</p><p>Metabolic pathways have traditionally been defined in two stages. First, the sequence of reactions that comprise the pathway is determined biochemically. These determinations are almost invariably qualitative in nature. Second, flux through the pathway is quantified using radioisotopes to trace the turnover of a single metabolite, typically the end product of the pathway. By combining LC-MS/MS methods with stable isotope tracing, flux can be monitored through multiple intermediates in a biosynthetic pathway simultaneously. As illustrated in the present study, this approach can reveal bifurcations in established pathways that imply novel biochemistry and physiology for molecules previously viewed simply as biosynthetic intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Deuterium labeled water (D<sub>2</sub>O, 99.8% pure) was purchased from Sigma.

The value of N ranged from 20 to 28 in all tissues.</p><p>The rate of synthesis of each sterol was determined by assuming first-order kinetics, using the equation:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>∞</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where g<sub>∞</sub> is the asymptotic value of g, t is time, and k is the rate constant. The value of g<sub>∞</sub> and k were calculated using the Matlab Optimization Toolbox (Natick, MA). The rate of synthesis of each sterol was determined by multiplying the rate constant (k) by the concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA from tissues and cells was isolated using commercial reagents (RNA-STAT 60). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg RNA using Taqman (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, New York.) with random hexamer primers and amplified by PCR in 2× SYBR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The specific oligonucleotides for each transcript are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. The levels of each mRNA were normalized to the level of 36B4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Samples for immublotting were placed in sample buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.6) and homogenized using an Ultra-TURRAX homogenizer and then passed through a 22 G needle 35 times. Membranes were isolated from the homogenates by sequential centrifugation (7 min at 2200 rpm, followed by a second centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 60 min). The pellet from the second centrifugation step was re-suspended in lysis buffer (10 mM tris–HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA and EGTA, pH 6.8) and shaken for 1 hr at 4°C. After an hour, an equal volume of solubilization buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl, 15% SDS, 8 M urea, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT, pH 6.8) and 5× loading buffer was added (Fermantas). Samples were size fractionated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (GE Healthcare) before incubating overnight at 4°C with a rabbit anti-mouse DHCR24 antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies) in PBST (Sigma) plus 5% (wt/vol) fat free milk. Anti-mouse calnexin (1:2000; MBD International) was used to detect calnexin as a loading control. After incubation, the filter was washed and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000; GE Healthcare) was used as a secondary antibody. The filter was scanned using a LiCor Odyssey and visualized using iS ImageStudio software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Transfection</title><p>Mouse DHCR24 was cloned into a PCDNA 3.1 TOPO TA vector using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). The insert sequence was verified by sequencing and the plasmid was amplified with a Maxiprep kit (Origene). The plasmid was prepared in a 1:3 ratio with Fugene 6 (Promega) (wt/vol) and diluted in Opti-Mem medium (Life Technologies). Cells were transfected by exchanging the medium for Opti-Mem medium containing 8 μg plasmid DNA at a 1:3 ratio with Fugene 6 (wt/vol). After 20 hr the medium was changed to Opti–Mem supplemented with 5% D<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank David Russell, Elizabeth Parks, and Russell Debose-Boyd for helpful discussions and Zifen Wang for technical assistance.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephen Young (Reviewing editor); Joanne Kelleher and Marc Hellerstein (peer reviewers).</p><p>All three reviewers were enthusiastic about your paper and all three thought that a revised manuscript that attended to the reviewers' criticisms would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In their manuscript, the authors have analyzed cholesterol synthesis through the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russell pathways in different tissues and cell types. They found that no tissue used the canonical K-R pathway, but that several used a modified K-R pathway. They found that the use of the Bloch and MK-R pathways is highly variable, tissue-specific, and flux dependent. The factors that regulated use of the different pathways was not clearly delineated, but the manuscript represents an important contribution to cholesterol biochemistry.</p><p>None of the three reviewers requested additional experiments, but all three reviewers thought that it was essential for the authors to defend some of their conclusions and expand upon their interpretations of the data. Also, reviewers 2 and 3 thought that the authors needed to clarify methodological issues and in some cases qualify their conclusions. For example, the authors need to discuss how subpools of intermediates might affect their interpretations and conclusions. The authors are strongly encouraged to respond to all of the reviewers' criticisms regarding methodology and data interpretation in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a beautifully prepared manuscript with great figures and novel data. The authors have worked define the importance of two different cholesterol biosynthetic pathways in different cell lines and in different mouse tissues. They have also examined the two biosynthetic pathways in response to perturbations that alter cholesterol synthetic rates. They have identified several important novel twists and turns in the pathway. The authors clearly have carved out a fruitful and intriguing topic for future research.</p><p>I have several comments. First, the authors should defend their contention that the identification of the hybrid cholesterol synthesis pathway is novel. This reviewer noted that this hybrid pathway appears to be described in the cholesterol synthesis discussion in the Wikipedia page on Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome. Of course, Wikipedia has plenty of errors. Nevertheless, I would request that the authors defend their contention that the “pathway switchover” is novel – or whether their hybrid pathway had been conceptualized and proposed previously.</p><p>Second, I would ask the authors to elaborate on the fact that plasma and liver have similar proportions of deuterium enrichment in cholesterol and precursor sterols. This is a nice finding. This reviewer believes that some sort of model would be useful to reconcile this finding with the observation that most of the cholesterol is made outside of the liver. How do the authors propose that this occurs? Please elaborate.</p><p>Also, the authors showed that expression of DHCR24 affects the pathway, but that the extent to which pathway usage depends on DHCR24 expression was not 100% consistent. One possibility is that pathway utilization depends on the concentrations, or relative concentrations, of pathway intermediates, perhaps including pre-squalene intermediates. Was there evidence for this? Can one perturb pathway utilization with low doses of squalene synthase inhibitors? Please elaborate on your thoughts about what is controlling pathway utilization.</p><p>It would be interesting, if possible, to tie this work to disease. For example, it might be interesting to compare pathway usage in different tissues of Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome mice. In those mice, is the utilization of different biosynthetic pathways in different tissues perturbed or maintained? Could you quantify the amount of 7-Dehydrocholesterol that is shunted away into oxidized derivatives? Does different pathway utilization in different tissues explain the susceptibility of different tissues to disease? Such studies are almost certainly too much for this paper, but the authors should at least put forward a more detailed description of what they consider to be the most important biochemical factors that govern pathway utilization of the two different pathways in different cell lines and tissues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an original and very well-conceived study of metabolic regulation, addressing the pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. The results are consistent and convincing, indicating that the pathway for cholesterol synthesis in most mouse tissues – specifically, the step at which cholesterol-24,25 reduction occurs, catalyzed by DHCR24 – is late (classic Bloch pathway) or is mid-pathway, after zymosterol (modified Kandutsch-Russell [K-R] pathway). Accordingly, it is somewhat misleading to talk of an eponymous, pure K-R pathway. Variability among tissues is not explained by gene expression (mRNA levels, even for DHCR24) and may have regulatory consequences.</p><p>The methods appear solid, combining heavy water labeling and LC/MS mass isotopomer analysis with pool size measurements to measure synthesis rates and using established modifiers of cholesterol flux (cholesterol depleted media, DHCR24 overexpression). The paper is well written.</p><p>I believe that this is an unusually compelling contribution to the classic field of cholesterol biosynthesis.</p><p>There are a few important methodologic issues to clarify:</p><p>1) How much of the differences in total synthesis rates are due to the kinetic measurements (turnover rates) vs. the tissue concentrations of each metabolite? The k values are not shown (e.g., in an appendix). Would their findings have been discernable from simple measurements of metabolite concentrations (e.g., classic “cross-over plots”)?</p><p>2) The inability to detect some key biosynthetic intermediates analytically which happen to be right about where the DHCR24 crossover often occured – zymostenol, lathosterol, dehydrolathosterol – is a problem. The authors are forced to place this key step somewhere at or after zymosterol. This uncertainty, which is entirely analytic in nature, might be emphasized a bit more clearly in the text. Their one non-heavy water labeling study, with d<sub>6</sub>-lanosterol and d<sub>5</sub>-zymostenol, overcame the detectability problem and gave more detail on the cross-over site. The latter results support their general conclusion – i.e., cross-over seemingly around the dehydrolathosterol-lathosterol step, or maybe a step earlier. This supportive labeling result is worth noting in context of the greyed out parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>3) The kinetic method is not accurately described as ISA, which solves for p and synthesis fraction (g) by best fit to a family of curves. The authors know p here independently (tissue water enrichment). Their equation for g (in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Data interpretation”) is basic mass isotopomer analysis, identical for MIDA (JCI 1991, AJP 1992) and ISA (AJP 1992).</p><p>4) A point worth mentioning about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (and subsequent figures): it is not possible to have a higher absolute flux rate in the final product of a linear pathway, in this case 7-dehydrocholesterol, than in preceding intermediates. Like water through a hose, flow cannot be greater over one length than over an earlier length. So these figures by themselves must mean a crossover into “K-R” has occurred – i.e., that K-R is not a linear pathway.</p><p><italic>Additional data files and statistical comments:</italic></p><p>Appendix showing kinetic rate constants (k) vs. metabolite concentrations, in their calculations of absolute synthesis rates (= k x concentration).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript contributes to understanding the pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Specifically it demonstrates that a kinetic labeling approach using ISA may be used to resolve the flux through the Bloch vs the K-R pathway for cholesterol synthesis. A possible difficulty with this approach would be the presence of two pools of an intermediate in the pathway. Consider the possibility of a small pool involved in the biosynthetic pathway which labeled fully and quickly and a second larger pool sequestered from the biosynthesis pathway which did not turn over. Such a pool might reduce to negligible values the labeling of the total intermediate isolated from the cells and falsely give the impression that there was no flux through this poorly labeled intermediate. Clearly this does not occur for the well labeled intermediates which label to 100% with expected kinetics. However, it might be useful if the authors commented on this possibility and any experiments that might rule this out.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07999.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>I have several comments.

The comment in Wikipedia appears to have its origin in a paper by Bae and Paik (Bae and Paik, Biochem J 326:609, 1997), who reported that zymosterol was preferred over lanosterol as a substrate for C-24 reduction in rat liver microsomes. Those authors hypothesized that the physiological pathway for conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol did not correspond to either the Bloch or the KR pathways, but rather to a reaction sequence in which C24-reduction occurred after demethylation but before the final Δ<sup>5</sup>-dehydrogenation and Δ<sup>7</sup>-reduction of the sterol nucleus. This proposal was not assessed in vivo and did not gain wide acceptance. Subsequently, Gaylor et al. noted the enzymes in the pathway act on sterols with both unsaturated and saturated side chains and so crossover between the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russell pathways could potentially occur at any point in the pathway (Gaylor J, BBRC 295:1139, 2002). The interpretation was challenged by Brown and his colleagues (Zerenturk et al. Prog Lipid Res 52:666, 2013) since desmosterol, not zymosterol, accumulates in DHCR24 deficiency. In response to this comment, we have revised the manuscript as follows:</p><p>In the first paragraph of the Discussion we have changed the statement “A previously unrecognized hybrid pathway that we have named the modified Kandutsch-Russell pathway (MK-R) exists in skin, preputial glands and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, red arrows)” to: “A hybrid pathway that we have named the modified Kandutsch-Russell pathway (MK-R) exists in skin, preputial glands and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, red arrows).”</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion: “The MK-R pathway is consistent with […] a major physiological substrate for the enzyme.”</p><p><italic>Second, I would ask the authors to elaborate on the fact that plasma and liver have similar proportions of deuterium enrichment in cholesterol and precursor sterols. This is a nice finding. This reviewer believes that some sort of model would be useful to reconcile this finding with the observation that most of the cholesterol is made outside of the liver. How do the authors propose that this occurs? Please elaborate</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting point. If circulating sterols are largely derived from liver how are sterols synthesized in peripheral tissues transported for excretion in liver or gut? This question touches on one of the major unresolved questions in cholesterol metabolism (viz. reverse cholesterol transport), and we agree that it deserves comment. Since the pathway appears not to be captured by our present data, any model we propose would be entirely speculative. We have added the following to the Discussion: “If extrahepatic tissues contribute little to the plasma sterol […] plasma elements to the centripetal transport of peripheral tissue cholesterol.”</p><p><italic>Also, the authors showed that expression of DHCR24 affects the pathway, but that the extent to which pathway usage depends on DHCR24 expression was not 100% consistent. One possibility is that pathway utilization depends on the concentrations, or relative concentrations, of pathway intermediates, perhaps including pre-squalene intermediates. Was there evidence for this? Can one perturb pathway utilization with low doses of squalene synthase inhibitors? Please elaborate on your thoughts about what is controlling pathway utilization</italic>.</p><p>We did not see an obvious relationship between concentrations of sterol intermediates and relative pathway utilization. We have added this data to the paper as requested by Reviewer 2 (see new Figure 5–figure supplement 1). We did not test squalene synthase inhibitors. Nonsterol intermediates are not detected in our assay, so we cannot exclude the hypothesis that the differences observed are due to concentrations of nonsterol these intermediates in the pathway.</p><p>We have expanded our discussion on possible factors that control pathway utilization as follows: “The relative utilization of the Bloch and MK-R pathways in cultured cells […] route of flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathways”.</p><p><italic>It would be interesting, if possible, to tie this work to disease. For example, it might be interesting to compare pathway usage in different tissues of Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome mice.

Such studies are almost certainly too much for this paper, but the authors should at least put forward a more detailed description of what they consider to be the most important biochemical factors that govern pathway utilization of the two different pathways in different cell lines and tissues</italic>.</p><p>We agree that a disease connection would be interesting, and we looked at pathway utilization in primary fibroblasts cultured from patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. In these experiments, sterol biosynthesis was reduced by about 50%, which is consistent with previous studies by Tint and Salen, and the modified pathway was used exclusively, which is consistent with the biochemical defect (the cells cannot synthesize desmosterol). Accordingly we elected not to include these data.</p><p>It is likely that the amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol that is diverted to oxidized derivatives could be determined using the methodology applied here, but it would require nontrivial method development. The assay of oxysterols requires completely different sample preparation, LC conditions (gradient), and mass spectrometry (ion source) from those used in this study.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>There are a few important methodologic issues to clarify</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) How much of the differences in total synthesis rates are due to the kinetic measurements (turnover rates) vs. the tissue concentrations of each metabolite?

Specifically it demonstrates that a kinetic labeling approach using ISA may be used to resolve the flux through the Bloch versus the K-R pathway for cholesterol synthesis. A possible difficulty with this approach would be the presence of two pools of an intermediate in the pathway. Consider the possibility of a small pool involved in the biosynthetic pathway which labeled fully and quickly and a second larger pool sequestered from the biosynthesis pathway which did not turn over. Such a pool might reduce to negligible values the labeling of the total intermediate isolated from the cells and falsely give the impression that there was no flux through this poorly labeled intermediate. Clearly this does not occur for the well labeled intermediates which label to 100% with expected kinetics. However, it might be useful if the authors commented on this possibility and any experiments that might rule this out</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an important caveat and we thank the reviewer for bringing it to our attention. We have added the following caveat to the Discussion: “The approach used in this study could potentially be confounded by the presence of two pools of an intermediate in the pathway that turn over at different rates. This problem would be particularly acute if a small pool of intermediate turns over rapidly while a second, larger pool sequestered from the biosynthesis pathway turned over slowly. Under these conditions the larger pool may significantly reduce the labeling of the total intermediate isolated from the cells resulting in falsely low estimates of flux. The observation that multiple independent intermediates showed essentially identical kinetics argues against this possibility, but we cannot formally exclude it.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
