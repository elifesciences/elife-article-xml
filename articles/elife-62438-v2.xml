However, the full complement of these elements is not known even in the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Using complementary RNA-sequencing approaches, we detected large numbers of 3´ ends in 5´ UTRs and open reading frames (ORFs), suggesting extensive regulation by premature transcription termination. We documented regulation for multiple transcripts, including spermidine induction involving Rho and translation of an upstream ORF for an mRNA encoding a spermidine efflux pump. In addition to discovering novel sites of regulation, we detected short, stable RNA fragments derived from 5´ UTRs and sequences internal to ORFs. Characterization of three of these transcripts, including an RNA internal to an essential cell division gene, revealed that they have independent functions as sRNA sponges. Thus, these data uncover an abundance of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNA regulators in bacterial 5´ UTRs and internal to ORFs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In most organisms, specific segments of a cell’s genetic information are copied to form single-stranded molecules of various sizes and purposes.

Changes in the secondary structures of these <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements lead to altered expression of the associated gene(s) by modulating accessibility of ribosomes to sites of translation initiation, accessibility of RNases, or premature transcription termination. The RNA secondary structure changes can occur in response to temperature (RNA thermometers), translation of small upstream open reading frames (uORFs), or the binding of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as metabolites (riboswitches), tRNAs, RNA-binding proteins such as CsrA, or small base-pairing RNAs (sRNAs) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breaker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kreuzer and Henkin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Romeo and Babitzke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Storz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Some of the regulatory events in 5´ UTRs are associated with premature transcription termination, which occurs by one of two mechanisms: intrinsic (Rho-independent) or Rho-dependent (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roberts, 2019</xref>). Intrinsic termination requires only RNA polymerase and an RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract in the nascent RNA. Rho-dependent termination requires the loading of the hexameric Rho protein complex onto nascent, untranslated RNA at <underline>R</underline>ho <underline>ut</underline>ilization (Rut) sites that are typically C-rich, G-poor, and unstructured sequences (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>). Rho translocates along the RNA until the protein catches RNA polymerase and promotes transcription termination, typically between 100 and 200 nt downstream of the Rut site, leading to 3´ ends that are processed by 3´ to 5´exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have sought to identify sites of transcription termination across the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome by sequencing RNA 3´ ends or by mapping the distribution of transcribing RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). The vast majority of identified termination sites are in 3´ UTRs. In some studies, termination was compared in cells grown with/without the Rho inhibitor, bicyclomycin (BCM), facilitating the identification of Rho termination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2012</xref>). These data provided evidence for Rho termination of mRNAs in 3´ UTRs and spurious transcripts initiated within genes. While termination within 5´ UTRs was noted in some of these studies, extensive global characterization of premature termination has not been performed. Many of the uncharacterized 3´ ends in 5´ UTRs or open reading frame (ORF)-internal regions are likely to be the result of regulatory events, given that riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hollands et al., 2012</xref>), attenuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Zvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrero Del Valle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Konan and Yanofsky, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kriner and Groisman, 2015</xref>), RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baniulyte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2014</xref>), and sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bossi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sedlyarova et al., 2016</xref>) have all been implicated in affecting premature Rho termination events.</p><p>In addition to being the product of a regulatory event, RNA fragments generated by premature termination or RNase cleavage themselves can have functions as regulatory sRNAs. sRNAs commonly base pair with <italic>trans</italic>-encoded mRNAs, frequently with the assistance of the RNA chaperone protein Hfq, resulting in changes in the stability or translation of the target mRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hör et al., 2020</xref>). Most sRNAs characterized to date are transcribed independent of other genes or are processed from mRNA 3´ UTRs, though a few 5´ UTR-derived sRNAs have been reported (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams and Storz, 2020</xref>). RNA fragments entirely internal to coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dar and Sorek, 2018a</xref>) also have been suggested to function as regulators, though this has not been tested. While sRNAs generally base pair with mRNA targets, a few small transcripts have been shown to have roles as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) also known as ‘sponges’, which base pair primarily with sRNAs, targeting the sRNAs for degradation or blocking their interactions with mRNA targets (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Denham, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Figueroa-Bossi and Bossi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grüll and Massé, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To systematically identify new regulatory elements in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we globally mapped RNA 3´ ends, and specifically characterized those ends in 5´ UTRs and ORF-internal regions. We compared this 3´ end dataset with another dataset where BCM treatment was used to identify sites of Rho termination. Using these approaches, we detected hundreds of RNA 3´ ends within 5´ UTRs and internal to ORFs, likely generated by premature transcription termination or RNase processing. We propose the majority of these 3´ ends are the consequence of regulatory events, and we document regulation for multiple examples. For instance, we show 3´ ends are associated with the translation of uORFs, or result from the binding of some sRNAs to mRNA 5´ UTRs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RNA fragments generated by premature transcription termination and from within coding sequences function as independent sRNA regulators; one as part of an autoregulatory loop and another that connects cell division to the cell envelope stress response. These findings reveal extensive and diverse regulation through premature transcription termination and RNase processing of mRNAs, which can lead to the generation of RNA by-products with independent functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global mapping of 3´ ends in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>Two independent cultures of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 (WT) were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.4 in rich (LB) medium, OD<sub>600</sub> ~2.0 in LB, and OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.4 in minimal (M63) glucose medium.

One <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 culture grown to OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.5 in LB was split with half left untreated and the other half treated with 100 µg/ml BCM for 15 min. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed using a DirectRNA-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ozsolak and Milos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a method optimized for sequencing very short reads (20–30 nt) directly from RNA, an advantage for examining the effect of Rho on the generation of small RNA fragments. Using these data, we calculated a ‘Rho score’ for each genomic position by comparing DirectRNA-seq coverage in 800 nt windows upstream and downstream in the treated (+BCM) and untreated (-BCM) samples (see Materials and methods). This ratio reflects the degree of transcriptional Rho readthrough in the +BCM cells, where a score of &gt;2.0 is indicative of at least a two-fold increase in readthrough in the +BCM compared to the -BCM sample. 1078 genomic regions were putatively associated with a Rho termination event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We note that these genomic positions are likely closer to processed RNA 3´ ends than the termination sites, since Rho-terminated transcripts typically are processed by 3´ to 5´ exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we refer to the identified genomic locations as ‘Rho termination regions’. As for 3´ ends mapped by Term-seq, we classified Rho termination regions by their position relative to annotated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). 3´ ends antisense to annotated genes represented the largest category (51.5%), consistent with significant Rho termination of antisense RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2012</xref>). Only a small percentage (4.5%) of the Rho termination regions are &lt;50 nt downstream of an annotated gene (primary), likely because Rho loading and termination typically requires &gt;50 nt untranslated RNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>).

Again, there was significant overlap with each of the three previous studies (hypergeometric test p&lt;2.2e<sup>−16</sup> in all cases), though many (43%) of the putative Rho termination regions we identified are &gt;500 bp away from any of the previously identified Rho termination regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2012</xref>). The large sets of Rho termination regions that differ between the studies suggest that much remains to be learned about Rho-dependent termination.

However, the number of Rho termination sites could be an underestimate, because inhibition of Rho leads to extensive readthrough transcription from very strongly transcribed genes that can mask overlapping transcripts, and 3´ ends generated by Rho termination are typically unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).

Translation of this uORF was previously detected by ribosome profiling, with expression of the corresponding small protein (YdgV) documented by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>).

Since the region of <italic>chiP</italic> encoding ChiZ has been documented to be a target for base pairing with the sRNA ChiX through compensatory mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Overgaard et al., 2009</xref>), we postulated that ChiZ reciprocally regulates ChiX, sponging its base-pairing activity. To test this possibility, we assayed the effects of ChiZ overexpression. As for chromosomally-encoded ChiZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), longer transcripts were observed for plasmid-encoded ChiZ, likely due to readthrough, but only the levels of the 90 nt ChiZ band were strongly reduced in the ∆<italic>hfq</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The levels of the <italic>chiP</italic> mRNA overall were higher in the Δ<italic>hfq</italic> mutant background, but we no longer observed an increase upon ChiZ overexpression, likely due to the instabilities of ChiX and ChiZ.

These observations support a novel sRNA regulatory network in which an mRNA (<italic>chiP</italic>) that is the target of an sRNA (ChiX) produces an RNA fragment (ChiZ) that reciprocally sponges the sRNA (ChiX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>We expected IspZ also might function as a base-pairing sRNA, and thus searched for potential targets identified by RIL-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melamed et al., 2016</xref>), an approach where RNAs in proximity on an RNA-binding protein are identified by co-immunoprecipitation, ligation, and sequencing of the chimeras. The predominant target for IspZ in these datasets is the oxidative stress-induced sRNA OxyS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altuvia et al., 1997</xref>). This observation led us to test whether IspZ might act as a sponge of OxyS. As for chromosomally-encoded IspZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and in contrast to ChiZ, little readthrough and no effect of ∆<italic>hfq</italic> was observed for plasmid-expressed IspZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We examined the effect of IspZ overexpression on OxyS levels in cells treated with 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide, a condition known to induce OxyS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altuvia et al., 1997</xref>). High levels of IspZ were associated with slightly lower OxyS levels, in line with sponging activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To obtain evidence for direct base pairing between IspZ and OxyS, IspZ was mutated on the overexpression plasmid (IspZ-M1), and compensatory mutations were introduced into the chromosomal copy of OxyS (OxyS-M1). Consistent with the predicted pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), IspZ-mediated down-regulation was eliminated with IspZ-M1 or OxyS-M1 alone but was restored when both mutations were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Putative ORF-internal sRNAs</title><p>We also noted examples of abundant 3´ ends internal to ORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), downstream of nearby 5´ ends previously identified by dRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thomason et al., 2015</xref>), and associated with a strong signal in total RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

It is possible the other sponges mask some of the effects of FtsO.</p><p>The conservation of <italic>ftsO</italic> was examined by aligning <italic>ftsI</italic> orthologs across 18 species of gammaproteobacteria, revealing a striking degree of <italic>ftsO</italic> conservation (91% average identity) at <italic>ftsI</italic> wobble positions compared to the entire <italic>ftsI</italic> mRNA wobble positions (67% average identity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The region of base pairing parallels the conservation of the RybB seed sequence and is predicted to be within an unstructured region of FtsO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that FtsO base pairing with RybB is conserved, and lowers RybB levels and activity following outer membrane stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The work demonstrates stable regulatory sRNAs can be derived from sequences internal to ORFs such that the same DNA sequence encodes two different functional molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Widespread premature transcription termination</title><p>Through our transcriptome-wide mapping of 3´ ends and Rho-dependent termination, we uncovered extensive RNA-mediated regulation and sRNA regulators encoded by 5´ UTRs and internal to ORFs. Other studies have previously identified RNA 3´ ends and regions of Rho-dependent termination in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). While there was considerable overlap between our work and these prior studies, there were also substantial differences. For example, reporter gene fusion data and northern analysis supported Rho termination of <italic>sugE</italic>, <italic>cfa</italic>, <italic>cyaA</italic>, <italic>speA</italic>, and <italic>mdtJ</italic>, of which, only <italic>sugE</italic> was detected in the previous genome-wide surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar and Sorek, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Some of the differences between studies can be attributed to differences in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, growth conditions, and methods used. Indeed, we previously found that small methodological differences have a large impact on the identification of mapped TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thomason et al., 2015</xref>). Like any RNA-seq method, a few 3´ ends also could be due to RNA degradation during library preparation. Nevertheless, our follow-up experiments confirmed the biological relevance of several 3´ ends in 5´ UTRs and internal to ORFs. Given that strain and growth conditions used for our Term-seq and total RNA-seq match those of the previous dRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thomason et al., 2015</xref>) in which we identified TSSs and 5´ processed ends, the combined sets represent a valuable resource for examining the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcriptome (see Materials and methods for links to interactive browsers).</p><p>The majority of the 3´ ends that we identified were classified as ‘internal’ or ‘orphan’, most of which map within 5´ UTRs or internal to ORFs, and a significant number of which are predicted to be generated by premature transcription termination. This notion of widespread premature transcription termination has been underappreciated in other studies that detected RNA 3´ ends and Rho-mediated termination. It is generally not possible to identify the exact position of Rho termination due to post-transcriptional RNA processing. Nevertheless, our reporter assays showed that in most cases tested, Rho termination could be localized to the 5´ UTR, suggesting that modulation of Rut accessibility in 5´ UTRs could be a common mechanism of regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multiple levels of regulation at 5´ UTRs</title><p>Presuming that many premature termination events are regulatory, we documented and characterized examples of novel, diverse regulatory events for several of the 3´ ends. Undoubtedly, additional unique regulatory mechanisms exist for many of the other 3´ ends. We propose that the identification of 3´ ends in 5´ UTRs and ORFs is an effective approach to discover novel regulatory elements. Classically, these regulators, such as riboswitches and attenuators, have been identified by serendipity, studies of individual genes, or searches for conserved RNA structures (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breaker, 2018</xref>), but these approaches may miss regulatory RNA elements if the function of the downstream gene is unknown or the region is not broadly conserved. Given that Term-seq is a sensitive, relatively unbiased, and genome-wide approach, it is another means of obtaining evidence for regulation in 5´ UTRs. As an example, the Term-seq data showed that transcripts from the 5´ UTR of the <italic>E. coli</italic> glycerol facilitator <italic>glpF</italic> have different 3´ ends under LB and M63 growth conditions, which could be due to uncharacterized regulation. 3´ end-mapping applied to <italic>E. coli</italic> grown under other conditions or other bacterial species should lead to the characterization of many more regulators, particularly in organisms such as the Lyme disease pathogen <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2017</xref>) that lack any known <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements. Consistent with broad applicability, Term-seq previously led to the identification of known riboregulators in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and a novel attenuator in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A number of 3´ ends in 5´ UTRs and ORFs were found to be associated with uORFs. Our characterization of the <italic>mdtU</italic> uORF suggests that regulation of premature <italic>mdtJI</italic> transcription termination occurs in response to ribosome stalling induced by polyamines. Two recent studies showed that the polyamine ornithine can stall ribosomes immediately upstream of the stop codon of the <italic>speFL</italic> uORF, affecting Rho binding and the secondary structure of the <italic>speFL</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Zvi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herrero Del Valle et al., 2020</xref>). Strikingly, conservation of MdtU is strongest at the C-terminus, and overlaps a region of the <italic>mdtU</italic> RNA that is predicted to base pair with the <italic>mdtJI</italic> ribosome binding site. Thus, a mechanism similar to the one found for <italic>speFL</italic> may regulate <italic>mdtJI</italic> induction by spermidine, a hypothesis that deserves further study, together with other examples where 3´ ends are located downstream of uORFs.</p><p>We also documented three instances of 3´ ends that localized a short distance downstream of known <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNA base-pairing sites. These 3´ ends could be generated by endonuclease processing as a result of sRNA base pairing, or could be due to protection against exonucleases as a result of sRNA pairing. An examination of sRNA base-pairing sites predicted by RIL-seq points toward other instances of this type of regulation. For example, Term-seq identified 3´ ends immediately downstream of the predicted sRNA base-pairing regions for the uncharacterized mRNA-sRNA interactions <italic>rbsD</italic>-ArcZ, <italic>dctA</italic>-MgrR, and <italic>yebO</italic>-CyaR detected by RIL-seq chimeras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>). In all these instances, the 3´ ends could be a result of the sRNA regulatory effect, and in some cases, may result in the formation of a new sRNA, as we observed for ChiZ. In general, our data further illustrate the complex regulation that occurs once transcription has initiated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Generation of sRNAs from 5´ UTRs and ORF-internal sequences</title><p>Previous studies have shown that intergenic regions and mRNA 3´ UTRs are major sources of regulatory sRNAs, with a few characterized examples of sRNAs derived from 5´ UTRs, and no characterized ORF-internal sRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams and Storz, 2020</xref>). Our data document that 5´ UTRs and ORFs can indeed encode functional base-pairing sRNAs. However, our work also raises important questions, including the mechanisms by which 5´ UTR-derived and ORF-internal sRNAs are generated.</p><p>Given that sRNAs derived from 5´ UTRs only require the generation of a new 3´ RNA end (likely sharing a TSS with their cognate mRNA), and are not usually constrained by codon sequences, they could evolve rapidly. We documented the formation of several 5´ UTR fragments by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory events. These by-products of regulation could obtain independent regulatory functions, as has been reported for a few riboswitches and attenuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DebRoy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melior et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mellin et al., 2014</xref>). The sRNA 3´ end can be formed by intrinsic termination or Rho-dependent termination and/or processing. Importantly, for the downstream mRNA to be expressed, there needs to be some transcriptional readthrough. RNA structure predictions strongly suggest the IspZ 3´ end is generated by intrinsic termination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) for which we observed very little readthrough. In contrast, the ChiZ 3´ end is generated by Rho-dependent termination with significant readthrough that would allow <italic>chiP</italic> expression. The mechanisms that drive formation of either 5´-derived sRNAs or the corresponding full-length mRNAs could be regulated and are an interesting topic for future work.</p><p>Less is known about both the 5´ and 3´ ends of the ORF-internal sRNAs. The ends might be generated by ORF-internal promoters, termination, or RNase processing. In cases where one or both sRNA ends are generated by processing, this is presumably coupled with down-regulation of the overlapping mRNA. Strikingly, the number of sequencing reads for FtsO is orders of magnitude higher than that for the <italic>ftsI</italic> mRNA. How and when FtsO is produced are interesting questions for future studies. It is possible that the <italic>ftsI</italic> mRNA is protected from cleavage by ribosomes during cell division such that FtsO is only generated in the absence of mRNA translation. Other coding sequence-derived sRNAs, such as the putative regulator internal to <italic>mglC</italic>, likely have their own TSS. In some cases, such as <italic>rlmD</italic> int and <italic>ampG</italic> int, a transcript originating from a TSS internal to the cognate mRNA could be processed to form the 5´ end of the sRNA. These observations underscore how the interplay of transcription initiation, transcription termination, and RNase processing leads to many short transcripts that have the potential to evolve independent regulatory functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Roles of 5´ UTR-derived and ORF-internal sRNAs</title><p>We identified and characterized three sRNA sponges that have 3´ ends either in 5´ UTRs or internal to the coding sequence. The first example, ChiZ-ChiX-<italic>chiP</italic>, represents a novel reciprocal autoregulatory loop. ChiZ is generated from the <italic>chiP</italic> 5´ UTR encompassing the site of pairing with the ChiX sRNA. We found ChiZ is formed by Rho-dependent termination, and in the absence of ChiX base pairing with <italic>chiP</italic>. When cells utilize chitobiose as a carbon source and ChiX levels are naturally low, there are higher levels of <italic>chiP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Overgaard et al., 2009</xref>) and likely also higher levels of ChiZ. In this model, when chitooligosaccharides need to be imported, ChiZ prevents ChiX from base pairing, and promotes degradation of ChiX. When metabolic needs shift, the levels of ChiZ could decrease, allowing ChiX to regulate <italic>chiP</italic> and other targets. This may work in competition, conjunction, or at separate times from the <italic>chbBC</italic> intergenic mRNA sequence, which also sponges and promotes decay of ChiX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Overgaard et al., 2009</xref>). It will be interesting to see if other 5´ UTRs and sRNAs form similar autoregulatory loops, since 5´ UTRs are enriched for sRNA pairing sites, and we have shown that sRNA pairing is associated with distinct small transcripts from 5´ UTRs.</p><p>In a second example, we characterized IspZ, which is generated from the 5´ UTR of <italic>ispU</italic> (<italic>uppS</italic>), encoding the synthase for undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP), a lipid carrier for bacterial cell wall carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apfel et al., 1999</xref>). We suggest IspZ may connect cell wall remodeling with the oxidative stress response. Cellular levels of toxic reactive oxygen species are increased when cell wall synthesis is blocked, and oxidative damage impedes <italic>ispU</italic>-related cell wall growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, IspZ downregulation of the hydrogen peroxide-induced sRNA OxyS may dampen the oxidative response at a time when the response might be detrimental.</p><p>While small transcripts from within coding sequences have been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dar and Sorek, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reppas et al., 2006</xref>), and a homolog of FtsO (STnc475) has been detected for <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smirnov et al., 2016</xref>), we are the first to document a regulatory role for a bacterial ORF-internal sRNA. FtsO was found to base pair with, and negatively regulate the membrane stress response sRNA, RybB. The <italic>ftsI</italic> mRNA encodes a low-abundance but essential penicillin-binding protein that is localized to the inner membrane at the division site and cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weiss et al., 1997</xref>). The cell may need to alter its response to membrane stress during the division cycle when many membrane components are needed, and we suggest FtsO could facilitate crosstalk between cell division and membrane stress by regulating RybB activity. Intriguingly, we observed the greatest effect of ethanol addition on RybB levels in the Δ<italic>ftsO</italic> background at 20 min, which is also the doubling time for <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655. While it is reasonable to assume that regulatory sRNAs encoded by intragenic sequences are rare, due to the challenge of encoding two functions in one region of DNA, we think it is likely that other ORF-internal sRNAs have function.</p><p>Our work has significantly increased the number of sRNAs documented to modulate the activities of other sRNAs by sponging their activities, as found for ChiZ, or affecting their levels, as shown for IspZ and FtsO. The findings raise other questions including how many more short transcripts generated by termination or processing have regulatory functions. It also is intriguing that some abundant sRNAs are subject to regulation by multiple sponges, including ChiX, which is regulated by ChiZ and the <italic>chbBC</italic> intergenic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Overgaard et al., 2009</xref>), and RybB, which is regulated by FtsO, RbsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melamed et al., 2020</xref>) and the 3´ETS<sup>leuZ</sup> tRNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lalaouna et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, little is known about how the activities and levels of the sponges themselves are regulated. The levels of some, but not others, are influenced by Hfq binding. A number appear to be constitutively expressed, such that target sRNA levels must increase to overcome the effects of the sponges.</p><p>Further identification and characterization of RNA fragments generated by premature termination or processing, detected by mapping the 5´ and 3´ ends of bacterial transcriptomes, will help elucidate the effects of regulatory RNAs. Our datasets point to a plethora of potential <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory elements in 5´ UTRs and ORF-internal regions, providing a valuable resource for further studies of gene regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

RNA was extracted as described above and analyzed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation System to check the quality. Any contaminating DNA in the samples was removed by treating 15 µg of RNA with 10 U of DNase I (Roche) for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 80 U of recombinant RNase inhibitor (Takara Bio). Next, RNA was purified by mixing the sample with an equal volume of phenol stabilized:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and centrifugation at maximum speed in Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 PRIME).

All these 3´ ends were examined for the first upstream feature (either a TSS or an ORF stop codon). Any 3´ end where the first upstream feature was a stop codon was eliminated, unless there was also a TSS ≤200 bp upstream the 3´ end or that upstream feature was the stop codon of an annotated ‘leader peptide’ on the EcoCyc <italic>E. coli</italic> database (<italic>mgtL</italic>, <italic>speFL</italic>, <italic>hisL</italic>, <italic>ivbL</italic>, <italic>ilvL</italic>, <italic>idlP</italic>, <italic>leuL</italic>, <italic>pheL</italic>, <italic>pheM</italic>, <italic>pyrL</italic>, <italic>rhoL</italic>, <italic>rseD</italic>, <italic>thrL</italic>, <italic>tnaC</italic>, <italic>trpL</italic>, <italic>uof</italic>).

Specifically, we determined how many of the positions in our list of genome coordinates are within a given distance threshold of a genome coordinate from another study. We also performed the reciprocal comparison. Note that the two numbers may differ if two coordinates in one study are close to one coordinate in the other; hence, we include both numbers in the Venn diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. To determine the extent of overlap between lists we calculated the proportion of the genome that is within the given distance threshold of each genome coordinate in a single list. We then divided this number by double the genome size (doubled to account for the two possible strands), to determine the frequency with which a randomly selected genomic position would overlap with a genome coordinate in that list. We assessed the statistical significance of the overlap between lists of genome coordinates by using a hypergeometric test to compare the number of overlapping positions and the frequency expected by chance. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2C</xref>, 19 of the 296 3´ ends in the LB 0.4 dataset are within 10 nt of a 3´ end in the Dar and Sorek dataset. We determined how many genomic positions are within 10 nt of a position in the Dar and Sorek dataset (22899 positions). The input parameters for the hypergeometric test were 219 (number of successes), 296 (sample size), 22899 (number of successes in the population), and 9283304 (population size; twice the genome length, to account for the two possible orientations).

The work is expected to boost future studies looking into bacterial sRNAs derived from 5'UTRs or ORFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> and beyond.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Regulatory roles of 5' UTR and ORF-internal RNAs detected by 3' end mapping&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Alexander Westermann as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Masatoshi Miyakoshi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present study, you have comprehensively identified the 3' ends of transcripts in <italic>E. coli</italic> and demonstrated that many arise from premature transcription termination in either Rho-dependent or intrinsic manner. As a result, you discovered numerous stable RNAs derived from 5'UTRs or CDSs and functionally characterized several of these &quot;unconventional&quot; RNAs as sponges of well-studied Hfq-dependent small RNAs. The reviewers all agreed that this is impressive work, the findings are novel and relevant for researchers within the microbiology and RNA communities and may inspire future studies of non-canonical bacterial sRNAs. Overall, they deem the results convincingly supported by the experimental data, but would like to see a few more experimental and analytical amendments to your work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Comparison of global data sets: For cross-comparison, it would be advisable that the current data sets and previously published ones were analyzed consistently. This might increase the overlap between the results of the different studies.</p><p>a) Term-seq: The computational method used to process the current Term-seq data is different from the one presented in the original Term-seq paper of Dar and Sorek. The authors should explain why they turned to a different computational pipeline and – for cross-comparison – reanalyze the published data set from Dar and Sorek with their own computational methodology, or analyze their results by Dar and Sorek's computational method.</p><p>b) Rho-dependent termination: Since the authors here made the effort to treat the cells with BCM and generate sequencing libraries, it is not clear why they did not simply carry out Term-seq following BCM treatment and compared the identified 3' ends to those determined without BCM. Rather, the authors followed the analysis pipeline of Dar and Sorek who used available data of BCM-treated cells from Peters et al., 2012, and therefore could only evaluate the readthrough in the vicinity of determined 3' ends. Here also, the authors modified the computational method of Dar and Sorek. This needs justification and the parameters used should be explained (e.g. why using a window size of 500 nt and threshold of the Rho score of 2). For cross-comparison of the results, the Dar and Sorek data set and the current data set should be analyzed by the same method.</p><p>2) Evaluation of statistical significance: It is not always clear how the reported p-values of the hypergeometric tests were computed, and it is not possible to re-compute them as the value of N was not provided. Please verify that p (x{greater than or equal to} actual result) was computed and provide the details of the computation for all hypergeometric tests included in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Experimental validation: Several newly discovered 3' termination sites were tested experimentally. From the reported results it seems that all tested sites were validated by wet-lab experiments. Could the authors explain how the individual examples were selected? Were there any predicted 3' ends that could not be validated experimentally? If so, reporting true vs. false positives would provide another assessment of the reliability of the data.</p><p>4) Rho-dependent premature termination (–subsection “Novel sites of regulation are predicted by 3´ ends and Rho termination regions in 5´ UTRs”; Figure 2D, E, F): The results obtained from some of the northern blots seem confusing in light of the corresponding LacZ reporter assays. For example, the galactosidase experiments with cells from OD 0.4~0.6 showed an increase of LacZ activity in the rhoR66S mutant for most reporters, as expected (Figure 2D, E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). On the other hand, in several cases the northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from cells at OD 0.4 revealed the increase of prematurely terminated 5'UTR fragments in the rhoR66S strain (Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Wouldn't these 5' fragments be expected to accumulate in the WT – rather than the R66S – strain, if they were generated through Rho-dependent termination? The authors' hypothesis that increased levels of longer transcripts in the absence of Rho could be processed to give rise to these shorter products (see the aforementioned subsection) could be better explained. In parallel, the northern blot membranes should be re-hybridized with probes for some of the sequences downstream of the termination sites to corroborate this assumption.</p><p>5) sRNA sponges: The exact effect of RybB on FtsO has not been clarified in the manuscript (subsection “ORF-internal FtsO is an sRNA sponge”). When RybB is abundant, the level of FtsO is reduced (Figure 7B). This may be indicative of coupled degradation upon base-pairing between FtsO and RybB. However, when RybB was induced by ethanol (Figure 7E), the level of FtsO was unchanged (or even increased), probably attributable to transcriptional activation of ftsI. To clarify the reciprocal regulation between RybB and FtsO and the consequences of their interaction, the half-life of each sRNA in the presence or absence of its counterpart sRNA should be quantified. Additionally, the (indirect) effect of FtsO on the RybB target <italic>ompC</italic> is not very pronounced (Figure 7E). Could the authors please quantify this effect on the protein level (e.g. by western blot, ß-gal assay) to further support the notion that FtsO-mediated sponging of RybB translates into a de-repression of RybB targets?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62438.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Comparison of global data sets: For cross-comparison, it would be advisable that the current data sets and previously published ones were analyzed consistently.

For example, the Term-seq paper of Dar and Sorek does not globally identify 3´ ends and rather only reports 3´ ends directly downstream of annotated ORFs. Therefore, we only compared our “primary 3´ ends” (downstream of annotated ORFs) to this dataset. As another example, the study by Ju et al. published one table of 3´ ends identified from logarithmic and stationary phase grown bacteria together, without distinguishing 3´ ends identified in each condition. Therefore, we compared our 3´ ends identified from LB 0.4 and 2.0 conditions to this dataset. We feel that this approach most accurately compares the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Term-seq: The computational method used to process the current Term-seq data is different from the one presented in the original Term-seq paper of Dar and Sorek.

The “at least 4 reads” threshold of the Dar and Sorek method is completely dependent on the sequencing depth of the particular replicate and the characteristics of the experiment, so it is difficult to generalize this threshold to other experiments. Furthermore the Dar and Sorek method does not take into account replicate variability.</p><p>Our method instead starts with a peak-calling step using the scipy.signal.find_peaks function commonly used in electronic signal processing. This is then followed by a statistically-founded comparison of replicate reproducibility (irreproducible discovery rate, IDR) which uses a rank-based approach to identify peaks that are both strong and consistent among replicates. Taken together, these two steps, as implemented in our open-source term-seq peak-calling package <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NICHD-BSPC/termseq-peaks">https://github.com/NICHD-BSPC/termseq-peaks</ext-link> result in a method that is agnostic to sample coverage and that at the same time takes into account replicate variability by scoring highly those peaks found at consistent ranks across replicates. Empirically, we observe that our method´s results match manual observations in the genome browser much better than the Dar and Sorek approach. Furthermore, we have successfully used the same method with two other bacterial species (in unpublished work), supporting the generality of our approach.</p><p>As suggested, we reanalyzed the data in the Dar and Sorek paper using our algorithm and compared these 3´ ends to ours. The results have been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 2. The following statement has been added to the main text “Given that a previous <italic>E. coli</italic> Term-seq study only reported 3´ ends downstream annotated genes (Dar and Sorek, 2018b), we also used our 3´ end calling algorithm to re-analyze the sequencing data from this study (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). Again, there was significant overlap (hypergeometric test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e<sup>-16</sup>), but 51% were unique to our study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Rho-dependent termination: Since the authors here made the effort to treat the cells with BCM and generate sequencing libraries, it is not clear why they did not simply carry out Term-seq following BCM treatment and compared the identified 3' ends to those determined without BCM.

For cross-comparison of the results, the Dar and Sorek data set and the current data set should be analyzed by the same method.</p></disp-quote><p>Term-seq +/-BCM would not be effective for identification of all Rho-dependent terminators since our data show that, in many cases, 3´ end abundance does not decrease following BCM treatment. This is presumably because the 3´ ends are generated by RNase processing rather than directly by Rho, and the processing can occur even when transcription reads through the terminator. Our approach assessed the Rho scores for all regions in the DirectRNA-seq data (not only for 3´ ends identified by Term-seq, although we did score each of the Term-seq 3´ ends specifically for Rho termination). Supplementary file 2 is a list of all the putative Rho termination regions identified from DirectRNA-seq alone.</p><p>The window size and thresholds we used were somewhat arbitrary. Prompted by the reviewer comments, we performed an empirical analysis of these parameters, allowing us to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of our approach. As a consequence, we made several improvements to our analysis pipeline, although the basic approach is unchanged: we count the number of sequence reads in DirectRNA-seq data in a window upstream and a window downstream of the genome coordinate of interest, for untreated and BCM-treated datasets. We then compare these numbers, looking for cases where the downstream:upstream ratio is higher in the BCM-treated dataset than in the untreated dataset. While the new pipeline is fundamentally similar to the old one, there are several important improvements. First, we no longer use the Rho score to set a cut-off for calling Rho-dependent terminators. Using the Rho score required us to set a threshold for the minimum number of reads in each window, to avoid taking ratios of very small numbers. We now use a Fisher’s exact test to compare the scores for each window, obviating the need for a minimum read count threshold.</p><p>Second, we have increased the window size to 800 nt. This is based on a thorough ROC analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Specifically, we selected the 50 most Rho-dependent, and the 50 least Rho-dependent terminators identified by Dar and Sorek; these served as true positive and true negatives, respectively. We then calculated the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) using our method with different p-value cut-offs (From the Fisher’s exact test). Thus, we generated ROC plots that show FPR and TPR across a range of p-value cut-offs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, left panel, for an 800 nt window size). We generated ROC plots for different window sizes (100 -1000 nt, in 100 nt increments). The window size that gave the highest area under the curve in the ROC plots was 800 nt (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right panel). We also carried out similar analysis using different upstream and downstream window sizes, including the window sizes used by Dar and Sorek, but the ROC area under the curve values were invariably lower than those we determined for an 800 nt window on both sides. Using an 800 nt window size, we selected the p-value cut-off that gives the largest value of TPR-FPR, which in this case is a difference of 0.64 (TPR = 0.72, FPR = 0.08; circled datapoint in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, left panel). Finally, we applied these parameters to call peaks from the DirectRNA-seq data, identifying 1,078 putative sites of Rho-dependent termination. Importantly, the regions around these sites have a similar C:G ratio to the previous list (Figure 1D), and to putative sites of Rho termination identified by Peters et al.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62438-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Evaluation of statistical significance: It is not always clear how the reported p-values of the hypergeometric tests were computed, and it is not possible to re-compute them as the value of N was not provided.

The input parameters for the hypergeometric test were 219 (number of successes), 296 (sample size), 22899 (number of successes in the population), and 9283304 (population size; twice the genome length, to account for the two possible orientations).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experimental validation: Several newly discovered 3' termination sites were tested experimentally.

We think the numbers assayed by northern analysis are too few to be able to comment on true versus false positives. The text was changed to better convey this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Rho-dependent premature termination (–subsection “Novel sites of regulation are predicted by 3´ ends and Rho termination regions in 5´ UTRs”; Figure 2D, E, F): The results obtained from some of the northern blots seem confusing in light of the corresponding LacZ reporter assays. For example, the galactosidase experiments with cells from OD 0.4~0.6 showed an increase of LacZ activity in the rhoR66S mutant for most reporters, as expected (Figure 2D, E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). On the other hand, in several cases the northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from cells at OD 0.4 revealed the increase of prematurely terminated 5'UTR fragments in the rhoR66S strain (Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Wouldn't these 5' fragments be expected to accumulate in the WT – rather than the R66S – strain, if they were generated through Rho-dependent termination? The authors' hypothesis that increased levels of longer transcripts in the absence of Rho could be processed to give rise to these shorter products (see the aforementioned subsection) could be better explained. In parallel, the northern blot membranes should be re-hybridized with probes for some of the sequences downstream of the termination sites to corroborate this assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also very surprised by this accumulation of 5´ UTR fragments in the rhoR66S strain but found this to be true in many of the examples we examined. The 3´ ends generated following premature Rho termination are likely due to processing by exonucleases. This can still happen in transcripts where RNA polymerase has read through the terminator, assuming there is an endonuclease that cuts downstream.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we now try to explain our hypothesis better. We also used the RNA samples in Figure 2F for an agarose gel northern, which we probed for the coding sequences (downstream of the identified 3´ ends) for <italic>cfa</italic>, <italic>cyaA</italic>, <italic>speA</italic> and <italic>mdtJI</italic>. These blots, added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1, showed much higher levels of read-through in the rhoR66S mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) sRNA sponges: The exact effect of RybB on FtsO has not been clarified in the manuscript (subsection “ORF-internal FtsO is an sRNA sponge”). When RybB is abundant, the level of FtsO is reduced (Figure 7B). This may be indicative of coupled degradation upon base-pairing between FtsO and RybB. However, when RybB was induced by ethanol (Figure 7E), the level of FtsO was unchanged (or even increased), probably attributable to transcriptional activation of ftsI. To clarify the reciprocal regulation between RybB and FtsO and the consequences of their interaction, the half-life of each sRNA in the presence or absence of its counterpart sRNA should be quantified. Additionally, the (indirect) effect of FtsO on the RybB target ompC is not very pronounced (Figure 7E). Could the authors please quantify this effect on the protein level (e.g. by western blot, ß-gal assay) to further support the notion that FtsO-mediated sponging of RybB translates into a de-repression of RybB targets?</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out a number of additional experiments to address the several different issues raised in this comment. (i) To test whether there is coupled degradation upon base pairing between FtsO and RybB, we examined the effect of RybB overexpression on FtsO levels (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A). We found that indeed, there is a reciprocal effect of RybB on FtsO for stationary phase cells. This is now discussed in the text. (ii) To further test the effect of FtsO on the RybB target <italic>ompC</italic>, we compared <italic>ompC</italic> mRNA and protein levels upon overexpression of FtsO and the previously characterized RybB sponge, RbsZ (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B). With both FtsO and RbsZ we observed clear increases in the levels of the <italic>ompC</italic> mRNA, but no obvious effects on the OmpC protein. This is likely due to abundant, stable levels of OmpC present at this condition. This is now stated and discussed in the text. We also re-ran the agarose northern in Figure 8E (previously Figure 7E) to have a better quality 5S signal.</p></body></sub-article></article>
