However, the mechanism by which the recognition memory controls feeding is unclear. Here, we show that the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> forms a memory of particular foods after experience and displays behavioral plasticity, increasing the feeding response when they subsequently recognize the familiar food. We found that recognition of familiar food activates the pair of ADF chemosensory neurons, which subsequently increase serotonin release. The released serotonin activates the feeding response mainly by acting humorally and directly activates SER-7, a type 7 serotonin receptor, in MC motor neurons in the feeding organ. Our data suggest that worms sense the taste and/or smell of novel bacteria, which overrides the stimulatory effect of familiar bacteria on feeding by suppressing the activity of ADF or its upstream neurons. Our study provides insight into the mechanism by which familiarity discrimination alters behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00329.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00329.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00329.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many species, including our own, show a preference for familiar foods over novel ones.

The nervous system senses diverse extrinsic and intrinsic cues, integrates the information and activates muscle movements that are required for food intake. The nervous system also stores past food experiences, which change the pattern of food intake. Dissection of the neural pathways that control food intake is not only a key to stop the epidemic of obesity and eating disorders, but may also provide insight into fundamental problems in neuroscience such as sensory perception and learning and memory.</p><p>Recognition is the ability to identify and to judge a recently encountered item as having been presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</xref>). In response to previously encountered stimuli, this ability allows knowledge gained from prior experience to guide animals to respond with an altered output that is beneficial for their survival. Recognition is classified into two types: recollection and familiarity discrimination. Recollection is knowledge of prior occurrence with vivid contextual details. In contrast, familiarity discrimination is mere sensation of prior occurrence and thus does not accompany episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</xref>). Accumulated studies show that mere exposure to particular food alters subsequent consumption of the food in many different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pliner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang and Provenza, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Cenzano and Chotro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morin-Audebrand et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that feeding regulation by familiarity discrimination is conserved across species. Some species including humans consume familiar food more actively than novel food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diaz-Cenzano and Chotro, 2010</xref>), probably to avoid possible pathogens. In contrast, other species consume familiar food less actively than novel food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang and Provenza, 1996</xref>), probably to assure balanced nutrition intake. Despite extensive studies of recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seoane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Uslaner et al., in press</xref>) and subsequent behavioral plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kravitz, 1988</xref>), the mechanisms by which familiarity discrimination alters food intake are still poorly understood.</p><p>Its genetic tractability and simple anatomy make the bacteria-eating roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schafer, 2005</xref>) an attractive model system for study of the process. Although it is unknown if familiarity discrimination alters food intake in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the following observations support the possibility: The nervous system in <italic>C. elegans</italic> senses various aspects of food, such as the efficiency with which it supports growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>) and its pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), and triggers behavioral plasticity. The nervous system can also form memories of various olfactory or gustatory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann, 2006</xref>), which is likely to be crucial for the recognition of familiar food. Here, we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> discriminates familiar food from novel food and selectively increases feeding in response to familiar food. Using the behavioral pattern that we identified, we uncover the mechanism by which familiarity discrimination increases the feeding response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recognition of familiar bacteria increases the feeding response in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>To test if familiarity discrimination alters feeding in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we tested if exposure to a particular bacterium alters its subsequent consumption. For this assay, we trained wild-type animals to develop familiarity either to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> HB101 (H) or to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> DA1878 (D) (also called B7 in our previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>) by exposing the animals to one or the other bacterium from the first larval stage (L1) until adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). HB101 and DA1878 are benign bacteria that support the growth of <italic>C. elegans</italic> at a similar rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>). Once the animals reached adulthood, we compared feeding rates on previously experienced bacteria (HH and DD groups) to feeding rates on novel bacteria (DH and HD groups) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see ‘Feeding assay’ and ‘Statistical analysis and data presentation’ in ‘Materials and methods’ for details). We found that the feeding rates of the animals on familiar bacteria were significantly higher than the rates on novel bacteria, regardless of bacterial type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The increased feeding rates on familiar food compared to the rates on novel food persisted 7–8 hr after the training was over, supporting that worms discriminate familiar food from novel food and that recognition of familiar bacteria increases feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Consistent with this, the familiar food-induced increase in feeding was not affected by the worm's nutritional status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). We then tested if the behavior is selective for the two tested bacteria by repeating the experiment using other benign bacterial strains, <italic>Enterobacteria</italic> JU54 and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> PA14 <italic>pstP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tan et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with the idea that mere exposure to any benign bacterium increases subsequent consumption of that bacterium, the feeding rates on familiar bacteria were higher than the rates on novel bacteria, regardless of bacteria type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). Finally, we considered the possibility that cultivation on two different bacteria caused the differences in feeding rates on familiar food and novel food by affecting development. If the feeding differences are caused by developmental differences, not familiarity discrimination, an exposure to particular bacteria during adulthood is not expected to cause an increased feeding response to the bacteria. However, 9 hr of exposure to a particular bacterium during adulthood was sufficient to induce a preferential response to that bacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). In contrast to 9 hr, 6-hr exposure to the training food failed to increase subsequent consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), suggesting that the behavioral plasticity was determined by the duration of exposure to the training food. These data imply that <italic>C. elegans</italic> forms a recognition memory of particular bacteria after experience, which allows the worms to discriminate familiar bacteria from novel bacteria, and that the recognition of familiar bacteria increases the feeding response.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00329.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recognition of familiar food increases feeding response in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

However, the serotonin effect on feeding was tested only on familiar bacteria; thus it is unknown if the serotonin feeding signaling is activated by novel bacteria. We thus hypothesized that recognition of familiar bacteria might increase the feeding response by activating serotonin signaling. To test our hypothesis, we first tested if a <italic>tph-1</italic> null mutation suppresses the difference in the feeding rates between animals on familiar bacteria and novel bacteria. <italic>tph-1</italic> encodes a tryptophan hydroxylase required for serotonin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sze et al., 2000</xref>). We found no difference in the feeding rates between the <italic>tph-1</italic> null mutant animals on familiar bacteria and novel bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4A,B and 5</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous serotonin treatment increased the feeding rates on novel food to rates comparable to those on familiar food without affecting the rates on familiar food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These data suggest that recognition of familiar bacteria indeed increased feeding rate by activating serotonin signaling. To find out which serotonin receptors mediate the serotonin action on feeding, we compared the feeding rates between wild-type and serotonin receptor null mutants in presence of serotonin. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes four serotonin-activated G protein coupled receptors, SER-1, SER-4, SER-5 and SER-7, and a serotonin-gated Cl<sup>−</sup> channel MOD-1. Among the tested mutants, only the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant failed to activate feeding in presence of serotonin, confirming the previous report that serotonin activates feeding via a type 7 serotonin receptor SER-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hobson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song and Avery, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with the idea that serotonin increases feeding via SER-7 in response to familiar food, the feeding rates of <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutants on familiar food were substantially decreased compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Furthermore, no differences were found in the feeding rates among the <italic>tph-1</italic> single null mutant, the <italic>ser-7</italic> single null mutant and the <italic>tph-1; ser-7</italic> double null mutant on familiar bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Since SER-7 is the major receptor to mediate the serotonin action, we initially expected no difference between feeding rates of the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant on familiar food and novel food, as for the <italic>tph-1</italic> null mutant. When the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant animals were tested on DA1878, the feeding rates of the animals did not differ on familiar and novel food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4F and 7B,D</xref>). However, when the animals were tested on HB101, the feeding rate of the animals was lower on familiar test food than on novel test food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4E and 7A,C</xref>). To resolve the unexpected observation, we examined feeding rates in wild type and the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant animals in the presence or absence of serotonin. Serotonin suppressed feeding in the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that serotonin suppresses as well as activates feeding. We also found that null mutations in <italic>ser-4</italic> and <italic>mod-1</italic> completely relieved the suppression of feeding by serotonin in the <italic>ser-7</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that serotonin suppressed feeding by acting on SER-4 and MOD-1. In support of the idea that the inhibitory serotonin signal via SER-4 and MOD-1 is active only on familiar food, the feeding rates of the <italic>ser-4; mod-1; ser-7</italic> triple null mutant were greater than the rates of the <italic>ser-7</italic> single null mutant on familiar food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4E,F and 7C,D</xref>) whereas the feeding rates of the two mutant animals were not different on novel food. Interestingly, the amount of suppression by the inhibitory serotonin signal on familiar food, that is the difference between feeding rates of the <italic>ser-4; mod-1; ser-7</italic> mutant and the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant animals on familiar food, was greater on HB101 than DA1878 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4E,F and 7F</xref>). Although it is not clear why the activities of the inhibitory serotonin signal on the two bacteria are different, it explains the unexpected observation seen in the feeding rate differences between the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant animals on familiar food and novel food in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>. We next tested whether the inhibitory serotonin signal is essential for recognition of familiar food or its regulation of feeding by comparing the feeding rates of the <italic>ser-4; mod-1</italic> double null mutant animals on familiar food and novel food. Consistent with the idea that SER-7 is the major serotonin receptor, the double mutant, like wild type, showed increased feeding responses on familiar food compared to novel food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00329.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Recognition of familiar food increases feeding response by activating serotonin signaling via SER-7.

A <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutation suppressed the rescue effect of restoring serotonin in ADF in the <italic>tph-1</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). To understand how serotonin increases feeding at a neural circuit level, we asked where SER-7 acts. SER-7 is expressed mostly in pharyngeal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hobson et al., 2006</xref>), which regulate the motions of pharyngeal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avery and Horvitz, 1989</xref>). Among the pharyngeal neurons, MC is particularly interesting because it is essential for normal fast feeding on bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avery and Horvitz, 1989</xref>), and SER-7 was suggested to activate MC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hobson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song and Avery, 2012</xref>). To ask if SER-7 acts in MC, we expressed SER-7 in the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant using the <italic>flp-21</italic> and the <italic>flp-2</italic> promoters. The <italic>flp-21</italic> and the <italic>flp-2</italic> promoters drive expression in several neurons, and the expression patterns of the two promoters overlap only in MC and M4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Li, 2004</xref>). We found that both <italic>pflp-21::</italic>SER-7 and <italic>pflp-2::</italic>SER-7 fully rescued the feeding rate in the <italic>ser-7</italic> mutant in response to familiar food as well as serotonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>; Part of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref> were reported previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song and Avery, 2012</xref> and were re-analyzed and presented here.). In contrast, expression of SER-7 in M4 and occasionally in M2 using the <italic>ser-7b</italic> promoter failed to alter the pumping rate and had only a small effect on pumping in the <italic>ser-7</italic> null mutant in response to serotonin and familiar food, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>), suggesting that SER-7 in MC activates pharyngeal pumping. The failure of rescue is unlikely to be due to insufficient expression because expression of the rescue construct significantly activated isthmus peristalsis, the other feeding motion in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which is controlled by M4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song and Avery, 2012</xref>). To test whether SER-7 indeed acts through MC, we used an <italic>eat-2</italic> null mutation to test if blocking neurotransmission from MC suppresses the rescue effect of <italic>pflp-21</italic>::SER-7 in the <italic>ser-7</italic> mutant. <italic>eat-2</italic> encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit specifically localized in the pharyngeal muscles postsynaptic to MC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKay et al., 2004</xref>).

In summary, we conclude that serotonin released from extrapharyngeal ADF increased feeding in response to familiar bacteria mainly by activating SER-7 in MC directly, which in turn activates cholinergic transmission from MC to the pharyngeal muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Recognition of familiar bacteria activates ADF and increases serotonin release from ADF</title><p>We next asked why ADF increases feeding response on familiar but not novel bacteria. A simple explanation is that only familiar bacteria can activate ADF, and this activation causes increased serotonin release. We tested the hypothesis first by asking if ADF is more active on familiar bacteria than novel bacteria by directly measuring the response of the ADF neurons to novel and familiar bacteria using ratiometric calcium imaging. For this, we imaged the ADF neurons using the genetically-encoded calcium sensor Cameleon YC3.60. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration were reported as changes in the ratio of fluorescence emission at distinct wavelengths (ΔR/R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>). Slow yet substantial increases in the activity of ADF neurons, reported as an increase in ΔR/R, were observed in response to familiar food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A,B</xref>).

There are several other possible explanations for the greater increase on familiar food than novel food that we cannot exclude, such as increased efficiency of serotonin uptake in serotonin-uptaking cells or increased serotonin release from NSM on familiar food compared to novel food.

To get insight into the mechanism, we tested if worms recognize familiar bacteria by their taste or smell. For this, we examined feeding rates of worms on bacteria mixed with LB broth or with medium conditioned by one of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). The conditioned media do not contain any bacterial particles, thus, if the media alter the feeding responses to familiar food or novel food, it suggests that gustatory or olfactory cues in the media were sensed by worms and affected discrimination of familiar food from novel food. We found that the media from bacteria that are familiar to the tested worms did not alter the feeding responses to the novel bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B,C</xref>).

These results, together with the fact that the conditioned media did not affect feeding rates on familiar food or novel food of the same bacterial type as those that conditioned the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B,C</xref>), indicate that taste and/or smell of novel bacteria overrides the stimulatory effect of familiar bacteria and suppresses feeding activation.

We first showed that regulation of feeding by familiarity discrimination is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by showing that (1) Prior exposure to particular bacteria selectively increases feeding in response to those bacteria; (2) The behavior depends on the duration of exposure, but not on the timing of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or nutritional status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>); (3) <italic>C. elegans</italic> retains the memory of familiar bacteria for at least 7 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E and 2B–E</xref>). We speculate that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system may have evolved this way to increase the probability of consuming wholesome food by using past food experiences as in higher vertebrates and humans.

We destroyed both ADFs or NSMs in newly hatched GR1333 larvae (0–4 hr old) using a MicroPoint laser ablation system (Andor Technology USA, South Windsor, CT). For laser ablation, we mounted the larvae on 2% agarose pads containing 10 mM sodium azide. To minimize the variation caused by sodium azide, we retrieved all the mock-operated and the putative ADF-ablated animals from the agarose pad after the same incubation time (12 min). Mock-operated groups were treated in the same way except that the laser was not fired. The retrieved animals were cultured on HB101 until adulthood. After 7 hr of starvation, feeding assays were performed as described in ‘Materials and methods’. Successful ablation of ADFs was confirmed by absence of the ADF or NSM GFP signals. Only data from animals in which both ADFs or NSMs were specifically destroyed are included.</p></sec><sec id="s5-6"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>One-day-old adults were placed in a T-shaped microfluidic chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>), with the tip of their nose exposed to constantly flowing LB broth. After 30–50 s, the solution was switched to LB broth containing either DA1878 or HB101 bacteria (OD = 10.0). ADF neurons were visualized through a Zeiss plan-apochromat 63X, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Excitation light (436/10 nm) was provided by an X-cite 120 illuminator (Lumen Dynamics Group Inc, Ontario, Canada). For ratiometric imaging, images in cyan (480/15 nm) and yellow (535/20 nm) wavelength bands were simultaneously acquired by the calcium imaging camera (Hamamatsu; ORCA-AG, Bridgewater, NJ) by means of a beam splitter (Optical Insights; OI-DV-FC, Tucson, AZ). The camera was controlled by Micromanager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Frames were acquired at 2–10 Hz with a 8 × 8 binning. The resulting images were analyzed off-line using custom analysis routines written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Briefly, fluorescence intensity I in the 480 and 535 nm wavelength images was measured in a circular region of interest (ROI) centered on the neuron. Background fluorescence I' was measured in a second ROI surrounding the first one. The raw emission ratio was computed as R = (I<sub>535</sub> − I'<sub>535</sub>)/(I<sub>480</sub> − I'<sub>480</sub>) − 0.65, where the latter term corrects for 480-nm channel bleed-through into the 535-nm channel. This raw emission ratio was corrected for photobleaching and normalized by fitting a single exponential function to the emission ratio trace and dividing the latter by the fitted function; thus all ratio changes were expressed in terms of changes in fluorescence, ΔR/R.<fig id="fig16" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00329.018</object-id><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>The schematic of the experimental setup for calcium imaging.</title><p>The microfluidic chamber consisted of a T-shaped channel formed in PDMS bonded to a glass coverslip.

Just after the 7-hr starvation we divided each group into three equal subgroups and fixed one. The remaining two groups were separately refed on either DA1878 or HB101 and fixed after 1 hr. This assay could not be done immediately after training because most of the serotonin-uptaking cells were serotonin positive in DA2300 as in wild type worms. The background was too high to detect any increase in serotonin release. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a protocol from Curtis Loer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://home.sandiego.edu/~cloer/loerlab/anti5htlong.html">http://home.sandiego.edu/∼cloer/loerlab/anti5htlong.html</ext-link>) with the following antibodies: anti-serotonin rabbit IGG: S5545 (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc), Anti-GFP chicken IGG: GFP-1020 (Aves Labs, Inc), ALEXA FLOUR 488 goat anti-chicken IGG: A11039 (Invitrogen Corporation), Cy-3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IGG: 711-165-152 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Failure of the co-immunostaining against serotonin and against GFP was 0%. The GFP signal was used to identify serotonergic neurons (<italic>ptph-1::gfp</italic>) and to find transgenics that express <italic>tph-1</italic> cDNA in ADF (<italic>psrh-142::tph-1::gfp</italic>). Due to <italic>Is[ptph-1::gfp]</italic> in DA2299 and DA2300, GFP signal was found in NSM, ADF, HSN and sporadically in RIH and AIM in all animals. Although <italic>ptph-1::gfp</italic> expresses GFP in ADF, we could still recognize the transgenic animals that express <italic>Ex[psrh-142::tph-1::gfp]</italic> because GFP signal in ADF is much stronger in those transgenics. The strong GFP signal in ADF was perfectly correlated with serotonin signal. In DA2300, serotonin signal was found in four different classes of serotonergic neurons (ADF, NSM, RIH and AIM). In DA2299, the control strain that is defective in serotonin uptake, serotonin signal was found only in ADF. Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510-meta confocal microscope using a 40× oil-immersion objective.</p></sec><sec id="s5-8"><title>Quantification of serotonin-positive neurons</title><p>To calculate the increase in the average number of serotonin-positive serotonin-uptaking cells during 1 hr of refeeding for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>), we first blindly counted the number of serotonin positive AIMs and RIH from each animal and calculated the average number for each group. ADF, NSM and HSN were not included because serotonin was detected in all ADFs and NSMs even before refeeding and in none of HSNs even after refeeding. To minimize variation, only the animals expressing TPH-1 in both ADFs (as indicated by the presence of the strong GFP signal from <italic>psrh-142::tph-1::gfp</italic>) were considered for counting the number of serotonin positive AIMs and RIH. Then, we subtracted the baselines from each familiar and novel food group as follows: (Serotonin positive cell)<sub>HD/HH</sub> = (Average number of serotonin positive AIMs and RIH)<sub>HD/HH</sub> − (Average number of serotonin positive AIMs and RIH)<sub>H.</sub> (Serotonin positive cells)<sub>DH/DD</sub> = (Average number of serotonin positive AIMs and RIH)<sub>DH/DD</sub> − (Average number of serotonin positive AIMs and RIH)<sub>D.</sub> For data presentation, we combined the values from three independent experiments (see ‘Detailed data analysis’ in ‘Materials and methods’ for details).</p></sec><sec id="s5-9"><title>Assay of the effect of serotonin on feeding</title><p>To examine serotonin effects on feeding rate in absence of bacteria, feeding rates were quantified from 3- to5-hr-old L1 larvae that had never been exposed to bacteria. The feeding assay was performed with L1 larvae because it was easier to examine feeding responses of developmentally synchronized worms that are free from bacteria in large numbers. The strategy is particularly useful for the developmentally retarded mutants that carry <italic>eat-2(ad465)</italic>, which makes comparisons of the feeding rates in adults rather difficult. We confirmed that the effects of single null mutations of the serotonin receptors in response to serotonin are consistent in L1 and adults (data not shown) and thus, it is likely that our observations made in L1 larvae are still valid in adults. After collecting embryos by egg preparation, we incubated them on unseeded NGM plates for 2 hr. Newly hatched L1 larvae (0- to 2-hr-old) were then transferred to unseeded NGM plates and incubated for 3 hr. 15 min after mounting the larvae (3- to 5-hr-old) on 2% agarose pads containing 20 mM serotonin (H7752, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) in M9, the feeding motions of each larva were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 63× objective. 2-min videos were taken from each larva with a Hitachi kP-160 CCD camera and digitized using Adobe Premiere v6.5 for quantification of feeding rates. Each experiment continued for 1 hr. Feeding rates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig8">Figures 4G and 8E</xref> were calculated by averaging two measurements per animal (pumps per 55 s).</p></sec><sec id="s5-10"><title>Statistical analysis and data presentation</title><p>Except the data that are analysed by one-way ANOVA or by Student t test, data were statistically analysed by both the unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and the Mann–Whitney U test (two-tailed). The two tests produced the same conclusions for all data analyses. For data presentation, the more conservative p value was selected. Only the familiar food group and the novel food group that were tested on the same test food were compared since the feeding rates on HB101 were significantly higher than the rate on DA1878 (in non-starved wild-type worms [p=0.006] and in 7–8 hr starved wild-type worms [p=0.003]), on JU54 (p=0.003) and since the feeding rate on PA14 <italic>pstP</italic> was significantly higher than the rate on HB101 (p<italic>=</italic>0.001). The <italic>ser-7</italic> effect on the feeding rate (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) for each food condition was calculated by subtracting the averaged feeding rate of the <italic>ser-7</italic> mutant from the rate of wild-type worms that were tested under each food condition. Student's <italic>t-</italic>test (two-tailed) was used to compare the <italic>ser-7</italic> effects on feeding rate between HH and DH groups, and between DD and HD groups (see ‘Detailed data analysis’ in ‘Materials and methods’ for details). GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) was used for statistical analysis. The effects of inhibitory serotonin signal on feeding rates in HH and DD groups (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) were calculated and compared as for the <italic>ser-7</italic> effect using the feeding rates of the <italic>ser-7</italic> single mutant and the <italic>ser-4; mod-1; ser-7</italic> triple mutant.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Peggy Mason served as the Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>Your work is thorough, interesting, and novel. Attention to the following points would further strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>* Not all pairwise combinations are tested in behavioral assays with HB101 always being tested against one of the others. The consistency of the behavioral results mitigates this concern but the lack of a second comparison is more problematic in the Ca++ imaging study.</p><p>* Is it possible to elicit pharyngeal pumping by ADF activation?</p><p>* Day-to-day variations in feeding rates are as large or larger than the familiarity effect. Depending on how the experiments were done, this could be of serious concern or simply puzzling. It should be stated explicitly whether experiments and controls for every comparison were done on the same day, using the same reagents. The variability in baseline pumping rate appears as an issue in much of the data and is of particular concern with regard to drawing negative conclusions (e.g., Figure 5a, Figure 8c–d).</p><p>* What were the actual values of R, i.e., of the exponential fit of the baseline I535/I480 ratio and their variations? Do <italic>ADF::gfp</italic> animals display similar rates of bleaching? The average values of the individual yellow and cyan channels should also be presented. A description of the design of the microfluidic chip (or a reference) should be given. How much time passed from picking to imaging?</p><p>[Editors' note: the following comments were sent to the authors upon evaluating the revised manuscript.]</p><p>One issue that still concerns us is the day-to-day variation issue. Of course we understand that variation happens. At the same time, the range of the day-to-day variation (about 100 pumps/min) is larger than the size of the effect (about 20). Your response mentions that you always tested worms in two conditions at the same time, and on the same day with the same reagents. Then you state that you combined data from 3–5 experiments (meaning 3–5 days presumably) together. This latter methodology makes the variability more difficult to understand. Why wouldn't the day-to-day variation average out similarly across groups? Moreover, if similar numbers of experiment- and control-animals were not assayed in each experiment, then how can data from the different days be grouped together (unless there was no day-by-day variation)? It is therefore necessary to provide more methodological details. Finally, related to this issue are negative conclusions from experiments that have control pumping rates on the very low side (e.g., Figures 4b, 5a). As it is not clear that the pumping rate could be lower than such low control values, it is not clear that the conclusions stated are warranted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00329.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>* Not all pairwise combinations are tested in behavioral assays with HB101 always being tested against one of the others.

It is therefore necessary to provide more methodological details</italic>.</p><p>Actually, the range of random day-to-day variation is quite narrow. We guess that you estimated the variation by comparing the values in different experiments. However, these differences are caused by different experimental conditions, not by random day-to-day variation. To collect data for each figure, we repeated experiments 3–5 times, and the pumping rates that were measured on different days were quite consistent as seen from the narrow distribution of pumping rates (Author response images 1 and 2, below). We attribute the consistency of the range of pumping rates within experiments to the consistency of experimental conditions.</p><p>For each experiment, preparation of worms and reagents and feeding assays were performed in the same way in a designated place, mostly using the same batch of reagents. In contrast, conditions for feeding assays for different experiments varied in several ways, for instance, temperature and amount of test bacteria. Feeding assays were performed in multiple places due to change in lab space and experimental convenience, which caused inevitable change in multiple factors including temperature for preparing worms and performing feeding assays. Additionally, feeding assays that involved the <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant were performed using more test bacteria (100ul of bacterial culture OD=5.0) than others (10ul) as described in ‘Preparation of test food and conditioned media for feeding assay’ in the Materials and methods. From our experience, temperature and density of bacteria significantly affect pumping rates.</p><p>We want to point out that, regardless of the variation in conditions, we consistently observed the stimulatory effect of familiar food on pumping throughout the 3–5 independent assays for each dataset (Author response image 3), which strongly supports the validity of our conclusions. We added text explaining the differences in the pumping rates among different experiments in ‘Feeding assay’ in the Materials and methods.<fig id="fig18" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Difference in pumping rates among different datasets was not caused by day-to-day variation.</title><p>These datasets were chosen as an example due to their difference in values.

As it is not clear that the pumping rate could be lower than such low control values, it is not clear that the conclusions stated are warranted</italic>.</p><p>In fact, the pumping rate can be far lower than the control values (∼150 pumps/min).

Given that worms pump faster on <italic>E. coli</italic> DA837 than <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101, the bacterial strain that was used for the figures (unpublished observation), we believe that our conclusion that the <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant is defective in increasing pumping rate in response to familiar food is valid.</p></body></sub-article></article>
