Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) suppresses food intake and acts as a satiety signal. We show here that meal challenges increase serum LCN2 levels in persons with normal or overweight, but not in individuals with obesity. Postprandial LCN2 serum levels correlate inversely with hunger sensation in challenged subjects. We further show through brain PET scans of monkeys injected with radiolabeled recombinant human LCN2 (rh-LCN2) and autoradiography in baboon, macaque, and human brain sections, that LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier and localizes to the hypothalamus in primates. In addition, daily treatment of lean monkeys with rh-LCN2 decreases food intake by 21%, without overt side effects. These studies demonstrate the biology of LCN2 as a satiety factor and indicator and anorexigenic signal in primates. Failure to stimulate postprandial LCN2 in individuals with obesity may contribute to metabolic dysregulation, suggesting that LCN2 may be a novel target for obesity treatment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and affects more than 40% of adults in the United States. People with obesity have a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. Changes in diet and exercise can be difficult to follow and result in minimal weight loss that is rarely sustained overtime. In fact, in people with obesity, weight loss can lower the metabolism leading to increased weight gain. New drugs may help some individuals achieve 5 to 10% weight loss but have side effects that prevent long-term use.</p><p>Previous studies in mice show that a hormone called Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) suppresses appetite. It also reduces body weight and improves sugar metabolism in the animals. But whether this hormone has the same effects in humans or other primates is unclear. If it does, LCN2 might be a potential obesity treatment.</p><p>Now, Petropoulou et al. show that LCN2 suppressed appetite in humans and monkeys. In human studies, LCN2 levels increased after a meal in individuals with normal weight or overweight, but not in individuals with obesity. Higher levels of LCN2 in a person’s blood were also associated with a feeling of reduced hunger. Using brain scans, Petropoulou et al. showed that LCN2 crossed the blood-brain barrier in monkeys and bound to the hypothalamus, the brain center regulating appetite and energy balance. LCN2 also bound to human and monkey hypothalamus tissue in laboratory experiments. When injected into monkeys, the hormone suppressed food intake and lowered body weight without toxic effects in short-term studies.</p><p>The experiments lay the initial groundwork for testing whether LCN2 might be a useful treatment for obesity. More studies in animals will help scientists understand how LCN2 works, which patients might benefit, how it would be given to patients and for how long. Clinical trials would also be needed to verify whether it is an effective and safe treatment for obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LCN2</kwd><kwd>postprandial</kwd><kwd>hunger</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>anorexigenic</kwd><kwd>primates</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR001873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Mishaela</given-names></name><name><surname>Kousteni</surname><given-names>Stavroula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AG032959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kousteni</surname><given-names>Stavroula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Roche-Chugai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Confavreux</surname><given-names>Cyrille B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NJAES -

In individuals with longstanding obesity, the body responds to long-term weight loss by a reduction in metabolic rate, favoring weight regain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fothergill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosenbaum et al., 2010</xref>).

Long-term LCN2 administration to lean and obese mice suppresses appetite and body weight gain without loss of effect over time, and improves whole body glucose metabolism while at the same time increasing energy expenditure. Therefore, LCN2 overcomes the inherent compensatory decrease in energy expenditure that develops following a sustained decrease in food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mosialou et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, LCN2 acts as a satiety signal that is upregulated after feeding in mice to limit food intake.

The results from the chase experiment—standard uptake values at every timepoint—were compared to those of the no-chase experiment, by using the same procedure, software and atlas. Infusion of the MC4R receptor ligand, α-MSH, 15 min after [<sup>124</sup>I] rh-LCN2 did not seem to affect the tracer uptake in the thalamic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and L</xref>), whereas it did reduce uptake compared with the no-chase condition in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and M</xref>). We observed a 6.3% and 5.7% difference in the standard uptake value (SUV) in the left and right thalamus respectively, and a 49.8% and 51.2% reduction in the left and right hypothalamus.

Specific binding was observed in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and both the dorsomedial (DM) and ventrolateral (VL) nuclei of the human hypothalamus, all areas where MC4R is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1, A</xref>).

That a-MSH blocked less [<sup>125</sup>I] rh-LCN2 binding than non-radiolabeled LCN2 may suggest that, at least in primates [<sup>125</sup>I] rh-LCN2 has a higher binding affinity for MC4R than α-MSH.</p><p>To enhance the rigor of the autoradiography experiments, we also examined LCN2 binding using immunofluorescence in baboon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G</xref>) and human brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) containing the hypothalamus. Binding was again shown in both human and baboon brain sections and quantified as the average of LCN2-positive cells (21.3 ± 1.3% and 17.6 ± 1.8%, respectively) and it was specific since it was competed by non-biotinylated LCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, I</xref>). The reduction in binding was approximately 75%. If the concentration of the blocking agent is insufficient then the block may be incomplete and explain why 25% nonspecific or non-displaceable binding is observed even when the tracer and blocking drugs are almost the same. It is also possible that a slightest difference in structure may mean differences in nonspecific binding or off-target high-affinity binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamill et al., 2005</xref>). Of note, bar graphs were obtained from a single brain section and therefore depict qualitative representations of binding. Overall, we observed a consistent and comparable degree of binding in the hypothalamus, among the three species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>), which indicates that the PET findings are evidence of specific binding in the non-human primate hypothalamus and supports the premise of a common interspecies target of action for LCN2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>rh-LCN2 treatment suppresses food intake and body weight in vervets within five days of treatment</title><p>Having established that rh-LCN2 is able to cross the BBB of vervets and localize to the hypothalamus, we then sought to examine whether a daily treatment of lean monkeys with intravenously administered rh-LCN2 would lead to appetite suppression.

To test this, we measured serum CRP levels before and after the treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, while CRP levels appear to increase during the time of LCN2 injections, the effect was mostly driven by the extreme value for one animal in the first week of treatment. Rhabdomyolysis is indicated as a rare cause of CRP increase, and may account for the high levels of CRP in that subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landry et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that the animal did not tolerate well the daily intramuscular injections of dexmetodimine, which is also evident by the AST data (the value for this animal was the highest). As we mention in the next paragraph, high levels of AST may indicate muscle inflammation or injury. Furthermore, a subject of the saline-treated group was difficult to dose throughout the study, and this stress may account for the high CRP concentrations in this subject at each time point. Nevertheless, serum CRP levels did not change with LCN2 treatment. Similarly, saline-treated monkeys had normal CRP levels compared with baseline.</p><p>Quantification of liver enzyme levels in the serum that would indicate liver injury or toxicity, showed no significant elevation with treatment, except for aspartate aminotransferase AST (SGOT). AST was elevated both in saline-treated and LCN2-treated subjects to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Higher levels of AST compared to ALT, as in this study, may indicate muscle inflammation due to myocyte injury following vigorous exercise, toxins, or drugs use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cobbold et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, monkeys had to be injected daily with a mild sedative drug, dexmetodimine, which was given intramuscularly. It is possible that the daily intramuscular injections, led to myocyte injury that was in turn responsible for the rise in AST levels.</p><p>The kidney function and possible injury before and after treatment were assessed by measuring serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels (BUN). Serum creatinine was elevated in the LCN2-treated group compared to baseline but this rise was within the normal range and did not differ significantly from the saline-treated group. Similarly, even though BUN was elevated with LCN2 treatment, this rise was again found within physiological levels and did not change significantly from the saline-treated group. In addition, the BUN/Creatinine ratio did not change with treatment ruling out substantial acute renal injury or dysfunction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Additional serum parameters, such as serum total protein, albumin, globulin, and calcium were analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) but did not change with treatment.

Regarding glucose, a significant decrease was observed in both treatment groups when compared to baseline, whereas in triglycerides the reduction was borderline significant only in the LCN2-treated group. Serum insulin was not altered by LCN2 treatment. Of note, monkey LCN2 levels remained stable, both with saline and LCN2 treatment ruling out the possibility of regulation of the endogenous monkey LCN2 by exogenous administration of the recombinant human protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined the translational and therapeutic potential of LCN2, and we found that LCN2 crosses the BBB, localizes to the hypothalamus, and suppresses food intake in non-human primates. Consistent with this, binding experiments show the specificity of LCN2 binding in the PVN of human and non-human primates.</p><p>In addition, circulating LCN2 increases postprandially in lean human subjects, and the rise in LCN2 correlates with a drop in hunger sensation; these data suggest that the satiety function of LCN2 is conserved in humans. However, LCN2 post-prandial response is blunted in individuals with obesity. The extent of postprandial elevation of serum LCN2 response is affected by BMI, as women with normal weight have the highest response, women with overweight have a positive yet relatively attenuated response and women with obesity have a negative response. Similar to LCN2, other hunger or satiety peptide postprandial concentrations have different responses in people with normal or excessive BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamska-Patruno et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, postprandial upregulation of LCN2 is of similar magnitude as of GLP1 in individuals with normal weight or overweight and strongly correlates with hunger scores in these groups. These results suggest that the decrease in hunger sensation in humans might be mediated by the same mechanism that we observed in mice, namely LCN2 binding to appetite-suppression centers in the hypothalamus.</p><p>The observed variation in the extend of postprandial LCN2 increase among the studies could be due to differences in test meals (total mass, caloric content, macronutrient composition, and texture), the extent of involvement of the cephalic phase response and the stimulation of taste receptors by the presence of solid foods, as well as the racial composition of the cohort, all factors previously reported to affect postprandial gut peptides release and satiety responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feinle-Bisset, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miquel-Kergoat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Willis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Graaf, 2012</xref>). Moreover, in most studies, the magnitude of postprandial response tends to be similar for LCN2 and GLP-1, although it differs in subjects with normal or overweight. However, whereas LCN2 levels inversely correlate with hunger in normal weight and overweight subjects but not obese individuals, GLP1 levels only inversely correlate with hunger scores in subjects with obesity. Notably, the postprandial regulation of LCN2 and its role in satiety is supported by multifaceted evidence taking into consideration not only the p-value threshold, but also based on scientific reasoning in accordance to the guidelines of the American Statistical Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016</xref>). This is important for experiments like those described in this study which involve four different cohorts of human subjects collected and evaluated at four different sites, three in the United States and one in Europe. Patients across different states and countries eat different diets, which increase the variability of the responses. The fact that within this variation range, all subjects respond by increasing LCN2 in their blood after a meal, highlights the broad significance of these observations.</p><p>While the postprandial increase in LCN2 observed in the average-weight humans was 16–50%, the one we previously observed in mice was approximately 300% within the first 3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mosialou et al., 2017</xref>). This difference could be due to several reasons: (1) Difference in meal patterns between the two species. Mice mainly eat in the night and overnight fasting would result in approximately 75% of food deprivation. Humans fast after midnight, which would be after dinner, and were offered a meal at or around breakfast time. Thus, fasting and hunger in humans would not be as severe as in mice and could affect the magnitude of postprandial LCN2 response after feeding. (2) Differences in the amount of food consumed within the same time after fast/refeed between mice and humans. Mice consume approximately 40% (1.6g) of their daily food intake (4 g total on average) within 3 hr. In our Study 1, 2, and 3, humans consumed 37% (732 kcal), 11% (212 kcal), and 14% (275 kcal) of their daily food intake (2000 calories/day, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S, 2015</xref>, Appendix 2), respectively. These numbers account for a 2.8- to 29–fold higher food intake in mice than in humans within 3 hr. Higher food intake in mice may have stimulated the higher increase in postprandial LCN2 levels.</p><p>Ours studies show that the magnitude of postprandial increase of LCN2 is inversely correlated with hunger scores in normal weight and overweight human subjects. A similar magnitude of postprandial change we observed in serum GLP-1 levels in normal weight and overweight subjects. LCN2, and GLP-1, are not the first examples of a modest increase in hormone levels, producing a large change in a biological function or in disease. For example, a 10% increase in serum levels of parathyroid hormone above normal levels is sufficient to induce hyperparathyroidism; likewise, an increase of blood calcium from 100 to 104 mg (5% increase) is sufficient to create pathological hypercalcemia. Our results demonstrate that 20–50% increase in LCN2 levels, can suppress food intake in rodents and non-human primates and inversely correlate with hunger scores in normal weight and overweight human subjects. In endocrinology, a modest increase in hormones or second messenger signaling mechanisms like those involving GPCR signaling (as in our case with LCN2 acting through the MC4R) are enough to disturb homeostasis and induce pathology.</p><p>In the future, larger and well-controlled studies are needed to more precisely characterize LCN2 as a biomarker of adverse metabolic profile and abnormal appetite control and how BMI, meal composition and texture and other subject characteristics affect the postprandial LCN2 response and subsequent appetite control. Even though more thorough pharmacological studies are warranted in the future, this set of data suggests that LCN2 could be developed into an effective and safe treatment for obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-biotin antibody</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat# ab53494, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_867860">AB_867860</ext-link></td><td valign="top">10 ug/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488</td><td valign="top">Life technologies</td><td valign="top">Cat# A-21206, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535792">AB_2535792</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">RNA from human osteoblasts</td><td valign="top">Laboratory of Prof. Stavroula Kousteni</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">The coding sequence of human LCN2 was amplified and the amplified insert was cloned into the πα-SHP-H vector.

Sections were then dried under a stream of desiccated cold air. All slides were laid out in X-ray film cassettes and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 1–2 days, developed using Kodak D-19 developer and fixative. The autoradiograms were sampled using a computer-based image analysis system (MCID; Imaging Research Inc, Ontario, Canada) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arango et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arango et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boldrini et al., 2008</xref>).

After washing in harvesting buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]), samples were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min, washed in PBS, and incubated with rabbit anti-biotin antibody (ab53494, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4°C. The signal was visualized, after incubation with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (A21206, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) followed by DAPI counterstaining. To test for assay specificity, the procedure described above was performed in the presence of hundred-fold excess of non-biotinylated LCN2 (2.5 ng/mL). The binding was quantitated using the ‘Cell Counter’ analysis in ImageJ, by counting total cells (DAPI-stained/blue) and LCN2-positive cells (LCN2-stained/green) and subsequently calculating the percent of LCN2-positive cells in the two conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Non-human primate study</title><p>Based on our previous mouse studies where we observed an 18% reduction in food intake in wild-type lean mice that were treated with recombinant LCN2, we calculated that in order to have an 18% reduction (SD=+/-5 g), and error a = 0.05 and power of analysis 0.90, we needed n = 6 monkeys per group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brant, 2020</xref>). To minimize the number of animals we employed a cross-over design, in which each animal served as its control. There were two treatment weeks with one washout period of 9 days in between. In the first treatment week, three monkeys were treated with saline and three with rh-LCN2. After the washout period monkeys were assigned to the opposite treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Six male vervet/African green monkeys (AGM; Caribbean-origin <italic>Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus</italic>) used in this study were housed at the Vervet Research Colony at Wake Forest School of Medicine. The age of the subjects ranged from 4.7 to 16.6 years. Vervets were pair-housed in standard four cage racks (81 × 71 × 81 cm per compartment) that contained sitting perches and enrichment items. Animals had unlimited access to commercial monkey chow (LabDiet 5038; Labdiet, St Louis, MO) and water via automated lixit. They were fed supplemental fruits and vegetables 5 days/week.</p><p>Vervets were initially anesthetized with ketamine (15 mg/kg, intramuscularly-i.m.), intubated, and maintained on a combination of sevoflurane (2.0–4.0%) and isoflurane (1.5–2.0%). A catheter was surgically placed in the right saphenous vein with a vascular access port (Swirl Phantom P-SPH; Access Technologies, Skokie, IL) located subcutaneously in the right thigh. Monkeys were allowed to recover for 14 days. After recovery, they were re-acclimatized to pair-housing and food intake measurements for 7 days. At the end of the acclimatization period, the baseline food consumption for 5 days was measured. Animals were injected with rh-LCN2 or saline in the morning and then pairs were separated and fed individually for 4 hr. After the 4 hr feeding periods, all food was removed and weighed and then pairs were reunited. This means that animals were essentially fasted each night. Some enrichment foods (small pieces of fruit or vegetables) were provided in the afternoon, but those accounted to be a low percentage of their daily caloric intake. On blood sampling days, the animals had samples collected in the afternoon, after the 4 hr feeding period. Three animals were injected daily, via vascular access port, with saline and three with rh-LCN2 for five 5 days. To facilitate daily IV injections via the vascular access port, animals were lightly sedated with dexmedetomidine (0.035 mg/kg, i.m.) and then administered reversal agent atipamezole (0.35 mg/kg) following access port injections. For afternoon blood samples at the end of the week, they were anesthetized with ketamine.</p><p>Food consumption was measured daily as described above. At the end of day 5, a blood sample was collected for analyses, under ketamine anesthesia (10 mg/kg). A washout period of 9 days followed and then monkeys were subjected to a second baseline food consumption for 5 days. Then animals were switched to the opposite group. Again three animals were injected daily with saline and three with rh-LCN2 for 5 days. Food consumption was measured daily as described above. At the end of day 5, a small blood sample was collected for analyses. After the end of the second treatment week, monkeys were left to washout for 10 days. Two out of the six monkeys underwent PET imaging with a no-chase or chase design, as described below. At the end of all the studies, monkeys were anesthetized as described before and vascular access ports were surgically removed and the animals were left to recover for 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>PET imaging of [<sup>124</sup>I] rh-LCN2 in vervets</title><p>PET scans were performed in two of the six vervets using a GE 64-slice PET/CT Discovery VCT scanner (General Electric). The day prior to the PET scan, animals were administered a solution (0.5 mL) containing 4% potassium iodide and 2% iodine via oral gavage under ketamine anesthesia (10 mg/kg, i.m.). For each scan, the fasted animal was initially immobilized with ketamine (15 mg/kg, i.m.) and maintained on 1.5–2.0% isoflurane anesthesia via an endotracheal tube. The core temperature was kept constant at 37°C with a heated water blanket. An intravenous infusion line with 0.9% NaCl was maintained during the experiment and used for hydration and radiotracer injection. The head was positioned at the center of the field of view, and a 10 min transmission scan was performed before the tracer injection. [<sup>124</sup>I] rh-LCN2 radiotracer was injected (407 ± 80 MBq) as an intravenous bolus over 30 s, and emission data were collected for 120 min in three-dimensional mode.</p><p>In a subsequent chase experiment, α-MSH—ligand of the MC4 receptor—was given 15 min after the administration of [<sup>124</sup>I] rh-LCN2 to block non-specific binding in the areas of interest. The same procedure, software and atlas, as in the no-chase experiment, were used to extract time-activity curves (TACs) in the thalamus and hypothalamus, bilaterally. The TACs from the chase experiment were then compared to the corresponding TACs from the first, no-chase experiment in the same regions. We compared the average standard uptake value (SUV) between the two experiments, using the formula: 100*[SUV (no-chase) – SUV (chase)]/SUV (no-chase), to calculate the percent difference. Animals had MRI scans performed 1 week before PET scans using similar anesthesia procedures. MRI scans were performed using a Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra 3T MRI Scanner (Siemens, Munich, Germany) with the following sequences: large fov localizer, small fov localizer 128 mm, MPRAGE Axial_ND, and MPRAGE Axial (TE = 3.39 ms, TR = 2700 ms, TI = 880 ms, resolution = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm; FOV = 128 mm × 128 mm; matrix size = 256 × 256). All PET images were coregistered to the corresponding MRI (see volume of interest (VOIs) and outcome variable of SUV on PET).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>PET data analysis reconstruction</title><p>PET scans were reconstructed using the iterative ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm, which were corrected for attenuation, scatter, and dead time. The radioactivity was corrected for physical decay to the injection time and rebinned to 23 dynamic PET frames of 256 (left-to-right) by 256 (nasion-to-inion) by 000 (neck-to-cranium) voxels. The frame schedules were two 30 s, three 60 s, five 120 s, four 240 s, and nine 600 s for 120 mins. The final spatial resolution is expected to be less than 00-mm-full width half maximum in three directions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Volume of interest (VOIs) and outcome variable of SUV on PET</title><p>For spatial normalization, tissue segmentation, and anatomical labeling, PMod software (version 3.7; PMod Technologies Ltd, Zürich, Switzerland) was used with INIA 19 rhesus high-quality template for non-human primate brains (Rohlfing T, 2012). INIA 19 template was created from high-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of 19 rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collaboratory, 2020</xref>), including &gt; 100 brain regions per side and transferred to individual animal’s magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using MRI-to-MRI spatial normalization (target: INIA 19 monkey MRI). Then VOIs were transferred to the PET scan of the animal using the MRI-to-PET co-registration module, and minimally adjusted for radioactivity distribution of the scan. Averaged SUV images and time-activity curves (TACs) were generated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantitation of circulating factors</title><p>Human serum LCN2, insulin, and GLP-1 were quantitated using commercially available ELISA kits and following the manufacturer’s instructions (#DY1757, R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN;#90095, CrystalChem, Inc, Elk Grove Village, IL,; #EZGLP1T-36K, Merck, Burlington, MA, respectively). Monkey LCN2 and insulin were assayed with ELISA kits from LifeSpan BioSciences (#LS-F38530 and LS-F10306 respectively; Lifespan Biosciences, Inc, Seattle, WA) and leptin with an ELISA kit from Cusabio (#CSB-E14936Mk, Cusabio, Houston, TX). Circulating levels of primate CRP were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit using the manufacturer’s instructions (911CRP01P-96; Helica Biosystems, Inc, Santa Ana, CA). Blood chemistry was performed using a Heska Element DC Veterinary Chemistry Analyzer (Heska, Loveland, CO) at Columbia University’s Institute of Comparative Medicine Diagnostic Laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), with a level of significance at p&lt;0.05. Since serum LCN2 concentration for each sample was measured multiple times over time, a one- or two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) repeated measures design was appropriate for examining whether statistically significant differences in means exist in each experiment. Data were examined for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables were log-transformed. Variables were log-transformed using the natural logarithm (ln) when appropriate, and nonparametric tests were used when necessary. Using the F-ratio statistic, we examined whether the repeated measured variable, time, had an overall statistically significant effect, implying that the corresponding values of the outcome that is examined in each experiment is statistically different from values obtained at other points of time. To correct for any violations of the assumption of sphericity (ϵ), degrees of freedom for each F value were adjusted according to the estimated epsilon obtained in each analysis. For values of ϵ &lt; 0.75, the Greenhouse-Geisser Epsilon correction was used, while in cases when ϵ &gt; 0.75, the less conservative Huynh-Feldt Epsilon correction was preferred. Using the CONTRAST option in PROC General Linear Model (GLM) in SAS, we investigated whether and which mean values at each time point were statistically different from baseline, at t = 0. Pearson’s correlation coefficient, or Spearman’s correlation for data not normally distributed, were used. For non-repeated observations either two-tailed Student’s t-tests, Mann-Whitney or rank-sum Wilcoxon non-parametric tests were used depending on the normality of distribution. For the vervet studies, comparisons were made with paired or unpaired t-tests as needed. Data are reported as mean ± SEM. */<sup>#</sup> indicates p&lt;0.05, <bold>‡</bold> indicates p&lt;0.06, and † indicate p&lt;0.1. n indicates the number of human subjects or animals tested in each experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Human Study #1 and the non-human primate study were supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through Grant Number UL1TR001873 to Stavroula Kousteni and Mishaela Rubin.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous work by the same group has established in mice that lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) is a bone-derived hormone suppressing food intake and acting as a satiety signal (Mosialou et al., 2015). Yet, whether LCN-2 fulfils the same function in primates, including humans, remains unknown. In the present manuscript, the authors address this important gap in knowledge through multiple approaches. They show that circulating LCN2 increases postprandially in non-obese subjects, and that the serum levels of LCN2 negatively correlates with hunger sensation after a meal challenge. They provide evidence for the binding of radiolabeled or biotinylated recombinant human LCN2 in the hypothalamus of monkeys and humans. They also find that daily treatment of monkeys with recombinant human LCN2 decreases food intake by about 20%. This is an important study; the paper is generally well-written, and the data are convincing. With that said, certain issues need to be addressed and the manuscript modified accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While this paper provides compelling evidence that LCN2 is a satiety signal, it is less clear that it is a biomarker of hunger. Please comment.</p><p>2) A weakness seems to be a lack of statistical power in some of the studies, in particular in the experiments involving the injection of LCN2 into monkey. Some results don't reach statistical significance because only 3 monkeys were use in each group (Figure 4B-D, F, and Figure 5B and D). While the reviewers recognize that it may not be feasible to increase monkey numbers due to a number of reasons, an explanation to account for the lack of power is required, and this caveat should be clearly stated.</p><p>3) In the study presented in Figure 4, monkeys are given a daily injection of LCN2 and the authors show that the circulating level of LCN2 is increased 4 h after the injection (Figure 4F). Have they formally determined the half-life of recombinant human LCN2? In other words, do they have data (or samples on which they can measure circulating levels of LCN2 at earlier time points, namely 10, 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes after the injection? If not, it is suggested that they conduct a formal pharmacokinetic study and post the results onto BioRxiv. Furthermore, and of note, the authors argue that the postprandial increase in LCN2 observed in the average-weight humans (16-50%) is in the same order of magnitude than the one they previously observed in mice (Mosialou et al., 2017). However, in their previous paper the postprandial increase in mice was about 300% within the first 3hrs. This difference should be discussed appropriately in the Discussion.</p><p>4) Please clarify whether the monkeys were injected just before they received food or whether feeding was ad libitum?</p><p>5) The daily dose of recombinant LCN2 injected in the monkey in Figure 4 is not indicated in the Materials and methods or anywhere else in the manuscript. How was the dose determined? Have they performed preliminary studies to determine which doses produce a significant raise in circulating LCN2? Please therefore explain the strategy to determine the optimal dose.</p><p>6) In their previous studies in mice, the recombinant mouse LCN2 was produced in bacteria. Here they use a mammalian cell expression system, which is certainly a good idea to ensure the presence of all the posttranslational modifications normally present in LCN2 such as N-glycosylation (Kjeldsen et al. JBC 1993). It will be important to show the purity and the integrity of their recombinant protein on an SDS-PAGE gel (Coomassie) and to confirm that it is indeed N-glycosylated. In addition, have they verified the absence of endotoxin in their preparation of recombinant human LCN2? These are simple biochemical analyses that could be accomplished with ease and would strengthen the developmentability of their molecule.</p><p>7) Autoradiography studies are underpowered (e.g., 1 brain slice and 4 fields of view) for quantitative assessment of %LCN positive cells (Figure 2V-W, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F). The reviewers suggest either using more biological replicates or stating that these are qualitative representations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58949.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While this paper provides compelling evidence that LCN2 is a satiety signal, it is less clear that it is a biomarker of hunger.

In the absence of additional data to further support the notion that LCN2 is a biomarker of hunger we have removed it from the title and throughout the text. We now clarify that LCN2 is a satiety signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A weakness seems to be a lack of statistical power in some of the studies, in particular in the experiments involving the injection of LCN2 into monkey.

However, they do not reach statistical significance because of the small number of animals per group (N=3). In Figure 5E (previous 4E) which combines the data from the two treatment weeks (N=6 animals/group) the observed reduction in food intake is statistically significant.</p><p>Two different ELISA assays were used; one for human and one for monkey LCN2. Each ELISA has selective reactivity for the designated species. Therefore, in Figure 5F (previous 4F) gray bars indicate serum levels of monkey LCN2 whereas red bars represent serum levels of human LCN2 following its administration to N=6 monkeys. Even though the combined human and monkey LCN2 levels approximately doubled following administration of recombinant human LCN2, this increase was not statistically significant (p=0.35). Similarly, Figure 6D and E (previous 5B and D) show a trend towards decrease in body weight and serum Leptin levels but those were not statistically significant. We believe that the lack of power in these data reflects the limited number of monkeys used in each group (N=3). These caveats are now clearly stated in the Results text describing these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the study presented in Figure 4, monkeys are given a daily injection of LCN2 and the authors show that the circulating level of LCN2 is increased 4 h after the injection (Figure 4F).

This difference could be due to several reasons: (1) Difference in meal patterns between the two species. Mice mainly eat in the night and overnight fasting would result in approximately 75% food deprivation. Humans fast after midnight, which would be after dinner, and were offered a meal at or around breakfast time. Thus, fasting and hunger in humans would not be as severe as in mice and could affect the magnitude of postprandial LCN2 response after feeding. (2) Differences in the amount of food consumed within the same time after fast/refeed between mice and humans. Mice consume approximately 40% (1.6g) of their daily food intake (4g total on average) within 3h. In our study 1, 2 and 3, humans consumed 1.37% (732kcal), 10.6% (212kcal) and 14% (275kcal) of their daily food intake (2000 calories/day, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-2/">https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/20152020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-2/)</ext-link>, respectively. These numbers account for a 2.8- to 29–fold higher food intake in mice than in humans within 3 hours. Higher food intake in mice may have stimulated the higher increase in postprandial LCN2 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please clarify whether the monkeys were injected just before they received food or whether feeding was ad libitum?</p></disp-quote><p>Animals were injected with rh-LCN2 or saline in the morning and then pairs were separated and fed individually for 4 hours. After the 4 hour feeding periods all food was removed and weighed and then pairs were reunited. This means that animals were essentially fasted each night. Some enrichment foods (small pieces of fruit or vegetables) were provided in the afternoon, but those accounted to be a low percentage of their daily caloric intake. On blood sampling days the animals had samples collected in the afternoon, after the 4-hour feeding period. This information is now provided in the Materials and methods under the section “Non-human primate study”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The daily dose of recombinant LCN2 injected in the monkey in Figure 4 is not indicated in the Materials and methods or anywhere else in the manuscript.

In the mouse hypothalamus the amount of naturally occurring LCN2 is 28 pg/mg and in the adult mouse and human serum it is on average 100-150 ng/ml. In mice, administration of LCN2 by intraperitoneal injection of 150 ng/g daily crosses the blood brain barrier and suppresses appetite. Using interspecies conversion per m<sup>2</sup>, we have calculated the monkey dose to be 0.0375 mg/kg. This dose is equivalent to the amount used to treat mice and it is calculated based on body surface area; it takes into account interspecies variation in several physiological parameters including oxygen utilization, caloric expenditure, basal metabolism and blood volume (Reagan-Shaw, Nihal and Ahmad, 2008). This information in now provided in Results under the section “rh-LCN2 treatment suppresses food intake and body weight in vervets within five days of treatment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In their previous studies in mice, the recombinant mouse LCN2 was produced in bacteria.

Stocks were digested with N-glycanase to examine N-glycosylation. Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows that the recombinant protein is pure and N-glycosylated. In addition, in the same stocks we measured endotoxin levels by a chromogenic LAL assay and found them to be 1EU/mg of protein. We then used an endotoxin removal kit which lowered the endotoxin levels by 20% (0.8EU/mg of protein). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-technical-guides/bacterial-endotoxinspyrogens">https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcementand-criminal-investigations/inspection-technical-guides/bacterial-endotoxinspyrogens)</ext-link> the endotoxin limit for the parenteral (in our case intravenous injection) administration of drugs is 5 EU/kg/hr. Based on measured endotoxin content of our preparation and the body weights of the non-human primates at the time of LCN2 administration, each animal received a maximum endotoxin of 0.03 EU/kg/hr. This information is provided in the Materials and methods under the section “Production of recombinant human LCN2 (rh-LCN2)” and in Results under the section “rh-LCN2 treatment suppresses food intake and body weight in vervets within five days of treatment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Autoradiography studies are underpowered (e.g., 1 brain slice and 4 fields of view) for quantitative assessment of %LCN positive cells (Figure 2V-W, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F).
