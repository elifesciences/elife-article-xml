key roles during prenatal development in defining neural circuitry function, including ensuring proper synaptic wiring and maintaining homeostasis. Mammalian breathing rhythmogenesis arises from interacting brainstem neural networks that are assembled during embryonic development, but the specific role of microglia in this process remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anatomical and functional consequences of respiratory circuit formation in the absence of microglia. We first established the normal distribution of microglia within the wild-type (WT, <italic>Spi1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (Pu.1 WT)) mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) brainstem at embryonic ages when the respiratory networks are known to emerge (embryonic day (E) 14.5 for the parafacial respiratory group (epF) and E16.5 for the preBötzinger complex (preBötC)). In transgenic mice depleted of microglia (<italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (Pu.1 KO) mutant), we performed anatomical staining, calcium imaging, and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activities in vitro to assess the status of these circuits at their respective times of functional emergence. Spontaneous respiratory-related activity recorded from reduced in vitro preparations showed an abnormally slow rhythm frequency expressed by the epF at E14.5, the preBötC at E16.5, and in the phrenic motor nerves from E16.5 onwards. These deficits were associated with a reduced number of active epF neurons, defects in commissural projections that couple the bilateral preBötC half-centers, and an accompanying decrease in their functional coordination. These abnormalities probably contribute to eventual neonatal death, since plethysmography revealed that E18.5 <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos are unable to sustain breathing activity ex utero. Our results thus point to a crucial contribution of microglia in the proper establishment of the central respiratory command during embryonic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>neural network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20170336764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoby-Brisson</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010299</institution-id><institution>Institut pour la Recherche sur la Moelle épinière et l'Encéphale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pascual</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional and anatomical analysis reveal a crucial role played during embryonic development by microglia in the ontogenesis and function of central circuits responsible for respiratory rhythmogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that invade the central nervous system (CNS) early during embryogenesis where they participate actively in brain homeostasis and in shaping neural circuit assembly. Indeed, it is now established that microglia play important roles in different aspects of the development of brain structures by controlling cell death, angiogenesis, synapse refining, neurogenesis, and axon tract formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thion and Garel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Barres, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stevens and Schafer, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Breathing behavior relies on several interacting rhythmogenic networks controlling motoneuronal pools located in specific regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. The two main brainstem neuronal groups involved in respiratory rhythmogenesis and motor burst activity phasing are the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) responsible for inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2001</xref>) and the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG), involved in pre-inspiration and active expiration, as well as in playing a crucial role in central chemoception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onimaru and Homma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pisanski et al., 2020</xref>). A third neuronal group, the post-inspiratory complex (Pico, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) has been more recently identified, but was not considered in the present study since its embryonic origin and functional emergence have yet to be established. The initial formation of these circuits occurs early during development: in mice, an operational pFRG emerges first at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (hence named embryonic parafacial group (epF) at this stage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>) whereas the preBötC becomes active at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</xref>). From this latter stage onwards, these rhythmic bilateral networks are functionally and reciprocally connected, and the various respiratory motoneuronal pools are driven through complex ipsi- and contralateral projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The formation of functional networks requires their constitutive neurons to be born in specific anatomical niches before translocating to their final destination through active migratory processes, as well as the development of proper axonal extensions toward their targets and the establishment of appropriate synaptic connections. While the territories of origin for both epF and preBötC neurons are reasonably well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 2010</xref>), the accompanying developmental processes involved in establishing the functional respiratory command are not fully understood. In particular, the role that microglia might play in such early formative processes remains completely unknown.</p><p>Here, to investigate the extent to which microglia are implicated in the construction of operational respiratory networks during embryonic development, we examined the anatomical and functional status of the epF and preBötC networks during embryogenesis in a mouse line, the so-called <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant (also called <italic>Pu.1</italic> mutant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Back et al., 2004</xref>), which is devoid of microglia. To this end, we combined anatomical approaches with plethysmographic recordings of breathing behavior in vivo, electrophysiological recordings, and calcium imaging of fictive respiratory activity in reduced embryonic preparations (isolated brainstem or transverse brainstem slices) in vitro. By comparing data from wild-type (WT) and <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice embryos, our findings reveal for the first time that microglia make an important contribution to the prenatal development of the respiratory command necessary to ensure survival at birth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microglia cell distribution in the developing embryonic hindbrain</title><p>In a first set of experiments, we assessed the presence and spatiotemporal organization of microglial cells in the brainstem of WT (Spi1<sup>+/+</sup>) mice at different embryonic stages from E14.5 to E18.5, using immunostaining labeling against the specific microglial marker Iba1. Since the pia and choroid plexus (two other known Iba1-positive structures) were removed from our preparations, any positive staining detected was considered to be specific to microglia contained in central nervous structures. Microglia were found present in brainstem tissue throughout this developmental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, F, K</xref>), with an uneven distribution characterized by a preferential localization in motoneuronal pools, such as the facial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, G, L</xref>) and hypoglossal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, I, N</xref>). In contrast, selective concentrations of microglia in loci where the respiratory generators are located, ventral to the facial nucleus in the case of the epF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, G, L</xref>) and ventrolateral to the nucleus ambiguus for the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, H, M</xref>) were not observed. However, in all three developmental stages we detected a pronounced congregation of microglia flanking the two sides of the hindbrain midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, J, O</xref>). This unexpected observation was of particular interest in the context of the bilaterally distributed rhythmogenic respiratory half-centers that are connected through commissural axonal pathways serving to synchronize the network activity of the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) (see below).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immunodetection of microglia in the mouse hindbrain during embryonic development.</title><p>Immunostaining for Iba1 (green) and ChAT (red) in transverse, 30 µm thick brainstem frozen sections obtained from three wild-type embryos (WT, upper three horizontal rows) and one Spi1<sup>−/−</sup> embryo (bottom row) at different embryonic ages (indicated on left) and at different axial levels (indicated at bottom).

As expected, nervous tissue from such mutant embryos was completely devoid of labeling at all rostro-caudal levels examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P–T</xref>, see also Figures 4 and 5), including those regions in close proximity to brainstem motor nuclei and along the midline.

Moreover, when preparations (<italic>n</italic> = 4) were superfused by an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution with a lowered pH (decreased from 7.4 to 7.2), the cycle frequency of ongoing fluorescence signals increased to 18.7 ± 1 calcium transients/min (p = 0.002), as expected due to the known intrinsic sensitivity of the epF network to acidosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, in mutant preparations under normal aCSF (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and consistent with our anatomical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, right), functional imaging revealed that a significantly lower number of rhythmically active epF cells could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). In addition, the spontaneous epF network rhythm monitored under control aCSF was generated at a significantly reduced cycle frequency compared to WT control of 8.2 ± 0.7 calcium transients/min (p = 0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). On the other hand, the network’s sensitivity to pH changes was conserved in the mutant, since reducing the aCSF pH to 7.2 induced a significant frequency increase to 14.4 ± 1.5 calcium transients/min (p = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together these findings indicate that the absence of microglia during embryonic development leads to both anatomical and functional abnormalities in the epF network at E14.5, although its chemosensitivity to acidosis is maintained.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PreBötC rhythmogenesis is preserved in <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos at E16.5 despite abnormal commissural projections</title><p>The second major respiratory network, the preBötC starts to become active at E15.5 in the mouse and is fully functional by E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</xref>).

More precisely, was there evidence for a disruption of the commissural pathways between the two preBötC half-centers in <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants, and if so, how might this interfere with overall preBötC network function? To address this issue, we first labeled commissural projections from the preBötC network on one side by the unilateral application of a fluorescent dye crystal (Alexa Fluor 488 dextran) to WT (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 6) slice preparations taken from E16.5 to E18.5 embryos. The midline was unequivocally localized by its strong immunoreactivity to the anti-NK1R antibody, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2005</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (four examples of each genotype), considerably less commissural fibers were found to traverse the hindbrain midline in mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A1, A2</xref>). We then assessed whether such an anatomical impairment of commissural connectivity in the mutant had functional consequences for the coordination between the preBötC networks of each side. Simultaneous macroelectrode recordings were therefore made from both the left and right preBötC networks in WT (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 8) preparations between E16.5 and E18.5, as for a typical WT preparation illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B1</xref>. From measurements of the delay between the onset of a given preBötC network burst and that of its contralateral partner, in contrast to the strict synchrony of burst pairs in WT preparations, a significantly wider range of delays was observed in <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> preparations, with mean values attaining 48.9 ± 27.8 ms in the latter preparations compared to −4±11.7 ms in the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B2, B3</xref>; 15 bursts per preparation; p &lt; 0.05). This greater variability in the coordination between corresponding left and right preBötC bursts of activity probably also partially explains their longer durations (see Discussion). Thus, in the absence of microglia during embryonic development, commissural projections between the bilateral preBötC networks develop abnormally, likely underlying the observed weakened synchronization between the two oscillator half-centers, and in turn, to the generation of longer and less frequent bursts of respiratory-related activity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The bilateral preBötzinger complex (preBötC) networks exhibit abnormal commissural projections and diminished inter-network synchronization in the <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryo at E16.5–E18.5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photomicrographs of transverse brainstem slice preparations immunolabeled for Iba1 and NK1R (red), ChAT (blue), and with commissural projections from one preBötC network to its contralateral partner labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green) for wild-type (WT) (<bold>A1</bold>) and <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<bold>A2</bold>) preparations.

Our findings reveal that the complete absence of microglia during <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse embryonic development results in major deficits of the identified neuronal networks responsible for breathing behavior, specifically in relation to their ability to produce an effective central respiratory command.</p><p>Respiratory rhythmogenesis relies on an interaction between distinct neuronal groups located in separate regions of the brainstem, which normally become sequentially operational during embryogenesis to produce a stable respiratory-related rhythm from 3 days before birth (at E15.5) onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>). In examining the anatomical and functional characteristics of the two main respiratory neuronal groups (the epF and the preBötC networks) we found that when developing in an environment devoid of microglia, these networks continue to become functional at typical developmental stages, but exhibit anomalies that lead to the generation of an overall slower rhythm and a subsequent inability to sustain breathing behavior at birth. This deficit is likely to arise from a lack of the normal influence of microglia in regulating cell numbers and the proper wiring of the brainstem circuits responsible for respiratory rhythmogenesis during prenatal development. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of indirect effects, especially since the regions in which respiratory networks reside are not those that express a high accumulation of microglia. This therefore raises the possibility that anomalies in the establishment of the central respiratory command in the Spi1 mutant arises from defaults at very early developmental stages (during early migration of progenitors, for example) or in other actors involved brainstem circuit development.</p><p>The main abnormality observed in the mutant was a very low respiratory frequency expressed in vitro by isolated brainstem preparations. The centrally generated respiratory rhythm results in part from network interactions between the parafacial respiratory group (epF at embryonic stages) and the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>), both of which are strongly connected to their contralateral counterparts via midline-crossing commissural projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the cycle frequency of respiratory activity is determined by (1) the intrinsic rhythm generated by each half-center network, and (2) the strength of the homo- (preBötC/preBötC; epF/epF) and hetero- (preBötC/epF) network synaptic interactions. During embryonic development these dual controlling processes are established between E14.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>), a period during which the epF (intrinsically active at a higher frequency) progressively entrains the intrinsically slower preBötC network, thereby setting the overall respiratory rhythm to an intermediate cycle frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we find in the mutant that at the time of their respective emergence, each respiratory network generates rhythmic activity at an abnormally low frequency. In the case of the epF, this lower frequency is likely to be the consequence of a substantially diminished number of constituent neurons. For the preBötC network, anomalies in commissural projections connecting the two bilaterally distributed preBötC neuronal groups, resulting in a diminished inter-network synchronization, are likely to contribute to the slower rhythm generation. Ultimately, when these networks become fully connected at E16.5, their intra- and inter-circuit anomalies result in a reduced frequency of the final respiratory command observed at the level of motor output.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Premature death of <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos</title><p>While <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mortality at P0 probably results from multiple functional defaults that are not necessarily exclusively CNS related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Back et al., 2004</xref>), the cause of death is very unlikely related to an immune system deficiency or the development of septicemia that could have arisen due to the absence of microglia. In contrast, peripheral causes are likely to be involved in the premature death of animals devoid of microglia. Indeed, Spi1 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors impacting not only microglia but also meningeal, choroid plexus, and perivascular macrophages, as well as peripheral immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldmann et al., 2016</xref>). In a recent study, no premature death was observed in transgenic mice in which microglia depletion was specifically restricted to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rojo et al., 2019</xref>), thus directly inferring peripheral deficits, possibly including developmental malformations of the upper airways, lungs and heart, as important contributors to neonatal death of <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants. Although further investigations are now needed to address such possibilities, our findings nevertheless indicate that, despite the sustained generation of a central, rhythmically organized respiratory motor command, peripheral breathing movement was rapidly undetectable in neonatal mutants. Therefore, major defaults in overall breathing movement control (potentially also at the peripheral level) and/or anomalies in cardiorespiratory activity are very likely contributing significantly to the inability of perinatal Spi1 mutants to survive after birth.</p><p>Microglial-related defects in the motor output commands themselves that are produced by hindbrain circuits could be another contributor to mutant immediate postnatal death, especially since in WT embryos, we found microglia to be present with a higher density in brainstem regions where motor nuclei are located. Interestingly, anatomical anomalies were observed in the hindbrain facial nucleus of mutant preparations, although whether these two features are linked and whether such anatomical defaults lead to actual functional deficits remain to be determined. Also, potential anatomical and functional defects in the hypoglossal nucleus, another hindbrain motor nucleus that controls muscles of the upper airways, similarly need to be investigated. Overall, however, a multifactorial combination of deficits at both central and peripheral levels is very probably responsible for the immediate death of newborn pups when embryonic development has occurred in the complete absence of microglia, presumably accelerating the fatal impact of a deficient respiratory command.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regional localization and associated roles of microglia in the embryonic brainstem</title><p>Microglia are known to enter and invade the CNS early during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thion and Garel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelim et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with an important role in the initial stages of neuronal circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casano and Peri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reemst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosser et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, microglia exhibit a specific spatiotemporal distribution in the embryonic brain, with a characteristic uneven distribution that coincides with the localization of progenitor niches, loci where neurogenesis and cell division also occur, near developing blood vessels and the formation of axonal tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fantin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoshiko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swinnen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squarzoni et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in the developing brainstem, we find that microglia also express a preferential spatial distribution, with a higher prevalence not only in hindbrain motor nuclei but also along each side of the hindbrain midline. This latter observation was of particular interest since most brainstem circuits are bilaterally distributed, with their activities coordinated by commissural axonal projections that cross the midline. This is especially relevant for the central networks organizing the respiratory command, where a strict left/right synchronization of motor output is required to produce a coordinated drive to the left and right diaphragm muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The commissural connectivity between the central respiratory groups displays redundancy and is extremely complex. For example, a bilateral co-activation of the two epF networks occurs as early as E14.5, with synchronizing signals being conveyed through multiple, but still anatomically undefined commissural pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, commissural interneurons, both between the two preBötC networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>) and between the ventral respiratory groups (VRGs) that contain pre-motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), participate in the synchronization of bilaterally coordinated contractions of inspiratory effector muscles. At the level of the preBötC, this anatomical specificity requires the Slit/Robo signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>), but might also involve microglia due to the latter’s localization near the midline and their known participation in axonal tract formation elsewhere in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pont-Lezica et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squarzoni et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this idea, our findings show firstly, that inter-preBötC network projections are considerably reduced in the <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos, and second, and correspondingly, in slice preparations isolating the preBötC networks from <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos at E16.5, the normal functional synchronization between the rhythmogenic half-centers is diminished. However, despite this abnormality in the relative timing between left/right preBötC bursts in the mutant, a strict bilateral synchronization similar to that found in the WT was observed in phrenic (C4) motor nerve recordings from the whole isolated hindbrain at E18.5. This apparent compensation is likely attributable to the redundancy of midline-crossing commissures between the other brainstem centers that are sufficient to offset the weakened local connections between the preBötC half-centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), thereby enabling the coordination between the downstream left and right motor outputs in the <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryo to be maintained.</p><p>Without fully disrupting bilateral coupling, the absence of microglia and the resulting reduced number of midline-crossing fibers connecting the two preBötC networks affects other parameters of respiratory pattern generation. Most notably, in the mutant phrenic motor burst output occurs with a significantly slower cycle frequency and more strikingly longer individual bursts than in the WT. On the one hand, the decreased frequency is likely to be the direct consequence of the slower rhythmic command signal emanating from the interacting epF and preBötC networks, both groups separately generating a respiratory-related rhythmic activity at an abnormally slow frequency. On the other hand, the increase in motor burst duration could have arisen from a reduction in the coordination within the preBötC networks and between inspiratory interneurons and VRG pre-motoneurons. This in turn would lead to a less synchronized drive to target motoneurons and thus an overall increase in phrenic motor burst duration in each cycle. Another possibility is that the phrenic motor nucleus itself is affected in the mutant, especially in light of our finding that microglia are normally present in high density in the different brainstem motor nuclei. Thus, when developing in the absence of microglia, the firing properties of these motoneuronal groups, including those in the phrenic nucleus, might be directly affected, thereby contributing to the observed increase in phrenic burst duration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Early role of microglia in respiratory network ontogenesis</title><p>The essential regulation of neuronal numbers in the construction of neural circuitry during development occurs through several mechanisms in which microglia may participate: neuronal death, survival, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thion and Garel, 2017</xref>). In the mouse respiratory system, epF neurons originate in the dB2 domain of rhombomere 5 (r5) then migrate conjointly with facial motoneurons to reach their final location in r6 by E14.5, near the ventral surface of the hindbrain and below the facial motor nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mellen and Thoby-Brisson, 2012</xref>). Perturbations in epF formation have been detected in different mouse lines genetically modified for transcription factors known to specify epF neuronal components, such as <italic>Phox2b</italic>, <italic>Egr2</italic>, <italic>Lbx1</italic>, and <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pagliardini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>). In most cases, the number of epF neurons was found to be drastically reduced in these mutant animal, with significant resultant effects on epF network function, including both rhythmogenesis and loss of CO<sub>2</sub>/pH responsiveness. In the <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, the reduction (by ~31%) of neurons constituting the epF group presumably results from an abnormally high level of epF cell death and/or migratory dysfunction. This diminished epF population size in turn probably explains the production of a slower (by 33%) epF rhythm at E14.5, and indeed, also that of fictive respiration observed from E16.5 onwards in isolated hindbrain preparations, where rhythmic burst activity in the phrenic motor roots arises from both the epF and the now active preBötC generators operating in combination. Since at this later embryonic stage the epF is known to entrain the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2009</xref>), a slower intrinsic rhythm generated by the epF in the mutant will drive the preBötC at an equally reduced frequency (but note, the preBötC itself generates a slower rhythm; see below), with a resultant production of slower phrenic motor bursting. In contrast, the epF’s intrinsic sensitivity to pH changes at E14.5 is preserved in the mutant, indicating that despite a reduction in constituent neurons, the normal chemosensing capability of this neuronal group is preserved. This functional property also persists later in development, since acidifying the aCSF bathing isolated brainstem preparations at E18.5 still evoked a frequency increase of respiratory activity recorded at the level of phrenic roots. Together these findings therefore indicate that although the complete neuronal composition of epF circuitry early during embryonic development depends on the presence of microglia, nevertheless, in the latter’s absence the network’s basic rhythmogenic and chemosensitivity properties remain.</p><p>The preBötC network originates from the V0v domain in r6/7, and is composed of a heterogeneous population of Dbx1-specified interneurons that migrate radially from their territory of origin (near the <italic>sulcus limitans</italic> bordering the fourth ventricle) to their final position in the ventro-lateral area in the vicinity of the nucleus ambiguus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mellen and Thoby-Brisson, 2012</xref>). Potential anatomical deficits in the preBötC network population are more complicated to detect in general as it does not express any specific molecular characteristics enabling anatomical marker detection. However, our physiological results indicate that this network in the mutant is sufficiently preserved, if affected at all, in its ability to produce inspiration-related rhythmic activity, albeit at a slower frequency. This frequency reduction could result from a diminished connectivity between inspiratory interneurons as indicated by the reduced number of commissural projections between the preBötC half-centers (as discussed above) and a consequent less efficient synchronization between the two preBötC groups. Another plausible explanation resides with the known role of microglia in shaping and refining synapses during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thion and Garel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thion et al., 2018</xref>), in their formation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2016</xref>), and in regulating synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben Achour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pascual et al., 2012</xref>). Such multiple influences might also contribute to the establishment of the preBötC network, in which appropriate interneuronal connections and activity levels are required for proper respiratory rhythmogenesis. Of further relevance is the fact that Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is known to modulate preBötC activity through an activation of Trkb receptors expressed by inspiratory neurons and is required for the normal development of the central respiratory rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erickson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balkowiec and Katz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thoby-Brisson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvier et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, mice lacking BDNF display severe deficits in breathing control, including depressed ventilation and an irregular respiratory rhythm. On the other hand, microglia are able to release BDNF that can cause a disinhibition of neural circuits and increase network excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coull et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrini et al., 2013</xref>). A further possibility, therefore, is that microglia also serve as a source of BDNF for the preBötC network, and whose absence during embryonic development leads to abnormal preBötC function. Although beyond the scope of the present study, this hypothesis clearly warrants further investigation.</p><p>The roles of microglia in neurogenesis, axonal tract formation, and proper circuit wiring are evidently relevant to the developmental establishment of a functional central respiratory command, as evidenced here by our <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> analysis. Nonetheless, despite anatomical and functional disturbances in respiratory network emergence, the absence of microglia during embryonic development does not totally prevent the formation of neural circuits capable of fundamental respiratory-related rhythmogenesis. This is probably due to additional strong and even redundant mechanisms that contribute to establishing the integral central command for such a vital function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Microglia in relation to gender and age</title><p>The number and morphology of microglia throughout brain development are dependent upon the sex and age of an individual, as well as the particular brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>).

Accordingly, we did not discriminate between male and female embryos in our experiments, although we have no evidence to suggest that the dysfunctions of the central respiratory command observed in the <italic>Spi1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryo was other than a consequence of the absence of microglia, whatever the sex of the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Microglia colonize the CNS early during embryogenesis and contribute to various developmental processes. The early roles of embryonic microglia have only begun to be described in rodents, including the regulation of axonal tract formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pont-Lezica et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squarzoni et al., 2014</xref>), positioning of migratory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squarzoni et al., 2014</xref>), modulation of neurogenesis and synapse refinement (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Witcher et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, microglia are implicated in a wide range of processes, rendering these cells important contributors to the assembly and refinement of central neuronal circuits during ontogenesis. In the context of breathing control, the possible roles of microglia have so far been mainly investigated in relation to inflammatory responsiveness and its impact on rhythm generation, autoresuscitation, chemoreception, and plasticity at postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huxtable et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huxtable et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tadmouri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lorea-Hernández et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camacho-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyeler et al., 2020</xref>). Here, in a first description of the distribution and role of microglia in the embryonic hindbrain, we provide new data on the contribution of microglia to the early anatomical and functional development of brainstem networks responsible for respiratory rhythmogenesis. Our findings thus underline the critical role played by these brain-resident macrophages in the ontogeny of central neuronal circuits, including those controlling vital physiological functions. Future work now requires identifying the cellular actors, signaling pathways, and mechanistic processes supporting this role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures employed in this study were conducted in accordance with the local animal welfare ethics of the University of Bordeaux as well as national and European committee regulations.

All preparations were dissected in aCSF maintained at 4°C and continuously bubbled with oxygen. Embryos were first decerebrated then the brainstem was isolated from the embryos' head by a rostral section performed at the junction between the rhombencephalon and mesencephalon, and a caudal section made below the sixth cervical roots. Surrounding tissue was carefully removed in order to keep intact ventral cervical roots required for subsequent extracellular axonal recordings. In addition for calcium imaging experiments, the pia was carefully removed on brainstem preparations at E14.5 to allow dye penetration and cellular imaging. Transverse brainstem slices were further obtained by serially sectioning in the rostral to caudal direction isolated hindbrains mounted in a low melting point agar block using a vibratome (Leica VS 1000, Leica Microsystems, France). A 450-µm-thick slice isolating the preBötC was obtained at an axial level that was ~300 µm more caudal to the posterior limit of the facial nucleus.

Finally, a lookup table was applied to the resultant image in order to link cell density values to different colors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used, in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/UE).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80352-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by an ‘Equipe FRM’ funding (DEQ20170336764) to MTB and IRME funding to OP.

(Pu.1-/- mouse line) indicating that these cells have an important role in the embryonic establishment of critical neural circuits in the brainstem generating breathing motor behavior in mice. The authors examined in comparison to wild-type animals the anatomical and functional characteristics of two main respiratory neuronal groups-in the embryonic parafacial (epF) and the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) respiratory regions that operate together in the developing brainstem to generate the rhythmic neural activity necessary to establish normal breathing behavior and ensure survival at birth. Convincing experimental evidence is presented indicating that these respiratory networks become functional at typical developmental stages in the absence of microglia but exhibit anomalies in endogenous rhythm generation (slower respiratory rhythm). The authors' data suggest that these deficits are associated with reduced cell numbers of active neurons and abnormal rhythmogenesis in epF and reduced commissural axonal projections affecting bilateral activity synchronization of the preBötC circuits generating inspiratory rhythm.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80352.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jeffrey C</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Herlenius</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056d84691</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.08.495245">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495245v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeffrey C Smith as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Herlenius (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since Pu.1 is not specific to microglia and is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors impacting meningeal, choroid plexus, and perivascular macrophages, the authors need to provide additional caveats about neonatal death since in another specific depletion model of microglia, for example, the FIRE mice (Rojo et al., 2019), there are no reported neonatal deaths. Have the authors detected other, including peripheral, deficits of the Pu.1 -/- mice that may have contributed to their immediate postnatal death?</p><p>2) The authors should provide where available, or at least discuss the need for, some quantitative information on the kinetics of microglia colonization of the different brainstem nuclei to present a more precise picture of the observed accumulations from E14.5 to E18.5.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, the size of the VII and epF nuclei appear to be a bit smaller in the mutant conditions. Did the authors carefully analyze this? Similarly, a quantification of the number of Phox2b-/+, Islet1,2-/+ could be performed in control and mutant as it appears different at least in Figure 3B. If there are no effects, the authors should state this.</p><p>4) The authors should be more cautious when referring to microglia using Iba1 or GFP staining in the cx3cr1gfp mouse line as both stain microglia, meningeal, choroid plexus, and perivascular macrophages contrary to P2ry12 that specifically labels microglia in the brain parenchyma. Please add a sentence about the specificity of the staining.</p><p>5) The authors should more clearly discuss the fact that the epF and preBotC regions associated with the perturbations of rhythm exhibit few or no microglia during embryonic development, and thus direct localized effects on these neurons due to microglia deletion would be unlikely.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>After going through this manuscript several times, I cannot find major issues that require revision of the present form of the layout of the scientific rationale behind the experimental design, or the technical execution of the experiments.

This paper indeed indicates that the absence of microglia selectively in the brain does not affect the survival of newborn mouse pups, in contrast to what we observed in the Pu.1 mutants. This therefore argues in favor of a multiple causes of death in the latter mutant in which peripheral deficits potentially affecting meningeal, choroid plexus and perivascular macrophages maybe associated with the central nervous defaults found in our study. We now address this specific point in a new paragraph of the Discussion (pages 13-14), and to also respond to related comments of reviewer 3 (see below).</p><p>Note that we started our experiments using the Pu.1 mutant mouse line in 2014, a long time before the FIRE mouse line was established. It was therefore not possible for us to reproduce all our experiments in parallel with this new mouse line, although we definitively should include mention of the Rojo et al., data in our Discussion. Importantly, these latter findings also provide an explanation for neonatal death in the Pu.1 mutant while the central respiratory networks, despite being significantly affected and unable to sustain actual breathing, still remain capable of generating patterned rhythmic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The kinetics of microglia colonization of the different nuclei in the brainstem should be quantified to have a precise idea of the observed accumulations from E14.5 to E18.5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that the developmental kinetics of brainstem tissue invasion by microglia is not described in detail in our study. However, our goal was not to address this particular issue, but rather to show that at key prenatal developmental stages of the respiratory neuronal network (E14.5 for the epF and E16.5 for the preBötzinger complex) microglia are indeed present in brainstem areas hosting the respiratory neuronal networks. We therefore feel that presenting images of microglia colonization at these 3 specific points of development provides a sufficiently supportive basis for our study, and we hope that the reviewer accepts that establishing the detailed developmental dynamic of brainstem microglia colonization is beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 3, the size of the VII and epF nuclei appear to be a bit smaller in mutant conditions.

This led us to perform a new analysis by measuring the rostro-caudal extension of the facial nucleus in several preparations (n = 11) of each genotype. This led to the confirmation that the size of the facial nuclei was indeed significantly shorter in mutant preparations, and we have added a panel to Figure 3 and corresponding text (page 6) to present this new result. We have also extended the Discussion with an additional paragraph addressing a possible link between the preferential distribution of microglia around hindbrain motor nuclei (as described in Figure 1) and this new observation of a smaller facial nucleus in the mutant, with possible associated functional deficits (page 14).</p><p>We are unsure as to what the reviewer means by Phox2b-/+, Islet1,2-/+ cells? We guess that the reviewer refers to epF cells, which are defined as Phox2b+/Islet1,2- cells. We had in fact counted these as quantified in the graph of Figure 3, panel C (see also corresponding text). However the original legend was probably not sufficiently clear about the cellular phenotype of the epF cells counted, and we have modified the legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors could be more cautious when referring to microglia using Iba1 or GFP staining in the cx3cr1gfp mouse line as both stain microglia, meningeal, choroid plexus, and perivascular macrophages contrary to P2ry12 that specifically labels microglia in the brain parenchyma.

Unfortunately, the anti-P2ry12 antibody from Anaspec is not available anymore and the others disposable ones are not specific enough in our hands. But, in the isolated brainstem preparations we used (whole brainstems or slices), the pia and the choroid plexus were removed before staining and clarity procedures were applied. Thus neither meningeal nor choroid plexus macrophages were included in our preparations, and so we are confident that potential spurious positive signals arising from perivascular macrophages would have been minimal. We have added a sentence in the text to emphasis this point (page 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors report a nice effect on the epF and preBotC neurons but do not clearly discuss the fact that some of the observed effects are in regions that exhibit few or no microglia during embryonic development.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that we now address in the Discussion (page 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 3C, legends should clearly state that the number of quantified cells is Phox2b+, Islet1,2-.

Our major goal was to decipher the role of microglia in the developmental establishment of the central respiratory command, rather than to identify the cause(s) of death in newborn mice devoid of microglia. And indeed, as indicated by this reviewer, the available literature is extremely poor concerning the gross and fine anatomy of Pu.1 mutant mice. In the McKercher (1996) paper (related to Scott et al., 1994) where the original Pu.1 mutant line was first used, it is stated that the mutant’s appearance was ‘unremarkable’, except for individuals occasionally exhibiting a slightly darker red liver, suggesting potential hepatic functional deficits. In addition to anomalies in the hematopoietic lineage described in this paper, the main cause of death that occurs a few days after birth was proposed to be linked to septicemia. In the Back et al., (2004) study, another Pu.1 mutant line generated (which dies at embryonic stages) exhibited anomalies in the liver and in erythropoiesis. Furthermore, Beers et al., (2006) observed a lack of macrophages, neutrophils, T and B cells and CNS microglia. But in none of these publications could we find a description of gross anatomy anomalies or any organ deficits in Pu.1 mutants. Thus, at the present time, a comprehensive anatomical and functional characterization of Pu.1 mutants is lacking.</p><p>We should also add that in our experiments, a small proportion of mutant embryos seemed to die early during embryonic development (around e15.5), with entire embryo’s body turning white in appearance with extremely soft tissue. These subjects were obviously discarded from any subsequent analysis.</p><p>Nevertheless, due to the multiple roles of microglia in developmental processes, it is highly likely that brainstem circuits are not the only affected structures in the Pu.1 mutant. Indeed, reviewer 2 pointed to a study (Rojo et al., 2019) in which the authors found that the specific depletion of microglia in the brain during development did not lead to premature postnatal death in their transgenic mouse. This finding therefore suggests that the cause of immediate death in the Pu.1 mutant has multiple origins, albeit with breathing deficits very probably being the fatal contributor. We now address this specific aspect in a more detailed manner in a new paragraph in the Discussion (pages 13-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, in summary, excellent paper but please add some more refs/discussion or data to underline that the deficits that you have shown are a major contributor to immediate postnatal death.</p><p>ANY sign of Peripheral deficits; eg upper airway, heart, or lung anatomical /functional deficits?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is now addressed more fully in the Discussion, as stated above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
