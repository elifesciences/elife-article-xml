project that, over the course of several weeks in March, reaches hundreds of thousands of people in the United States every year. We combine four approaches to science outreach – gamification, social media platforms, community event(s), and creative products – to run a simulated tournament in which 64 animals compete to become the tournament champion. While the encounters between the animals are hypothetical, the outcomes rely on empirical evidence from the scientific literature. Players select their favored combatants beforehand, and during the tournament scientists translate the academic literature into gripping “play-by-play” narration on social media. To date ~1100 scholarly works, covering almost 400 taxa, have been transformed into science stories. March Mammal Madness is most typically used by high-school educators teaching life sciences, and we estimate that our materials reached ~1% of high-school students in the United States in 2019. Here we document the intentional design, public engagement, and magnitude of reach of the project. We further explain how human psychological and cognitive adaptations for shared experiences, social learning, narrative, and imagery contribute to the widespread use of March Mammal Madness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>education</kwd><kwd>outreach</kwd><kwd>science communication</kwd><kwd>animal ecology</kwd><kwd>animal behavior</kwd><kwd>performance science</kwd><kwd>informal learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hypothetical battles between animals can be used to interest the general public in biology.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Public education and outreach are an essential pillar of 21<sup>st</sup> century scholarship. A substantial portion of empirical research and research infrastructure, especially in higher education, is supported through public funds. Research output is therefore not only expected to serve the public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Hazelkorn and Gibson, 2019</xref>), but a broad view of the social contract conceptually situates scientific knowledge generated with public funds within the public trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Schroeder et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Gibbons, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hetland, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Krishna, 2020</xref>; for important exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Fox, 2020</xref>). Advocacy for Open Science has grown in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Sá and Grieco, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Cribb and Sari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">NASEM, 2018</xref>) but even when scholarly publications are open access, empirical findings too often remain behind a paywall of jargon. As such, institutions, funding agencies, professional societies, and individual scholars increasingly recognize the importance of science communication (hereafter SciComm) and informal STEM education to reach learners, clinicians, policy-makers, and other members of the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beaulieu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Jessani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">National Science Board, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, increased visibility of science and scientists can counter stereotypes about who does science and inspire the next generation of scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib201">Woods-Townsend et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Jarreau et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Across the life, biomedical, physical, and social sciences, scholars participate in SciComm and educational outreach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Cooke et al., 2017</xref>), and increasingly leverage social media platforms to achieve these broader impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">McClain and Neeley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Mehlenbacher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Jarreau et al., 2019</xref>). SciComm and educational outreach campaigns, however, can be variably successful in their content, reach, propagation, and sustainability and “impact” is often opaquely operationalized, measured, or assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Saunders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Davies, 2019</xref>). Web traffic, social media engagement, and long-term use of resources are most often used as indicators of SciComm impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Saunders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Fernández-Bellon and Kane, 2020</xref>). Comprehensive roadmaps of successful SciComm initiatives, campaigns, and programs have been infrequently described in the scholarly literature. Early and recent reports, however, have demonstrated that memes, images, activities, and dynamic content from scientists are associated with increased learner and public interest, competencies, donations, and enthusiasm for nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Moskal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Hone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">McClure et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">McClain, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Lenda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our SciComm program March Mammal Madness (MMM) engages hundreds of thousands of members of the general public in a celebration of animal behavior, and the broader natural world, for several weeks each year. Notably, March Mammal Madness blends together four approaches to science outreach – gamification, social media platforms, community event(s), and creative products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Subhash and Cudney, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Varner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Bush et al., 2018</xref>) – with salient animal-based content. Science communicators have previously recognized that students in the United States are particularly interested in animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Bush et al., 2018</xref>) across urban, suburban, and rural landscapes in which species diversity and visibility varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Schuttler et al., 2019</xref>). At very young ages, children are attracted to neotenous and familiar animal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Borgi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Borgi and Cirulli, 2015</xref>). Children and young adults also express greater affinity for mammals and birds than reptiles, insects, and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Schlegel and Rupf, 2010</xref>). Leveraging the dynamic game elements of a single elimination tournament combined with story-telling scientists, March Mammal Madness makes accessible reports from the scientific literature including elegant behavioral ecology experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Morand-Ferron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>), meticulous natural history descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Able, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Tewksbury et al., 2014</xref>), and gripping narratively-constructed accounts of observed animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Ramsay and Teichroeb, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The tournament also provides lesson plans as an Open Educational Resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Miao et al., 2016</xref>) to educators who systematically integrate March Mammal Madness into their curriculum. March Mammal Madness achieves key SciComm goals by reaching many audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Varner, 2014</xref>), facilitating interactions between scientists and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Boyette and Ramsey, 2019</xref>), and effecting propagation and sustained adoption of the tournament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Stanford et al., 2017</xref>). Across 11 evenings, beginning with a Wild Card through early rounds into the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Trait, the Final Roar, and finally the Championship “battle”, March Mammal Madness is a SciComm extravaganza.</p><p>Here we systematically document our intentional design, magnitude of reach, and compounding impact of March Mammal Madness. We further contextualize how human psychological and cognitive adaptations for games, shared experiences, co-constructed narratives, and artistic illustration likely underlie the sustained success of this science communication approach. We posit that March Mammal Madness models generalizable and scalable tactics for other scientists seeking to develop or expand their own science communication. Alternatively, and with much less effort, scientists can incorporate March Mammal Madness into their own outreach portfolio by introducing the tournament into their labs, classrooms, and communities.</p><p>“<italic>This was no ordinary death,though forty million yearslay between us and that most gaping snarl.

Each year, we release a unique bracket revealing the selected combatants organized into four thematic divisions. Players predict the likely outcomes of sequential encounters between pairs of combatants based on the player’s knowledge, preferences, or taxon allegiances. After allowing players ~ 10 days of research to make bracket predictions, the official tournament outcomes are revealed over several weeks using science-based story-telling. Scientist-narrators “live-announce” the crafted encounters like a sporting event radiocast on the social media platform Twitter, as players follow along, primarily via mobile devices (53%) or desktop/laptop computers (41%). Scientist-narrators typically use a standardized narrative arc, in sequence presenting background “stats” for each combatant, describing the scene of the “battle,” and then creatively report the back-and-forth details of the encounter like a sports play-by-play (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The tournament outcome bracket for March Mammal Madness in 2018.</title><p>Players initially begin with a “blank” bracket listing just the first-round match-ups and predict sequential match outcomes from their pre-existing knowledge, targeted research, and/or guessing. In the 2018 tournament the four divisions were the ‘Antecessors’ (fossil species that “came before” today’s living mammals, stretching back to the synapsids), ‘Great Adaptations’ (mammals that have exceptional and rare traits), and ‘Urban Jungle’ (mammals that survive, and sometimes thrive, in suburbs and cities). The last division, ‘When the Kat's Away’, was a colloquial allusion to entomologist Chris Anderson and ichthyologist Josh Drew inserting a division of non-mammal combatants for the launch of the tournament when mammalogist Katie Hinde was out of the country. In the Final Four, elephant-relative <italic>Amebelodon</italic> emerged victorious from the Antecessors and defeated #AltMammal Orinoco crocodile, but was wounded during the encounter. Coyote may have been king of the Urban Jungle but was no match for the pygmy hippopotamus (from Great Adaptations). In the ultimate showdown, <italic>Amebelodon</italic>’s larger size and weaponry could not overcome his previously-sustained injuries, and he was displaced by surprise 2018 Champion pygmy hippopotamus.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65066-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although rife with pop culture jokes and internet memes, March Mammal Madness is systematically anchored to the scientific literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Hinde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Fisher, 2018</xref>). For each simulated battle, scientist-narrators provide key information about each combatant species and feature facts about behavior, life history, conservation status, phylogeny, morphology, and other exceptional adaptations. Predation tactics, anti-predator defenses, kleptoparasitism, kill ownership, maternal aggression, signaling behavior, optimal foraging, interspecific displacement, sickness behavior, winner effects, gut passage time, and many other aspects of animal behavior, physiology, and morphology are routinely invoked in battle narrations, often with specific citations linked. Additional facts and images are tweeted by geneticists and partner organizations such as the American Society of Mammalogists, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and the Aldo Leopold Foundation. Immediately after the evening’s battles conclude, written “sports summaries” of the battles (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and underlying science and full transcripts of the play-by-play are posted on multiple online platforms including Facebook, Wakelet, Blogspot, and LibGuide so the science behind the outcomes is widely available. These materials are additionally distributed directly to educators using March Mammal Madness in their classrooms so student players can follow the tournament without being on social media or accessing the internet. Our tournament motto perennially emphasizes “If you’re learning, you’re winning.”</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tournament species</title><p>March Mammal Madness has featured hundreds of species from a global distribution of biogeographic regions (N = 383 species across 2013–2019). Combatants have represented N = 25/27 mammalian orders, all except for Paucituberculata and Microbiotheria. Species inclusion as tournament combatants, however, does not achieve proportional representation across mammalian orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Burgin et al., 2018</xref>), much to the oft-communicated ire of researchers studying Chiroptera. Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Diprotodontia are particularly over-represented as tournament combatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and taxa from these orders have more often been featured in two or more tournament years as repeat entrants. Chiroptera, Rodentia, and Eulipotyphla are consistently featured as combatants, but have been under-represented in proportion to their actual species counts, while small-bodied taxa from mammalian orders less familiar to the general public have been routinely showcased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As such, each year our bracket includes well-recognized charismatic megafauna, familiar backyard species, and introduces rare taxa many players have never encountered in their zoo visits, reading, or nature program viewing.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>How the combatants featured in March Mammal Madness compare with mammals in general.</title><p>Proportion of extant species by order across the mammalian class, stacked according to the species count of the order (with the largest order at the bottom; left), and as combatants in March Mammal Madness (right).

While early tournaments only showcased a smattering of non-mammals, since 2018 March Mammal Madness has featured dozens of diverse animal taxa including insect, amphibian, lepidosaurian, archosaurian (including avian), cephalopod, arachnid, crustacean, and tardigrade combatants. In an effort to further expand the topics included in our science outreach and to intentionally disrupt “plant blindness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Jose et al., 2019</xref>), we included several plant species in 2019. Organismal diversity and description have waned as foci within biology curricula, in tandem with decreases in student and public engagement with nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Tewksbury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Greene, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Schmidly, 2005</xref>). By structuring the tournament around organisms and routinely linking to the higher and lower levels of biological complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Greene, 2005</xref>), March Mammal Madness continuously spins a sparkling kaleidoscope of biological life on earth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tournament divisions</title><p>Each year, March Mammal Madness presents combatant species in four novel “Divisions” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In the inaugural year, the divisions were largely organized around mammalian Orders (Carnivora, Primates), that had the dual drawbacks of reduced phylogenetic representation across the mammalian Class and substantial redundancy of attributes among many combatants due to recent shared common ancestry. Since 2014, we have intentionally designed divisions to integrate more complex themes of environments, extinction-risk, adaptations, lexical quirks, among other bins. These divisions demonstrate how biological life can be clustered according to diverse taxonomies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Medin and Bang, 2014</xref>) and facilitate dialogues about historical context of scientific “discovery.” For example, in 2019 the CAT-e-GORY Division featured many “cool cats,” but no species from the mammalian Family Felidae. Rather these were taxa whose English common name or scientific binomial alluded to phenotypic similarities to felids, an extensively used comparand in common names and taxonomic nomenclature. This division provided important opportunities to highlight the intertwining of scientific colonialism, linguistic privilege, and phylogenetics as the co-occurrence of European Imperialism and the formalization of Linnean taxonomy manifested in a rapid global cataloging of fauna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Raj, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Smith and Jackson, 2006</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Each annual March Mammal Madness tournament featured novel divisions that showcased diverse taxa.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th valign="top">Divisions</th><th valign="top">Description</th><th valign="top">Example taxa</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">2013</td><td>Carnivores</td><td>Meat-eaters</td><td>Lion, Wolverine</td></tr><tr><td>Primates</td><td>Primate Order</td><td>Orangutan, Uakari</td></tr><tr><td>Browsers and Grazers</td><td>Herbivores</td><td>Tapir, Moose</td></tr><tr><td>Hodge Podge</td><td>Miscellaneous taxa</td><td>Wombat, Flying Fox</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">2014</td><td>Marine Mammals</td><td>Adapted to marine ecosystems</td><td>Narwhal, Harbor Seal</td></tr><tr><td>Social Mammals</td><td>Highly social species (battle as a team)</td><td>Hyena, African Wild Dogs</td></tr><tr><td>The Who in the What Now</td><td>Lesser-known taxa</td><td>Dhole, Saiga</td></tr><tr><td>Fossil Mammals</td><td>Extinct taxa from the fossil record</td><td>Mastodon, Dire Wolf</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">2015</td><td>Mighty Minis</td><td>Smol bois</td><td>Bumblebee Bat, Tenrec</td></tr><tr><td>Critically Endangered</td><td>IUCN red list taxa</td><td>Iberian lynx, Tenkile</td></tr><tr><td>Sexy Beasts</td><td>Traits strongly influenced by sexual selection</td><td>Irish Elk, Elephant Seal</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical Mammals</td><td>Creatures from cultural myths and folklore</td><td>Minotaur, Yeti</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">2016</td><td>Cold-adapted</td><td>Adapted to cold environments/seasons</td><td>Snow Leopard, Caribou</td></tr><tr><td>Mighty Giants</td><td>Large in size/for their clade</td><td>Panda, Giant Armadillo</td></tr><tr><td>Mascot Mammals</td><td>Mascots of colleges/universities</td><td>(Howard) Bison</td></tr><tr><td>Mammals of the Nouns</td><td>Ecosystem niche featured in common name</td><td>‘Hyrax of the Rock’</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">2017</td><td>Desert-adapted</td><td>Adapted to arid environments</td><td>Aardwolf, Saiga</td></tr><tr><td>Coulda Shoulda</td><td>Contenders defeated unexpectedly 2013–16</td><td>Sabertooth Cat, Lion</td></tr><tr><td>Adjective Mammals</td><td>Common name includes adjective</td><td>Sac-winged Bat</td></tr><tr><td>Two Animals, One Mammal</td><td>Taxa with two-part animal common names</td><td>Spider Monkey</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">2018</td><td>Antecessor</td><td>Synapsids and their fossil descendants</td><td><italic>Dimetrodon</italic>, <italic>Doedicurus</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Great Adaptations</td><td>Unique/exceptional traits</td><td>Crabeater Seal, Aye Aye</td></tr><tr><td>Alt-Mammals</td><td>OK FINE, WE'LL HAVE NON-MAMMALS</td><td>Mantis Shrimp, Secretary Bird</td></tr><tr><td>Urban Jungle</td><td>Taxa that thrive in high density human areas</td><td>Coyote, Rhesus</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">2019</td><td>Waterfalls</td><td>Aquatic adaptations</td><td>Aquatic Genet, Manatee</td></tr><tr><td>Tag Team</td><td>Inter-species mutualisms (battle as a team)</td><td>Banded Mongoose and Warthog</td></tr><tr><td>Jump-Jump</td><td>Adaptations for saltation</td><td>Jackrabbit, Serval</td></tr><tr><td>CAT-e-GORY</td><td>Nomenclature referring to a felid</td><td>Sea Lion, Tiger Owl</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>A mythical mammal division in 2015 stirred controversy as some fans initially averred the inclusion of imaginary species subverted scholarly credibility and competitively inhibited legitimate animals. Discussion of mythical mammals, however, was harmonious with the tournament’s science communication priorities. Importantly, mythical mammals often feature traits or combinations of traits of species within a local ecology that present danger, risk, or usefulness to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Scalise Sugiyama, 2001</xref>), allowing narrators to include information on multiple actual species in tandem with the mythical stories. For example, one contestant was the ichneumon, a mythical mammal which would allow itself to be swallowed by a crocodile and then burst out, and in doing so, would kill its sworn enemy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Budge, 1969</xref>). Through this myth, we were able to not only showcase the role of crocodiles as apex predators in African river systems, but also introduce the biology of ichneumon wasps – a group of insects that lay eggs within other insect species, the larvae hatch within and emerge, thereby killing the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Gauld and Bolton, 1988</xref>). Tales of magic beings or objects have the greatest diffusion across cultural landscapes and can persist for thousands of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">da Silva and Tehrani, 2016</xref>). As such, mythical creatures can serve as valuable symbols around which conservation themes can be structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>). Myths and mythical mammals as phenomena are constructs that emerge from human adaptations for social learning, credulity, and abstract thought, allowing MMM to reflexively discuss how evolution has shaped humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ihejirika and Edodi, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Kline, 2015</xref>). Lastly, by including mythology gleaned from antiquity and ethnography, we hoped to broaden participation among students and scholars in the humanities.</p><p>Within divisions, combatants are assigned relative rankings, termed “seeding”, that suggest expected competitiveness within the tournament construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Schwenk, 2000</xref>). Seedings are largely based on upper limits of combatant mass, with predators “punching above their weight.” Seed assignment can be, in part, to facilitate more reasonable first round match-ups in terms of battle substrate (terrestrial vs. aquatic match-ups are typically avoided in the first round) or to minimize counter-productive digressions in classrooms of adolescents in contexts of various cultural sensibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Skiba et al., 2016</xref>). For example, one year our initial seed assignment would have generated a macaque vs. deer match-up shortly after extensive media coverage of inter-specific sexual behaviors between <italic>Macaca fuscata</italic> and <italic>Cervus nippon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Gunst et al., 2018</xref>), prompting seed re-assignment early in tournament planning. Once we finalize the full bracket line-up, the MMM scientific team conducts additional research to evaluate likely match outcomes, accounting for battle ecology. Following team evaluation and discussion, outcome probabilities are assigned to each match-up. These probability estimations are used in conjunction with a 1-100 random number generator to determine the “official” match outcomes and allows the random occurrence of upsets (see Battle Outcomes below). The scientist-narrators then use the scientific literature or personal experiences in the field to craft plausible battle scenarios. In this way, the tournament incorporates structured game mechanics around science learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Subhash and Cudney, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Battle location (This is not Thunderdome)</title><p>Battle narrations are situated across diverse ecosystems globally and are March Mammal Madness canon. Early rounds of the tournament favor the better-ranked combatant by situating the encounter in their own habitat, a “home-court advantage” that potentially disadvantages their opponent. Adaptations mismatched with ecological context have contributed to tournament losses due to hyperthermia (<italic>Panthera uncia, Gulo gulo</italic>), hypoxia (<italic>Mustela erminea</italic>), and osmotic imbalance (<italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic>). More advanced rounds – the Elite Trait, the Final Roar, and the Championship – are randomized among four possible ecosystems specific to each tournament year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Scientist-narrators often situate battles in specific locations to highlight national parks, conservation areas, public lands and/or endangered ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bland et al., 2017</xref>). Tournament spectators have been figuratively transported to the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan; Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia; the Cojedes River, Venezuela; Bears Ears National Monument, USA; coastal ice flows of Antarctica; Cradle Mountains-Lake St. Clair National Park, Australia; Namib-Naukluft National Park, Namibia; and thorn forests of the Deccan Plateau, India, among hundreds of other locations. Figurative transportation has been combined at times with time travel, as battles involving fossil combatants occur within specific paleoenvironments. For example, a battle between <italic>Andrewsarchus mongoliensis</italic> and <italic>Nuralagus rex</italic> took place 40 million years ago in a humid forest in what is present-day Inner Mongolia. Scientist-narrators frequently highlight aspects of the community ecology, particularly carnivore guilds that have shaped the evolution of the combatant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Caro and Stoner, 2003</xref>). Of additional interest in the tournament are ecosystem engineers whose activities alter physical structures within the environment, impacting numerous other taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Coggan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Battles in the advanced rounds of the tournament take place in one of four randomly selected ecosystems.</title><p>The four ecosystems or habitats that might be used in the advanced rounds of the tournament (that is, in the four Elite Trait battles, the two Final Roar battles and the Championship battle) are announced during the pre-season, with the ecosystem to be used being revealed in “real time” during the play-by-play narration.

Lethal or devastating injuries can occur from predation, anti-predator defense, territorial encounters, or conflict over a recent kill, and were coded as a “technical knock out” (TKO). Scientist-narrators have described apex predators’ mortal attacks on mesopredators, parental defense of young, and other intentional conflicts that escalated into physical attacks. TKO outcomes occurred in ~50% of tournament battles (N=225/451). But in nature the injury risks and/or energy costs associated with physical attacks, when weighed against potential benefit, can frequently precipitate de-escalation, retreat, or withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Parker and Rubenstein, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Briffa and Sneddon, 2007</xref>), outcomes often intentionally featured in March Mammal Madness (32%, N=146/451).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>How battles end in March Mammal Madness.</title><p>Most battles conclude with a fatal or debilitating encounter between the two combatants (also known as a technical knock out or TKO).

While only a small proportion of outcomes (5.5%, N=25/451), the Deus ex Machina device often incenses players, but suggests particularly strong long-term retention of information. For example, in 2014 in a 1<sup>st</sup>-round battle between a fossa (<italic>Cryptoprocta ferox</italic>) and a pangolin (<italic>Manis crassicaudata</italic>), a poacher collected the defensively curled pangolin for illegal animal trafficking. The day before this battle was live-tweeted, the IUCN Pangolin working group reported pangolins as the most trafficked animal globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), hence making for not only a topical and timely narrative, but a 3<sup>rd</sup> party intervention that players continue to spontaneously bemoan years later.</p><p>“Other” outcomes (12%, N=55/451) featured in March Mammal Madness battles include prioritization of foraging, dam-building, nest relocation, distraction by mating competition, electrocution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Kumar and Kumar, 2015</xref>), Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Blumstein et al., 2015</xref>), foraging exclusion, displacement, and cryptic hiding. Typically, the better-seeded species defeated the worse-seeded species, but on average 22% (mean=13 ± 2.2 sd) of battle outcomes involved an “upset” in which the worse-seeded species advanced. In the NCAA men’s basketball March Madness tournament, historically ~22% of outcomes have been characterized as “upsets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Greenburg, 2019</xref>). We do note, however, that the NCAA definition of upset is more conservative in terms of relative rankings – 2 or more seeds distant – as is appropriate for a more evenly-matched tournament in which all participants are of the same species.</p><p>Events occurring in one round are carried forward in a combatant’s story arc. Combatants advancing in the tournament have had to grapple with snapped canines, wrenched knee joints, wound infections, envenomations, and zoonotic disease transmissions.

Artists have used both digital approaches and traditional illustration media, including graphite, pen and ink, scratchboard, and acrylic paints, to depict each of the competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Artists created individual illustrations for each competitor for their tournament debut, and a “victory” illustration with each advance in the tournament. First round artwork has generally been produced with a minimum of detail, while illustrations for advances became sequentially more refined. As a result, by the completion of the tournament, the champion competitor has been depicted in seven individual illustrations.

The diverse skillsets among the MMM team facilitate an annual “SciComm spring training” for messaging to the public.

Contributors to MMM gain visibility, a wider audience through new followers, and an expanded social media network. Additionally, contributors’ study taxa and topics are intentionally showcased in the tournament. MMM contributors have been featured in media interviews, podcasts, news stories, and blogs that discuss the tournament, expanding their media experience and connections with science journalists. In this way, the broader impacts of March Mammal Madness are twofold, both in communicating science to the public and preparing scientists to publicly communicate. Moreover, the MMM contributor community supports, mentors, cheers, and cares for each other throughout the year. Informal peer-support networks are important in the development of early-career researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Macoun and Miller, 2014</xref>), particularly for identities underrepresented in academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agosto et al., 2016</xref>). The use of Twitter as a primary platform expands the opportunities for informal mentoring and support and can accommodate the unfortunately transient aspects of early career stages by facilitating access to colleagues and confidants regardless of geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ferguson and Wheat, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Emergent community: public, scientists, and institutions</title><p>Although tournament content is widely available across multiple social media and website platforms, the most dynamical interactive aspects occur on Twitter. Twitter not only provides the figurative amphitheater allowing spectators to actively engage during the “battles,” but facilitates an active, interconnected community among the citizenry. Students, fans, scientists, academics, and institutions hilariously interact during the weeks of the tournament and, to a lesser extent, throughout the year. In this way, March Mammal Madness reaches many “publics” and explicitly dismantles boundaries among scientists, students, and the broader members of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Varner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Jarreau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cheplygina et al., 2020</xref>), an important component in stemming misinformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Scheufele and Krause, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Particularly compelling jokes, combatants, themes, and controversies become ongoing hashtags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Buarki and Alkhateeb, 2018</xref>). Hashtags, such as #2019MMM, function to coordinate creators and consumers toward relevant content on social media platforms. In this way, searching or following hashtags facilitates access to topics and communities. On Twitter, users have “real time” content in their “timeline”, and can use hashtags to filter popular or recent tweets. Scientist-narrator celebration of carnivore dentition has perpetuated into the perennial exclamation of #carnassials. Bloodthirsty spectators disappointed in accurate withdrawal outcomes have for years hollered for #carnage. In response, plant biologists now routinely decry the rampant #PlantCarnage perpetrated by herbivores in battle narrations. In 2016, the giant panda was described as simultaneously “the worst bear” and “the worst herbivore,” due to poor digestion of the cellulose that comprises the majority of the panda’s diet – earning the continuing moniker #WorstBear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Woolston, 2016</xref>). In 2019, the inclusion of mutualists Bornean Bat (<italic>Kerivoula hardwickii</italic>) &amp; Pitcher Plant (<italic>Nepenthes hemsleyana</italic>) not only inspired the hashtag #TeamBatToilet, but also the fan-created Twitter account @TeamBatToilet that heckled, cheered, and informed throughout the tournament. One particularly purrsistent fan-generated hashtag has been #CatScandal, as felid aficionados pawsited that systematic bias, rather than infurriority, contributed to the early exits of cat combatants from the tournament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Kosmala, 2016</xref>).</p><p>But one MMM joke outsizes them all (no, not the <italic>Paraceratherium</italic> ‘Walter’). During a 2016 first round mustelid-e-mustelid battle, Prof. Kristi Lewton narrated the relative mass “1 wolverine = 67 stoats,” a hilarious device subsequently applied to additional battle narrations as numerous combatants were converted into stoat units. Several nights later, Lewton reported her discovery that the stoat unit of measurement was used as early as 1866 when esteemed natural historian and Royal Society Fellow George Allman described an otter shrew as “somewhat larger than a stoat” in his treatise on the clade in the Transactions of the Zoological Society of London. Subsequently the artistic director and editor collaborated to create an official conversion chart. To date, #StoatsAsMeasurement remains one of the most popular MMM hashtags among fans (and scientist-narrators), routinely tweeted hundreds of times each year.</p><p>March Mammal Madness intentionally builds connections with other science communication and education campaigns.

Although ~1400 tweets annually are official tweets generated by the MMM team, an additional 40,000+ tweets are created or shared by the active MMM Twitter community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In 2019, the highest annual hashtag use to date, 5400 accounts used the tournament hashtag, tweeting to 13.3 million followers. Cumulative estimates of timeline deliveries of tweets using the tournament hashtag 2017–2019 are in excess of 339 million, although not all tweets will be seen by all followers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). On Twitter, as of fall 2019, the tournament account had 17,000+ followers and retweeted only official tournament tweets by organizers and contributors, thus showcasing only scientific and artistic content while shielding followers from any fandom intensity that manifests as profane exclamations on the tournament hashtag. This “MMMletsgo” account was spontaneously created in 2016 by then high school junior Emma Willcocks, and she continued to maintain the account as a college undergraduate majoring in Biology. All official tournament tweets since 2013 have been archived, initially on Storify, but with the scheduled extinction of that platform in 2018, the March Mammal Madness collection was migrated to Wakelet where it continues to be curated. All scientific content of tournament battles remains available and, to date, the archive has been viewed tens of thousands of times. As of Fall 2019, 6,500+ accounts followed the March Mammal Madness Facebook page and the day the 2019 tournament bracket dropped the FB post organically reached 43,000+ Facebook newsfeeds from user engagement.

The platform collects usage statistics and can generate customized usage reports to assess how users are navigating the resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Gessner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Griffin and Taylor, 2018</xref>). Across tournament years, use of the ASU Library March Mammal Madness LibGuide has increased 14-fold, from N = 18,992 page views in 2017 to N = 274,926 in 2019. Not only is this the highest traffic LibGuide created at ASU, in 2019 the MMM LibGuide was the 125th out of over 700,000 LibGuides on Springshare, putting it in the top 0.0002% on the platform. Each year, the top three elements of the MMM LibGuide have consistently been the ‘How to Play’ (38 ± 7%), ‘Annual Tournament Information Page’ (29 ± 4%), and ‘Animal Information’ (26 ± 4%). The ‘Animal Information’ page of the LibGuide links to resources such as Animal Diversity Web, Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, and the Encyclopedia of Life as students conduct background research to make predictions for bracket outcomes. Use of the MMM LibGuide is primarily during the pre-tournament period after brackets of species combatants have been publicly released but before the tournament battle narrations have begun (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Importantly, the MMM LibGuide provides a stable location for the tournament information year-to-year to aid educator and student use and the .edu webaddress is not typically blocked by school or library public computer browser filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Cameron et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Pageviews of the ASU LibGuide before and during the MMM tournament.</title><p>Daily page views for the MMM ASU LibGuide were greatest during the pre-tournament research period, but active traffic was sustained during the tournament as seen for 2017, 2018 and 2019; for each year, day 0 is the day the tournament bracket was released.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65066-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Oxford University Press has curated a special issue of articles from the Journal of Mammalogy and Mammalian Species that feature combatant species since 2017.

Traffic to the special issue each March has been monotonically increasing from N = 1743 pageviews in 2017 to N = 12,110 in 2019. Indeed, in 2019, traffic to the March Mammal Madness special issue accounted for over 14% of all traffic to the journal for the entire month of March.</p><p>Educators have increasingly adopted March Mammal Madness due to word-of-mouth about teacher and student enthusiasm, intentional design of curricular materials, and educational resources such as the ASU LibGuide. In response to informal teacher feedback, we invited educators in February 2017 to submit requests for early access to the bracket to facilitate planning for classroom use before it became publicly available. We expanded this practice in 2018 to include not only early release of the bracket, but pre-tournament and tournament lesson plans and worksheets for educators to integrate MMM into their science classrooms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>). The lesson plan included a pre-tournament research phase in which students chose (or were assigned) 1–2 of the 65 animals in the tournament bracket. Students then created animal profiles from researching the animals’ biomes, adaptations, and trophic levels. Once each annual tournament began and scientist-narrators provided narrative play-by-plays explaining the battle outcomes, students completed worksheets comparing and contrasting their predictions with the scientific explanations from the official tournament outcomes. The lesson plans and worksheets prompt students to answer questions about the species relating to Next Generation Science Standards: behavior, evolution, adaptation, human impacts, and ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">National Research Council, 2015</xref>). Beginning in 2019, we developed additional permutations of the worksheets that emphasized anatomy and physiology, classification system, and genetics, partly in response to survey findings from 2018 (described below) that revealed the breadth of courses taught by educators using March Mammal Madness. Additionally, as few Americans can name a living scientist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Research!America, 2020</xref>), the worksheets prompted students to report information about the scientist(s) who conducted the research that was cited in the battle. To better harmonize tournament content with classroom curriculum, internal MMM protocols for battle narrations were updated annually to coordinate battle narration content with the student worksheets distributed to educators. In this way, we have positioned March Mammal Madness for propagation and sustainable adoption by educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Stanford et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Sequential surveys of educators in 2018 and 2019 indicate that March Mammal Madness has been adopted across all continents except Antarctica, reaching hundreds of thousands of students since 2013. The 2018 survey prioritized a quantitative assessment of the educational contexts in which educators were distributing the tournament bracket to students, whereas in 2019 we conducted a more qualitative assessment of how educators were using the tournament in their classrooms and their perceptions of student impact. Among educators requesting March Mammal Madness open educational resources in 2018 and 2019, an astonishing 99.6% and 99.7% opted to participate in the annual survey, although not all respondents answered each survey question (for information about surveying educators and more typical response rates of 20–30%, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Neal et al., 2020</xref>). In 2018, N = 1594 survey respondents provided information about the number of students to whom they intended to distribute the bracket (N = 119,768 students), courses and grade levels they taught, and the rural/suburban/urban context of their school and its geographical region. In 2019, N = 3171 survey respondents requested March Mammal Madness materials to use with their N = 245,483 students and provided information about how they found out about the tournament and whether/how they would integrate these materials into their curriculum. We note that 37% (N = 1173/3162) of the educators responding to the 2019 survey had previously used March Mammal Madness in their classrooms and may have continued to teach some of the same students, so we are unable to definitively combine the student totals across 2018 and 2019 to generate a cumulative number of students. Regardless, we expect that these educator and student numbers likely underestimate the reach of the tournament because we release the bracket and teaching resources from an embargo over a week before the tournament begins. At that point, the bracket and teaching resources become freely available and are likely widely shared within and across educator groups and websites. Indeed, in the 2019 survey, educators reported they were most likely to have found out about the tournament through Facebook teacher groups (N = 1360/3157; 43%) or directly from colleagues (N = 674/3157; 21%).</p><p>The majority of educators using March Mammal Madness teach life sciences to high school students and are proportionately distributed across the United States. In the 2018 survey, nearly all educators were situated within the United States (N = 1538/1593, 96.5%) as were their students (N = 117,079/119,745 students; 97.7%). Over ninety percent of the educators using March Mammal Madness taught classes in the life and earth sciences (N = 1448/1586; 91.2%), particularly biology and/or environmental science (N = 1093), but zoology, anatomy and physiology, geology, oceanography, mammalogy, ecology and evolution, zoology, and other sciences were represented. Educators outside the life sciences taught general education, humanities, math/statistics, physical sciences, special education, science communication and other courses. March Mammal Madness is primarily used by K-12 teachers (N = 1516/1589, 95.4%), mainly high school (grades 9–12; N = 1099) and middle school teachers (grades 6–8; N = 244). A smaller proportion of the respondents were elementary school teachers (K-5; N = 80) and college faculty (N = 72), or taught across elementary, middle school, and high school boundaries (N = 94). Importantly, datasets made available through the National Center for Education Statistics from the U.S. Department of Education allow us to evaluate MMM reach within the broader context of education in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Glander, 2017</xref>). March Mammal Madness use was largely proportionately distributed across geographic regions of the United States (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) based on SY15-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Glander, 2017</xref>), the most recent year for which data are available. Although over-represented among rural (N = 25,857/115,433; 22.3%) and suburban (N = 65,812/115,443; 57%) communities, and under-represented in urban communities (N = 23,714/115,443; 20.6%), in 2018 March Mammal Madness was distributed to K-12 students somewhat similarly to their distribution across urban-suburban-rural gradients in the United States (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Glander, 2017</xref>).

In the 2019 survey, educators reported that they most typically planned to use the tournament as an embedded component in units on adaptation, diversity of life, biological interactions, human impact, ecosystems, taxonomy and other topics to introduce, discuss, reinforce, or review course content (N = 2119/3026, 70%). Over a quarter of educators planned for students to engage in the tournament through in class activities often involving a combination of pre-tournament research, presentation, and/or project (individual or group) to support critical thinking, team-building, and ‘explain, justify, argue from evidence’ skills (N = 852/3026, 28%). Very few educators planned to only use the tournament for an extra credit activity (N = 53/3026, 1.8%). Educators who had familiarity with the tournament prior to 2019 were more likely to explain how the tournament would be implemented with a specific plan/purpose than were educators participating for the first time in 2019 (N = 1107/1136, 97% vs. N = 1359/1883, 80%; Chi<sup>2</sup> = 224.3, p&lt;0.0001). In many cases, students would present their background research on an animal combatant through a promotional poster or public speaking. Relatively few educators integrated art, creative writing, or group work in conjunction with March Mammal Madness in 2019. Numerous teachers described building a large bracket in school hallways surrounded by student-generated, species summaries:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>“Students will research animals and adaptations and write a paragraph about why their animal could win MMM.

In both annual surveys, the final prompt was an invitation for the educators to share any comments they had about the tournament. In 2018 and 2019, ~90% of educators who responded to this prompt included positive content (N = 265/279 and N = 632/704, respectively) with fewer than 4% of comments including negative content. Semantic textual analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Bree and Gallagher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Maguire and Delahunt, 2017</xref>) showed that 28% (N = 257/910) of educators spontaneously described March Mammal Madness as “fun,” “great,” and/or “awesome.” Over 40% of responding educators (N = 373/910) used the word “love” – their students’ love and/or their own – for March Mammal Madness. Qualitative thematic analysis with latent evaluation of educator’s answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Bree and Gallagher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Maguire and Delahunt, 2017</xref>) revealed not only the educators’ appreciation that the tournament connected to curricula, but several compelling themes were identified about how the tournament stimulated emotional engagement, skill development, and interest in science.

By conducting the surveys in the lead-up to the tournament, our educator respondents represent two distinct categories: (1) educators experienced with March Mammal Madness whose positive or beneficial experiences in the past motivate sustained adoption of the tournament and (2) educators who plan to use the tournament for the first time. This design does not allow us to learn about the experiences and perspectives of educators who, having tried the tournament once, do not sustainably adopt March Mammal Madness. Additionally, by asking about experiences one and more years ago in an online survey, recall bias may influence responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bell et al., 2019</xref>). For further research, a combined pre-tournament and post-tournament survey design and/or a smartphone survey app throughout the tournament has the potential to better assess myriad educator experiences while using the tournament with their learners. Moreover, although educators are reliable in assessing the achievement of their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Rimfeld et al., 2019</xref>), educator responses to our surveys represent pooled observations and an aggregate assessment of their students’ engagement with March Mammal Madness. Future research should more directly assess individual student perceptions, emotional affect, learning, and meta-cognitive outcomes as a function of participation in the March Mammal Madness tournament across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Narrative facilitates learning</title><p>The bracket-based tournament structure of March Mammal Madness functions as a narrative arc and immerses “learners in a captivating world populated by intriguing characters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Mott et al., 1999</xref>). Through narrative, learners are transported across time and space, draw inferences, and experience emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Gerrig, 1993</xref>). Information constructed in narrative is easier to comprehend, read faster, better recalled and inconsistencies are more readily detected than are other forms of exposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Dahlstrom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Glaser et al., 2009</xref>). Narrative-centered learning has important motivational benefits by promoting learner self-efficacy, interest, presence, and perception of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">McQuiggan et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, narrative-based educational activities enhance learning and memory by working within cultural frameworks and cognitive architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Mott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Neeley et al., 2020</xref>). Due to computational demands of content processing, the effectiveness of narrative-based education is contingent on scientific information being integral to the story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Fisch, 2000</xref>). Instead of sharing lists of animal facts or relegating outcomes to a process of voting, March Mammal Madness scientist-narrators present facts embedded in suspenseful descriptions of combatant’s offensive and defensive maneuvers as though observing such an encounter in real time. In this heightened, shared moment, we are all as naturalists observing animal behavior, imagined in the mind’s eye. The dynamism of narrative enhances emotional engagement among players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Glaser et al., 2009</xref>), especially elements of suspense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Gerrig, 1993</xref>).</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>“Oh, right, something we forgot to mention until JUST RIGHT NOW... that might be important...

Notably players are adept at recognizing that in this manufactured March Mammal Madness story world, they are “spectating” on naturalistically-inspired encounters. The animal combatant is constructed as oblivious to any tournament and therefore can have very divergent goals and motivations from the spectators. This situation precipitates many hilarious Twitter exclamations of encouragement, especially when considered through the multiple layers of imagination and theory of mind. Since the play-by-play is written in advance, but the announcing “occurs” as though in real-time on social media, effectively the spectator is yelling at a representation of an animal in their mind, collaboratively crafted by their pre-existing knowledge and the information being provided by the scientist-narrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Gerrig, 1993</xref>). In this way, storytelling represents iterative theory of mind among narrators and audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bietti et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the gamified bracket format “story arc” facilitates exploration, collaboration, and reflection among students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Mott et al., 1999</xref>). Presenting a list of 60+ animal species and tasking students with researching their adaptations and ecosystems would likely manifest as onerous busy-work, but gamefication of those same species arranged in a bracket with the question “Who Would Win?” skyrockets student psychological and emotional engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Hamari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Lee and Hammer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Subhash and Cudney, 2018</xref>). Educators routinely highlight the collaborative discussions among students during pre-season research, as they speculate and hypothesize about various attributes, environments, and other contingencies that may influence the tournament outcomes. Educators reported that the tournament facilitated assignments on conducting research, critical thinking, and generating reasoned claims from evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">McNeill and Martin, 2011</xref>). Importantly, during in-person learning, nearly 100% of US-based schools have internet access in classrooms, computer labs, or a school library to facilitate their research of combatant taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Fortner et al., 2018</xref>). In conjunction with discussions among classmates, students individually generate predictions of the outcomes of combatant encounters across tournament rounds until they construct a completed bracket and identify their tournament champion. In this way, students are active agents in their learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Reeve and Tseng, 2011</xref>) and co-constructors of narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Mott et al., 1999</xref>), creatively integrating animal and ecological information in new combinations across tournament rounds. March Mammal Madness, depending on how the tournament is delivered to and perceived by learners, has the potential to access numerous dimensions underlying learner engagement. Importantly, learner engagement reflects emotional, behavioral, and cognitive investment, with personal agency and social embededness also playing key roles, and contributes in part to learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ciric and Jovanovic, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Veiga, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Scientist-narrators expect students have conducted scouting research and provide added value by crafting narrative explanations for outcomes gleaned from primary literature. These outcomes may be consistent with the student’s hypothesized battle or share exciting new information. As such, the March Mammal Madness format explicitly rejects the deficit-based approaches that are ineffective for science outreach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Varner, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>) and adheres to the known-new construct that effectively scaffolds knowledge and supports learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Mukherjee, 2018</xref>). Further, the tournament manifests the learning environment advocated by Mott and colleagues in 1999 “…<italic>by enabling learners to be co-constructors of narratives, narrative-centered learning environments can promote the deep, connection-building meaning-making activities that define constructivist learning</italic> (pg. 78).”</p><p>While educators in many subject areas, such as history and the language arts, embraced narrative-centered learning in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, this educational device has achieved lower penetrance in the sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Klassen, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Glaser et al., 2009</xref>). When present in science education, narrative-based approaches are often embedded within computer games, artificial intelligence, and virtual-reality based systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">McQuiggan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Qian and Clark, 2016</xref>), access to which is inequitably distributed in the US and globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Resta and Laferrière, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Fortner et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, users of March Mammal Madness can retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute the tournament bracket and lesson plans at no cost to educators, students, and the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib199">Wiley et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, in a head-to-head match-up, a narrative-based approach without digital technology performed as well, if not better, than did an educational computer game in shaping student learning outcomes and interest in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Sadler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The scientific illustrations embedded in March Mammal Madness parallels expanding initiatives for arts-integrated science instruction. Humanities and arts educational elements, integrated within STEM, are thought to better support student creativity, learning, collaboration, and enthusiasm for the life and physical sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Perignat and Katz-Buonincontro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Hardiman et al., 2019</xref>).

In this way integrating artistic creativity into science classrooms can contribute to addressing achievement gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Hardiman et al., 2019</xref>). Drawing organisms and observed phenomena in field journals was essential within the naturalist skillset and illustrators and biologists advocate for the resurrection of this arts-science integration within the natural sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Merkle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Schmidly, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although Western education has been slow to restore narrative in science teaching, story-telling as pedagogy is found across human societies and facilitates intergenerational transfer of ecological knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Scalise Sugiyama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">da Silva and Tehrani, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). In numerous traditional and Indigenous cultures, knowledge and ways of knowing are intrinsically embedded in nature and children socially learn via storytelling by Elders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Little Bear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Hare, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Medin and Bang, 2014</xref>).

Among First Nations communities in Canada “children engaged in learning that was experiential, land based, narrative and inter-generational” better situated their learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Hare, 2012</xref>). In re-centering traditional knowledge and ways of knowing, Kaupapa Māori theory and practice in Aotearoa (New Zealand) make use of traditional pedagogical story-telling, and a wide family of story-tellers, for learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Smith, 2000</xref>). Analyses of children’s books revealed that books by Native American authors and illustrators were more likely to be characterized as close-up views of animals than were children’s books by non-Native authors and illustrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Medin and Bang, 2014</xref>). Further, decolonizing narratives of “<italic>nature–culture relations</italic>” and land dynamism can importantly contribute to global dialogues about the climate crisis and improve climate education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">McGinty and Bang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Greene, 2020</xref>).

Rigorous psychological research has demonstrated that children have content learning biases for animals, particularly dangerous animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Broesch et al., 2014</xref>), and even plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Wertz, 2019</xref>). Additionally, children engage in ecological reasoning, referring to habitat relations when presented with pictures of biological species, though cultural differences likely shape children’s spontaneous reasoning about food chain relations and biological needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Medin and Bang, 2014</xref>). Notably, humans are characterized by a particularly extended period of juvenility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Crittenden and Meehan, 2016</xref>) that involves substantial social learning via story-telling, a pedagogical approach disrupted in Western schooling practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Scalise Sugiyama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Neeley et al., 2020</xref>).

Indeed, across numerous cultures end-of-day fireside gathering of family and friends is often dedicated to story-telling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Wiessner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Animals feature prominently in many oral traditions, stories, and folklore and may represent fitness-relevant information for predator avoidance, hunting success, and safe navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Sugiyama, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">da Silva and Tehrani, 2016</xref>). These evolved capacities for content biases, storytelling, and social learning reveal that humans are adapted for narratives about the world we navigate.</p><p>Additionally, for tens of thousands of years, human creativity has manifested in artistic representations of animals. From the 35,000 years-old cave painting of a babirusa in Sulawesi, Indonesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aubert et al., 2019</xref>) to the depictions of extinct marsupial megafauna <italic>Thylacoleo carnifex</italic> by Aboriginal Australians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akerman and Willing, 2009</xref>), human artists have exquisitely portrayed the physical and behavioral traits of sympatric species. Such artwork reveals essential natural history knowledge. For example, petroglyphs featuring predator-prey dynamics, often between felids and cervids, are found among the Scythian nomadic Iron Age culture of the Altai mountain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Fitzhugh, 2009</xref>). The behavioral attributes of life history stage are shown in the hiding young steenbok and following elephant calf in the rock paintings in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Parkington, 2003</xref>). Moreover, animal depictions in Paleolithic cave art correlated with faunal availability in the local ecology and likely reflected necessary knowledge for successful hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Rice and Paterson, 1986</xref>). Animal motifs are found widely adorning the architecture of antiquity such as the lions on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Rodler et al., 2019</xref>) and the jaguars on Olmec monuments in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Grove, 1972</xref>). These animal depictions can range from realistically zoomorphic to the abstractly symbolic. In more recent centuries, scientific illustration, clay or glass models, and taxidermy became common approaches to making life-like the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Péquignot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Topper, 1996</xref>). Within this human tradition, March Mammal Madness has been greatly enhanced by the ongoing contributions of an incredible artistic team (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, through illustration and narrative, these stories of science are crafted, and made indelible in our ‘hearts’ and minds.</p><p>March Mammal Madness narratives provide a collective spectator experience that emerges from multiple dimensions of human psychology and cognition. The real-time, single elimination tournament structure manifests a virtual “event” in which participation can vary along a continuous spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Getz and Page, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Davies, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>) from minimal research in bracket selections to deep immersion in every battle. To the extent that an individual participates and engages with others, the event manifests as a dynamic, community-building experience that motivates repeat participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Getz and Page, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>). The emergent “communitas – a temporary sense of closeness and camaraderie” among participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>) likely contributes to enthusiasm for March Mammal Madness even when one’s selected champion is defeated in a battle narration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>). Players routinely tweet about deep emotional engagement as scientist-narrators tweet the battle play-by-play, describing their own shouting, cheering, laughing, jumping, and yelling in response to animal maneuvers and battle events (and the startled responses of their families, roommates, and pets in response to exclamations). Players have even expressed bewilderment at their own emotional investment in an imaginary tournament as they find themselves choked up about the fictional death of a beloved combatant. Educators described friendly competitions among their classes, school-wide engagement, and, in one case, a cross-town rivalry. Educators have also offered extra credit, trophies, or merely bragging rights for “Beat the Teacher” and “Beat the Principal.” The many unfamiliar species and the secrecy of the battle outcomes “evens the playing field” between educators and learners (for once teachers DON’T already know the answers!), and among learners, between high-achieving students and their classmates. This “leveled play” aspect of the tournament likely facilitates wider buy-in among learners. The game mechanic elements within the tournament structure are combined with gamified rewards as implemented in classrooms and among social groups of co-workers, friends, and families in the forms of points, trophies, and prizes. Gamified learning often improves learner attitude, engagement, and performance, but research on gamification and game-based learning has been primarily conducted among college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Subhash and Cudney, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the March Mammal Madness tournament is finite in duration each year, the resonating emotions, enduring communities, and retained knowledge suggest a lasting impact. Past tournament events are routinely revisited through hashtags and retelling of stories. Such activities contribute to the formation and maintenance of a collective tournament memory and group history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bietti et al., 2019</xref>). Interactions with nature and live animals can build enduring connections with the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Bush et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Schuttler et al., 2018</xref>) but present ethical, logistical, scalable, and safety challenges in many contexts. We speculate that some of the animal “characters” that emerge from MMM story arcs make similar, lasting connections, without commensurate costs to a living animal and partially bridge the loss of human-nature interactions in increasingly urbanizing human populations. Parents have emailed hilarious photos and stories of their children at zoo exhibits of species featured as MMM combatants. Moreover, although we routinely select cute, familiar, and dangerous mammals that appeal to content biases among children and adults, the inclusion of rare taxa and their ecosystems raises their visibility and familiarity for hundreds of thousands of students and the general public. By weaving together elements of the humanities and social sciences into the tournament, both in the delivery and design, March Mammal Madness models important approaches to science communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Bush et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Neeley et al., 2020</xref>), scientific literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Roth and Lee, 2002</xref>), and biodiversity conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Lenda et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, by crafting stories of organisms and the rich details of their lives, and highlighting the exquisite work of well-known and emerging naturalists, March Mammal Madness contributes to a necessary “revitalization of natural history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Tewksbury et al., 2014</xref>) that fosters curiosity-driven learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Farris, 2020</xref>).</p><p>March Mammal Madness is widely appealing and facilitates myriad connections among numerous publics. The combination of animals, bracket, experts, and narrative absorbs diverse audiences across geographic regions, rural-urban gradients, and age groups. As “Nerds of Trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">McClain, 2017</xref>), we have fielded queries from grandparents, afterwork drinking buddies, hospital radiographers, retirees, Hollywood industry workers, veterinarians, high school students, and many others. Educators report the enduring enthusiasm of their students, including students not typically engaged in the science classroom. As such, March Mammal Madness reaches beyond typical SciComm audiences with established interests in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Ocobock and Hawley, 2020</xref>). The tournament, however, also has extensive traction across university, museum, and conservation communities. Scholars have referenced the tournament in various academic publications including in the acknowledgements of a PhD dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib200">Woods, 2018</xref>), in a book review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Fox, 2018</xref>), and in an article figure description in which <italic>Paraceratherium</italic> is called ‘Walter’ from #2014MMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Sulak et al., 2016</xref>).

Few studies have assessed the long-term learning outcomes of zoo, museum, and science festival visits, as such outcomes are shaped by a constellation of factors, but such experiences for children and adults are important exposures to animals, biological systems, scientists, and self-directed exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Godinez and Fernandez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Mujtaba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Davies, 2019</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>). The extent to which participation in March Mammal Madness increases scientific knowledge among audiences similarly remains to be determined, but reports from educators emphasized that the tournament sustainably engaged learners and facilitated individual and collaborative practice with consolidation of information, advanced planning, and critical thinking.

Scientists situate ourselves in the domain of data collection framed by hypotheses and predictions as we speculate about the world(s) around us. But fundamentally these are just grown-up words for ideas hewn from imagination and the creative combination of what is known to journey into the unknown. March Mammal Madness is collective, “performance science” – the stories of animals, told creatively with awe for the natural world. We celebrate species and the ecosystems they inhabit, the scientists who conduct studies, and the funders who make the research possible. For a few weeks each year, a vibrant and diverse March Mammal Madness community comes together to collectively marvel at our living planet’s beauty, harshness, and fragility. We acknowledge that humans are at the root of many of the problems we highlight, but also recognize that the communities we reach are essential branches of any solutions. By fostering a greater love and respect for biodiversity, we hope that engaged students and curious publics will be inspired to transform their affection into action and reverence into protection.</p></sec><sec id="s8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s8-1"><title>Species</title><p>In our count of species combatants 2013–2019 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), subspecies were not counted as unique combatants; <italic>Papio</italic> systematics counted as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>; the batfly commensal <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> were considered a single operational taxonomic unit; mythical combatants, though purportedly sharing features with biological species, were not counted as species.

The full 2018 and 2019 survey instruments are included in as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary files 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">7</xref>, respectively. Both the 2018 and 2019 surveys asked specifically how many years the educator had been using March Mammal Madness with their learners (allowing differentiation of experienced and first-time tournament users) and how many students they planned to distribute the bracket to. The 2018 survey asked open-ended questions about the courses/classes and what grade levels the educator taught, specific USA geographical region operationalized by states, or non-USA North America, Central and South America, SubSaharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, Central Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands, South Asia and Southeast Asia, and Europe. Respondents were asked if their local community was rural, suburban, urban (or other) without specifically operationalizing these terms (stage whisper: whoops). The 2018 survey asked how they used the tournament in their classroom. Respondents in 2018 for the last question were prompted to “<italic>Please add any comments you wish to share about MMM</italic>.” The 2019 survey asked an open-ended question about how educators had learned about March Mammal Madness and asked specifically “<italic>In 2019, how will you use MMM in your classroom</italic>?” In 2019, the final question we asked was “<italic>If 2018 was the first year you used MMM in your classroom, please share any comments you have about the experiences of 2018</italic>.”</p><p>Survey responses were evaluated for errors, duplicates, and outliers and then coded for analyses. From the 2018 survey we removed duplicate entries (N = 59), and excluded respondents who did not provide an email address (and therefore could potentially be duplicates; N = 9) and one student who requested materials for their math club, resulting in N = 1594 educators who participated in the survey from the 1598 who requested educational materials (response rate 99.6%). We censored one cell in 2018 that reported the tournament would be distributed to 5000 students, as this number was many multiples (5x) above the continuous distribution of responses to this question. From the 2019 survey we removed duplicate entries (N = 196), and excluded respondents who did not provide an email address (and therefore could potentially be duplicates; N = 19), resulting in N = 3171 educators who participated in the survey from the N = 3184 who requested educational materials (response rate 99.7%). We censored one cell in 2019 that reported the tournament would be distributed to 3500 students, as this respondent indicated that they would distribute materials to teachers in their district to consider distributing to students.</p><p>For survey questions that were open-ended, respondent answers were systematically reviewed, binned (for example answers ‘7th and 8th grade’ binned with ‘grades 7 and 8’ as Middle School; Twitter, twitter, tweet binned together). For our 2019 survey question about how the educator planned to use the tournament in their classroom, N = 3027 provided a textual answer. Answers were coded as either ‘specific plan’ or ‘non-specific plan.’ Examples of specific plans ranged from “<italic>Research project</italic>” to “<italic>Students will create &quot;profile sheets&quot; for one of the animals, which will be displayed in the hallway for reference and passers-by educational purposes. Students can use these profiles to inform their bracket choices. Discussions over battles in class as time allows. Students who beat my bracket receive extra credit.</italic>” Examples of non-specific plans included “don’t know” and “not sure.”</p><p>After data cleaning, and organizing, we were able to tabulate and analyze responses within survey year and, for one analysis, combine answers from both survey years. We conducted a Chi<sup>2</sup> analysis to compare the probability that an educator would provide a specific plan as a function of being a “veteran” or “newbie” user of the tournament using JMP 14 (SAS Institute). While assessing responses for the presence or absence of specific plans for using March Mammal Madness with their learners, some terms repeatedly occurred within the answers. KH used these terms to refine exploration of how educators planned to use MMM with their learners. KH screened text for curricula integration and classroom activities by scanning for keywords within individual respondent answers using an excel formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Bree and Gallagher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Maguire and Delahunt, 2017</xref>). The category for “curricular enhancement” was based on inclusion of ‘add’, ‘bell’, ‘class’, ‘complement’, ‘connect’, ‘content’, ‘curriculum’, ‘discuss’, ‘educat’, ‘enrich’, ‘explor’, ‘exten’ ‘integra’ ‘intro’, ‘learn’, ‘lesson’, ‘look up’, ‘module’, ‘reinforce’, ‘review’, ‘section’ ‘study’, ‘supplement’, ‘teach’, ‘topic’, and ‘unit’. The category for “skill development” was based on inclusion of ‘activit’, ‘argu’, ‘assign’, ‘collab’, ‘critical’, ‘debate’, ‘EJAE’, ‘evaluat’, ‘evidence’, ‘explan’, ‘explain’ ‘group’, ‘justif’, ‘present’, ‘project’, ‘research’, ‘reason’, ‘team’, ‘think’, ‘predict’, ‘poster’, ‘problem-solv’, and ‘problem solv’. For words that had multiple derivations, we used a word root that would capture them collectively. Given this formulaic approach, the answers were secondarily screened for accidental “by-catch.” For example, a formula that assigned “TRUE” to and answer along the lines of ‘in our ecology unit, students will research animals and give presentations of their scouting reports of their traits to the class’ would be accurate, but ‘I’m researching the tournament as I consider using it in my class’ would not and would be reassigned a “FALSE” designation.</p><p>To better understand veteran educators’ key takeaways about their experiences using March Mammal Madness, we combined unique respondents across the 2018 and 2019 surveys who were experienced with using MMM in their classrooms. We accomplished this by pooling veteran educators from the 2018 survey with educators in the 2019 survey whose first year using the tournament was 2018. Of the N = 1192 educators who fit these selection criteria, N = 910 (76%) provided free-write answers when prompted to share comments in the final question in both surveys. Comments were coded as &quot;Positive,&quot; &quot;Negative,&quot; &quot;Constructive,&quot; &quot;Constructive/Positive,&quot; &quot;Mixed Positive and Negative,&quot; and &quot;Other.&quot; Comments were coded as positive or negative depending on whether the comment expressed positive or negative sentiments about emotions, engagement, experiences and/or outcomes from using March Mammal Madness. Comments were coded as “Constructive” if the respondent made a suggestion, wishlist, request, or other constructive critique about March Mammal Madness. If respondent comment had combinations of positive, negative, and constructive elements, they were assigned the relevant combination code. Comments were coded as “Other” if they did not have positive, negative, or constructive elements and instead addressed scheduling conflicts, description of plans, mis-entered response to a different question, or other miscellaneous responses that would have required subjective inference to apply another valence code. Latent evaluation of survey responses by KH inductively revealed several themes and we then conducted semantic screening for thematic keywords within individual respondent answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Bree and Gallagher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Maguire and Delahunt, 2017</xref>) including “love,” “engage,” “fun,” “discuss,” and “former” using cell formulas in Microsoft Excel. We curated illustrative quotations for inclusion in the manuscript. We noted substantial variance in the length and detail of the respondents free-write answers and our blunt, preliminary textual analysis could not effectively explore many elements and nuances among the answers or comprehensively manifest the rich scholarly approaches to qualitative text analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Wutich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bernard et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8-4"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data are publicly available in the ASU Research Data Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dataverse.asu.edu/dataverse/marchmammalmadness">dataverse.asu.edu/dataverse/marchmammalmadness</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Hinde, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Hinde, 2021b</xref>) and linked with the March Mammal Madness Open Resources Collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Perry and Hinde, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Profs.

To all the amplifiers, journalists, educators, students AND ALL PLAYERS, thank you for making March Mammal Madness the transformative community we all deserve. We lastly, and most importantly, acknowledge that the majority of our MMM team members work within settler/colonialist institutions and live and research on stolen land. Science and education anchored to Eurocentrism is impoverished by the exclusion and marginalization of Indigenous people and traditional knowledge, among other deficits of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Eurocentric conservation efforts are similarly inadequate, and we direct readers, and ourselves, to support Indigenous-led environmental organizations including the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ienearth.org/">Indigenous Environmental Network</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.honorearth.org/">Honor the Earth</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including George Perry as the Senior and Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Penny Bishop (Reviewer #1); Michelle Bezanson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers and editors have discussed the reviews and we have drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an outstanding contribution that describes the motivation, mechanics, adoption, and impact of a leading science education activity, March Mammal Madness. The manuscript is written in a highly-engaging style while covering a lot of ground. That is, readers will find continuous points of interest whether they are fellow science communicators, familiar March Mammal Madness participants, educators, or those who will be introduced to this activity via this article, all without losing the sense of the artistry, excitement, and inspiration that embody March Mammal Madness (and this manuscript). Well done.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I am including the full reviews from all three reviewers. In consultation we agreed that all of the (relatively small number of) points raised within the reviews should be considered as essential revisions. Key points include appropriately distinguishing between educator and student perspectives and more directly addressing the operational definition of impact used in this report (and probably, also discussing this on a more expansive basis), and explicitly highlighting the important role of natural history and observational science in the March Mammal Madness ecosystem. See below for additional important points to address in your revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper is a well-conceptualized documentation of a novel approach to science education, namely a tournament, housed on social media, of research-based, hypothetical encounters between mammal &quot;combatants&quot;. It would be of broad interest to scientists interested in new avenues for outreach, as well as to middle and high school educators. The manuscript's strengths include interesting and unusual subject matter, an engaging and accessible tone, and solid substantiation of claims.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review your work. I learned a great deal about MMM, an initiative with which I was unfamiliar previously. You provided a well-organized and detailed accounting of a truly novel approach to science education and outreach. I particularly appreciated the engaging, and even at times humorous, tone, which seems all too rare in scholarly writing. As an educator, I also appreciated your focus on how narrative arcs can facilitate learning, and how gamification, storytelling, and social media can be leveraged towards those ends.</p><p>By documenting the design, you offered appropriate and sufficient context for readers who are unfamiliar with the tournament to understand its aims and approaches. You also effectively established the reach of the tournament, elaborating the nature of the social media community, and the increase in user engagement as documented through blogpost views and Twitter hashtag use, among other measures. The development and use of educational resources associated with the tournament were similarly compelling ways to consider impact.</p><p>I have a few minor suggestions and questions for your consideration that you may find useful.</p><p>1) How you are defining impact for the purposes of this paper is somewhat unclear. Based on some of the data you share, it appears connected to teachers' perceptions of student engagement, whereas educators and the public might assume student learning to be a goal. You make reference to broader impacts related to science communication. I would encourage you to be more explicit about this.</p><p>2) The reliance on teacher perceptions of student experience, rather than students' voicing their own experience, is a fairly common shortcoming in educational research.

I learned a great deal about MMM, an initiative with which I was unfamiliar previously. You provided a well-organized and detailed accounting of a truly novel approach to science education and outreach. I particularly appreciated the engaging, and even at times humorous, tone, which seems all too rare in scholarly writing. As an educator, I also appreciated your focus on how narrative arcs can facilitate learning, and how gamification, storytelling, and social media can be leveraged towards those ends.</p><p>By documenting the design, you offered appropriate and sufficient context for readers who are unfamiliar with the tournament to understand its aims and approaches. You also effectively established the reach of the tournament, elaborating the nature of the social media community, and the increase in user engagement as documented through blogpost views and Twitter hashtag use, among other measures. The development and use of educational resources associated with the tournament were similarly compelling ways to consider impact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so very much. We wanted our manuscript to reflect our tournament by weaving scholarly content with elements of humor. We agree that this is too rare in scholarly writing and speculate that positioning scholars and scholarship as largely humorless is an unforced error that widens the chasm among scientists and publics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a few minor suggestions and questions for your consideration that you may find useful.</p><p>1) How you are defining impact for the purposes of this paper is somewhat unclear. Based on some of the data you share, it appears connected to teachers' perceptions of student engagement, whereas educators and the public might assume student learning to be a goal. You make reference to broader impacts related to science communication. I would encourage you to be more explicit about this.</p></disp-quote><p>Your point is excellent. To better situate impact in our manuscript, we have expanded the Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections (and added ~20 citations). We now more explicitly address how impact has been assessed for SciComm programs in the Introduction, situated educator competence in assessing student achievement and engagement when discussing surveys limitations in the Educational Resources section, and explained how student engagement as a multifactorial construct contributes, in part, to learning outcomes in the broader section on Narrative Facilitates Learning and Human Adaptations at Play.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reliance on teacher perceptions of student experience, rather than students' voicing their own experience, is a fairly common shortcoming in educational research. If you have student-level data, consider adding it. If you don't, consider naming this issue or limitation. Relatedly, the &quot;Emergent Community&quot; section provides lively examples of the type of community that MMM has fostered. I am left to wonder how much of the &quot;fandom&quot; described is comprised of the adult community and what role adolescents in fact play in it, how they perceive it, etc. (I do recognize this is not a central aim of the paper, however. ) Further, the proliferation of laudatory comments from educators regarding their students' experience are impressive. They might be even more compelling, and perceived as more trustworthy, if they were offset by a brief consideration of concomitant challenges or the provision of any negative data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important set of considerations, thank you for presenting them.</p><p>While we have an extensive collection of tweets by engaged students that are available often publicly, particular favorites are kids tweeting that they’ve asked their parents’ permission to stay up past their bedtime to “watch” the twitter battles, student letters requesting particular animal combatants, and photos of learners with brackets conducting research, the identifiable elements and underage status precludes us from treating these as data. Instead we have added text to highlight this limitation and how to address it with future research in the discussion of the limitations of the surveys (more about this below).</p><p>In response to the recommendation for a balanced presentation of “laudatory comments” and “negative data”, we coded the final free-write comments from educators as positive, negative, constructive, combination, or other. In the final “comments” about the experiences of using March Mammal Madness with their learners, ~90% of responses included positive content, fewer than 4% of comments included negative content. In addition to reporting this in the text (and updating the Materials and methods), readers can access all comments via the source data in our dataverse repository.</p><p>Further, we have added a paragraph that unpacks the primary limitations of our survey design including selection bias, indirect access and aggregated representation of student experiences, and unknown learning outcomes. In this paragraph we further identified future research directions for addressing these limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) You use first person plural as the authors and it is then that I recognized that the authors are the same as the MMM team. I suggest identifying this positionality earlier on.</p></disp-quote><p>To better situate ourselves as the creative team behind the tournament, the Abstract and Introduction now includes more intentional and consistent use of possessive pronouns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) You state reference potential &quot;chaotic derailment in a classroom of adolescents,&quot; which in my opinion underscores society's deficit perspective of adolescents.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. This statement was made as an allusion to tweets from multiple educators who have communicated that some of our combatants or tournament events created notable disruption in their classrooms (students having laughing fits) that has shaped our planning process. Our aim was to advise other scientists to consider the developmental stage(s)/fascinations of audiences when planning public communication and to consider how materials may play out for educators trying to manage their classrooms. We have deleted the phrase “chaotic derailment” and revised this text to state “minimize counter-productive digressions in classrooms of adolescents in contexts of various cultural sensibilities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I found the manuscript to be very well written and of value to a broad educator audience. (As an aside, I'll be recommending MMM to my own professional networks as a result of the opportunity to learn about it!).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

As background, the tournament was launched as a lark in 2013, with the game structure of battles spontaneously created by KH on a Friday afternoon in the lead-up to departmental happy hour. With each subsequent year, as folks with diverse skills sets became enamored with the tournament, they often spontaneously volunteered their contributions. As Editor-in-Chief, KH would coordinate balance and structure across these contributors and elements, but in so many ways March Mammal Madness was a collective, emergent phenomenon. As we wrote this manuscript and revisited literatures (social learning, narrative structure cognition, content biases) or discovered literatures (sports fan engagement, shared experiences at festivals) it became evident to us that we had wonderfully, but somewhat unwittingly, tapped into dimensions of human cognition and psychology.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to address this issue in several ways. The inclusion of more possessive pronouns in early sections in response to reviewer #1 required some more active and intentional phrasing. Similarly, in response to reviewer #2, as we integrated the importance of natural history, we were able to more explicitly discuss intentional planning in species selections. We revised in several other sections to reflect intentional planning and applied design. Lastly we made some adjustments in the timeline section to more explicitly situate serendipity and the emergent “alchemy” of March Mammal Madness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The perspectives on impact (both from survey data and as represented in the ethnographic data and illustrative quotes) are from educators rather than perhaps the ultimate target audience, the child and young adult learners.

Thank you for advocating that we better consider learners even if we do not yet have direct, systematic data at this time. Briefly to flashback to our response to reviewer #1, we have revised the manuscript to better situate March Mammal Madness and our educator surveys within constructs of impact and user engagement, while discussing the limitations and future approaches to more directly assess learners’ perceptions and outcomes. We have revised the text to note “illustrative” quotes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the interest of ensuring full transparency, I believe that a COI should be reported for Charon Henning (and any other contributing artists who are co-authors) re: the revenue from the sales of the MMM art, which is discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected at revision resubmission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
