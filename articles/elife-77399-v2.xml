To examine this, we used wearable microphones and autonomic sensors to collect multimodal naturalistic datasets from 12-month-olds and their caregivers. We observed that, across the day, clusters of vocalisations occur during elevated infant and caregiver arousal. This relationship is stronger in infants than caregivers: caregivers vocalisations show greater decoupling with their own states of arousal, and their vocal production is more influenced by the infant’s arousal than their own. Different types of vocalisation elicit different patterns of change across the dyad. Cries occur following reduced infant arousal stability and lead to increased child-caregiver arousal coupling, and decreased infant arousal. Speech-like vocalisations also occur at elevated arousal, but lead to longer-lasting increases in arousal, and elicit more parental verbal responses. Our results suggest that: 12-month-old infants’ vocalisations are strongly contingent on their arousal state (for both cries and speech-like vocalisations), whereas adults’ vocalisations are more flexibly tied to their own arousal; that cries and speech-like vocalisations alter the intra-dyadic dynamics of arousal in different ways, which may be an important factor driving speech development; and that this selection mechanism which drives vocal development is anchored in our stress physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>autonomic nervous system</kwd><kwd>infancy</kwd><kwd>co-regulation</kwd><kwd>self-regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000269</institution-id><institution>Economic and Social Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES/N017560/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wass</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JDIL 845859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goupil</surname><given-names>Louise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ONACSA 853251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wass</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2018–281</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wass</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infants' vocalisations are contingent on their own stress physiology, and alter the inter-personal dynamics of how stress states are shared across the infant-caregiver dyad.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infants explore their vocal possibilities from birth, producing vocalisations that are on a continuum from cries (rough sounds with a high amplitude and fundamental frequency) to speech-like vocalisations, or protophones (sounds whose morphological and spectro-temporal features resemble speech sounds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kent et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nathani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oller et al., 2019</xref>). This pre-linguistic phase of vocal exploration is thought to be crucial for the emergence of speech: it could serve as a base for a selection mechanism whereby caregivers’ differential responses to their infants’ vocal outputs (e.g. different responses to cries versus protophones) progressively lead to the prioritisation of speech signals for communication, both at developmental and evolutionary scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghazanfar and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oller and Griebel, 2020</xref>). Temporal contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoo et al., 2018</xref>) could be especially important for infants, allowing them to realise through repeated interactions that some sounds are privileged communicative signals that are particularly efficient to engage their social partners in conversation.</p><p>But what determines when infant vocalisations occur initially, and what their acoustic characteristics are? Are infants’ early vocal explorations constrained, and if so, how? One possibility is that vocal explorations follow a stochastic regime early on, and that infants’ explorations of their vocal tract possibilities produce a wide and unconstrained repertoire of outputs that is then narrowed down through the parental selection mechanism described above. Consistent with this idea, Oller and colleagues have proposed that a fundamental ability that supports the emergence of speech is functional flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oller and Griebel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oller et al., 2013</xref>). An individual has functional flexibility when at least some of their vocalisations can occur alongside variable underlying affective states, and are not tied to specific communicative functions (e.g. expressing distress). This ability is necessary for the establishment of a language system: it is because we can produce specific sounds to convey different meanings that arbitrary, symbolic systems can emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oller et al., 2013</xref>). In short, functional flexibility is a necessary condition for arbitrariness, a key feature of words that supports the emergence of conventional symbolic systems. By contrast, non-human primate vocalisations remain largely inflexible with respect to arousal even in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>) (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Infants would be said to have functional flexibility if specific vocalisations that they produce (e.g. protophones) were not tied to specific communicative functions, instead occuring alonside variable affective states. Consistent with this idea, by 3 months, infants can produce speech-like vocalisations in conjunction with both positive and negative facial displays, which suggests that their vocal explorations are functionally flexible in terms of valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oller et al., 2013</xref>). It remains possible, however, that their vocalisations remain tied to other affective dimensions, in particular autonomic arousal, the fast-acting neural substrate of the body’s stress response mediated by the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cacioppo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wass, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfaff, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Porges, 2007</xref>). Arousal and valence vary in an orthogonal fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreibig, 2010</xref>), so it remains possible that infants vocalisations are tied to arousal, while remaining relatively flexible with respect to valence (e.g., vocalisations produced with both positive and negative affect could be monotonically linked to arousal).</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis, one factor that does appear to influence vocalisation likelihood early on in development is the presence of an interactive social partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumwell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gros-Louis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2003</xref>): although infants also vocalise when they are alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2020</xref>), from the first few days of life, most infants’ vocalisations cluster with parental speech in time when infants are awake and actively engaged with a partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caskey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominguez et al., 2016</xref>). This might suggest that infants mostly vocalise when they are aroused, in the context of social interactions in particular, and thus, that their vocalisations might remain relatively inflexible – at least with respects to states of arousal, early on in development. This assumption has not been formally tested in humans, but research with marmoset monkeys has shown that vocalisation likelihood and the acoustic properties of vocalisations are both driven by rhythmic fluctuations in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) across multiple temporal scales, in infants and in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghazanfar and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McFarland et al., 2020</xref>). These influences span across temporal scales, from the temporally fine-grained (spectral features of vocalisations, in the kHz range), through to context-dependent vocalisations likelihood on the scale of minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Relatively little research has investigated whether vocal behaviours in human infants are influenced in a similar way by fluctuations in autonomic arousal. Although a number of authors have discussed the relationship between physiological arousal and vocal behaviour, particularly in the context of infant cries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolff, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeskind et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilder, 1974</xref>), no research to our knowledge (other than work from McFarland and colleagues, discussed below) have directly measured it. Studying this is important for two reasons.</p><p>First, as mentioned above, so far, research on functional flexibility has focused on valence and correspondences between visible facial affects and vocalisations only, which limits our understanding of how and when functional flexibility emerges across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oller and Griebel, 2020</xref>). Thus, here, we investigate whether each infant’s and adult’s vocalisation likelihood is <italic>overall</italic> more contingent on arousal (either their own arousal level or their partner’s). We also subdivide infant vocalisations into several types: cries (which our supplementary analyses show tend to be negative affective valence) and speech-like vocalisations (which our analyses show tend to be neutral affective valence). The functional flexibility hypothesis predicts that speech-like vocalisations should be relatively independent from arousal, while cries (alarm signals) should largely co-vary with arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altenmüller et al., 2013</xref>). Another important aspect is that functionally inflexiblility of vocalisations with regard to arousal in early infancy could be inidicative of a specific learning mechanism that underlies the development of speech over time. That is, it might be that instead of a stochastic regime, what determines the acoustic features of infants vocalizations early on is precisely fluctuations in arousal, that impact on the tension of the vocal folds, and thus, on the roughness and loudness of vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fitch et al., 2002</xref>). The parental selection mechanism would then operate on a repertoire of vocalisations that is not stochastic, but grounded in physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghazanfar and Zhang, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Second, studying how vocalisations relate to arousal changes and autonomic arousal coupling across the dyad would deepen our understanding of how caregivers identify and respond to various types of vocalisations, leading to selective reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oller and Griebel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstein and Schwade, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). Many authors have described how mimicry and vocal turn-taking behaviours play roles in socio-communicative development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Condon and Sander, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneirla, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lester et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fogel, 2017</xref>), and how empathy and physiological synchrony play roles in the development of self-regulation and caregiver-child affiliative bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ham and Tronick, 2009</xref>); but the relationship between these two areas remains relatively under-explored. McFarland and colleagues have shown that contingent vocalisations (mother to infant and infant to mother) are more common during periods of respiratory-marked synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McFarland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McFarland, 2001</xref>). And our own previous research has shown transient increases in caregiver-child physiological synchrony following negative affect vocalisations <sup>4223,38</sup>. Traditionally, the co-regulation of arousal (i.e. management of arousal across the caregiver-child dyad) has been considered important for the early development of self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fogel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kopp, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beebe et al., 2016</xref>), but it has rarely been linked to the development of communicative skills. The limited previous research in this area suggests that negative affect vocalisations are more common at high arousal states, and are more likely to elicit contingent caregiver responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wass et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tronick, 2007</xref>). But, if this is the case, and cries are more likely to elicit parental responses, then how might speech-like vocalisations (i.e. non-cries) become progressively prioritised? To answer this question, it seems crucial to examine whether non-cry vocalisations also elicit changes in arousal, arousal stability and arousal coupling across the caregiver-child dyad, and whether this is related to changes in caregivers’ responses to these vocalisations; but to our knowledge no previous research has examined this.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we designed new miniaturised wearable autonomic monitors (electrocardiograms and actigraphs) and miniaturised microphones and video cameras that could be worn by infant and caregivers to obtain day-long recordings in home settings. For technical reasons our microphones recorded a 5-s sample every minute (i.e. 8% of each minute) and therefore our analyses examined only large-scale arousal changes during the 20 min before and after each vocalisation (see Methods for further discussion).</p><p>We had two main research questions. First, are caregiver and infant vocalisations as inflexible with regard to arousal as those documented in non-human primates? That is, do different types of vocalisation, such as cries and speech-like sounds, show different patterns of association with arousal across the infant-caregiver dyad? Our hypothesis was that even speech-like vocalisations remain relatively tied to fluctuations in arousal during infancy, in contrast with adulthood. Second, do spontaneously occurring vocalisations during the day co-occur with specific patterns of arousal synchrony and co-regulation? Here, our hypothesis, in line with the parental selection mechanism, was that caregivers would track infants’ arousal fluctuations, and that as a consequence their vocalisations and arousal would be largely tied to their infants rather than their own.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our results section is in two parts. In part 1, we analyse individual and cross-dyadic arousal changes relative to all vocalisations obtained in our data. In part 2, we subdivide vocalisations into cries and speech-like vocalisations; and, in Appendix 1, by additionally subdividing vocalisations based on vocal intensity and affective valence, manually rated by trained coders (Appendix 1 sections 2.5–2.6).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Part 1 – All vocalisations</title><p>Our first research question was: are caregiver and infant vocalisations as inflexible with regard to arousal as those documented in non-human primates? To examine this, we conducted three analyses. First, as a preliminary analysis, we examine how vocalisations are clustered together in time. Second, we examine caregivers’ and infants’ arousal levels around vocalisations, using three approaches: (1) average arousal levels around vocalisations; (2) vocalisation likelihood around arousal peaks; and (3) Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. Third, we examine arousal around vocalisations subdivided by the partner’s arousal at the time of the vocalisation.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Temporal clustering</title><p>To examine whether infants and caregivers produce clusters of vocalisations simultaneously, we performed the following analysis. For each vocalisation, we estimated the likelihood of another vocalisation occurring both before and after that vocalisation. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, which shows as an example the likelihood of a subsequent infant vocalisation occurring 1–3 min after an initial infant vocalisation. To compare the observed probabilities with chance we performed a control analysis in which we inserted random ‘non-vocalisation’ events into the data and repeated the analysis relative to these ‘non-vocalisations’, and compared the ‘real’ and ‘control’ datasets using a Mann-Whitney U test. We then repeated this analysis across multiple time windows from 20 min before the vocalisation to 20 min after. We also repeated it across multiple contrasts, looking both within an individual (e.g. infant vocalisations relative to infant vocalisations) and across a dyad (e.g. infant vocalisations relative to adult vocalisations). Multiple comparisons were corrected for using permutation-based clustering analysis (described Appendix 1 section 1.9).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Vocalisation clusters.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sample violin plot showing the analysis for one time interval that was then repeated iteratively across multiple time intervals in b.

This indicates that, when a caregiver vocalisation had occurred, there was an elevated likelihood of a infant vocalisation occurring for all time windows from 12 min prior to that caregiver vocalisation to 8 min after it. Similarly, caregiver vocalisations were significantly more likely to occur relative to an infant vocalisation from 20 min before to 20 min after; infant vocalisations were significantly more likely to occur relative to another infant vocalisation from 16 min prior to a vocalisation to 20 min after (all ps &lt;.05); and caregiver vocalisations were significantly more likely to occur relative to another caregiver vocalisation from from 16 min prior to a vocalisation to 16 min after. Overall, these findings indicate that vocalisations occurred in clusters both within an individual and across the dyad, which confirms previous reports that infant vocalisations tend to cluster with those of their social partners (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slone et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Arousal around vocalisations. We conducted three analyses to examine the relation between arousal levels and vocalisations. First, we examined how average arousal levels change before and after vocalisations. Second, we examined how the likelihood of vocalisation changes around peak moments in arousal. Third, we calculated ROC curves to examine whether arousal levels alone can predict vocalisation likelihood.</p><p>Analysis 1 - average arousal levels around vocalisations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows histograms of arousal levels at the time of a vocalisation, including both within-individual (e.g. infant arousal to infant vocalisations) and across the dyad (e.g. infant arousal to adult vocalisations). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the same information, but also examines change in arousal during the period from 20 min before and 20 min after each vocalisation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> is identical to the Time 0 values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. Significance testing was performed by comparing the observed arousal levels around vocalisations with a chance value of 0 (which, for z-scored data, is that individual’s average arousal level across the entire day). Multiple comparisons were corrected for using a permutation-based cluster test (described Appendix 1 section 1.9). For infant arousal to infant vocalisations, significant increases in arousal were observed from 16 min before to 16 min after the vocalisation (all ps &lt;0.05, after correction). Note that these findings are not affected by autocorrelation in the arousal data as this was removed (see Appendix 1 section 1.6). For infant arousal to caregiver vocalisations, significant increases were observed from 16 min before to 18 min after each vocalisation; for caregiver arousal to infant vocalisations, significant increases were observed from 4 min before to 6 min after; for caregiver arousal to caregiver vocalisations, no significant difference from 0 was observed at Time 0, but a significant difference was observed for the period between 4 minutes to 2 minutes before each vocalisation. Overall, these results suggest that infant arousal levels are elevated around both infant and caregiver vocalisations, and that caregivers also show smaller but significant increases in arousal around infant vocalisations. By contrast caregivers’ vocalisations show little association with their own arousal, congruent with the hypothesis of heightened vocal flexibility in human adults as compared to infants.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>arousal changes around vocalisations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Histogram showing the distribution of arousal levels at the time of each vocalisation.

Conversely, we also examined the likelihood of vocalisations occurring around peaks in arousal. We identified the moments when the infants’ and the caregivers’ z-scored arousal levels exceeded the top 10% most elevated values observed for that participant that day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and e</xref>). Appendix 1 section 2.4 shows the same analysis repeated with different threshold levels (5% and 20%). We then examined the likelihood of vocalisations occurring during the time windows around arousal peaks, and compared this with control data generated in the same way as described in section 1.1. Significance was calculated by performing Mann Whitney U tests and correcting for multiple comparisons using a permutation-based clustering analysis (see Appendix 1 section 1.9). Significant increases in vocalisation likelihood were observed only when we examined the likelihood of infant vocalisations around infant arousal peaks, and when we examined the likelihood of adult vocalisations around infant arousal peaks. Note that this latter finding was not significant when other threshold values were used instead (see Appendix 1 section 2.4). No significant increases in vocalisation likelihood were observed relative to adult arousal peaks. Overall, these results confirm that infant arousal peaks are associated with an increased vocalisation likelihood in both infants and (to a lesser extent) adults, but that peaks in adult arousal are not associated with increased vocalisation likelihood (a marker of greater vocal functional flexibility).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Analysis 3</title><p>As a further test of whether arousal levels predict vocalisation likelihood differently in infants and adults, we employed a signal detection framework based on the ROC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Each dataset was systematically thresholded at all possible values from its minimum to maximum value. At each threshold, each epoch was individually classified either as a True Positive (above-threshold arousal, vocalisation present) or a False Positive (above-threshold arousal, vocalisation absent). If the systematic thresholding produced as many false alarms as hits, then the feature dimension could not be said to aid in predicting vocalisation likelihood. Following calculation of the ROC curves, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated: a higher AUC indicates that the feature dimension is more predictive. AUC values were calculated per participant and compared with a chance value of 0.5 using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Results indicated that the infant arousal was significantly predictive of infant vocalisation likelihood (p&lt;0.001), but that other relationships were not. This is again consistent with the idea that infants’ vocalisations are inflexibly related to their arousal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Arousal around vocalisations subdivided by partner arousal at the time of vocalisation</title><p>Our final method for examining how contingent infant and caregivers’ vocalisations are on arousal levels across the dyad was to subdivide all vocalisations by the partner’s arousal at the time of the vocalisation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows caregiver arousal relative to infant vocalisations (i.e. the same as the purple line from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), but subdivided using a quartile split by infant arousal at the time of the vocalisation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> shows infant arousal relative to caregiver vocalisation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Arousal changes across the dyad following vocalisations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Caregiver arousal subdivided by infant arousal at the time of the vocalisation.

For infant arousal, the opposite finding was observed: high arousal caregiver vocalisations were accompanied by increased infant arousal during the period 10–6 min before the caregiver vocalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that high arousal infant vocalisations are followed by subsequent increases in caregiver arousal, and that high arousal caregiver vocalisations are preceded by increases in infant arousal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Control analyses</title><p>Overall, results thus far suggest that infants’ vocalisations are contingent on their arousal state, whereas adults’ vocalisations are independent of arousal. However, we also considered two possible alternative explanations for this finding. The first is that it may be because vocalisations are more likely to occur while the participants are in physical positions associated with increased arousal. To examine this possibility, we conducted an additional analysis in which we performed video coding to examine infants’ physical position while vocalising (Appendix 1 section 2.2). In brief, this analysis suggested that 49% of infant vocalisations occurred while the infant was freely moving; 33% occurred while they were free but stationary; 7% while strapped sitting; 11% while carried. For adult vocalisations, 44% occurred while the infant was freely moving; 33% while free stationary; 10% while strapped sitting; 12% while carried. Overall when we examined how arousal levels differed by physical position we found no evidence that arousal increases around vocalisations are attributable to changes in physical position.</p><p>The second possibility is that arousal increases around vocalisations may be attributable to the physical act of vocalising itself. This may seem unlikely given that we also observed increases in infant arousal relative to caregiver vocalisations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Yet, because we also observed that caregiver and infant vocalisations occur in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), it remained possible that vocalising itself increased infant arousal in these periods. To address this, we conducted a more fine-grained analysis on a different dataset in which we continuously recorded vocalisations and arousal in 11-month-old infants and their caregivers during two 5-min tabletop interactions (see Appendix 1 section 2.3). The timings and durations of vocalisations were coded to an accuracy of 20 Hz (i.e. 50 ms), and our findings examine heart rate changes on a much finer time-scale (1 sample per second compared with 1 sample per minute for the main analyses). Overall our results suggested that, in a seated tabletop interaction, caregivers showed no change in arousal relative either to vocalisations either from themselves or their partner (the infant). Infants showed non-significant increases in arousal relative to their own vocalisations, which started to increase 5 s before a vocalisation and returned to baseline 20 s after. No changes in infant arousal were observed relative to caregiver vocalisations. The fact that arousal levels start to increase before a vocalisation suggests, consistent with animal research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>), that it is unlikely that arousal changes around vocalisations are purely attributable to the physical act of vocalising itself. The fact that no changes were observed in caregiver arousal around caregiver vocalisations is also consistent with this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>Arousal stability and arousal coupling around vocalisations</title><p>Our second research question was: do spontaneously occurring vocalisations during the day co-occur with specific patterns of arousal, arousal synchrony and arousal co-regulation?

To further test our first research question, therefore, we examined whether different types of vocalisation, such as cries and speech-like sounds, show different patterns of association with arousal.

For caregiver vocalisations following infant speech-like vocalisations, significant differences from the control were observed from –4 min to +12; for caregiver vocalisations following infant cries, from –4 min to +8 min. Overall, these results suggest that in naturalistic data, vocalisations occur in clusters around both speech-like vocalisations and cries, which is inconsistent with previous reports based on laboratory recordings which suggested that infants often produce speech-like vocalisations that are not directed to social partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Arousal around vocalisations</title><p>To examine how arousal levels changed relative to cries and speech-like vocalisations, we performed the same three analyses as described for part 1.</p><sec id="s2-2-2-1"><title>Analysis 1 - average arousal levels around vocalisations</title><p>The peak arousal (Time 0) at the time of the vocalisation was z-score.56 for cries and.41 for speech-like vocalisations, which for both categories was significantly higher than chance (both ps &lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

To do this, we subdivided infant and caregiver vocalisations by vocalisation affect, intensity and type, on the basis of a manual rating of the data by trained coders (Appendix 1 sections 2.5, 2.6). Note that the vocalisations identified as negative mostly corresponded to cries (98%), and positive vocalisations mostly included protophones, with a mixture of quasi-resonant vowel (20%), fully-resonant vowel (21%), marginal syllable (9.6%), and canonical syllable (33%). First, we examined infant vocal affects as a function of valence<bold>Fig S8a, S8c</bold> and intensity (see Appendix 1 section Supplementary analyses for part 2 – arousal by infant vocalisation affect and intensity). Our results suggest that larger infant arousal changes are observed relative to negative affect, and high-intensity vocalisations, which as we report above mostly correspond to cries.</p><p>Next, we examined caregiver vocalisation intensity<bold>Fig S9a, S9c</bold> (see Appendix 1 section Supplementary analyses for part 2 – arousal by caregiver vocalisation type and intensity). Our results suggested that there was no relationship between caregiver arousal and caregiver vocal intensity, but that caregiver vocalisation intensity is influenced by infant arousal during the time window prior to the vocalisation.</p><p>Second, we examined caregiver vocalisation type (differentiating positive, stimulating, intrusive, and sensitive vocalisations)Fig S9b, S9d. Our results suggested that there was no relationship between caregiver arousal and caregiver vocalisation type, but that caregiver vocalisation type is influenced by infant arousal during the time window prior to the vocalisation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using day-long home recordings obtained using miniaturised wearable autonomic monitors and microphones, we examined how autonomic arousal cofluctuates with vocal behaviours in caregiver-infant dyads recorded in a naturalistic home setting. We examined within-individual relationships (e.g. how infant arousal relates to infant vocalisation likelihood) and cross-dyad relationships (e.g. caregiver arousal to infant vocalisation likelihood). We also examined how caregiver-child arousal coupling cofluctuates with vocalisation likelihood. From our results the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>First, the within-individual relationship between arousal and vocalisation likelihood is strong in infants, and weaker in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Symmetrically, for infants, there is an increase in the likelihood of vocalising around arousal peaks, which is not the case for adults (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The same result was confirmed by our ROC analyses, suggesting that vocalisation timings can be predicted based on arousal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our findings are based on analyses conducted at the minute-level temporal scale. Findings from a more temporally fine-grained supplementary analysis (see Appendix 1 section 2.2) suggest, consistent with findings from animal research, that it is unlikely that these changes are purely attributable to the physical act of vocalising itself. These findings are also unlikely to be attributable to changes in physical positioning around vocalisations, as our supplementary analyses suggest that most vocalisations occur while free roaming, and that differences in arousal contingent on physical positioning are limited (see Appendix 1 section Supplementary Analysis 1 – video analyses of physical position while vocalising). This suggests that infants vocalisations are still relatively inflexible with respects to states of arousal at 12 months.</p><p>Our finding that the association between arousal and vocalisation likelihood is strong in infants, but weaker in adults, can be contextualised by previous research suggesting that the association between arousal and vocalisation likelihood is present in both infant <italic>and</italic> adult marmoset monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghazanfar and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas previous research has suggested that human infants already show vocal flexibility with respect to affective valence (i.e. they can use similar vocalisations in conjunction with various facial affects) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oller and Griebel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oller et al., 2013</xref>), our findings suggest that infant vocalisations are relatively <italic>inflexible</italic> with regard to arousal during early development. This was true both for cries and for speech-like vocalisations, which were also more likely to occur around arousal peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), as confirmed by our ROC analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). This discrepancy with previous findings might be due to a genuine difference in functional flexibility across arousal and valence, which is possible given the orthogonality of these two constructs (one can be happy, highly aroused and positive, and angry, highly aroused and negative). However, at this stage it remains equally possible that the discrepancy between our study and previous studies focusing on facial affects stem from methodological differences. Physiological measures might be more sensitive than relying on overt displays, and in future we could use other measures (e.g. acoustic analyses of vocalisations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fitch et al., 2002</xref>) to try to understand whether and how functional flexibility develops at the same rate for arousal and valence. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that, in early infancy, vocal production is directly related to the arousal state of the infant, with increases in arousal necessary for infants to vocalise, whatever vocalisation type.</p><p>By contrast, our results show that caregiver vocalisation likelihood is more influenced by the infant’s arousal than by the caregiver’s own arousal. The likelihood of an adult vocalising increases around infant arousal peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> – purple line), more than around the caregiver’s own arousal peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> – blue line). No relationship was observed between caregiver vocal intensity and caregiver arousal (Fig S9c), but high-intensity caregiver vocalisations are preceded by high infant arousal (Fig S9a). Similarly, no associations were noted between caregiver vocalisation type and caregiver arousal (Fig S9d), whereas positive caregiver vocalisations are more likely to be preceded by high infant arousal (Fig S9b). Finally, caregivers are more likely to produce high arousal vocalisations following an increase in infant arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these findings confirm that caregivers’ speech is flexible with respect to their own levels of arousal (in contrast with what has been documented in other primate species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>) but reveal that it is finely attuned to their child’s levels of arousal. This suggests that speech is an under-appreciated mechanism for arousal co-regulation during early life. Previous research has pointed to caregiver-child arousal synchrony as a mechanism for arousal co-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tronick, 2007</xref>). One mechanism for this might be that parents dynamically modulate their own arousal level to match their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wass et al., 2019</xref>). The present findings reinforce this by suggesting, for example, that high arousal infant vocalisations tend to be followed by subsequent increases in caregiver arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Vocalisations thus appear as an important medium through which arousal is made manifest between caregivers and their infants, supporting coregulation at the level of the dyad.</p><p>Our vocal type findings also point to a clear role for vocalisations in arousal co-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolff, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeskind et al., 1985</xref>). Infant arousal is higher when they produce cries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), and they show decreased arousal stability around cries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Infant cries also lead to changes across the dyad: increased caregiver arousal stability is observed in the time following the vocalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), as well as increased caregiver-child arousal coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). Comparing arousal levels before and after a vocalisation suggests that cries tend to be followed by decreases in arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and increases in arousal stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This may be because cries are less likely to occur in clusters (i.e. to be followed by another vocalisation) than speech-like vocalisations are (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This suggests that cries are events that serve to down-regulate the infant’s arousal, and that the likely mechanism for this is through caregiver-infant arousal coupling.</p><p>Speech-like vocalisations show a strikingly different profile. Although arousal levels at the time of the vocalisation are also elevated relative to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), the profile of change after the vocalisation is markedly different as compared to cries. Speech-like vocalisations tend to lead to sustained increases in infant arousal, in contrast to cries which lead to decreases in arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and b</xref>). Infant speech-like vocalisations are also more likely to be followed by other speech-like vocalisations from both the infant and the caregiver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This potentially indicates increased attentional processes in the time-period after a speech-like vocalisation that could support the processing of caregiver’s verbal responses, information encoding, and influence later vocal production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstein and Schwade, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Most important to selective reinforcement accounts of early speech development, whereas cries vocalisations lead to changes in arousal stability and coupling across the dyad, speech-like vocalisations do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h and l</xref>). Thus, despite the fact that they are both associated with fluctuations in the infant’s own arousal, there are functional differences between cries and speech-like vocalisations at the level of the dyad: compared to cries, speech-like vocalisations do not seem to relate to arousal co-regulation, and they induce less changes in arousal in caregivers. This may be an important mechanism for selective learning in early speech development, with caregivers’ unimpaired arousal allowing for more flexible, timelier, and, potentially, more semantically attuned responses to these vocalisations. Supporting this suggestion, parents overlap more frequently in their responses to infant cry-sounds, compared to protophones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoo et al., 2018</xref>), and, in our data, speech-like vocalisations were more likely to be followed by caregiver vocalisations over a longer time-period, compared to cries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that a parental selection mechanisms grounded in stress physiology is the ‘engine for vocal development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghazanfar and Zhang, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although technical factors meant that we were confined to random sampling during the day rather than continuous recordings, our analyses suggest that this sparse sampling preserves the temporal structure of the data (see Appendix 2 section Supplementary analysis – simulation to examine the effects of sparse sampling on the data); furthermore, we examine event-related changes relative to vocalisations, and so the presence of undetected vocalisations can only have weakened the patterns of event-related change that we have documented here. Nevertheless, future research based on continuous recordings would allow us to examine in more detail the role of turn-taking behaviours in communicative exchanges – examining, for example, whether arousal facilitates effective communication between caregiver and child by making children more likely to respond to verbal initiations by the caregiver. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to examine whether the link between arousal and vocalisations remains unchanged even in the absence of the caregiver, or where the caregiver is unresponsive.</p><p>In future, it would also be interesting to explore the role of vocalisations in developmental psychopathology. For example, our present results suggested that, in typical dyads, high arousal infant vocalisations tend to be followed by increases in caregiver arousal. But other work from our group has shown that, in caregivers with elevated anxiety, moments of high infant arousal were <italic>more</italic> likely to be accompanied by high caregiver arousal; that anxious caregivers were more likely to vocalise intensely at high arousal, and to produce intense vocalisations that occurred in clusters; and that high intensity vocalisations were associated with more sustained increases in autonomic arousal for both anxious caregivers and their infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2021b</xref>). Understanding how arousal relates to vocalisation likelihood across typical and atypical development is an important goal for future research. Relatedly, longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association between infant arousal and vocalisations across development; when, for example, do speech-like vocalisations become functionally flexible from arousal, and how is this affected by early infant-caregiver coregulation?</p><p>Overall, our data show that there is a functional dissociation between speech-like vocalisations and cries: cries are more likely to lead to changes in the caregiver’s arousal, while speech-like vocalisations are more likely to associate with sustained increases in infant arousal, as well as an increase in vocalisations in both infants and caregivers. These results are consistent with the idea that caregivers’ differential responses to specific types of vocalisations (i.e. speech-like vocalisations), which are not yet produced flexibly by infants, may be an important factor driving speech development, and they suggest that this bidirectional physiological process supports progressively specialised vocalisations through parental selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental participant details</title><p>The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of East London (Approval number: EXP 1617 04). Informed consent, and intent to publish, were obtained in the usual manner. Participants were recruited from the London, Essex, Hertfordshire and Cambridge regions of the UK. In total, 91 infant-caregiver dyads were recruited to participate in the study, of whom usable autonomic data were recorded from 82. Of these, usable paired autonomic data (from both caregiver and child) were obtained from 74 participants. Further details, including exclusion criteria, and detailed demographic details on the sample, are given in Appendix 1 section 1.1. The sample size was selected following power calculations presented in the original funding application ES/N017560/1. Of note, we excluded families in which the primary day-time care was performed by the male caregiver, because the numbers were insufficient to provide an adequately gender-matched sample. All participating caregivers were, therefore, female. Participants received £30 in gift vouchers as a token of gratitude for participation, split over two visits.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental method details</title><p>Participating caregivers were invited to select a day during which they would be spending the entire day with their child but which was otherwise, as far as possible, typical for them and their child. The researcher visited the participants’ homes in the morning (c. 7.30 - 10am) to fit the equipment, and returned later (c. 4 - 7pm) to pick it up. The mean (std) recording time per day was 7.3 (1.4) hr.</p><p>The equipment consisted of two wearable layers, for both infant and caregiver (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For the infant, a specially designed baby-grow was worn next to the skin, which contained a built-in Electrocardiogram (ECG) recording device (recording at 250 Hz), accelerometer (30 Hz), Global Positioning System (GPS) (1 Hz), and microphone (11.6 kHz). A T-shirt, worn on top of the device, contained a pocket to hold the microphone and a miniature video camera (a commercially available Narrative Clip 2 camera). For the caregiver, a specially designed chest strap was also worn next to the skin, containing the same equipment. A cardigan, worn as a top layer, contained the microphone and video camera. The clothes were comfortable when worn and, other than a request to keep the equipment dry, participants were encouraged to behave exactly as they would do on a normal day.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Photographs of recording equipment used.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77399-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Raw Data Sample.</title><p>from top to bottom: infant arousal composite score (see SM sections 1.2–1.5); infant arousal after removal of the auto-correlation (see SM section 1.6); infant vocal affect (see Methods section); infant vocal intensity; infant vocalisation type; caregiver arousal; caregiver arousal after removal of the auto-correlation; caregiver vocal affect; caregiver vocal intensity; caregiver vocalisation type.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77399-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>At the start and end of each recording session, before the devices were inserted into the clothes worn by the participants, the researchers synchronised the two devices by holding them on top of one another and moving them sharply from side to side, once per second for 10 consecutive seconds.

For this reason, all of the analyses presented in the paper only include data segments in which the dyad was at home and the infant was awake. A description of how these segments were identified are given in Appendix 1 (section 1.7). Following these exclusions, the mean (<italic>std</italic>) total amount of data available per dyad was 3.7 (<italic>1.7</italic>) hr, corresponding to 221.5 (<italic>102.4</italic>) 60 second epochs per dyad.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Vocal coding</title><p>The microphone recorded a 5 s snapshot of the auditory environment every 60 s. <italic>Post hoc</italic>, trained coders identified samples in which the infant or caregiver was vocalising, and the following codings were applied.

All coders were blind to study design and hypothesised study outcome.</p><p>Importantly, analyses conducted on a separate, continuous dataset (see Appendix 1, section S10) suggest that the temporal structure of our vocalisations was maintained despite this ‘sparse sampling’ approach. Furthermore, our analyses examine how arousal changes relative to observed vocalisations, and any arousal changes that we do observe time-locked to vocalisations would be weakened (not strengthened) by the fact that the vocalisation data were sparsely sampled (because power would have been reduced by missing vocalisations through the sparse sampling method, rather than increased).</p><p>Infant data. (<italic>i) vocalisation type</italic>. A morphological coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oller et al., 2013</xref>) was applied with the following categories: cry, laugh, squeal, growl, quasi-resonant vowel, fully-resonant vowel, marginal syllable, canonical syllable. Overall, 29% of vocalisations were cries; 1% laughs; 1% squeal; 3% growl; 18% quasi-resonant vowel; 18% fully-resonant vowel; 6% marginal syllable; 23% canonical syllable. For analyses presented in the main text these were collapsed into cries and speech-like vocalisations, which included the following non-cry categories: quasi-resonant vowel; fully-resonant vowel; marginal syllable; canonical syllable. Laughs, squeals and growls were excluded due to rarity. (ii) <italic>vocal affect</italic> was coded on a three-point scale for vocal affect (negative (fussy and difficult)), neutral or positive (happy and engaged). In order to assess inter-rater reliability, 11% of the sample was double coded; Cohen’s kappa was 0.70, which is considered substantial agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McHugh, 2012</xref>). (iii) <italic>vocal intensity</italic> was coded on a three-point scale from low emotional intensity, neutral, or high emotional intensity.</p><p>Adult data. (i) <italic>vocalisation type</italic>. A trained coder listened to vocalisations one by one and categorised them into the following categories: Imperative, Question, Praise, Singing, Imitation of Baby Vocalisation, Laughter, Reassurance, Sighing, Storytelling. These were then further collapsed into four supraordinate categories: Positive (Singing, Laughter); Stimulating (Question); Intrusive/negative affect (Imperative, Sighing); Sensitive (Praise, Imitation of Baby Vocalisation, Reassurance, Storytelling). Overall, 14% of vocalisations were Positive; 30% were Stimulating; 41% were Intrusive; 15% were Praise. In addition, (ii) <italic>vocal affect and</italic> (iii) <italic>vocal intensity</italic> were coded in the same way as for the infant data.

To ensure good quality recordings, the ECG device was attached using standard Ag-Cl electrodes, placed in a modified lead II position. Due to technical problems with the ECG recording leads (N=9) and to problems with attaching the ECG recording electrodes securely (N=2), the ECG data were unavailable for 11 of the 93 participants originally tested.</p><p>To ensure the accuracy of these recording devices, they were cross-validated by recording heart rate and heart rate variability using both the new devices at home and established recording devices (a Biopac MP150 amp recording at 2000 Hz) in lab settings. High reliability was observed both for heart rate (rho = 0.57, p&lt;0.001) and heart rate variability (rho = 0.70, p=0.01).</p><p>To analyse the Inter-Beat intervals, data were first parsed using a simple amplitude threshold (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aurobinda et al., 2016</xref> for a similar approach), with R peaks identified as moments where the raw ECG signal exceeded the threshold value. Initially, the threshold value was set high; the same process was then repeated at incrementally decreasing thresholds.</p><p>At each threshold value, the R peaks identified were automatically subjected to the following checks. These threshold values were set following extensive piloting and visual inspection of our infant ECG data using the visualisation shown in Figure S2. (i) minimum temporal threshold: does the R peak occur at a time interval of greater than 300 ms since the previous R peak (corresponding to a heart rate of 200 BPM); (ii) maximum temporal threshold: does the R peak occur at a time interval of less than 850 ms since the previous R peak (corresponding to a heart rate of 70 BPM); (iii) maximum rate of change: when we calculate the R to R interval between this peak and the subsequent peak, and compare it with the R to R interval between this peak and the previous peak, is this difference less than 300 ms? In setting these threshold values, careful attention was paid to visual inspection to determine the maximum and minimum ‘genuine’ heart rates observed in our infant data; in setting the maximum rate of change criterion, careful attention was paid to identify the maximum rate of vagally mediated heart rate changes in infants.</p><p>Figure S2 shows a sample screenshot from the Matlab processing algorithm that was used. Two separate types of artefact are shown. The first, highlighted by the call-out figures at a and d, are instances where the ECG signal for a particular beat was lower than the threshold, and a genuine beat was missed. It can be seen that in both instances, the R peaks either side of this missing beat have been automatically identified, and excluded. These artifacts were identified based on the maximum temporal threshold criterion in example a and d, and additionally based on the maximum rate of change criterion in example d. The second, highlighted by the call-out figures at b and c, are instances where the ECG signal exceeded the amplitude threshold, and an incorrect R peak was identified. In both instances, the incorrect beat has been identified based on the minimum temporal threshold criterion, and the R peaks either side of this incorrect beat have been identified and excluded.

In order to preclude the possibility that differences in the autocorrelation may have influenced results, the autocorrelation was removed from the data prior to performing all calculations, using the following procedure. First, best-fit bivariate polynomials were calculated for the two time series independently, in order to remove linear and quadratic trends, and the residuals obtained were subjected to the Dickey-Fuller test to check that they showed stationarity, which they did. The residuals were used in subsequent analyses. Next, in order to remove the autocorrelation component from each time series independently, univariate autoregressive models were fitted to each time series, and the residuals were calculated (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaffe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suveg et al., 2016</xref> for similar approaches).

In each case, the test statistic (always specified in the text) was calculated independently for each time window. Series of significant effects across contiguous time windows were identified using an alpha level of.05. 1000 random datasets were then generated with the same dimensions as the original input data.

Then, the same sequence of analyses was repeated, and the longest series of significant effects across contiguous time windows was identified.

No increases in infant arousal were observed relative to caregiver vocalisations, and no increases in caregiver arousal were observed relative either to caregiver or to infant vocalisations. Overall these results suggest that, in a seated tabletop interaction, caregivers show no change in arousal relative to vocalisations either from themselves or their partner (the infant).

At the same time, both reviewers agreed on several points that need to be addressed to strengthen the article and back up the conclusions that can be drawn. We highlight the most important points here:</p><p>1) The theoretical justification and articulation of the hypothesis and discussion need careful revision.</p><p>2) In addition, both reviewers agreed that some continuous data collection needs to be added to confirm the results from the sparse sampling. At least a couple of dyads are needed to confirm whether the sparse sampling is capturing a similar pattern to more continuous recording. A transcription of the speech is not needed -- time-stamping of the onsets and offsets of caregiver and child vocalizations would suffice. In fact, Reviewer #1 advised that LENA recorders (or some equivalent open-source software) can automatically time-stamp vocalizations (this is not perfect, of course, but it can provide a baseline).</p><p>3) Moreover, clarification of the code is necessary to ensure that results can be replicated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Using an impressive dataset of at-home recordings of video, movement, and electrocardiogram data from caregivers and their infants, the authors examine how large-scale changes in infant arousal relate to spontaneous vocal production in caregivers and their infants. The paper is exhaustive with many analyses and the authors are commended for the Supplementary Materials, which address several alternative hypotheses to the results presented in the manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, the theoretical justification driving the analyses in this study could be better articulated. The authors appear to be seeking evidence for functional flexibility in one-year-old infants and are using arousal as a novel pathway to answer this question (as opposed to facial expressions). A clear and coherent explanation of what functional flexibility is would be helpful in the introduction. In addition, some set of hypotheses and alternative hypotheses to drive the data analysis in relation to functional flexibility would better ground the paper in theory.</p><p>While Figures 2, and 4 are clear and fairly straightforward to interpret, Figures 1 and 5 need particular attention. Consider Figure 1 (Lines 155-175). This attempt to demonstrate that vocalizations occur in temporal clusters is not intuitive and very difficult to interpret. For example, in lines 168-169, &quot;infant vocalisations were significantly more likely to occur relative to an infant vocalisation from 16 minutes prior to 20 minutes after.&quot; Do infant vocalizations occur in clusters of 36 minutes in duration? Or is it that given any infant vocalization, there is a probability of a vocalization 16 minutes prior/20 minutes after (with silence in the intervening time). Although a simple measure of burstiness could be a direct way to measure the clustering of vocalizations, it is unclear how this temporal clustering relates to functional flexibility.</p><p>Due to technical constraints, the authors randomly sampled 5 seconds of audio every minute through their recordings. There is no continuous audio recording. While the authors have done the best they can, given the constraints, lines 127-128 are quite surprising: &quot;the presence of undetected vocalisations can only have weakened any patterns of event-related change that we did observe.&quot; (and restated lines 540-541). If more data weaken the present findings, how are we to believe this paper is not simply reporting a spurious result due to sparse, random sampling of infant vocalizations?</p><p>The natural structure and timing of human vocalizations and vocal interactions occur across time periods longer than 5 seconds in duration. The authors provide little evidence that a random 5-second sampling every minute throughout the day can accurately reflect the clustering of infant vocal production, adult vocal production, and infant-adult vocal interaction. This is a serious concern.</p><p>While this is an interesting paper with several novel findings, it is severely limited by sparse audio collection.

This work found that caregiver and infant vocalization clustered around moments of heightened infant (and to a lesser extent caregiver) arousal. Infant cries and speech-like vocalizations were associated with different fingerprints in terms of average arousal, arousal stability, and arousal coupling between the caregiver and the infant. These data highlight the importance of examining physiological arousal in the study of caregiver-infant communication and speech development.</p><p>The manuscript has many strengths -- in addition to its cutting edge methodology, it provides detailed descriptions of the patterns observed in this study, includes thorough supplementary materials, and excels in capturing the dynamics of arousal and vocalizations in the naturalistic context of the child's everyday environment. However, the manuscript would benefit from a deeper discussion of the interpretation of these findings. Specifically:</p><p>(1) An important point to clarify is the relation between functional flexibility and communicative function. The sentence that starts on p. 4, line 87 (specifically, &quot;…are largely tied to arousal fluctuations rather than communicative functions&quot;) suggests the interpretation that if infant vocalizations are functionally inflexible (that is, they only happen when the infant is in a specific affective state -- e.g., high arousal), they don't have a communicative function. It is possible that infant vocalizations operate on a switch that turns on when a certain arousal level is reached, but to make that claim we need to know whether the link between arousal and vocalizations remains unchanged when the caregiver isn't around and isn't responding for an extensive period of time (seems like that's not the case, based on p. 3, lines 60-63). However, it is plausible that signaling that the infant is in a high arousal state to caregivers is an important communicative function. Perhaps the flexibility shown by adults (vocalizing equally across different affective states) is a sign of the more sophisticated content of their vocalizations -- if infants don't have access to the same linguistic precision to express nuanced meaning in different vocalizations, they may use frequency of vocalization to communicate their internal state instead. If the infant's arousal is coupled with the caregiver's vocal production, it may be that arousal facilitates effective communication between the caregiver and the child and helps infants vocalize in moments when they are most likely to receive feedback. It is also important to discuss why the results for valence (in prior work) and arousal (current study) may be different -- these are very different constructs and the authors don't discuss what functional flexibility in terms of each of these dimensions would mean.</p><p>(2) It is also important to discuss the possible mechanisms that could result in the sustained elevated arousal surrounding infant and caregiver vocalizations. Currently, caregiver and infant vocalizations are described as standalone events (except in the very first section on temporal clustering), when in fact they likely are highly interdependent. These vocalizations occur in the context of social interaction, and as the authors pointed out, vocalizations occur in clusters. Therefore, the minutes following an infant vocalization are more likely to have more caregiver (and infant) vocalizations as well (and this may differ depending on the type of infant vocalization; e.g., cries vs. speech-like vocalizations). The presence of further vocalizations by the caregiver may sustain the infants' elevated autonomic arousal. Similarly, if an infant shows heightened arousal before a caregiver vocalization, that may either be due to the caregiver responding to the infant's heightened arousal or vocalization, or it may signal a prediction from the infant. It would be interesting to explore, even if just in a descriptive way, how conversation turn-taking may have contributed to the observed results.</p><p>(3) The paper uses three measures related to autonomic arousal. However, the text lacks discussion of the unique contributions of each of the three measures (average arousal, arousal stability, and arousal coupling) to answering the main research questions. The paper would benefit from a clear discussion of the authors' predictions in terms of these measures. When might we expect these measures to converge or diverge? How might increases or decreases in each measure impact infants' behavior or cognition? If the findings are the result of exploratory analyses, it's good that the authors aren't overstating the extent to which they had prior hypotheses. However, even so, it is important to frame the motivation for each variable and outline alternative hypotheses for each measure.</p><p>In addition to the above comments, I also wanted to add some smaller points that could strengthen the paper.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>(1) I wonder if the abstract could open with a stronger sentence (p. 2, line 21) describing why it is important and interesting to understand the link between arousal and early vocal communication (beyond there being little work on the topic). This is such an exciting field, and the authors could do a better job of hooking the reader. (Note: this isn't a comment I feel strongly about, just a suggestion.)</p><p>(2) Functional flexibility should either be defined in the abstract (in half a sentence -- e.g., the authors do this in the introduction on p. 3, line 59) or the authors could perhaps describe the results without using this term, as it is a bit jargony.</p><p>(3) The last sentence of the abstract may be a bit misleading in terms of the conclusions of the paper, specifically &quot;caregivers' differential responses to specific types of vocalizations is an important factor driving speech development; and that this selection mechanism which drives vocal development is anchored in our stress physiology.&quot; As it is currently written, this sentence suggests that this paper directly probes the link between caregiver responses to infant vocalizations and infants' speech development. While there is other work examining this question, the current investigation only examines the link between autonomic arousal (and related measures) and vocalizations but not speech development; we don't see changes in how children vocalize over time in response to caregiver feedback.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>(4) It would be very helpful to add a paragraph on functional flexibility. This paragraph can include (1) a definition of what the authors mean by the term in the context of this specific investigation (there is a short definition on p. 3, line 59, but more elaboration would be useful), and (2) why the development of functional flexibility is important to understand. The authors touch on bits and pieces of this second point on p.4, lines 75-89, but currently, the paragraph misses some important questions. What would it mean if infants' vocalizations are (or aren't) functionally flexible? How would that change or inform theories of speech development?</p><p>(5) The authors mention that there are some limited studies on how autonomic arousal influences infant vocalization likelihood in human infants (p. 4, line 76, references 18-20). Could the authors elaborate more on these studies (it seems like they are mostly focused on respiration)? Highlighting how this study is situated in the human infant literature could emphasize its importance (not just novelty).</p><p>Results:</p><p>(6) Broadly, the Results section would benefit from clearer transition sentences at the start of each subsection and analysis explaining what question the analysis answers (e.g., the authors did a great job at this on p. 12, line 249; they also do this well at the end of some sections -- for example, p. 10, lines 211-212; it would be great to frontload these connections to the bigger hypotheses earlier in the section as well). It would be especially useful to remind the reader of the motivation behind each measure (see the earlier point in the Introduction section).</p><p>(7) To what extent are the three different measures (average arousal, arousal stability and coupling) correlated? (I know by definition they don't have to be correlated but in practice, it's possible they are.) Also, I know the authors did some multiple comparisons corrections, but I wonder if they could elaborate more on how they navigated having many different exploratory analyses and how they interpret diverging results in these different measures (again, see earlier points about explaining the different predictions for each measure).</p><p>(8) I had trouble understanding the paragraph on p. 14, lines 283-290. Don't some of the results (e.g., no changes in arousal before and after caregiver vocalizations -- lines 287-288) contradict the findings of the current study? Further, the point that the change in arousal is not due to the physical act of vocalizing is fair, but it may still be due to some physiological preparation associated with the motor planning of a vocalization.</p><p>(9) I was curious how fluctuations in caregiver and infant arousal throughout the day compare? Are caregivers overall &quot;flatter&quot; throughout the day? I wonder if that could explain some of the differences as well?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>(10) As in previous sections, I think the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of (1) what each measure means for the broader questions of functional flexibility, caregiver-infant communication, and speech development, and why we might expect different results across measures, and (2) what the alternative explanations for the results may be.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>(11) Overall pretty detailed, it might be helpful to describe the ROC analysis in more detail in the Methods section and also briefly remind the reader in the Results section what the analysis shows conceptually. I know it is a very common analysis method, but I could imagine someone reading this and not knowing how to interpret it. I also couldn't find information on the thresholding process (Analysis 3, p. 12, lines 251-254).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77399.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see in the reports appended below, both reviewers thought that this article represents an interesting contribution to the field, in terms of advancing our understanding of the development of communication abilities. At the same time, both reviewers agreed on several points that need to be addressed to strengthen the article and back up the conclusions that can be drawn. We highlight the most important points here:</p><p>1) The theoretical justification and articulation of the hypothesis and discussion need careful revision.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this we have completely rewritten the introduction and made changes to the discussion, following the suggestions made by the reviewers. We describe these changes in our point-by-point responses to the reviewers below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, both reviewers agreed that some continuous data collection needs to be added to confirm the results from the sparse sampling. At least a couple of dyads are needed to confirm whether the sparse sampling is capturing a similar pattern to more continuous recording. A transcription of the speech is not needed -- time-stamping of the onsets and offsets of caregiver and child vocalizations would suffice. In fact, Reviewer #1 advised that LENA recorders (or some equivalent open-source software) can automatically time-stamp vocalizations (this is not perfect, of course, but it can provide a baseline).</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this we have collected the new data samples and conducted the additional analyses that the editor and the reviewers had suggested. We have taken these data from a new study that includes continuous home recordings, that is currently piloting in our lab. We have data from a cohort of 10 infants, of whom 8 were 5 months of age, and the remaining 2 were 10 months. Other than the fact that the microphone records continuously, the data analyses conducted are identical to those presented in our manuscript. The results of this new analysis strongly support our original findings, by independently replicating key elements – as we describe further in the point-by-point response to reviewer #1, below. We feel more confident in our findings as a result of adding these additional analyses, and we are extremely grateful for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Moreover, clarification of the code is necessary to ensure that results can be replicated.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment we have completely re-written the instructions that we have provided along with the code, and added a readme file that explains in detail how to run analyses in order to replicate each of the data figures contained in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Using an impressive dataset of at-home recordings of video, movement, and electrocardiogram data from caregivers and their infants, the authors examine how large-scale changes in infant arousal relate to spontaneous vocal production in caregivers and their infants. The paper is exhaustive with many analyses and the authors are commended for the Supplementary Materials, which address several alternative hypotheses to the results presented in the manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, the theoretical justification driving the analyses in this study could be better articulated. The authors appear to be seeking evidence for functional flexibility in one-year-old infants and are using arousal as a novel pathway to answer this question (as opposed to facial expressions). A clear and coherent explanation of what functional flexibility is would be helpful in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have now considerably amended the introduction (pp.3-4) to better define functional flexibility, as follows:</p><p>“But what determines when infant vocalisations occur initially, and what their acoustic characteristics are? Are infants’ early vocal explorations constrained, and if so, how? One possibility is that vocal explorations follow a stochastic regime early on, and that infants’ explorations of their vocal tract possibilities produce a wide and unconstrained repertoire of outputs that is then narrowed down through the parental selection mechanism described above. Consistent with this idea, Oller and colleagues have proposed that a fundamental ability that supports the emergence of speech is functional flexibility <sup>1,2</sup>. An individual has functional flexibility when at least some of their vocalizations can occur alongside variable underlying affective states, and are not tied to specific communicative functions (e.g., expressing distress). This ability is necessary for the establishment of a language system : it is because we can produce specific sounds to convey different meanings that arbitrary, symbolic systems can emerge <sup>2</sup>. For instance, we can say “fine” to mean that we are happy to do what a partner suggested, or on the contrary, to signal irritation at the end of a conversation. In short, functional flexibility is a necessary condition for arbitrariness, a key feature of words that supports the emergence of conventional symbolic systems. By contrast, non-human primate vocalisations remain largely inflexible with respect to arousal even in adulthood <sup>3</sup> (although see <sup>4</sup>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, some set of hypotheses and alternative hypotheses to drive the data analysis in relation to functional flexibility would better ground the paper in theory.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this point we have refined how we define our research questions and hypotheses on p.8, in order to make the link to functional flexibility more clear, as follows:</p><p>“First, are caregiver and infant vocalisations as inflexible with regard to arousal as those documented in non-human primates? I.e., do different types of vocalisation, such as cries and speech-like sounds, show different patterns of association with arousal across the infant-caregiver dyad? Our hypothesis was that even speech-like vocalizations remain relatively tied to fluctuations in arousal during infancy in contrast with adulthood. Second, do spontaneously occurring vocalisations during the day co-occur with specific patterns of arousal synchrony and co-regulation? Here, our hypothesis, in line with the parental selection mechanism, was that caregivers would track infants’ arousal fluctuations, and that as a consequence their vocalizations and arousal would be largely tied to their infants rather than their own.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While Figures 2, and 4 are clear and fairly straightforward to interpret, Figures 1 and 5 need particular attention. Consider Figure 1 (Lines 155-175). This attempt to demonstrate that vocalizations occur in temporal clusters is not intuitive and very difficult to interpret. For example, in lines 168-169, &quot;infant vocalisations were significantly more likely to occur relative to an infant vocalisation from 16 minutes prior to 20 minutes after.&quot; Do infant vocalizations occur in clusters of 36 minutes in duration? Or is it that given any infant vocalization, there is a probability of a vocalization 16 minutes prior/20 minutes after (with silence in the intervening time). Although a simple measure of burstiness could be a direct way to measure the clustering of vocalizations, it is unclear how this temporal clustering relates to functional flexibility.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment we have substantially re-written the text in order to make it clearer how these results should be interpreted (p.8). We are grateful for the reviewer’s suggestions to use a burstiness measure instead – and are actually using this measure in some of the new analyses we describe below. However, it is not possible to use burstiness here as we need to be able to use the same measure to look at inter-relationships <italic>across</italic> the dyad (i.e. how the likelihood of an infant vocalisation changes during the time window around caregiver vocalisations) as <italic>within</italic> individuals (i.e. how the likelihood of an infant vocalisation occurring changes during the time windows around infant vocalisations). The burstiness measure allows us to calculate the latter type of relationship but not the former, and so would be unsuitable for this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Due to technical constraints, the authors randomly sampled 5 seconds of audio every minute through their recordings. There is no continuous audio recording. While the authors have done the best they can, given the constraints, lines 127-128 are quite surprising: &quot;the presence of undetected vocalisations can only have weakened any patterns of event-related change that we did observe.&quot; (and restated lines 540-541). If more data weaken the present findings, how are we to believe this paper is not simply reporting a spurious result due to sparse, random sampling of infant vocalizations?</p><p>The natural structure and timing of human vocalizations and vocal interactions occur across time periods longer than 5 seconds in duration. The authors provide little evidence that a random 5-second sampling every minute throughout the day can accurately reflect the clustering of infant vocal production, adult vocal production, and infant-adult vocal interaction. This is a serious concern.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this point we have collected data from a cohort of 10 infants, part of a new ongoing longitudinal study. 8 of these infants were of 5 months of age, and the remaining 2 were 10 months. The devices used in this new study record continuous microphone data, along with the same autonomic measures as in the current study. All data were parsed in exactly the same way. For this analysis we only coded 60-minute segments of microphone recording from each dataset. In this way, we recorded a mean (std) of 72 (33) infant vocalisations per dyad, 63 (45) caregiver vocalisations; amongst the infant vocalisations, 22 (28) were speech-like vocalisations, and 4 (6) were cries.</p><p>Second, in order further to assess both the similarity of effects observed between the sparse coding and the continuous coding and the replicability of our results, we repeated what we consider to be the two most important analyses contained in the manuscript (Figure 2b and Figure 5c) using just the new N=10 hour-long datasets. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Figure (a) shows the original analysis (contained in the main text as Figure 2b), and figure (b) shows the identical analysis with the new pilot data. The analyses conducted were identical between the two sets of results. Figure (c) shows the original analysis (Figure 5c in the main text), and figure (d) shows the identical analysis with the new pilot data.</p><p>The results reveal a strong degree of similarity across the two sampling methods. This is striking particularly given the low N of the new analysis, the low numbers of vocalisations obtained in the infant speech-like vocalisation and infant cry categories, and the fact that these infants were younger. With the reviewers’ permission we would prefer not to include this analysis in the main published manuscript, as we feel that the low N, and the mixed age range of the data included, would not strengthen the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77399-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Second, in order to examine how the sparse sampling affected the temporal distribution of the data, we conducted an analysis examining the timing of clusters, using the approach that reviewer 2 suggested. We examined the timings of the vocalisations observed in the new, pilot continuously recorded data, and we compared it with a resampling to match the sparse sampling data in the original study. We did this by retaining from the continuously recorded data only the vocalisations recorded during the first 5 seconds of every minute.In order to quantify how the temporal distribution of the data was affected by this change, we calculated the burstiness measure used by Abney and colleagues<sup>5,6</sup>, exactly as the reviewer suggests above. This offers a way to quantify the temporal distribution of the data with a single number.

We do cite already in the introduction research suggesting that infants also vocalise when they are alone – which does partially speak to this point. However, we agree that investigating whether the link between arousal and vocalisations remains unchanged when the caregiver isn’t around would be a fascinating question for future research, and we now mention this point in the directions for future research (p.25).

This is clearly an important venue for future research, but at the moment we don’t want to speculate too much on this aspect because, at this stage, we are not sure that this discrepancy between our and Oller et al.’s previous work truly reflects differential flexibility for arousal and valence during infancy as opposed to stemming from methodological differences… We have now elaborated on this in the discussion:</p><p>“This discrepancy with previous findings might be due to a genuine difference in functional flexibility across arousal and valence, which is highly possible given the orthogonality of these two constructs (one can be happy, highly aroused and positive, and angry, highly aroused and negative). However, at this stage it remains equally possible that the discrepancy between our study and previous studies focusing on facial affects stem from methodological differences. Focusing on physiological measures might be more sensitive than relying on overt displays, and further research should try and rely on other measures (e.g., acoustic analyses of vocalizations) to try and disentangle”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is also important to discuss the possible mechanisms that could result in the sustained elevated arousal surrounding infant and caregiver vocalizations. Currently, caregiver and infant vocalizations are described as standalone events (except in the very first section on temporal clustering), when in fact they likely are highly interdependent. These vocalizations occur in the context of social interaction, and as the authors pointed out, vocalizations occur in clusters. Therefore, the minutes following an infant vocalization are more likely to have more caregiver (and infant) vocalizations as well (and this may differ depending on the type of infant vocalization; e.g., cries vs. speech-like vocalizations). The presence of further vocalizations by the caregiver may sustain the infants' elevated autonomic arousal. Similarly, if an infant shows heightened arousal before a caregiver vocalization, that may either be due to the caregiver responding to the infant's heightened arousal or vocalization, or it may signal a prediction from the infant. It would be interesting to explore, even if just in a descriptive way, how conversation turn-taking may have contributed to the observed results.</p></disp-quote><p>Again this is an excellent point, and we have made textual changes to the discussion to incorporate it (pp.24-25). How turn-taking shapes these interdependencies is indeed an important venue for future research, and we hope to be able to investigate this issue further once data collection for the study we describe above in response to reviewer 1 (and that we now use to address issues related to sampling) is complete. This novel dataset will be more suited to this research question, as it is continuous.</p><p>“Nevertheless, future research based on continuous recordings would allow us to examine in more detail the role of turn-taking behaviours in communicative exchanges – examining, for example whether arousal facilitates effective communication between caregiver and child by making children more likely to respond to verbal initiations by the caregiver. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to examine whether the link between arousal and vocalisations remains unchanged even in the absence of the caregiver, or where the caregiver is unresponsive.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The paper uses three measures related to autonomic arousal. However, the text lacks discussion of the unique contributions of each of the three measures (average arousal, arousal stability, and arousal coupling) to answering the main research questions. The paper would benefit from a clear discussion of the authors' predictions in terms of these measures. When might we expect these measures to converge or diverge? How might increases or decreases in each measure impact infants' behavior or cognition? If the findings are the result of exploratory analyses, it's good that the authors aren't overstating the extent to which they had prior hypotheses. However, even so, it is important to frame the motivation for each variable and outline alternative hypotheses for each measure.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this point we have rewritten the section on p.5 where we first introduce the concept of arousal coupling. We discuss how infant and caregiver arousal relates to vocal behaviour, and also how arousal coupling relates to vocal behaviour, but would prefer, given the word limits, to limit our discussion of the differences between arousal, arousal stability and arousal coupling within this manuscript, in order to help maintain focus, as the differences between these measures are discussed extensively elsewhere <sup>8,9</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the above comments, I also wanted to add some smaller points that could strengthen the paper.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>(1) I wonder if the abstract could open with a stronger sentence (p. 2, line 21) describing why it is important and interesting to understand the link between arousal and early vocal communication (beyond there being little work on the topic). This is such an exciting field, and the authors could do a better job of hooking the reader. (Note: this isn't a comment I feel strongly about, just a suggestion.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Functional flexibility should either be defined in the abstract (in half a sentence -- e.g., the authors do this in the introduction on p. 3, line 59) or the authors could perhaps describe the results without using this term, as it is a bit jargony.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this as requested, to avoid using this term in the abstract (e.g., “caregivers vocalizations show greater decoupling with their states of arousal”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The last sentence of the abstract may be a bit misleading in terms of the conclusions of the paper, specifically &quot;caregivers' differential responses to specific types of vocalizations is an important factor driving speech development; and that this selection mechanism which drives vocal development is anchored in our stress physiology.&quot; As it is currently written, this sentence suggests that this paper directly probes the link between caregiver responses to infant vocalizations and infants' speech development. While there is other work examining this question, the current investigation only examines the link between autonomic arousal (and related measures) and vocalizations but not speech development; we don't see changes in how children vocalize over time in response to caregiver feedback.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the last sentence of the abstract following this comment from the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>(4) It would be very helpful to add a paragraph on functional flexibility. This paragraph can include (1) a definition of what the authors mean by the term in the context of this specific investigation (there is a short definition on p. 3, line 59, but more elaboration would be useful), and (2) why the development of functional flexibility is important to understand. The authors touch on bits and pieces of this second point on p.4, lines 75-89, but currently, the paragraph misses some important questions. What would it mean if infants' vocalizations are (or aren't) functionally flexible? How would that change or inform theories of speech development?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now completely rewritten the introduction to better define functional flexibility following previous authors, and to specify why this is important for speech development (see also above in response to reviewer #1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors mention that there are some limited studies on how autonomic arousal influences infant vocalization likelihood in human infants (p. 4, line 76, references 18-20). Could the authors elaborate more on these studies (it seems like they are mostly focused on respiration)? Highlighting how this study is situated in the human infant literature could emphasize its importance (not just novelty).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section on this, as requested (p.4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>(6) Broadly, the Results section would benefit from clearer transition sentences at the start of each subsection and analysis explaining what question the analysis answers (e.g., the authors did a great job at this on p. 12, line 249; they also do this well at the end of some sections -- for example, p. 10, lines 211-212; it would be great to frontload these connections to the bigger hypotheses earlier in the section as well). It would be especially useful to remind the reader of the motivation behind each measure (see the earlier point in the Introduction section).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made these changes as the reviewer requests (see p.7 ff).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) To what extent are the three different measures (average arousal, arousal stability and coupling) correlated? (I know by definition they don't have to be correlated but in practice, it's possible they are.) Also, I know the authors did some multiple comparisons corrections, but I wonder if they could elaborate more on how they navigated having many different exploratory analyses and how they interpret diverging results in these different measures (again, see earlier points about explaining the different predictions for each measure).</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to this point above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) I had trouble understanding the paragraph on p. 14, lines 283-290. Don't some of the results (e.g., no changes in arousal before and after caregiver vocalizations -- lines 287-288) contradict the findings of the current study? Further, the point that the change in arousal is not due to the physical act of vocalizing is fair, but it may still be due to some physiological preparation associated with the motor planning of a vocalization.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text here (p.15) to explain these conclusions better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) I was curious how fluctuations in caregiver and infant arousal throughout the day compare? Are caregivers overall &quot;flatter&quot; throughout the day? I wonder if that could explain some of the differences as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Quantifying this difference is complex given the multiple time-scales of change that we are examining in this paper. We would argue that the consistency of our findings across multiple analyses (including e.g. the findings of how vocalisation likelihood change around naturally occurring arousal peaks) – Figure 2e – indicate that this reason alone is unlikely to be an explanation for our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>(10) As in previous sections, I think the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of (1) what each measure means for the broader questions of functional flexibility, caregiver-infant communication, and speech development, and why we might expect different results across measures, and (2) what the alternative explanations for the results may be.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these excellent points, and have addressed them in the revised discussion, as documented in our line-by-line responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>(11) Overall pretty detailed, it might be helpful to describe the ROC analysis in more detail in the Methods section and also briefly remind the reader in the Results section what the analysis shows conceptually. I know it is a very common analysis method, but I could imagine someone reading this and not knowing how to interpret it. I also couldn't find information on the thresholding process (Analysis 3, p. 12, lines 251-254).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information as requested to the method (p. 34), results (p.12) and the discussion (p.24).</p></body></sub-article></article>
