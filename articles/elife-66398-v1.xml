its synthetic derivative tetrahydro-XN (TXN), attenuates high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of XN and TXN on lipid accumulation in the liver. Non-supplemented mice were unable to adapt their caloric intake to 60% HFD, resulting in obesity and hepatic steatosis; however, TXN reduced weight gain and decreased hepatic steatosis. Liver transcriptomics indicated that TXN might antagonize lipogenic PPARγ actions in vivo. XN and TXN inhibited rosiglitazone-induced 3T3-L1 cell differentiation concomitant with decreased expression of lipogenesis-related genes. A peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) competitive binding assay showed that XN and TXN bind to PPARγ with an IC<sub>50</sub> similar to pioglitazone and 8–10 times stronger than oleate. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated that XN and TXN bind in the PPARγ ligand-binding domain pocket. Our findings are consistent with XN and TXN acting as antagonists of PPARγ.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ppar gamma</kwd><kwd>xanthohumol</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>hepatosteatosis</kwd><kwd>metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>antagonist</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01AT009168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>Claudia S</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Jan F</given-names></name><name><surname>Gombart</surname><given-names>Adrian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10RR027878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Jan F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>OSU Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Buhler-Wang Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miranda</surname><given-names>Cristobal L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Linus Pauling Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marion T.

About one-quarter of the US population suffers from NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estes et al., 2018</xref>), with rates in the rest of the world ranging from 14% in Africa to 32% in the Middle East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Younossi et al., 2016</xref>). The continuing obesity and diabetes epidemic drives increasing rates of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estes et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, no FDA-approved drugs exist for its treatment. Sustained healthy lifestyle changes and weight loss are the only interventions proven effective in preventing the onset and progression of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stefan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there is a critical need for novel and effective interventions.</p><p>As a central hub for lipid metabolism, a healthy liver maintains homeostasis among uptake, esterification, oxidation, and secretion of fatty acids (FAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldberg and Ginsberg, 2006</xref>). Overconsumption of saturated FAs or sugars can overload the liver and disrupt lipid homeostasis, resulting in excess storage of triacylglycerols (TAG) in hepatocytes and the onset and progression of hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ipsen et al., 2018</xref>). Given that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is important in hepatic lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharma and Staels, 2007</xref>), it has attracted considerable attention as a therapeutic target for NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeda-Valdés et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Attenuated PPARγ activity in heterozygous <italic>Pparg</italic>-deficient (<italic>Pparg</italic><sup>+/−</sup>) C57Bl/6J mice protects against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, liver steatosis, and adipocyte hypertrophy; however, treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone (PGZ) abrogates the protection against adipocyte hypertrophy (enlarged adipocytes) and decreases insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubota et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting a potential beneficial use for PPARγ antagonists to treat hepatic steatosis. PPARγ antagonists tanshinone IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gong et al., 2009</xref>), β-cryptoxanthine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goto et al., 2013</xref>), protopanaxatriol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), isorhamnetin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and Gleevec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2016</xref>) improved multiple metabolic parameters in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. These observations strongly suggest that moderate inhibition of PPARγ activity may reduce the risk for developing hepatic steatosis induced by diet, and PPARγ antagonists may be useful for the treatment and prevention of NAFLD.</p><p>Xanthohumol (XN), a prenylated flavonoid found in hops (<italic>Humulus lupulus</italic> L.), improves multiple parameters of MetS in rat and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Legette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miranda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). Tetrahydroxanthohumol (TXN), a non-estrogenic synthetic XN derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), appears more effective in ameliorating MetS in DIO mice than XN possibly due to its 5-, 10-, and 12-fold higher levels in the muscle, plasma, and liver, respectively, as compared with XN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). Both compounds likely mediate their benefits via multiple mechanisms. XN inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes and induces apoptosis in mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rayalam et al., 2009</xref>), attenuates the function of SREBP-1 by repressing its maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miyata et al., 2015</xref>) and induces beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT), decreases adipogenesis, and induces lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Samuels et al., 2018</xref>). We recently showed that XN and TXN significantly change gut microbiota diversity and abundance, alter bile acid metabolism, and reduce inflammation in mice fed a HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest both XN and TXN are effective for treatment of metabolic disorders and are promising candidates for NAFLD prevention and treatment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of XN and its synthetic derivative, TXN.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66398-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the present study, we show a daily oral intake of 0.035% TXN or 0.07% XN strongly suppresses diet-induced liver steatosis in C57Bl/6J male mice. Supervised machine learning of liver RNA-seq data identified perturbations in PPARγ signaling. Based on cell culture experiments, a PPARγ competitive binding assay and molecular docking studies, we provide evidence that XN and TXN act as novel PPARγ antagonists with moderate binding activity. Collectively, our findings suggest that appropriate functional antagonism of PPARγ is a logical approach to prevent and treat diet-induced liver steatosis and other related metabolic disorders. The structures of XN and TXN could serve as scaffolds for synthesis of more effective compounds to treat NAFLD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TXN attenuates HFD-induced weight gain and improves glucose homeostasis independent of caloric intake</title><p>As expected, C57Bl/6J mice on a 60% HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, solid blue line) gained more BW than mice on the low-fat diet (LFD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, dotted black line) throughout the experimental period (week 1: p&lt;0.05; week 2–16: p&lt;0.001; repeated measures).

XN supplementation decreased the number and size of intrahepatic lipid vacuoles in HFD mice in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Supplementation with TXN almost completely prevented hepatic lipid vacuole accumulation in HFD mice, resulting in less lipid accumulation than in LFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We did not detect discernable fibrosis in liver sections using Sirius red staining in any of the mice (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>TXN prevents HFD-induced liver steatosis in mice.</title><p>Mice were sacrificed at the end of the study and liver samples were freshly collected and processed.

The majority of mice (10 of 12) on a HFD diet had a liver to BW ratio above 4.5%, whereas all LFD mice had a liver to BW ratio between 3.8% and 4.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Supplementation with HXN decreased the number of mice with a liver to BW ratio above 4% to 4 of 12 mice and all TXN-supplemented mice had a liver to BW ratio below 3.6% except for one, which had a liver to BW ratio of 4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data are consistent with TXN and, to a smaller extent, HXN reducing NAFLD.

Gene counts were calculated to quantify gene expression in the four diet groups: LFD, HFD, HFD+HXN, and HFD+TXN. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of &lt;0.4, as compared to HFD.</p><p>To visualize expression patterns of DEGs in the four groups, we used hierarchical clustering with a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The DEGs clustered into two major types, one with higher expression (red) in the LFD and HFD groups but lower expression (blue) in the HXN and TXN groups and the other with lower expression in the LFD and HFD groups but higher expression in the HXN and TXN groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

GO enrichment analysis indicated that TXN treatment significantly downregulated genes involved in biological processes including xenobiotic catabolism, FA metabolism, glucose metabolism, and regulation of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, top panel). Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that TXN upregulated expression of genes in six pathways including complement and coagulation cascades, prion diseases, steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, retinol metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom right panel). Many of these included genes encoding Cyp450 enzymes and genes from the major urinary protein family (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, expression of genes in 25 KEGG pathways were significantly downregulated by TXN treatment compared to HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom left panel). The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways based on statistical significance and combined score ranking included the biosynthesis of unsaturated FAs, glutathione metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, chemical carcinogenesis, drug metabolism, FA elongation, and the PPAR signaling pathway. Consistent with the lack of Sirius red staining in the liver, we observed no changes in expression of genes involved in hepatic fibrosis in the HFD mice compared with the LFD.

To verify the robustness of our docking protocol, resveratrol was re-docked into the bound structure of PPARγ, reproducing the binding pose and orientation found in the crystal structure of the complex (PDB ID: 4JAZ). The best docked position of TXN occupies the binding site of PPARγ, exhibiting many non-bonded interactions involving side chain atoms in Leu255, Phe264, Gly284, Cys 285, Arg288, Val339, Ile 341, Met348, and Met364 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D</xref>). The side chains of His266, Arg280, and Ser342 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Ile281 are well positioned to make electrostatic/hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl protons and oxygen atoms of the bound TXN molecule. We observed many of the same hydrophobic interactions in the simulated PPARγ-XN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E</xref>) and PPARγ-oleic acid complexes, and potential electrostatic interactions between His266 and Glu343, or with Arg280 and XN or oleic acid, respectively. The relative binding affinities, ranked in decreasing value of their negative binding energies were, in order, TXN, XN, and oleic acid, consistent with the TR-FRET binding results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>XN and TXN are effective in suppressing development of diet-induced steatosis</title><p>Low-cost natural products like XN are of particular interest for treating obesity and NAFLD due to their availability, safety, and efficacy. XN and its derivatives appear to function through multiple mechanisms of action, and this polypharmacological effect may enhance their effectiveness. Three studies propose that XN improves diet-induced hepatic steatosis by suppressing SREBP1c mRNA expression and SREBP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miyata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takahashi and Osada, 2017</xref>). We also observed a decrease in hepatic SREPB1c expression with TXN treatment. Others propose mechanisms include inhibiting pro-inflammatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dorn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mahli et al., 2019</xref>), inducing AMPK activation in the liver and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costa et al., 2017</xref>), and enhancing FA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirkwood et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, using a combination of molecular, biochemical, biophysical, and bioinformatics approaches, we provide evidence for an additional novel mechanism by which XN and its derivative, TXN, can inhibit diet-induced hepatic steatosis through downregulation of hepatic FA uptake and lipid storage by binding to PPARγ in the liver and effectively antagonizing its actions.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that XN and TXN ameliorated DIO in C57Bl6/J mice with no evidence of liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). Using the same animal model, we confirmed the phenotypic outcomes observed in the previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this study and prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>), we noted a decrease in weight with treatment in the presence of similar caloric intake. Our metabolic cage data demonstrated energy expenditure increased with body mass, but a treatment effect was not identified. We hypothesize that changes in microbiota composition and bile acid metabolism, which can affect nutrient and energy harvesting, may explain the reduction in weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wahlström et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) observed by treatment, but requires testing in future work. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effect of XN and TXN on the development and progression of diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Administration of 0.07% XN and 0.035% TXN significantly slowed the development and progression of hepatic steatosis during a 16 week high-fat feeding. We observed less macro- and microvesicular steatosis, significantly lower liver mass to BW ratio, decreased TAG accumulation, and significantly lower steatosis scores in the XN- and TXN-supplemented mice compared to their untreated HFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Four pathways generally maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis: uptake of circulating lipids, de novo lipogenesis (DNL), FA oxidation (FAO), and lipid export in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These pathways are under tight regulation by hormones, nuclear receptors, and other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechmann et al., 2012</xref>). Long-term dysregulation of one and/or multiple processes can lead to the development of NAFLD, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.</p><p>To elucidate the mechanism of XN and TXN, we determined liver transcriptomic changes after 16 weeks of HFD feeding using RNA-seq. We observed significant changes in hepatic gene expression with TXN administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). GO enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that several biological processes were significantly downregulated by TXN treatment, including xenobiotic catabolism, FA metabolism, glucose metabolism, and regulation of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs revealed that multiple biological pathways were downregulated in the livers of TXN-treated mice, including biosynthesis of unsaturated FAs, glutathione metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, FA elongation, and PPAR signaling pathways, suggesting that TXN rewired global hepatic lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). There was a paucity of DEGs in the livers of mice supplemented with a high dose of XN even at an FDR cutoff of 0.4. This discrepancy might be due to reduced levels of XN in peripheral tissues as compared with TXN as we previously observed a 12-fold lower level of XN as compared with TXN in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To discover signature genes in the liver of mice treated with TXN, we applied a SVM classifier algorithm and extracted the most important features (genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Due to the limited number of samples in this study, we did not separate the data into training and testing sets for the construction of SVM. The caveat of this is that the learning model might not generalize well. Consistent with GO analysis, three of the eight significantly regulated genes – uncoupling protein 2 (<italic>Ucp2</italic>), cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (<italic>Cidec</italic>), and monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (<italic>Mogat1</italic>) – are involved in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Notably, these genes are targets of PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bugge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Karbowska and Kochan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wolf Greenstein et al., 2017</xref>). qRT-PCR confirmed this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and suggested that TXN modulates PPARγ actions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>XN and TXN are novel natural and synthetic PPARγ antagonists</title><p>PPARγ belongs to a super-family of nuclear receptors and just like other members, its activity requires ligand binding.

Because of its essential role in regulating adipogenesis and higher expression in the WAT, PPARγ has been a pharmacological target for drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lehmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lefterova et al., 2014</xref>) in combating metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which include RGZ and PGZ, are the most widely investigated PPARγ agonists due to their strong insulin-sensitizing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Henney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Soccio et al., 2014</xref>). Studies show that the main action of TZDs occurs in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chao et al., 2000</xref>).

Compared to agonists, researchers have identified only a few natural compounds that inhibit PPARγ, all of which have a moderate binding affinity for PPARγ receptor and can inhibit adipogenesis, obesity, and/or hepatic steatosis. These include resveratrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calleri et al., 2014</xref>), 7-chloroarctinone-b isolated from the roots of <italic>Rhaponticum uniflorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2009</xref>), tanshinone IIA from the roots of <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> (danshen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gong et al., 2009</xref>), astaxanthin from red-colored aquatic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jia et al., 2012</xref>), protopanaxatriol extracted from <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), foenumoside B from the herbal plant <italic>Lysimachia foenum-graecum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kwak et al., 2016</xref>), and betulinic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene found in the bark of several plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brusotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ammazzalorso and Amoroso, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence presented in this study support the hypothesis that XN and TXN are also PPARγ antagonists. First, using the 3T3-L1 cell model for PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis, we demonstrated that XN and TXN significantly and strongly suppressed RGZ-induced adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Consistent with a decrease in lipid accumulation, PPARγ target genes were also significantly downregulated in XN- and TXN-treated cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). The PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, did not significantly affect target gene expression of <italic>Pparg</italic>, even though it inhibited differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A2-3</xref>). In our experiments, we used a significantly lower concentration of GW9662 than used by others that ranged from 3 to 25 times higher, and this difference could explain our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sankella et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the PPARγ nuclear receptor competitive binding assay showed that XN and TXN have a moderate binding affinity of 1.97 µM and 1.38 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Lastly, consistent with the competitive binding assay, simulated molecular docking indicated that XN and TXN can interact with the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ like other known ligands and potentially form hydrogen bonds with His266, Arg280, Ser342, and Ile281, in addition to many non-bonded interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D,E</xref>). Moreover, the predicted binding model reveals that the interactions between XN, TXN, and the PPARγ ligand-binding domain resembles those observed between PPARγ and resveratrol, a dietary polyphenol that is also a PPARγ antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calleri et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings are consistent with XN and TXN functioning as PPARγ antagonists and now offer a mechanistic explanation for prior observations that XN impaired adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mendes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Samuels et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One of the many side effects observed from TZD therapy is weight gain. TZDs primarily mediate their effects in adipose tissue by PPARγ activation that stimulates adipocyte differentiation and increases the efficiency of uptake of circulating non-esterified FAs by adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, in this study, we observed a significant decrease in overall, sWAT, and mWAT fat mass in HXN- and TXN-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5AC</xref>), yet a slight increase in the eWAT fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Prior studies have reported that the expandability of eWAT in male mice is an indicator of metabolic health. Mouse sWAT and mWAT will continue to expand with BW, whereas eWAT expansion diminishes after mouse BW reaches about 40 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Beek et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that HXN- and TXN-treated mice have capacity to expand eWAT, whereas HFD-fed untreated mice do not, which seems to direct the development of metabolic disorders. In our previous study, we demonstrated that XN and TXN accumulates primarily in the liver with significantly lower levels in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). We could not detect XN or TXN in the WAT of these mice (data not shown). The levels of XN and TXN in the liver (TXN &gt; HXN &gt; LXN) and the absence of both compounds in the WAT suggest that these compounds antagonize PPARγ in the liver and not in the WAT, therefore, minimizing the side effect of weight gain observed with TZDs that are PPARγ agonists.</p><p>During a long-term HFD feeding, PPARγ and its target genes are upregulated to compensate for the lipid overflow in the liver. Namely, genes associated with lipid uptake and trafficking (<italic>Lpl</italic>, <italic>Cd36</italic>, <italic>Fabp4</italic>), TAG synthesis (<italic>Fasn</italic>, <italic>Scd1</italic>, <italic>Mogat1</italic>), and formation of lipid droplets for storage (<italic>Cidec</italic>/<italic>Fsp27</italic>, <italic>Plin4</italic>) (Supplement_File_B). The result is excessive lipid accumulation in the liver, leading to hepatic steatosis. This was observed with PPARγ overexpression in hepatocytes in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rahimian et al., 2001</xref>). We propose that TXN added to a HFD antagonizes PPARγ action in the liver potentially by physically interacting with PPARγ receptors as indicated in the molecular docking studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13DE</xref>) and, therefore, reduces PPARγ transcriptional activity and expression of the aforementioned target genes. Several in vivo studies support our findings. Hepatocyte- and macrophage-specific PPARγ deficiency protects Lep &lt; <italic>ob/ob</italic>&gt; mice from hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matsusue et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morán-Salvador et al., 2011</xref>); knockdown of <italic>Mogat1</italic> in the liver significantly attenuates hepatic steatosis after 12 weeks HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2012</xref>); and restoration of <italic>Cidec/Fsp27</italic> in Lep &lt; <italic>ob/ob</italic>&gt; liver-specific <italic>Pparg</italic> knockout mice promotes hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Matsusue et al., 2008</xref>). The role for <italic>Plin4</italic> in hepatic steatosis is limited, but it may affect TAG accumulation during HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffin, 2017</xref>). Ablation of <italic>Pparg</italic> in murine myeloid cells increased insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Souza et al., 2020</xref>) and ablation in macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, but not hepatocytes increased inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morán-Salvador et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, we did not observe either of these conditions in our study. In contrast, TXN did not promote hepatic inflammation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) but improved glucose clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We postulate complete the absence of PPARγ is quite different from modulating its activity through agonists and antagonists, and this may explain the differences noted in some of these cell-specific knockout studies and our findings.</p><p>As we discussed earlier, antagonizing PPARγ action is likely an additional mechanism by which XN and TXN suppress diet-induced NAFLD. Other possible mechanisms may play a role as well. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are diseases strongly associated with NAFLD. Mouse studies and fecal transplantation experiments have demonstrated a causal role of gut microbiota in the development of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henao-Mejia et al., 2012</xref>). We previously reported that both XN and TXN drastically changed gut microbiota composition in C57Bl6/J male mice, accompanied with a significant change in the fecal bile acid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, administration of XN and TXN decreased intestinal microbiota diversity and abundance, altered bile acid metabolism, and reduced inflammation. Changes in the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism may also explain, in part, the improvements in MetS and NAFLD, but requires investigation in future studies.</p><p>Legette et al. reported feeding XN to Zucker fa/fa rats for 6 weeks significantly lowered BW gain and plasma glucose levels only in male, but not female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Legette et al., 2013</xref>). This gender difference in response to XN is not unique as similar findings were observed for other flavonoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camper-Kirby et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blair et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), we found the expression of numerous major urinary protein (<italic>Mup</italic>) genes reduced by a HFD as compared to the LFD; however, the expression of these same genes were induced by TXN administration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). MUPs are unique members of the lipocalin super-family produced by the liver and secreted into urine primarily in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou and Rui, 2010</xref>). They function in the urine as pheromones in chemical communication and as metabolic signals regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in individual animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhou and Rui, 2010</xref>). Because adult male mice secrete significantly more MUPs than females, this finding may explain why female mice do not respond to XN and TXN like their male counterparts. TXN treatment also beneficially modulated expression of lipocalin members, Lcn2 and ApoMm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Milner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). To elucidate the role these changes in gene expression play in gender-specific responses to TXN requires additional research.</p><p>To maintain energy homeostasis, proper crosstalk between metabolically active tissues is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stern et al., 2016</xref>). In NAFLD (and MetS in general), these tissues often present a chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells, cytokines, and acute-phase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lackey and Olefsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Previously we reported that supplementation with TXN decreased chronic inflammation with reduced expression of major pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic> in WAT and to a smaller extent in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed a decrease in <italic>Ccl2</italic>, a chemotactic factor involved in the recruitment of monocytes, and macrophage marker F4/80 in WAT, suggesting that TXN may protect WAT from macrophage infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the dose of TXN given in the diet is very effective in suppressing the development and progression of diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice. TXN appears more effective in vivo than XN perhaps due to significantly higher levels of TXN in the liver, but XN can slow progression of the condition at a higher dose. At the dose used for TXN, we have not observed adverse events in our prior or current studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). In future work, we would consider testing lower and higher doses for safety and efficacy and pursuing pharmacokinetic studies such as those already done with XN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Legette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Legette et al., 2014</xref>). While XN and TXN are effective preventative approaches in rodents, in future studies we are interested in determining if these compounds can treat existing obesity. We provide evidence that XN and TXN act as novel, natural, and synthetic antagonists of PPARγ that bind with a similar affinity as the agonist PGZ. Our findings support further development of XN and TXN as novel, low-cost therapeutic compounds for diet-linked hepatic steatosis with fewer negative side effects than current drugs (e.g., reduced adipose tissue expansion). Additionally, the structures of XN and TXN could serve as scaffolds for the synthesis of more effective compounds to treat NAFLD and other fatty liver diseases. These findings also raise the possibility of testing XN and TXN in combination with other PPARγ ligands in treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Although these results are encouraging, further studies are required to clarify possible use in humans for the prevention and treatment of diet-linked hepatic steatosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and diets</title><p>Studies were performed using 8-week-old SPF male C57Bl/6J mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

RNA (0.25 µg) was converted to cDNA using iScript reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (Bio-Rad Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. PCRs were set up as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gombart et al., 2005</xref>). All the threshold cycle number (CT) were normalized to Ywhaz reference gene. PrimeTime Std qPCR assays were purchased from IDT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">Table 9</xref>). ΔCT = CT(target gene) – CT(reference gene). ΔΔCT = ΔCT(treated sample) – ΔCT(untreated sample/control average).

A terbium-labeled anti-GST antibody binds to a GST-PPARγ-ligand-binding domain fusion protein in which the LBD is occupied by a fluorescent pan-PPAR ligand (Fluormone Pan-PPAR Green). Energy transfer from the antibody to the ligand occurs and a high TR-FRET ratio (emission signal at 520 nm/495 nm) is detected. When a test compound displaces the ligand from PPARγ-LBD, a decrease in the FRET signal occurs and a lower TR-FRET ratio is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corporation, 2008</xref>). For each compound (XN, TXN, or oleic acid), a 10-point serial dilution (250,000–12.5 nM) was tested. Binding curves were generated by plotting percent displacement versus log concentration (nM), and IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined using a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Molecular docking simulations for XN and TXN into the PPARγ ligand-binding domain</title><p>To estimate the binding mode of XN and TXN to PPARγ, molecular docking simulations were performed using AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>). Structural models of XN and TXN were built using OpenBabel to convert the isometric SMILES descriptor for XN to a PDB formatted file, which was subsequently modified using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4.5, Schrödinger, LLC) to obtain a PDB file for TXN. The solved structure of PPARγ bound to the antagonist resveratrol (PDB ID: 4JAZ) was used as the receptor model. The PDBQT files for the receptor and the resveratrol, XN, TXN, and oleic acid ligands were generated using MGLTools-1.5.7rc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Morris et al., 2009</xref>). The PPARγ receptor was kept rigid during all docking experiments, and the center and size (20 × 20 × 20 Å<sup>3</sup>) of the docking box was positioned to cover the entire ligand-binding site of PPARγ. All rotatable torsion angles in the ligand models were allowed to be active during the docking simulations. Twenty docking poses were generated for each simulation, and the conformation with the lowest docking energy was chosen as being representative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis of variance procedures for continuous data and Fisher’s exact test for binary data were used for statistical comparisons. p-values of orthogonal a priori comparisons of the HFD control group versus each of the supplement groups are shown in the corresponding tables and figures.

It is potentially of broad interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and also a valuable addition to the field of metabolism and hepatic steatosis. It provides a comprehensive analysis of a new compound that shows promising therapeutic potential in improving hepatic steatosis and glucose handling in response to metabolic stress.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TXN, a xanthohumol derivative, attenuates high-fat diet induced hepatic steatosis by antagonizing PPARγ&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: José Cesar Rosa Neto (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Authors should assess in more detail the effects on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (gene and protein markers).</p><p>2. Discussion needs to be updated to expand on the following: [1] other potential mechanisms of TXN, [2] the effects of TXN on microbiome and bile acid metabolism, particularly in relation to NAFLD, [3] potential effects of crosstalk between adipose and liver crosstalk in response to TXN treatment, [4] potential sex differences, [5] expand on the balance between PPAR α and γ signaling in the regulation of hepatic steatosis and how TXN may disrupt that balance to improve hepatic lipid profiles.</p><p>3. More assays to characterize physical activity in response to TXN treatment (e.g. voluntary running wheel, time to exhaustion on treadmill).</p><p>4. Assess lipid oxidation pathway in response to TXN treatment.</p><p>5. Assess insulin sensitivity and glucose handling in TXN treated mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Zhang et al., systematically analyze the effect of xanthohumol and TXN, a xanthohumol derivative, in a model of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to mice, inducing several pathologies related to the metabolic syndrome. They analyze serum, different fat compartments and the liver. Furthermore, they assess energy expenditure. They convincingly show that these compounds attenuate HFD-induced weight, hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation in adipose tissues. Furthermore, they newly showed that XN and TXN bind to the PPARγ ligand-binding domain pocket and that this at least in part is responsible for the observe beneficial effects.</p><p>This is a comprehensive analysis of XN and TXN effects in different tissue compartments and on different pathological mechanism, respectively. Data are well presented and overall well discussed. Still, there are some issues that should described in more detail.</p><p>– Authors should assess in more detail the effects on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Even if the (duration of feeding the) diet may not induce histologically detectable changes, markers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, including activation of hepatic stellate cells, should be assessed.</p><p>– Authors briefly discuss and cite that there are other/further mechanism of action/previous studies by which xanthohumol exhibits beneficial effects in models of diet induced obesity and NAFLD. These should be discussed in more detail, and eventually, it should be also experimentally addressed, whether some of these mechanisms are also operative in the present study.</p><p>– It is known that changes in the microbiome and also (associated effects on) bile acid metabolism significantly affect diet induced weight gain and (progression of) NAFLD. Authors should discuss known effects of xanthohumol in this context.</p><p>– Also the crosstalk between adipose tissue and (fatty) liver plays a critical role in weight gain as well as NAFLD-progression. Authors should discuss, how xanthohumol may interfere with this crosstalk and also investigate some known key factors such as adipokines, lipocalin, IL6 in their study.</p><p>– An intriguing finding of the present study is that XN and TXN act as antagonists of PPARγ. In part, it has already discussed by the authors, but it should be done in more detail: what are the potential clinical implications in NAFLD, diabetes, obesity. When during the course of disease might XN or TXN be applied? Alone or in combination with other PPARγ affecting drugs? What are the risks and potential side effects?</p><p>– Authors might also discuss known as well as potential gender-specific differences in the mode of action.</p><p>– Regarding synthesis/source of the compounds, authors should not only refer to a previous publication but provide more details in the method section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript titled: &quot; TXN, a Xanthohumol Derivative, Significantly Attenuates High-Fat Diet Induced Hepatic Steatosisin vivo by Antagonizing PPARγ&quot; conduced by Zhang et al., showed that Xanthohumol Derivative reduced the hepatic steatosis by assumption that it is the PPAR-γ dependent mechanism.</p><p>I suggest that the manuscript should be rejected. The <italic>eLife</italic> is an outstanding journal and it is necessary high criticism on the evaluation of the manuscript. The conclusion is not supported by the method, it is necessary many additional experiments to show the relevance effect of TXN on lipid metabolism on liver.</p><p>The Results section show discussion during the description of results, for instance phrase that starts on line 188. On the same direction, the paragraph that starts on line 293.</p><p>The discussion is very speculative, and the authors starts the discussion writing about the AMPK and inflammation but neither of these parameters were evaluated during the manuscript.</p><p>Weakness of the manuscript:</p><p>The authors suggest that the effects of TXN might be associated by increase on physical activity. But the parameters used to measure are very weak. It is necessary to show the increased on physical activity by evaluation of running on wheel voluntary running cage. Moreover, the authors might measure if the TXN is able to improve the time to exhaustion in treadmill running.</p><p>The steatosis is a very complex process, which can induced by huge lipid storage or reduction on lipid oxidation. The unbalance between synthesis and oxidation is crucial to understand the hepatic steatosis. The authors did not measure the enzymes that regulate the lipid oxidation on liver, in special the PPAR-α pathway.</p><p>Moreover, Souza CO et al., 2020 showed (1) that the PPAR-γ deletion on myeloid cell, induces the stronger insulin resistance. On the same direction the ablation of PPAR-γ on myeloid cell induces the huge pro-inflammatory response (2). The beneficial effects of ppar-γ antagonism in hepatic steatosis are still unclear. The others authors showed that the a treatment with PPAR-γ agonist is able to improve the NAFLD and NASH induced by HFD (3). The dual role of PPAR-γ is showed with the deletion of PPAR-γ in hepatocytes that mitigate the NAFLD in mice fed with HFD, but this phenotype shows metabolic complications, such as inflammation and disturb on glucose homeostasis (4).</p><p>Another question is about the adipose tissue homeostasis. The great problem of obesity is the increase of fatty acids storage in non-adipose tissue. The effects of antagonist TXN is able to impair the metabolic status of adipose tissue.

The XN and TXN compounds are formulated with the diet, therefore the daily dose of compound consumed by each mouse will vary depending on the quantity of food consumed and the body weight of the animal, which increases over the period of the study. It would be preferable to indicate the percentage of compound in the diet, which is 0.003% TXN (Table 3, 0.003 g /100 g diet) and 0.003% or 0.006% XN (Table 3, 0.003 g or 0.006 g/100 g diet).

Other possible mechanisms may play a role as well. Gut microbiota dysbiosis associates with obesity and T2D, diseases strongly associated with NAFLD. Mouse studies and fecal transplantation experiments have demonstrated a causal role of gut microbiota in the development of NAFLD (Henao-Mejia et al., 2012). We previously reported both XN and TXN drastically change gut microbiota composition in C57Bl6/J male mice, accompanied by a significant change in fecal bile acid composition (Zhang et al., 2020). Specifically, administration of XN and TXN decreased intestinal microbiota diversity and abundance, altered bile acid metabolism, and reduced inflammation. Changes in gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism may also explain, in part, the improvements in MetS and NAFLD, but requires further investigation in future studies.</p><p>Legette et al. reported feeding XN to Zucker fa/fa rats for six weeks significantly lowered BW gain and plasma glucose levels only in male but not female rats (Legette et al., 2013). This gender difference in response to XN is not unique as similar findings were observed for other flavonoids (Camper-Kirby Dreama et al., 2001; Blair et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2005). Consistent with a prior study (Zhou, Jiang and Rui, 2009) we found expression of numerous major urinary protein (<italic>Mup</italic>) genes reduced by a HFD as compared to the LFD; however, the expression of these same genes were induced by TXN administration (Table 3). MUPs are unique members of the lipocalin super-family produced by the liver and secreted into urine primarily in males (Zhou and Rui, 2010). They function in the urine as pheromones in chemical communication and as metabolic signals regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in individual animal (Zhou and Rui, 2010). Because adult male mice secrete significantly more MUPs than females, this finding may explain why female mice do not respond to XN and TXN like their male counterparts. TXN treatment also beneficially modulated expression of lipocalin members, Lcn2 and ApoM (Wang et al., 2007; Milner et al., 2009; Auguet et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019). To elucidate the role these changes in gene expression play in gender-specific responses to TXN will require additional research.</p><p>To maintain energy homeostasis, proper crosstalk between metabolically active tissues is essential (Stern, Rutkowski and Scherer, 2016). In NAFLD (and MetS in general), these tissues often present a chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by the recruitment of proinflammatory cells, cytokines, and acute-phase proteins (Lackey and Olefsky, 2016; Wang et al., 2021). Previously we reported that supplementation with TXN decreased chronic inflammation with reduced expression of major proinflammatory cytokines <italic>Il-6</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic> in WAT and to a smaller extent in the liver (Zhang et al., 2020).

Compared to HFD control mice, TXN treated mice showed significantly improved glucose clearance, as indicated at time points 30 min, 60 min and 120 min post i.p. injection (Figure 2-supplement 1 A, green line; p-values = 0.04, 0.02, and &lt; 0.01, respectively), and a significantly lower AUC (area under the curve) (Figure 2-supplement 1 B, p &lt; 0.01). HXN treated mice also showed improved glucose clearance at time points 60 min and 120 min post i.p. injection (Figure 2-supplement 1 A, red line; p-values = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively). Although not statistically significant, HXN treated mice showed a trend toward a lower AUC (Figure 2-supplement 1 B, p = 0.067).

When during the course of disease might XN or TXN be applied? Alone or in combination with other PPARγ affecting drugs? What are the risks and potential side effects?</p></disp-quote><p>While the Reviewer raises important questions, it is beyond the scope of this paper to answer all of these questions without extensive speculation. We would need to conduct future studies investigating the efficacy of TXN on reversing established disease in obese animals. We are interested in the question of when during the course of disease might these compounds work and are there effective combinations with other PPARγ ligands. We also realize it is important to perform dose escalation studies with TXN to determine if it has potential side effects or risks in preclinical models. At the dose used in this study, we do not observe side effects. We do know side effects in mice and rats are not reported with XN at much higher doses than those used in this study, but we have not established this for TXN. We also do not know if we can use lower doses of TXN and still see beneficial effects. Pharmacokinetic studies in animal models such as those done with XN are also warranted before considering clinical studies in humans. We have added text to the final paragraph in the discussion address these points.</p><p>We rewrote the text, lines 1012-1030: In conclusion, we demonstrated the dose of TXN given in the diet is very effective in suppressing the development and progression of diet induced hepatic steatosis in mice. TXN appears more effective in vivo than XN perhaps due to significantly higher levels of TXN in the liver, but XN can slow progression of the condition at a higher dose. At the dose used for TXN, we have not observed adverse events in our prior or current studies (Miranda et al., 2018). In future work, we would consider testing lower and higher doses for safety and efficacy and pursuing pharmacokinetic studies such as those already done with XN (Legette et al., 2012; Legette et al., 2014). While XN and TXN are effective preventative approaches in rodents, in future studies we are interested in determining if these compounds can treat existing obesity. We provide evidence that XN and TXN act as novel, natural and synthetic antagonists of PPARγ that bind with a similar affinity as the agonist PGZ. Our findings support further development of XN and TXN as novel, low-cost therapeutic compounds for diet-linked hepatic steatosis with fewer negative side effects than current drugs (e.g., reduced adipose tissue expansion). Additionally, the structures of XN and TXN could serve as scaffolds for the synthesis of more effective compounds to treat NAFLD and other fatty liver diseases. These findings also raise the possibility of testing XN and TXN in combination with other PPARγ ligands in treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Although these results are encouraging, further studies are required to clarify possible use in humans for the prevention and treatment of diet-linked hepatic steatosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors might also discuss known as well as potential gender-specific differences in the mode of action.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do not fully understand the reasons for the gender-specific differences, we have added additional text to the Results and Discussion to describe the known effects of xanthohumol in this context and propose possible explanations.</p><p>In the Results line 542, we included the text genes from the major urinary protein family (Table 3), to point out that these genes were upregulated by TXN treatment.</p><p>Inserted text, lines 986-1002: Legette et al. reported feeding XN to Zucker fa/fa rats for six weeks significantly lowered BW gain and plasma glucose levels only in male but not female rats (Legette et al., 2013). This gender difference in response to XN is not unique as similar findings were observed for other flavonoids (Camper-Kirby Dreama et al., 2001; Blair et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2005). Consistent with a prior study (Zhou, Jiang and Rui, 2009) we found expression of numerous major urinary protein (<italic>Mup</italic>) genes reduced by a HFD as compared to the LFD; however, the expression of these same genes were induced by TXN administration (Table 3). MUPs are unique members of the lipocalin super-family produced by the liver and secreted into urine primarily in males (Zhou and Rui, 2010). They function in the urine as pheromones in chemical communication and as metabolic signals regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in individual animal (Zhou and Rui, 2010). Because adult male mice secrete significantly more MUPs than females, this finding may explain why female mice do not respond to XN and TXN like their male counterparts. TXN treatment also beneficially modulated expression of lipocalin members, Lcn2 and ApoM (Wang et al., 2007; Milner et al., 2009; Auguet et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019). To elucidate the role these changes in gene expression play in gender-specific responses to TXN will require additional research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding synthesis/source of the compounds, authors should not only refer to a previous publication but provide more details in the method section.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the source of the compounds, we inserted the following text at line 1042 of the Materials and methods.</p><p>XN and TXN (both of purity &gt;99%) were provided by Hopsteiner, Inc (New York, NY, USA).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I suggest that the manuscript should be rejected.

We thank the Reviewer for their time and effort in reviewing the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Results section show discussion during the description of results, for instance phrase that starts on line 188. On the same direction, the paragraph that starts on line 293.</p></disp-quote><p>We had trouble locating the specific instances raised by the Reviewer, as lines 188 and 293 were sentences describing the data source. We looked through the entire result sections for text resembling discussion. We removed lines 268-274. The following sentences were removed: In summary, HFD-fed mice used more energy for maintaining basal metabolism, body tissue turnover, or digestion as indicated by a higher energy expenditure and lower directed ambulatory locomotion activity than LFD mice. Compared to HFD only mice, XN- and TXN-treated mice had lower energy expenditure and higher directed ambulatory locomotion and fine movement activities, indicating lower energy for maintaining basal metabolism, body tissue turnover, or digestion and remained more physically active than untreated HFD-fed mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is very speculative, and the authors starts the discussion writing about the AMPK and inflammation but neither of these parameters were evaluated during the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We started the discussion by introducing published mechanisms describing how XN and its derivatives ameliorate diet-induced obesity, metabolic perturbations and liver function with the intention of describing the current state of knowledge in the field, not to confirm these mechanisms in our study. Our findings highlight another new, potential mechanism (antagonizing PPARγ) in addition to those already reported. Our point is to discuss what the current paper adds to the field and highlight that plant polyphenols are likely affecting numerous pathways in mediating their effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weakness of the manuscript:</p><p>The authors suggest that the effects of TXN might be associated by increase on physical activity. But the parameters used to measure are very weak. It is necessary to show the increased on physical activity by evaluation of running on wheel voluntary running cage. Moreover, the authors might measure if the TXN is able to improve the time to exhaustion in treadmill running.</p></disp-quote><p>These proposed experiments are good ideas, but not attainable now, as they require us to start a new animal study and to purchase the necessary equipment such as wheels and treadmills that our current funding situation does not allow.</p><p>The method we used to measure physical activity in this study is insufficient to address the points described by the reviewer. In this study, we derived physical activity from directed ambulatory locomotion and fine movements collected by the metabolic cage system we used (line # 1092-1107). We did not design the current study to specifically test whether XN and TXN alter physical activity because we did not have evidence that it might. We intentionally did not emphasize this data in the manuscript, because we understood the limitations. We decided to show it because no research groups have reported this phenomenon with xanthohumol and/or its derivatives and it could interest researchers in the field. We agree these findings require designing appropriate studies, as suggested by the Reviewer, for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The steatosis is a very complex process, which can induced by huge lipid storage or reduction on lipid oxidation. The unbalance between synthesis and oxidation is crucial to understand the hepatic steatosis. The authors did not measure the enzymes that regulate the lipid oxidation on liver, in special the PPAR-α pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s comment and fully agree that steatosis is a complicated process associated with an array of changes in glucose, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism across all tissues. To acquire some insight into this complicated relationship, we used a systematic pathway analysis of liver RNAseq data. We observed no evidence of changes in lipid oxidation by either XN or TXN treatment under our experimental conditions. We also looked for specific genes known in the β-oxidation process and found no differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the TXN and HFD groups. (Tables 1, 2; line 502 and 513).</p><p>On the other hand, we observed many DEGs involved in lipid storage. With limited resources, we decided to focus on lipid synthesis and storage rather than lipid oxidation. With this focus, our data led us to the main finding of this manuscript, which is XN, and TXN can function as PPARγ antagonists. Nevertheless, our findings do not rule out a role for PPARα, but we have not determined if XN and TXN affect PPARα. In future research, we are interested in the possible role of other nuclear receptors including PPARα, but this research is outside the focus of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, Souza CO et al., 2020 showed (1) that the PPAR-γ deletion on myeloid cell, induces the stronger insulin resistance. On the same direction the ablation of PPAR-γ on myeloid cell induces the huge pro-inflammatory response (2). The beneficial effects of ppar-γ antagonism in hepatic steatosis are still unclear. The others authors showed that the a treatment with PPAR-γ agonist is able to improve the NAFLD and NASH induced by HFD (3). The dual role of PPAR-γ is showed with the deletion of PPAR-γ in hepatocytes that mitigate the NAFLD in mice fed with HFD, but this phenotype shows metabolic complications, such as inflammation and disturb on glucose homeostasis (4).</p></disp-quote><p>There is evidence that PPARγ agonists are beneficial in ameliorating NAFLD and other diet induced metabolic diseases as the Reviewer pointed out. However, it does not contradict the fact that PPARγ antagonists can also be beneficial, as presented in our manuscript and others (Shiomi et al., 2015; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Forschunge 2017; Ammazzalorso and Amoroso, 2019). The Reviewer cited a study showing PPARγ deletion in macrophages can induce inflammation and deteriorate insulin resistance. However, we did not observe either of these conditions in our study. In contrast, TXN as a PPARγ antagonist did not promote hepatic inflammation (Table 2, line# 513) but improved glucose clearance (Figure 2-supplement 1). We postulate complete absence of PPARγ is quite different from modulating its activity through agonists and antagonists and this may explain the differences noted between the knockout studies and our findings.</p><p>We added text to this effect at lines 961-963, Hepatocyte- and macrophage-specific PPARγ deficiency protects <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice from hepatic steatosis (Matsusue et al., 2003; Morán-Salvador et al., 2011);…. and 967-974, Ablation of PPARγ in murine myeloid cells increased insulin resistance (Souza et al., 2020) and ablation in macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, but not hepatocytes increased inflammation (Morán-Salvador et al., 2013). Nevertheless, we did not observe either of these conditions in our study. In contrast, TXN did not promote hepatic inflammation (Table 2) but improved glucose clearance (Figure S1). We postulate complete absence of PPARγ is quite different from modulating its activity through agonists and antagonists and this may explain the differences noted in some of these cell-specific knockout studies and our findings.</p><p>Moreover, PPARγ agonists, such as TZDs, are possible double-edged swords: TZD treatments improve hepatic steatosis through insulin-sensitizing effects on the adipose tissue (Ratziu et al., 2010). Long-term TZD treatments will promote unwanted weight gain (Fonseca, 2003) due to TZD’s direct action on adipose tissue, as well as cardiovascular complications (Nesto et al., 2004). Our data suggest limited or no direct action of TXN on adipose tissue, given TXN’s level is undetectable in the adipose tissue (data not shown). Indeed, future pharmacokinetics studies are necessary to determine the systemic distribution of TXN in the host.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another question is about the adipose tissue homeostasis. The great problem of obesity is the increase of fatty acids storage in non-adipose tissue. The effects of antagonist TXN is able to impair the metabolic status of adipose tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We specifically quantified three different fat depots, namely epididymal, subcutaneous, and mesenteric white adipose tissue. Our data showed no sign of TXN impairing the metabolic status of adipose tissue, in fact, we saw the opposite. One explanation could be that TXN is undetectable in the adipose tissue, therefore cannot physically bind to PPARγ and antagonize its actions. In fact, this may explain why TXN is a better PPARγ antagonist compared with traditional PPARγ agonists that cause unintentional/undesirable weight gain in the adipose tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the insulin resistance is the first step of lipids accumulation on the hepatic parenchyma and it is not evaluate in this study (5).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data from glucose tolerance testing, and fasting glucose and insulin data to the Results section.
