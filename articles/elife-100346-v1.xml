Single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on pooled hypothalami from each group: aged male Norway brown rats treated with 17α-estradiol (O.T), aged controls (O), and young controls (Y). Supervised clustering of neurons (based on neuropeptides/receptors) evaluated subtype responses to aging and 17α-estradiol. Aging-induced elevation of neuronal cellular metabolism, stress, and reduced synapse formation-related pathways were significantly attenuated by 17α-estradiol. Neuron population analysis showed that subtypes regulating food intake, reproduction, blood pressure, stress response, and electrolyte balance were sensitive to 17α-estradiol. 17α-estradiol increased serum oxytocin (Oxt) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis activity (elevated plasma Gnrh, total testosterone; reduced estradiol). Gnrh1 upregulation mediated its effects on energy homeostasis, neural synapse, and stress response. Notably, <italic>Crh</italic> neurons in O.T showed prominent stress phenotypes, distinct from <italic>Agrp/Ghrl</italic> neurons. Thus, HPG axis and energy metabolism may be key 17α-estradiol targets in male hypothalamus. Additionally, our results demonstrate that supervised clustering (based on neuropeptides/receptors) effectively assesses the responses of hypothalamic neuron subtypes to aging and 17α-estradiol treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>17α-estradiol</kwd><kwd>snRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Gnrh</kwd><kwd>Crh</kwd><kwd>Oxt</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>SnRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>17α-estradiol</kwd><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Crh</kwd><kwd>Oxt</kwd><kwd>Gnrh</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31271448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yinchuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82171621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National High Level Hospital Clinical Research Funding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-PUMCH-A-231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Long-term 17α-estradiol modulates aged male hypothalamic function via HPG axis and energy metabolism, mitigating aging-related neuronal changes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hypothalamus serves as the central hub for controlling energy homeostasis, stress response, temperature, learning, feeding, sleep, social behavior, sexual behavior, hormone secretion, reproduction, osmoregulation, blood pressure, visceral activities, emotion, and circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hajdarovic et al., 2022</xref>). The hypothalamic energy-sensing system, particularly the circuits that regulate food intake, plays a crucial role in lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dacks et al., 2013</xref>). Elevated metabolic activity in the aged hypothalamus has been reported in aged hypothalamus, including increased mTor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Masliukov, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, decreases in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Ghrh, Trh, monoamine neurotransmitters, and blood supply are hallmarks of aging hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that 17α-estradiol extends the lifespan of male mice and has beneficial effects on metabolism and inflammation, similar to those of rapamycin and acarbose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stout et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wink et al., 2022</xref>). Recent study indicated that 17α-estradiol also extends the lifespan of male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mann et al., 2020</xref>). Further investigations revealed certain unique features of 17α-estradiol in life extension distinct to rapamycin and acarbose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watanabe et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burns et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that 17α-estradiol targets hypothalamic <italic>POMC</italic> neurons to reduce metabolism by decreasing feeding behavior through anorexigenic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steyn et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the lifespan extension effect has only been observed in male animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). The safety of 17α-estradiol is key for translation into clinical treatment, and the potential side effects on reproduction and feminization by 17α-estradiol treatment must be considered. However, contradictory results have been reported regarding its side effects on reproduction and feminization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stout et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isola et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stout et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, further investigation and verification are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of lifespan extension and the safety of 17α-estradiol.</p><p>In this report, we utilized single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing and performed supervised clustering of neurons based on neuropeptides, hormones, and their receptors. Supervised clustering offers better resolution in cell cluster screening compared to traditional unsupervised clustering. We assessed the effects of 17α-estradiol on metabolism, stress responses, ferroptosis, senescence, inflammation, and pathways involved in synaptic activity in each neuron subtype, ranking the most sensitive neurons. The effects of 17α-estradiol on reversing aging-related cellular processes were evaluated by two opposing regulatory networks involved in hypermetabolism, stress, inflammation, and synaptic activity. Several key endocrine factors from serum were examined, and the potential side effects of 17α-estradiol on specific neurons were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The overall changes in aged hypothalamus with or without long-term 17α-estradiol treatment via snRNA-seq profiling</title><p>To investigate the hypothalamus as a potential key target of 17α-estradiol’s effects on life extension, we performed snRNA-seq on the entire hypothalamus of aged and 17α-estradiol-treated aged Norway brown rats, using the hypothalamus from young adult male rats as a control. We identified 10 major cell types based on specific cell markers of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Notably, the proportions of all non-neural cells changed in O versus Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For instance, the proportions of oligodendrocytes (Oligo), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), and microglia (Micro) were found to be increased, while those of astrocytes (Astro), tanycytes (Tany), fibroblasts (Fibro), pars tuberalis cells (PTC), and endothelial cells (Endo) were decreased in O compared to Y. The proportions of Oligo, OPC, and Micro were also increased in 17α-estradiol-treated aged group (O.T) compared to those in Y. Furthermore, Endo was increased in O.T compared to both Y and O. The proportions of Astro, Tany, Epen, and PTC decreased more in O.T than those in O when compared to Y.

However, based on these cellular perturbations, it’s difficult to define the precise physiological status of these subtypes of neurons, particularly regarding neuroendocrine activities. Consequently, we performed enzyme immunoassays of hormones from the serum of O, O.T, and Y. The treatment with 17α-estradiol significantly increased the plasma level of Gnrh compared to Y (p=0.0099) and approached significance when compared to O (p=0.096) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). More intriguingly, testosterone levels in serum were significantly increased in O.T compared to O (p=0.018) and approached significance when compared to Y (p=0.052). Additionally, the serum estradiol levels were significantly increased in O compared to Y (p=0.011) and significantly decreased in O.T compared to O (p=0.019), suggesting that 17α-estradiol treatment markedly altered the homeostasis of testosterone and estradiol.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The response of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in males to 17α-estradiol and the causal effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh) on other endocrine factors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression profiles of pathways from the two opposing signaling networks in <italic>Gnrh1</italic>-, <italic>Esr2</italic>-, <italic>Esr1</italic>-, or <italic>Ar</italic>-positive neurons.

These results also suggest that the role of 17α-estradiol treatment in feeding, energy homeostasis, reproduction, osmotic regulation, stress response, and neuronal plasticity may be mediated, at least in part, by elevated Gnrh secretion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The most striking effect of 17α-estradiol treatment revealed in this study is its modulation of the HPG axis: serum levels of Gnrh and testosterone were significantly elevated in the O.T group compared to the O group, which may counteract age-related declines in HPG axis activity. The underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear; however, prior reports have indicated that 17α-estradiol can bind to ESR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mann et al., 2020</xref>). In our findings, 17α-estradiol treatment significantly decreased serum estradiol levels while elevating serum testosterone. Based on this evidence, we propose that 17α-estradiol may function similarly to estrogen receptor antagonists or aromatase inhibitors, potentially preventing the conversion of androgens to estrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guay et al., 2003</xref>). These actions could alleviate the feedback inhibition exerted by estrogen on hypothalamus and pituitary, thereby facilitating the secretion of Gnrh, FSH, and LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang and Swerdloff, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The testosterone levels in men gradually decline beginning in the third decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Camacho et al., 2013</xref>). Age-related deterioration of the gonadotropic axis, particularly in older males with low serum testosterone, is often linked to numerous aging symptoms, including loss of skeletal muscle mass, reduced muscle strength and power, low bone mineral density, frailty, impaired physical performance, mobility limitations, increased risk of diabetes, elevated all-cause cardiovascular mortality, cognitive decline, and heightened risk of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodrigues Dos Santos and Bhasin, 2021</xref>). Consequently, testosterone supplementation in older men is beneficial. Additionally, Gnrh supplementation may help mitigate age-related declines in neurogenesis and slow aging processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, treatment with 17α-estradiol did not result in feminization or adversely affect the sperm parameters and fertility in male animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stout et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isola et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the observed increases in Gnrh and serum testosterone levels due to 17α-estradiol treatment are likely advantageous for older males, particularly those experiencing late-onset hypogonadism.</p><p>Postmenopausal women with low estrogen experience aging-related syndromes similar to those of older males with low serum testosterone. Those women also face increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis fracture, urogenital atrophy, and dementia, all of which may benefit from hormone therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shoupe, 2011</xref>). However, a prior report indicates that 17α-estradiol treatment does not provide positive life extension effects in aged females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). The discrepancy may stem from the inhibitory effects of estrogens associated with 17α-estradiol treatment, as evidenced by its inability to enhance female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Isola et al., 2022</xref>). Nonetheless, due to the lack of parallel data in aged female BN rats treated with 17α-estradiol, further research is needed to definitely address this question in the female subjects in the future.</p><p>The stressed phenotype observed in neuronal subtypes discussed herein likely represents a transcriptomic manifestation of heightened physiological activity. For instance, as evidenced in this study, prolonged 17α-estradiol treatment induces a pronounced stressed phenotype in <italic>Gnrh</italic> neurons alongside elevated Gnrh secretion and consequent high serum testosterone levels. Similarly, the stressed phenotype reflected in the <italic>Crh</italic> neuronal transcriptome coincides with substantially increased serum cortisol. Furthermore, long-term 17α-estradiol treatment markedly alleviates the stressed phenotype in appetite-stimulating neurons (<italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Ghrl</italic>), suggesting an appetite-suppressing effect in rats. This aligns with previously reported findings that 17α-estradiol treatment inhibits feeding behavior in mice, as Agrp and Ghrl neurons are key promoters of appetite; reduced stress (and potentially reduced activity) in these neurons in O.T may weaken appetite drive, contributing to inhibited feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steyn et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another notable effect of 17α-estradiol is its ability to reduce the overall expression levels of energy metabolism in hypothalamic neurons of aged male BN rats. The nutrient-sensing network, mediated by MTORC1 complex, is a central regulator of mRNA and ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, autophagy, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biosynthesis, and proteasomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>). Downregulation of this nutrient-sensing network has been associated with increased lifespan and healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, 17α-estradiol treatment diminished nutrient-sensing network activity in most hypothalamic neurons, which may be a contributing factor in promoting lifespan extension.</p><p>In this report, we demonstrated significant changes in neuron populations involved in appetite control, including <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Pomc</italic>, <italic>Oxt</italic>, and <italic>Glp2r</italic> neurons. Among the identified subtypes, the proportion of <italic>Oxt</italic> neurons saw the most considerable increase due to 17α-estradiol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Oxt plays versatile roles in social behavior, stress response, satiety, energy balance, reproduction, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerem and Lawson, 2021</xref>). Most <italic>Oxt</italic> neurons originate from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) in the hypothalamus, exhibiting high plasticity during development and intricate circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rosen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madrigal and Jurado, 2021</xref>). The PVN, ARC, and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus together form a neural hub in the hypothalamus that integrates peripheral, nutritional, and metabolic signals to regulate food intake and energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cornejo et al., 2016</xref>). Many effects of Oxt are sex-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carvalho Silva et al., 2023</xref>; for instance, females are less sensitive to exogenous Oxt than males regarding social recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumais and Veenema, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, Oxt injections, facilitated by nanoparticles that enhance blood-brain barrier penetration, reduced body mass while increasing social investigation and the number of Oxt-positive cells in the SON, particularly in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duarte-Guterman et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, intracerebroventricular injections of Oxt in rats showed a reduction in food intake in both sexes, with a more pronounced effect in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we propose that Oxt’s role in systemic aging and feeding behavior may contribute to the sex-biased effects of 17α-estradiol. This hypothesis warrants further verification, such as investigating Oxt signaling in female models treated with 17α-estradiol.</p><p>Furthermore, 17α-estradiol treatment appears to have enhanced stress in HPA axis. One evidence was the increased levels of ferroptosis signature and UPR in <italic>Crh</italic> neurons. The other evidence was the elevated serum cortisol, which is also a potential hallmark of aging HPA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhuis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warde et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, more attention should be paid to the potential side effects of 17α-estradiol, especially in its clinical application.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that 17α-estradiol treatment positively influences the HPG axis and neurons associated with appetite and energy balance. This may be closely linked to the life-extension effects of 17α-estradiol in aged males. Additionally, employing supervised clustering based on neuropeptides, hormones, and their receptors proves to be a valuable strategy for examining pharmacological, pathological, and physiological processes in different neuronal subtypes within the hypothalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals, treatment, and tissues</title><p>Twelve Norway brown male rats (12-months-old) were acquired from Charles River, including 8 12- months-old and 4 1-month-old (Beijing).

To achieve this, they employed a very sophisticated method for single-cell genomic analysis that allowed them to analyze effects on various groups of neurons and non-neuronal cells. They were able to sub-categorize neurons according to their capacity to produce specific neurotransmitters, receptors, or hormones. They found that 17α-Estradiol treatment led to an improvement in several factors related to metabolism and synaptic transmission by bringing the expression levels of many of the genes of these pathways closer or to the same levels to those of young rats, reversing the ageing effect. Interestingly, among all neuronal groups, the proportion of Oxytocin-expressing neurons seems to be the one most significantly changing after treatment with 17α-Estradiol, suggesting an important role of these neurons on mediating its anti-ageing effects. This was also supported by an increase in circulating levels of oxytocin. It was also found that gene expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons was significantly impacted by 17α-Estradiol even though it was not different between aged and young rats, suggesting that these neurons could be responsible for side effects related to this treatment. This article revealed some potential targets that should be further investigated in future studies regarding the role of 17α-Estradiol treatment in aged males.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• The single nucleus mRNA sequencing is a very powerful method for gene expression analysis and clustering. The supervised clustering of neurons was very helpful in revealing otherwise invisible differences between neuronal groups and helped identify specific neuronal populations as targets.</p><p>• There is a variety of functions used that allowed the differential analysis of a very complex type of data. This led to a better comparison between the different groups in many levels.</p><p>• There were some physiological parameters measured such as circulating hormone levels that helped the interpretation of the effects of the changes in hypothalamic gene expression.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• One main control group is missing from the study, the young males treated with 17α-Estradiol.</p><p>• Even though the technical approach is a sophisticated one, analyzing the whole rat hypothalamus instead of specific nuclei or subregions makes the study weaker.</p><p>• Although the authors claim to have several findings, the data fail to support these claims.</p><p>• The study is about improving ageing but no physiological data from the study demonstrated such claim with the exception of the testes histology which was not properly analyzed and was not even significantly different between the groups.</p><p>• Overall, the study remains descriptive with no physiological data to demonstrate that any of the effects on hypothalamic gene expression is related to metabolic, synaptic or other function.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors revised part of the manuscript to address some of the reviewers' comments. This improved the language and the text flow to a certain extent. They also added an additional analysis including glial cells. However, they failed to address the main weaknesses brought up by the reviewers and did not add any experimental demonstration of their claims on lifespan expansion induced by 17α-estradiol in rats (the cited study does not include lifespan in rats). In addition, they insisted i keeping parts in the discussion that are not directly linked to any of the papers' findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100346.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Guanghao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Beijing Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Xiaolei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Junling</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Peoria</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Lirong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nantong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nantong</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ziqing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jinan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mo</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shan</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhuo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yinchuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nantong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nantong</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies have shown that treatment with 17α-estradiol (a stereoisomer of the 17β-estradiol) extends lifespan in male mice but not in females.

The primary focus of our research was on the transcriptional changes and serum endocrine alterations induced by 17α-estradiol in aged males compared to untreated aged males. We believe that even in the absence of female subjects, the significant effects of 17α-estradiol on metabolism in the hypothalamus, synapses, and endocrine system remain evident, particularly regarding the expression levels of GnRH and testosterone. Notably, lower overall metabolism, increased synaptic activity, and elevated levels of GnRH and testosterone are strong indicators of health and well-being in males, supporting the validity of our primary conclusions. However, including female controls would enhance the depth of our findings. If female controls were incorporated, we propose redesigning the sample groups to include aged male control, aged female control, aged female treated, aged male treated, as well as young male control, young male treated, young female control, and young female treated. We regret that we cannot provide this data in the short term. Nevertheless, we believe this reviewer’s creative idea presents a valuable avenue for future research on this topic. In this study, we emphasize the role of 17α-estradiol in overall metabolism, synaptic function, GnRH, and testosterone in aged males and underscore the importance of supervised clustering of neuropeptide-secreting neurons in the hypothalamus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is not known whether 17α-estradiol leads to lifespan extension in male rats similar to male mice. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the observed effects in the hypothalamus, are linked to the lifespan extension.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reminding. 17α-estradiol was reported to extend lifespan in male rats similar to male mice (PMID: 33289482). We have added the valuable reference to introduction in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The effect of 17α-estradiol on non-neuronal cells such as microglia and astrocytes is not well-described (Figure 1). Previous studies demonstrated that 17α-estradiol reduces microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hypothalamus of aged male mice. Current data suggest that the proportion of oligo, and microglia were increased by the drug treatment, while the proportions of astrocytes were decreased. These data might suggest possible species differences, differences in the treatment regimen, or differences in drug efficiency. This has to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed reports describing changes in cell numbers following 17α-estradiol treatment in the brain, using the keywords &quot;17α-estradiol,&quot; &quot;17alpha-estradiol,&quot; and &quot;microglia&quot; or &quot;astrocyte.&quot; Only a limited amount of data was obtained. We found one article indicating that 17α-estradiol treatment in Tg (AβPP(swe)/PS1(ΔE9)) model mice resulted in a decreased microglial cell number compared to the placebo (AβPP(swe)/PS1(ΔE9) mice), but this change was not significant when compared to the non-transgenic control (PMID: 21157032). The transgenic AβPP(swe)/PS1(ΔE9) mouse model may differ from our wild-type aging rat model in this context.</p><p>Moreover, the calculation of cell numbers was based on visual observation under a microscope across several brain tissue slices. This traditional method often yields controversial results. For example, oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum, fornix, and spinal cord have been reported to be 20-40% more numerous in males than in females based on microscopic observations (PMID: 16452667). In contrast, another study found no significant difference in the number of oligodendrocytes between sexes when using immunohistochemistry staining (PMID: 18709647). Such discrepancies arising from traditional observational methods are inevitable.</p><p>We believe the data presented in this article are reliable because the cell number and cell ratio data were derived from high-throughput cell counting of the entire hypothalamus using single-cell suspension and droplet wrapping (10x Genomics).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A more detailed analysis of glial cell types within the hypothalamus in response to drugs should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided more enrichment analysis data of differentially expressed genes between Y, O, and O.T in microglia and astrocytes in Figure 2—figure supplement 3.

A more detailed analysis of the hypothalamus such as histological examination to assess cellular senescence markers in CRH neurons, is needed to support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We also noted the inappropriate claim and have changed &quot;senescent phenotype&quot; to &quot;stressed phenotype&quot; and &quot;abnormal phenotype&quot; in both the abstract and results sections. The stressed phenotype could be induced by heightened functional activity in the cells, potentially indicating higher cellular activity. The GnRH and CRH neurons discussed in this paper may represent such a case, as illustrated by the observed high serum GnRH, testosterone, and cortisol levels. This revision suggestion is highly valuable and constructive for our understanding of the unique physiological characteristics revealed by these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Li et al. investigated the potential anti-ageing role of 17α-Estradiol on the hypothalamus of aged rats. To achieve this, they employed a very sophisticated method for single-cell genomic analysis that allowed them to analyze effects on various groups of neurons and non-neuronal cells. They were able to sub-categorize neurons according to their capacity to produce specific neurotransmitters, receptors, or hormones. They found that 17α-Estradiol treatment led to an improvement in several factors related to metabolism and synaptic transmission by bringing the expression levels of many of the genes of these pathways closer or to the same levels as those of young rats, reversing the ageing effect. Interestingly, among all neuronal groups, the proportion of Oxytocin-expressing neurons seems to be the one most significantly changing after treatment with 17α-Estradiol, suggesting an important role of these neurons in mediating its anti-ageing effects. This was also supported by an increase in circulating levels of oxytocin. It was also found that gene expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons was significantly impacted by 17α-Estradiol even though it was not different between aged and young rats, suggesting that these neurons could be responsible for side effects related to this treatment. This article revealed some potential targets that should be further investigated in future studies regarding the role of 17α-Estradiol treatment in aged males.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Single-nucleus mRNA sequencing is a very powerful method for gene expression analysis and clustering.

Including data from young males could potentially obscure the treatment's effects in aged males due to age effects, though similar effects between young and aged animals may exist. Long-term treatment of hormone may exert more developmental effects on the young than the old. Consequently, we decided to exclude this group from our initial sample design. We apologize for this omission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Even though the technical approach is a sophisticated one, analyzing the whole rat hypothalamus instead of specific nuclei or subregions makes the study weaker.</p></disp-quote><p>The precise targets of 17α-Estradiol within the hypothalamus remain unresolved.

You may mean the claim as the senescent phenotype in Crh neuron induced by 17a-estradiol.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have changed the &quot;senescent phenotype&quot; to &quot;stressed phenotype&quot; in the abstract and results to avoid such claim. The stressed phenotype may be induced by heightened functional activity in the cells, potentially indicating higher cellular activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The study is about improving ageing but no physiological data from the study demonstrated such a claim with the exception of the testes histology which was not properly analyzed and was not even significantly different between the groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the effects of 17α-Estradiol on the endocrine system in the aging hypothalamus; exploring anti-aging effects is not the main focus. From the characteristics of the aging hypothalamus, we know that down-regulated GnRH and testosterone levels, along with elevated mTOR signaling, are indicators of aging in these organs from previous publications (PMID: 37886966, PMID: 37048056, PMID: 22884327). The contrasting signaling networks related to metabolism and synaptic processes significantly differentiate young and aging hypothalami, and 17α-Estradiol helps rebalance these networks, suggesting its potential anti-aging effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Overall, the study remains descriptive with no physiological data to demonstrate that any of the effects on hypothalamic gene expression are related to metabolic, synaptic, or other functions.</p></disp-quote><p>The study focuses on investigating cellular responses and endocrine changes in the aging hypothalamus induced by 17α-estradiol, utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and a novel data mining methodology to analyze various neuron subtypes. It is important to note that this study does not mainly aim to explore the anti-aging effects. Consequently, we have revised the claim in the abstract from “the effects of 17α-estradiol in anti-aging in neurons” to “the effects of 17α-estradiol on aging neurons.” We observed that the lower overall metabolism and increased expression levels of cellular processes in the synapses align with findings previously reported regarding 17α-estradiol. To address the lack of physiological data and the challenges in measuring multiple endocrine factors due to their volatile nature, we employed several bidirectional Mendelian analyses of various genome-wide association study (GWAS) data related to these serum endocrine factors to identify their mutual causal effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comment:</bold></p><p>Based on the Public Reviews and Recommendations for Authors, the Reviewers strongly recommend that revisions include an experimental demonstration of the physiological effects of the treatment on ageing in rats as well as the CRH-senescence link. Additional analysis of the glia would greatly strengthen the study, as would inclusion of females and young male controls. The important point was also raised that the work linking 17a-estradiol was performed in mice, and the link with lifespan in rats is not known. Discussion of this point is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback.

This point has now been noted in the Introduction. We regret that further experimental validation of the treatment's physiological effects on aging in rats was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>b) Phenotype terminology:</p><p>In response to concerns about the &quot;senescent&quot; characterization of CRH neurons, we have revised this terminology to &quot;stressed phenotype&quot; throughout the abstract and results. While we were unable to conduct additional experiments to confirm senescence markers, this revised description better reflects the heightened cellular activity observed (as evidenced by elevated serum GnRH and testosterone levels), without implying confirmed senescence.</p><p>c) Glial cell analysis:</p><p>To address questions about glial cell function during treatment, we have added new enrichment analysis data of differentially expressed genes in microglia and astrocytes from young (Y), old (O), and old treated (O.T) groups in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. This analysis reveals that microglia exhibit contrasting synaptic-related cellular processes compared to total neurons.</p><p>d) Female and young controls:</p><p>We sincerely apologize for the absence of female subjects and young male controls in the current study. The reviewers' suggestion to examine the male-specific effects of 17α-estradiol using female controls represents an excellent direction for future research, which we plan to pursue in upcoming studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>General comments:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is very hard to read.

Earlier studies suggest that 17alpha-estradiol exhibits at least 200 times less activity than 17beta-estradiol (PMID: 2249627, PMID: 16024755). However, recent data indicate that 17alpha-estradiol shows comparable genomic binding and transcriptional activation through estrogen receptor α (Esr1) to that of 17beta-estradiol (PMID: 33289482). Additionally, there is evidence that 17alpha-estradiol has anti-estrogenic effects in rats (PMID: 16042770). These findings imply possible feedback inhibition via estrogen receptors. Furthermore, 17alpha-estradiol likely differs from 17beta-estradiol due to its unique metabolic consequences and its potential to slow aging in males, an effect not attributed to 17beta-estradiol. For instance, neurons are also targets of 17alpha-estradiol, with Esr1 not being the sole target (PMID: 38776045). Intriguingly, neurons expressing Ar and Esr1 ranked among the top 20 most perturbed receptor subtypes during aging (O vs Y), but were no longer ranked in this group following treatment (O.T vs Y and O.T vs O comparisons). This indicates that 17α-estradiol administration attenuated age-associated perturbation in these neuronal subtypes, which may be a consequence of potential feedback (Figure 3D). Nevertheless, the precise effective targets of 17alpha-estradiol are still unresolved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 409: This conclusion cannot be made because the effect is not statistically significant.
