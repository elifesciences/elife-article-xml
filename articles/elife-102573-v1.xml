In 2022, one in eight people were obese worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">World Health Organisation, 2024</xref>). Body mass index (BMI) is a longstanding measure of obesity, despite its high specificity but low sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chooi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okorodudu et al., 2010</xref>). Many observational studies have found BMI associated with disease risk factors and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whitlock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kahn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Khan et al., 2018</xref>). Generally, a higher BMI is detrimental to health. However, BMI does not account well for fat distribution. For men and women with the same BMI, women tend to store more fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Power and Schulkin, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, men tend to store fat around their organs, while women are more likely to store it subcutaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Power and Schulkin, 2008</xref>), potentially leading to different health impacts by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costanzo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Power and Schulkin, 2008</xref>). As such, the effect of BMI on health may vary between men and women and may be a modifiable factor contributing to differences in lifespan by sex.</p><p>Few previous observational studies have systematically assessed the role of BMI in health and disease, and are limited by their susceptibility to confounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fewell et al., 2007</xref>). Mendelian randomization (MR) studies reduce confounding by using genetic proxies, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith and Ebrahim, 2003</xref>). Previous phenome-wide association studies using MR (MR-PheWASs) have identified impacts of sex-combined BMI on endocrine disorders, circulatory diseases, inflammatory and dermatological conditions, some biomarkers, and feelings of nervousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyppönen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Millard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Millard et al., 2015</xref>), but did not systematically use sex-specific BMI for the exposure or sex-specific outcomes. Previous MR studies and trials of incretins have expanded our knowledge about a broad range of effects of BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marso et al., 2016</xref>). To our knowledge, no sex-specific PheWAS has investigated the effects of BMI on health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyppönen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Millard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Millard et al., 2015</xref>). To address this gap, we conducted a sex-specific PheWAS, using the largest available sex-specific GWAS of BMI, to explore the impact of sex-specific BMI on sex-specific health-related attributes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data sources</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Exposure: body mass index</title><p>To obtain genetic information for BMI sex-specifically, we used BMI (inverse rank normalized) from two sources: a prospective cohort study of half a million adults from the UK Biobank, and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Locke et al., 2015</xref>), a GWAS meta-analysis of 339,224 participants mostly of European ancestry. The UK Biobank has the advantage of a larger sample size and denser genotyping but is the only large-scale sex-specific source for many outcomes. The sex-specific UK Biobank BMI GWAS conducted by Neale Lab (women: 194,174; men: 167,020) was adjusted for age, age squared, and the first 20 principal components (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/faq">https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/faq</ext-link>). The GIANT GWAS has the advantage of using a different sample from the UK Biobank but is smaller with less dense genotyping (women: 171,977; men: 152,893). The sex-specific GIANT GWAS was adjusted for age, age squared, and study-specific covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Locke et al., 2015</xref>). We also considered overall BMI from GIANT (<italic>n</italic>: 681,275) which includes the UK Biobank participants (approximately 64%), and was adjusted for age, sex, and study-specific covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yengo et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The UK Biobank is currently the largest and most comprehensive source for sex-specific GWAS, provided by Neale Lab (women: 194,174; men: 167,020), including many disease outcomes and physiological attributes. The average age at recruitment of UK Biobank participants was 57 years, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Outcomes: inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>For continuous outcomes only rank normalized health attributes with at least 1000 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verma et al., 2018</xref>) were included to maintain statistical power. For binary attributes only those with at least 200 cases were included, while duplicate phenotypes were excluded. Where GWAS of very similar attributes were provided, we only included one instance. Where an attribute has a standard measure, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s, we used that in preference to similar measures. We also excluded attributes only assessed in selected subgroups of the UK Biobank participants, such as electrocardiogram, which was only conducted in healthy people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramírez et al., 2021</xref>). Where attributes were available from both self-report and doctor diagnosis, we used self-reports. This is because comprehensive record linkage to doctor diagnoses has not yet been fully implemented for the UK Biobank, so information from doctor diagnoses may not fully represent the broader UK Biobank cohort. Finally, attributes with known measurement issues, such as estrogen and immature reticulocyte fraction, were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newman and Handelsman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piva et al., 2015</xref>).

Inverse variance weighted estimates were used initially, that is, meta-analysis of Wald estimates (SNP on outcome divided by SNP on exposure), and then sensitivity analysis (MR-Egger) was used for any associations found. The significance level was adjusted for the false discovery to account for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Specifically, we ranked the p-values for men and women, respectively, calculated the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) value, and identified the significant attributes influenced by BMI using the BH value. We obtained differences by sex using a <italic>z</italic>-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paternoster et al., 1998</xref>), which as recommended was on a linear scale for dichotomous outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rothman, 2008</xref>), then we identified which ones remained after allowing for false discovery. We used the R packages ‘TwoSampleMR’ (version: 0.6.1), ‘Mendelian Randomization’ (version: 0.10.0) for the MR analysis, and ‘metafor’ (version: 4.6-0) to assess sex differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Initial analysis using sex-specific BMI from GIANT yielded similar estimates as when using sex-specific BMI from the UK Biobank but had fewer SNPs resulting in wider confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) and fewer significant associations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

Our study adds by showing sex differences in some traits related to psychological disorders as well as ApoB and showing stronger associations in men than women for common cardiovascular diseases.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Comparison with previous studies</title><p>Consistent with previous MR studies, BMI was positively associated with the risk of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riaz et al., 2018</xref>), hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riaz et al., 2018</xref>), and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Larsson and Burgess, 2021</xref>) in both men and women as would be expected. A previous MR study found height and fat-free mass positively associated with follicular lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2024</xref>). However, we found BMI positively associated with lymphomas in men, but not in women (although directionally consistent and not significant after allowing for false discovery). Another MR study found BMI positively associated with asthma and poorer lung function, but not with hay fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skaaby et al., 2018</xref>), while we found BMI inversely associated with hay fever and allergy allergic rhinitis or eczema in men, but not in women. Previous studies have shown BMI inversely associated with sodium/potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zanetti et al., 2020</xref>), while we found BMI positively associated with urinary potassium and sodium. Additionally, we found a positive association of BMI with major surgeries. Consistent with a previous MR study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardissino et al., 2022</xref>), we found BMI positively associated with sleep apnea. We also found positive associations of BMI with daytime dozing in both sexes, which may indicate effects of BMI on quality of life. Higher BMI was also associated with a younger age at recruitment among men, suggesting poorer survival to recruitment in men than women given the UK Biobank had a short recruitment window making period effects unlikely. The association of BMI with age at recruitment was less evident in women, with no significant sex difference. Consistently, a prior observational study found high BMI more detrimental to lifespan in men than women, especially at younger ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontaine et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Differences in the associations of BMI with health-related attributes in men and women</title><p>BMI was more strongly associated with common cardiovascular diseases in men than women. BMI was positively associated with ApoB in women, whereas in men, the association was inverse (but not significant after correction for multiple comparisons). However, the sex difference was significant. This pattern contrasts with earlier MR studies that reported an inverse association of BMI with ApoB in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2022</xref>). BMI being more strongly associated with heart disease in men than women while also being protective for ApoB, a key heart disease risk factor, requires some explanation. BMI is a complex phenotype that may represent different attributes or have different consequences in men compared with women. Fat mass storage tends to differ between men and women (visceral versus subcutaneous) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Power and Schulkin, 2008</xref>). The causes of higher BMI may also differ between men and women, due to occupational roles, gender-based food preferences or cultural norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kanter and Caballero, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, unknown factors affected by BMI could contribute to heart disease specifically to men. Whether the difference in ischemic heart disease rates between men and women that emerged in the US and the UK the late 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nikiforov and Mamaev, 1998</xref>) is explained by rising BMI remains to be determined. In terms of psychological disorders, women being more affected psychologically by higher BMI is consistent with sociocultural pressures and norms surrounding women’s rather than men’s bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Esnaola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz and Brownell, 2004</xref>). We also found that BMI was associated with balding in men but not women, although the sex difference was not significant. Moreover, BMI was positively associated with facial aging in both men and women, with larger effects in men.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of this study was the focus on sex differences, which have not been explicitly explored in previous PheWAS of BMI, despite differences in lifespan by sex. We also considered false discovery for sex differences. Despite the large sample size and the broad range of outcomes considered in this study, limitations and concerns exist. First, MR has stringent assumptions, that is, relevance, independence, and exclusion restriction. The <italic>F</italic>-statistics were above 10, which addresses relevance. MR is largely free from confounding by design. For a few attributes (37 out of 1456), the MR-Egger intercept was significant while the IVW estimate was not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), potentially indicating horizontal pleiotropic effects or the play of chance, which requires further investigation. Second, MR assesses lifetime effects of BMI, which may differ from those of short-term weight changes or weight cycling. Third, not all attributes were included. For example, heart rate from electrocardiogram and age at asthma diagnosis were excluded, because such information was limited to selected subgroups. Fourth, given the study’s exploratory nature, we allowed for multiple comparisons to minimize chance findings, which means some BMI effects may not be captured. However, such comprehensive consideration may identify previously unknown or ignored impacts, such as facial aging and balding. Fifth, while the UK Biobank does not fully represent the UK population, representativeness is not crucial for causal inference as long as the sample is not selected on exposure and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenland, 2003</xref>). Sixth, focusing on a European population may limit generalizability, but it helps reduce bias from population stratification. Seventh, we excluded replicated or very similar attributes, potentially missing some attributes. However, this reduces false negatives when adjusting for multiple comparisons. Eighth, this study is open to selection bias because genetic endowment is lifelong but the UK Biobank participants are middle-aged or older, so potential recruits who did not live to recruitment because of their BMI are missing. This may bias estimates toward the null or inverse for harmful binary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>), but is less likely to affect continuous outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smit et al., 2019</xref>). Ninth, we focused on BMI, because it is well accepted and easy to measure, although waist-to-hip ratio may be a better marker for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruder, 2023</xref>). Tenth, although this study primarily utilized sex-specific BMI, we also conducted analyses using overall BMI from GIANT including the UK Biobank, which gave a generally similar interpretation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Using sex-specific BMI from the UK Biobank and GIANT may lead to lower statistical power than using overall population BMI but allows for the detection of traits that are affected differently by BMI by sex. Including findings from the overall population BMI from sex-combined GIANT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) makes the results more comparable to previous similar studies. Eleventh, our study did not find associations of BMI with some early-onset cancers possibly because early-onset cancers tend to be of germline origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qing et al., 2020</xref>). Twelfth, we used information from Neale Lab, whose quality check removed participants whose self-reported sex differed from their biological sex, so our findings only relate to <italic>cis</italic> men and women. Thirteenth, while overlapping samples for BMI and the outcomes pose a potential issue in the main analysis, we also replicated the analysis using sex-specific instruments for BMI independent of the UK Biobank. Results were similar, suggesting bias from overlapping samples is minimal. Consistently, overlapping samples have been shown to make most difference for relatively small samples and for MR-Egger estimates, particularly when the I<sup>2</sup><sub>GX</sub> is low, leading to confounded estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minelli et al., 2021</xref>). Lastly, we used linear MR, so we cannot exclude the possibility of a ‘J’ shaped association, however trials of incretins suggest a ‘J’ curve may be a manifestation of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilding et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Public health implications</title><p>Trials of incretins have clearly indicated many benefits of weight loss particularly for older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leiter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lincoff et al., 2023</xref>). Our study showing how BMI might increase risk of chronic diseases, reduce quality of life, and depress mental health in women, underscores the importance of addressing the obesity epidemic equitably in men and women, given differences by sex in some consequences of overweight/obesity, such as psychological disorders and lipids. Being overweight or obese is more common in men than women in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kanter and Caballero, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maruyama and Nakamura, 2018</xref>). With ongoing global economic development, the same pattern is likely to become more common. Currently, women are more likely to seek medical intervention for weight management, such as semaglutide, than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luthra, 2023</xref>). To promote population health, it is important to address the unique challenges faced by overweight men and women. Men are at higher risk of heart disease and premature death due to high BMI, so targeted public health interventions, such as sex-specific weight recommendations or guidelines, could perhaps be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our contemporary systematic examination found BMI associated with a broad range of health-related attributes. We also found significant sex differences in many traits, such as for cardiovascular diseases, underscoring the importance of addressing higher BMI in both men and women possibly as means of redressing differences in life expectancy. Ultimately, our study emphasizes the harmful effects of obesity and the importance of nuanced, sex-specific policy related to BMI to address inequities in health.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study protocol was not pre-registered.

We have revised the analysis based on your feedback and that from the two reviewers.

A comprehensive description of the revisions is provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses information from the UK Biobank and aims to investigate the role of BMI on various health outcomes, with a focus on differences by sex. They confirm the relevance of many of the well-known associations between BMI and health outcomes for males and females and suggest that associations for some endpoints may differ by sex. Overall their conclusions appear supported by the data. The significance of the observed sex variations will require confirmation and further assessment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is one of the first systematic evaluations of sex differences between BMI and health outcomes. The hypothesis that BMI may be associated with health differentially based on sex is relevant and even expected. As muscle is heavier than adipose tissue, and as men typically have more muscle than women, as a body composition measure BMI is sometimes prone to classifying even normal weight/muscular men as obese, while this measure is more lenient when used in women. Confirmation of the many well-known associations is as expected and attests to the validity of their approach. Demonstration of the possible sex differences is interesting, with this work raising the need for further study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We are grateful for the time and effort you have devoted to reviewing our manuscript. We have strengthened our paper by adding your insightful comment about the rationale for sex-specific analysis to the introduction:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Many of the statistical decisions appeared to target power at the expense of quality/accuracy. For example, they chose to use self-reported information rather than doctor diagnoses for disease outcomes for which both types of data were available.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We apologize for the lack of clarity in our original description of the phenotypes. Information about health in the UK Biobank was obtained at baseline from tests, measurements and self reports. Subsequently comprehensive data linkage to hospital admissions, death registries and cancer registries was implemented. However, data linkage to primary care data, such as doctor diagnoses, has not been comprehensively implemented for the UK Biobank, possibly for logistic reasons. Doctor diagnoses are only available for about half the cohort, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/about-our-data/health-related-outcomes-data">https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/about-our-data/health-related-outcomes-data</ext-link>). So, we used self-reported diagnoses because they are substantially more comprehensive than the doctor diagnoses. We have explained this point by making the following change to the Methods:</p><p>“Where attributes were available from both self-report and doctor diagnosis, we used self-reports. This is because comprehensive record linkage to doctor diagnoses has not yet been fully implemented for the UK Biobank, so information from doctor diagnoses may not fully represent the broader UK Biobank cohort.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Despite known problems and bias arising from the use of one sample approach, they chose to use instruments from the UK Biobank instead of those available from the independent GIANT GWAS, despite the difference in sample size being only marginally greater for UKB for the context. With the way the data is presented, it is difficult to assess the extent to which results are compatible across approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We agree completely about the issues with a one sample approach, please accept our apologies for not explaining our rationale. The sex-specific GIANT GWAS study is similar in size to the UK Biobank GWAS. However, the sex-specific GIANT GWAS is much less densely genotyped (~2,5 million variants) than the sex-specific UK Biobank GWAS (~10 million variants), so has less power, hence our use of the UK Biobank. To make this clear, we have added the number of variants in each study to the method section. Nevertheless, we also repeated analysis using sex-specific GIANT, as now given in the methods by making the following change</p><p>We amended the description in the first paragraph of the results section:</p><p>“Initial analysis using sex-specific BMI from GIANT yielded similar estimates as when using sex-specific BMI from the UK Biobank but had fewer SNPs resulting in wider confidence intervals (S Table 1) and fewer significant associations (S Table 1). Analysis using sex-combined GIANT yielded more significant associations but lacks granularity, so we presented the results obtained using sex-specific BMI from the UK Biobank.”</p><p>In the discussion we also made the following changes:</p><p>“Tenth, although this study primarily utilized sex-specific BMI, we also conducted analyses using overall BMI from GIANT including the UK Biobank, which gave a generally similar interpretation (S Table 1). Using sex-specific BMI from the UK Biobank and GIANT may lead to lower statistical power than using overall population BMI but allows for the detection of traits that are affected differently by BMI by sex. Including findings from the overall population BMI from sex-combined GIANT (S Table 1) makes the results more comparable to previous similar studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The approach to multiple testing correction appears very lenient, although the lack of accuracy in the reporting makes it difficult to know what was done exactly. The way it reads, FDR correction was done separately for men, and then for women (assuming that the duplication in tests following stratification does not affect the number of tests). In the second stage, they compared differences by sex using Z-test, apparently without accounting for multiple testing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have accounted for multiple comparisons when considering differences by sex and have made corresponding changes. Specifically, in the methods, we changed:</p><p>“We obtained differences by sex using a z-test (Paternoster et al., 1998), which as recommended was on a linear scale for dichotomous outcomes (Knol et al., 2007; Rothman, 2008), then we identified which ones remained after allowing for false discovery”</p><p>We have made the following changes to the results section:</p><p>“We found significant differences by sex in the associations of BMI with 105 health-related attributes (p-value&lt;0.05); 46 phenotypes remained after allowing for false discovery (Table 1).

We checked the paper carefully. It gives sex-specific estimates when the outcome was assessed in different ways in men and women, for example the question about number of children was asked in terms of live births in women and number of children fathered in men. In addition, for some significant findings, the authors investigated differences by sex. However, the paper did not use sex-specific BMI or sex-specific outcomes systematically. We have added this paper to our introduction and amended the text to explain the novelty of our study compared to previous studies.</p><p>“Previous phenome-wide association studies using MR (MR-PheWASs) have identified impacts of sex-combined BMI on endocrine disorders, circulatory diseases, inflammatory and dermatological conditions, some biomarkers and feelings of nervousness (Hyppönen et al., 2019; Millard et al., 2015; Millard et al. 2019), but did not systematically use sex-specific BMI for the exposure or sex-specific outcomes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I believe that the authors' claim, &quot;To our knowledge, no sex-specific PheWAS has investigated the effects of BMI on health outcomes,&quot; is not well supported.

As explained above, we have checked very carefully. There are three previous PheWAS for BMI, Hyppönen et al., 2019, Millard et al., 2015 and Millard et al. 2019. Hyppönen et al., 2019 and Millard et al., 2015 are not sex-specific. Millard et al. 2019 used sex-combined instruments, but some sex-specific outcomes, when the questions were asked sex-specifically, such as age at puberty asked as “age when periods started (menarche)” in women and “relative age of first facial hair” and “relative age voice broke” in men. When they found a factor significantly associated with BMI, they sometimes analyze it further including sex-specific analysis, but they did not do the analysis systematically for men and women with sex-specific BMI and sex-specific outcomes. We have amended the introduction to clarify this point.</p><p>“To our knowledge, no sex-specific PheWAS has investigated the effects of BMI on health outcomes (Hyppönen et al., 2019; Millard et al., 2015; Millard et al. 2009).

In lines 229-231, it is implied that the 'significance' in one gender, but not in the other is used to indicate a difference.

It may be that a systematic approach has been implemented, but please check that it is adequately and accurately described to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Please accept our apologies for being unclear. Multiple comparisons are for independent phenotypes however, here, some phenotypes cannot be independent, therefore, using multiple comparisons in men and women separately is quite strict.
