conservation in the heart. We used single ATP turnover experiments to demonstrate that a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mutation (E525K) in human beta-cardiac myosin increases the fraction of myosin heads in the SRX state (with slow ATP turnover), especially in physiological ionic strength conditions. We also utilized FRET between a C-terminal GFP tag on the myosin tail and Cy3ATP bound to the active site of the motor domain to estimate the fraction of heads in the closed, interacting-heads motif (IHM); we found a strong correlation between the IHM and SRX state. Negative stain electron microscopy and 2D class averaging of the construct demonstrated that the E525K mutation increased the fraction of molecules adopting the IHM. Overall, our results demonstrate that the E525K DCM mutation may reduce muscle force and power by stabilizing the auto-inhibited SRX state. Our studies also provide direct evidence for a correlation between the SRX biochemical state and the IHM structural state in cardiac muscle myosin. Furthermore, the E525 residue may be implicated in crucial electrostatic interactions that modulate this conserved, auto-inhibited conformation of myosin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac muscle myosin</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>super-relaxed state</kwd><kwd>interacting-heads motif</kwd><kwd>dilated cardiomyopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL127699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yengo</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL150953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yengo</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sivaramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sivaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR072036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Roger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL139883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Roger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL164560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Roger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>916818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tiwari</surname><given-names>Prince</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A dilated cardiomyopathy mutation can stabilize the auto-inhibited super-relaxed state and interacting-heads motif in human cardiac myosin, suggesting a mechanism by which disease mutations can reduce muscle force and power.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle contraction is driven by the sliding of thick and thin filaments in the muscle sarcomere. In striated muscle, contraction is regulated by both thin and thick filament mechanisms. It is well established that a rise in intracellular calcium concentration changes the conformation of the actin-containing thin filaments (thin filament regulation), allowing myosin heads in the thick filament to bind to actin and power filament sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi and Solaro, 2005</xref>). Recently, thick filament regulation has garnered much attention, as myosin heads can form an auto-inhibited or super-relaxed (SRX) state with slow ATP turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooijman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nag and Trivedi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>). Structural studies have shown that myosin heads in the thick filament can fold back on the myosin tail and interact with each other in a conformation referred to as the interacting-heads motif (IHM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alamo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zoghbi et al., 2008</xref>), which prevents them from interacting with actin. However, it is currently unclear if the SRX biochemical state and IHM structural state are directly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craig and PadrÃ³n, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The SRX state is proposed to play several important roles in cardiac muscle. It appears to play a crucial role in conserving energy, as SRX heads turn over ATP about 5â10 times slower than the uninhibited disordered relaxed (DRX) heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooijman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toepfer et al., 2020</xref>). Cardiac muscle may also use the SRX heads as a reserve that can be recruited when peripheral metabolic demands warrant-increased cardiac contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNamara et al., 2015</xref>). It has been hypothesized that regulation of the SRX state in cardiac muscle underlies the Frank-Starling mechanism, in which contractile force increases as cardiac muscle is stretched (i.e. length-dependent activation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kampourakis and Irving, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Point mutations in cardiac myosin can lead to various forms of cardiomyopathy, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) being the most common phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yotti et al., 2019</xref>). HCM most commonly presents clinically as hypertrophy of the interventricular septum, while other forms of hypertrophy are also found including concentric, midventricular, and apical. The hypertrophy results in decreased left ventricular chamber size and is accompanied by pronounced relaxation deficits, myofilament disarray, and fibrosis. Preclinical individuals have been found to display increased ejection fraction and impaired relaxation suggesting a hypercontractile phenotype occurs prior to hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagueh et al., 2003</xref>). Recent work has revealed that several HCM mutations in cardiac myosin can destabilize the SRX state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gollapudi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vander Roest et al., 2021</xref>), which may explain the impaired relaxation and hypercontractile phenotype. On the other hand, DCM presents as an increase in left ventricular chamber size which leads to thinning of the myocardium, cardiomyocyte cell death, and a hypocontractile phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McNally and Mestroni, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, early-stage DCM patients present with subtle decreases in contractility and ejection fraction, suggesting hypocontractility may trigger disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lakdawala et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schafer et al., 2017</xref>). An attractive hypothesis is that DCM mutations may stabilize the SRX state, which reduces the number of myosin heads available to produce contractile force and could explain the observed hypocontractility. However, the leading hypothesis is that DCM mutations reduce the intrinsic motor properties of myosin without altering the SRX state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robert-Paganin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ujfalusi et al., 2018</xref>), although few studies have examined the impact of DCM mutations on the SRX state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The IHM, which appears to be a conserved regulatory structure in all muscle types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alamo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), has been proposed to be the structural basis of the SRX state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craig and PadrÃ³n, 2022</xref>). The motif is found in both single myosin molecules and native thick filaments. Early studies with smooth and non-muscle myosin revealed a folded tail conformation that was proposed to be auto-inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Onishi and Wakabayashi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trybus et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trybus and Lowey, 1984</xref>). A study with smooth muscle myosin was the first to reveal the interactions between the heads that characterize the IHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wendt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendt et al., 2001</xref>) and later how the folded tail stabilizes the interacting heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>). The motif subsequently has been demonstrated in myosin II molecules across the evolutionary tree, from humans to the earliest animals (e.g. sponges; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Further biochemical studies demonstrated that the IHM is the auto-inhibited structure that predominates in the dephosphorylated off-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendt et al., 2001</xref>). Three recent cryo-EM studies of smooth muscle myosin solved the high-resolution structure of the IHM, providing crucial details about head-head and head-tail interactions that stabilize the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heissler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scarff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). The IHM was first demonstrated in native thick filaments in tarantula muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>) and then was shown to be conserved in thick filaments throughout the animal kingdom, including vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">AlKhayat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alamo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zoghbi et al., 2008</xref>). The highest resolution so far (13 Ã) has come from tarantula filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), which showed an IHM with similar features to smooth muscle myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alamo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alamo et al., 2008</xref>). However, in skeletal and cardiac myosin, the high-resolution structure of the IHM has not been solved.</p><p>In order to directly examine the correlation between the IHM and SRX state, a method that can detect the IHM in solution in addition to the fraction of molecules with slow ATP turnover is crucial. In the current study, we developed a method of detecting the IHM in solution by FRET, allowing us to directly correlate the fraction of myosin heads in the IHM with the fraction of myosin heads in the slow ATP turnover (SRX) state. In addition, we examined the impact of a DCM-associated mutation, E525K, on the formation of the IHM structural and SRX biochemical states. We found that the E525K mutation dramatically stabilizes the SRX state, monitored by single ATP turnover, as well as the IHM, monitored by FRET and confirmed by single molecule EM imaging. Our results suggest that stabilization of the off-state is a viable explanation for the decrease in muscle force and power in DCM. We also demonstrate that the IHM correlates well with the SRX state, providing evidence that the IHM is the structural basis of the SRX biochemical state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall approach and rationale</title><p>Our initial goal was to produce a human beta-cardiac myosin construct that would allow us to monitor formation of the SRX biochemical and IHM structural states in solution. Previous studies in smooth muscle myosin demonstrated that at least 15 heptads of the S2 region of myosin were required for phosphorylation-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trybus et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, we generated human beta-cardiac heavy meromyosin (HMM) with 15 heptads of S2, a leucine zipper, and a C-terminal GFP tag (M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We expressed and purified M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP using the C2C12 expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), and the myosin contained endogenous mouse skeletal muscle light chains. This is similar in composition to our published studies on S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rasicci et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Swenson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). We reasoned that if M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP forms the IHM then we should be able to observe FRET between Cy3ATP bound to the active site and the C-terminal GFP tag, thus essentially functioning as a biosensor of the IHM or closed state. We generated a model of the open and closed states of M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP and found that the predicted distance between the active site of the free head (FH) and its C-terminal GFP tag is about 90â140 Ã, assuming the GFP tags are flexibly linked to the tail, which is close enough to participate in FRET. All other donor-acceptor pairs (blocked head [BH] to either C-terminal GFP tag, FH to the BH C-terminal GFP) have distances ~130â140 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, the distance in the open state is predicted to be â¥250 Ã, which is much too far to participate in FRET. Therefore, we proposed that the FRET biosensor would be able to detect the IHM formation in solution and that the FRET distance observed would be an ensemble average of all donor acceptor pairs, which are in the range of 90â140 Ã apart in the IHM.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular models of the M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP construct in open and closed (interacting-heads motif [IHM]) states.</title><p>From proximal to distal, the model contains myosin heavy chains (orange and cyan), each with one essential light chain (white) and one regulatory light chain (yellow). Following the last residue of the 15 heptad tail (E946), the leucine zipper (PDB: 1ZIL, gray) helps to dimerize the construct and is followed by a short, flexible glycine linker (pink), and then the C-terminal GFP molecule (PDB: 1GFL, green). Distances in the figure are measured from Y66 within the tripeptide fluorophore of GFP to S180 in the ATP-binding site of the myosin motor domain. Models were constructed by joining existing pdb files in UCSF Chimera software. The open state is based on a previously published model by the Spudich lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trivedi et al., 2018</xref>), while the closed state is based on the 5TBY cardiac homology model from the PadrÃ³n lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alamo et al., 2017</xref>). In the closed state, the free head (FH) of myosin lies closer to the C-terminal GFP molecules, as compared to the blocked head (BH).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77415-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Actin-activated ATPase and in vitro motility</title><p>The WT and E525K M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP preparations were &gt;95% pure based on SDS-PAGE and similar in purity to our M2Î² S1 preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We further characterized the IHM FRET biosensor by mixing Cy3ATP (0.25â2.5 ÂµM) with M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP (0.25 ÂµM) in a stopped-flow apparatus and monitoring the quenching of the GFP fluorescence as a function of time.

In Scheme 1, we assumed the initial ATP-binding step (K<sub>T</sub>) was followed by transition into the IHM (K<sub>IHM</sub>) which was then detected by FRET. The model postulates that heavy meromyosin (HMM) can populate two conformations in the absence of nucleotide (Apo), one that is in the Open conformation and another in an Alternate (ALT) conformation. The top pathway (Fast Phase-green) represents ATP binding to the Open state followed by a favorable transition into the IHM in low salt. The lower pathway (Slow Phase-yellow) is only significantly populated at low salt and characterized by slower ATP binding to the ALT conformation and a favorable transition into the IHM. In Scheme 2, the slow phase is caused by a conformation that is incompetent to bind nucleotide (INC) and in equilibrium with the Open conformation. In both models, in the absence of nucleotide (Apo) in low-salt conditions, the E525K mutant favors the ALT or INC conformation, while WT favors the open conformation. Also, both models predict that in high-salt conditions, the rate of transition into the IHM slows for both WT and mutant, and it is unfavorable for WT but E525K still favors the IHM. Rate constants for WT are in black and E525K in red (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> for summary of rate constants).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4s3sdata1"><label>Figure 4âfigure supplement 3âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Excel files with data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-77415-fig4-figsupp3-data1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77415-fig4-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig4s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 4âfigure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>FRET transients fit to the proposed kinetic model.</title><p>The fluorescence transients from the FRET experiments are fit to the kinetic model described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>.

In the first mechanism (Scheme 1), HMM can adopt two conformations in the absence of nucleotide (Apo), one that binds ATP with a similar rate constant to S1 (referred to as Open) and another that binds ATP more slowly (referred to as alternate conformation, ALT). Once the Open conformation binds ATP (K<sub>T</sub>), it rapidly transitions into the IHM (K<sub>IHM</sub>). In this pathway, ATP binding, followed by rapid transition into the IHM, gives rise to the fast phase of the FRET transients. The alternative conformation binds ATP about 10â20-fold slower (Kâ<sub>T</sub>) and then can rapidly transition into the IHM (Kâ<sub>IHM</sub>), thus giving rise to the slow phase that is also ATP concentration dependent. In this model, FRET is observed only in the IHM. Representative fluorescence transients from experiments with WT and E525K at low- and high-salt fit reasonably well to this kinetic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Another possible mechanism is that HMM can undergo a slow isomerization between two conformations in the Apo state, an alternative conformation incompetent to bind nucleotide (INC) and an Open conformation (Scheme 2). In this model, the slow phase is caused by the slow isomerization into the Open state prior to ATP binding. This mechanism was originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geeves et al., 2000</xref> in a study on Myo1C and was since demonstrated in several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">UÅ¡aj and Henn, 2017</xref>). Both models predict the E525K mutant stabilizes an alternate or incompetent Apo conformation at low salt, which explains the higher percentage of the slow phase observed in E525K. In addition, both models predict that high-salt favors the open Apo conformation in WT and mutant, while the transition into the IHM is unfavorable for WT but favorable for E525K.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Steady-state and time-resolved FRET measurements</title><p>The stopped-flow fluorescence transients were also used to determine the FRET efficiency after performing donor only controls. Measuring a precise distance by FRET can be quite challenging and is most accurate when the distance is between 0.5 and 1.5 R<sub>0</sub> (31.5â94.5 Ã). Since we predicted our closest distance in the IHM is ~100 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we emphasize our FRET approach is best utilized for measuring the change in FRET associated with different KCl concentrations and comparing WT and E525K, while it is not appropriate for measuring precise distances. We measured the FRET efficiency (0.25 ÂµM M2Î² and 1 ÂµM Cy3ATP) as a function of KCl concentration and found that WT shifts to a lower FRET state at higher KCl concentrations, while E525K maintains a similar FRET efficiency at low and high salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then compared the measured FRET efficiencies to the expected efficiencies assuming a simplified model in which the fraction of molecules in the closed and open states directly correlates with the single turnover measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We assumed no FRET in the open state and a FRET efficiency of ~6.0% associated with a 100 Ã distance when all heads are in the IHM configuration. The expected FRET efficiencies followed a similar trend to the measured efficiencies, especially in the E525K mutant, while the largest discrepancies were observed with WT in higher salt conditions. This is likely due to the greater degree of uncertainty with the measurements at high salt, which contained the lowest FRET efficiencies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>FRET monitors stability of the closed (interacting-heads motif [IHM]) conformation.</title><p>Steady-state FRET between the C-terminal GFP tag and Cy3ATP bound to the motor domain was examined in the stopped-flow as a function of KCl concentration.

Because the IHM is easily disrupted by binding to the grid surface during specimen preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>), we examined the molecules in low-salt (20 mM KCl) conditions, which strengthen the IHM, and minimized the time of contact of protein with the grid before staining. We performed the analysis on three separate preparations. The comparison of WT and E525K for each individual replicate was performed on the same day using grids from the same batch, prepared identically (glow-discharge etc.) under the same ambient conditions of temperature and humidity. WT molecules were dominated by non-interacting heads, producing an âopenâ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, yellow circles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), with only a small number of âclosedâ (folded) IHM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, green circles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, more of the E525K molecules adopted the folded (IHM) conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, green circles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Each replicate was performed on a different day, therefore, with non-identical conditions between preps. This likely accounts for differences in numbers of molecules in open and closed configurations between preps, as we know that conformation is highly sensitive to grid surface properties. Despite the experimental ânoiseâ introduced by these factors, there was a clear and dramatic 3-4 fold increase in the number of closed conformations in E525K compared with WT, consistent with stabilization of the IHM by the mutation and with the FRET data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>).

We also used class averaging to confirm that the closed structures we observed were actually IHMs. The E525K class average shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> reveals key features of the IHM, including the BHs and FHs, the two light chains (essential light chains, ELCs, and regulatory light chains, RLCs), and sub-fragment 2 interacting with the BH, all well-documented features of the IHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>). We conclude that the raw EM images and the 2D class averages qualitatively support our ATP turnover and FRET results showing that E525K promotes the IHM and thus stabilizes the SRX state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A common mechanism of myosin II regulation is via folding of the heads back onto the tail and interaction between the motor domains, effectively inhibiting actomyosin interactions and myosin ATP turnover. In the current study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism in cardiac muscle myosin, which exists in dynamic equilibrium between the folded-back conformation (IHM) and an open conformation capable of generating force upon muscle activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A major question in the field is whether the IHM correlates with the SRX state, a biochemical state that turns over ATP 5â10-fold slower than single-headed S1. This proposed mechanism is attractive since the sequestered heads would inhibit interactions with actin, serving as a reserve to be recruited when enhanced contractile force is needed (e.g. length-dependent activation). Furthermore, sequestered heads would consume far less ATP, helping to balance the energetic demands of the heart. We present direct evidence that the fraction of myosin heads in the IHM correlates well with the fraction of myosin heads in the SRX state, providing crucial information about the structural basis of the auto-inhibited state of cardiac myosin. We also demonstrate that a dimeric cardiac myosin molecule with 15 heptads of the coiled-coil displays the SRX state and IHM structure, allowing us to examine the folded conformation with a novel IHM FRET biosensor. In addition, we report that a single point mutation associated with DCM (E525K) can dramatically stabilize both the IHM conformation and SRX state. Our work highlights the stabilization of the IHM by electrostatic interactions and the critical function of the E525 residue in the core region where electrostatic interactions between the head and tail occur. The clinical significance of this study is that a DCM mutation can stabilize the auto-inhibited state of myosin, which provides a strong rationale for studying other DCM mutants to determine if this is a common mechanism that causes the reduced muscle force and power typically observed in DCM patients.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Correlating the SRX and IHM</title><p>The current study provides new information about the structural basis of the slow ATP turnover (SRX) state. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anderson et al., 2018</xref> demonstrated a strong correlation between the IHM and SRX state using negative stain EM and single ATP turnover measurements. They also examined the drug mavacamten, which dramatically stabilizes the SRX state. Based on visual inspection of negative stained EM images, they observed a corresponding increase in the fraction of molecules that adopt the IHM in the presence of the drug. Our study used single turnover measurements, in addition to an IHM FRET biosensor, to examine the conformation of cardiac myosin in solution. The fraction of myosin heads in the SRX state determined by single turnover measurements was used to simulate the FRET results expected if the SRX state and IHM are 1â1 correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We generated FRET efficiency estimates based on the structural model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which predicts the average distance between donor-acceptor pairs in the IHM is in the range of 90â140 Ã and no FRET in the open state. The measured FRET efficiency (5.5%) observed in low-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) corresponded to a condition with nearly 90% SRX heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), which allowed us to assume an efficiency of 6.0% in the IHM for our simulations. The simulated data follows fairly closely with the measured FRET efficiencies for the mutant but diverges for WT at higher salt (â¥100 mM KCl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), likely because the fraction of myosin heads in the IHM is quite low (â¤10%) in high-salt conditions and difficult to measure by FRET. Future experiments using time-resolved FRET approaches such as TR(2)-FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gunther et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rohde et al., 2018</xref>) may allow us to determine distance distributions, distances associated with partially folded intermediates, and the rate constants for transitioning into and out of the IHM.</p><p>Another study performed single turnover measurements with a different IHM FRET biosensor in bovine cardiac myosin and found the IHM was sufficient but not required to produce the SRX state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2021</xref>). They used glutaraldehyde cross linking to stabilize the IHM and found a corresponding increase in FRET. They demonstrated that mavacamten dramatically stabilizes the SRX state but did not cause a corresponding increase in the IHM formation, suggesting that the biochemical SRX state and structural IHM are uncoupled. Importantly, their FRET approach was not sensitive to ionic strength, which is very different from our results and other previous IHM studies. Other groups also have demonstrated that myosin constructs that lack an S2 domain, such as S1 and 2HP HMM (and thus cannot form the IHM), still have a small SRX state component in single turnover measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rohde et al., 2018</xref>). Our results fit well with the hypothesis that the SRX state may not require the formation of the IHM, but the IHM certainly enhances the SRX state by stabilizing the SRX heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craig and PadrÃ³n, 2022</xref>). The fraction of SRX heads also depends on their supramolecular organization, with the SRX molecules increasing from M2Î² S1 to HMM to a thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craig and PadrÃ³n, 2022</xref>). This relationship accounts for nominal SRX ratios observed in S1 and 2HP HMM as well as the correlation between SRX and IHM in our M2Î² HMM 15HPZ.GFP biosensor. Moreover, it accounts for the high sensitivity of the SRX state to ionic strength in HMM since many of the proposed interactions in the IHM are electrostatic in nature.</p><p>In addition to using FRET to monitor IHM formation, we examined negative stain EM images of M2Î² HMM 15HPZ.GFP, both by direct visual inspection and 2D class averaging, which allowed us to systematically classify the fraction of molecules in the IHM. We found that the E525K mutant had a much higher fraction of myosin heads in the IHM compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, this fraction was significantly different in the EM images compared to the predictions from the FRET and single turnover measurements in solution. We believe this is due to molecular interactions with the EM grid surface that destabilize the IHM. This has been well documented with smooth muscle HMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>). Our similar but even more extreme finding with cardiac myosin is exactly as predicted, given the lower stability of the cardiac compared with the smooth muscle myosin IHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, we found it essential to reduce the time of contact of the cardiac construct with the grid surface to a minimum (~5 s) before adding the uranyl acetate stain, which then immediately fixes the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao and Craig, 2003</xref>). With longer contact times, almost all IHMs were lost, consistent with the smooth muscle HMM findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, a recent study that performed small angle x-ray scattering on a cardiac myosin 25 heptad construct found that alternative conformations are likely in solution, including partially folded intermediates (e.g. one head folded and one head free; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gollapudi et al., 2021</xref>). We observed many structures by 2D class averaging with different orientations of heads. However, it is difficult to distinguish between novel conformations and states that simply lie on the grid in different orientations. Overall, our work clearly demonstrates by both EM and FRET that the IHM is a major contributor to the SRX state, while our EM studies suggest that the IHM is quite dynamic and sensitive to surface interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Kinetics of IHM formation</title><p>One unanswered question is how fast various myosins can transition into and out of the IHM. Geeves and co-workers estimated the rate of transition into the IHM was at least 5 s<sup>â1</sup> in bovine cardiac myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walklate et al., 2022</xref>). In agreement, our results suggest the transition into the IHM was significantly faster than ATP binding (â¥5 s<sup>â1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our results also suggest there are two conformations of HMM in the absence of nucleotide, one that binds ATP similar to S1 (Open) and one that binds ATP about 10â20-fold slower (ALT; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We also found that high salt shifts the equilibrium toward the Open conformation in the absence of nucleotide for both WT and E525K, while only the mutant can transition efficiently into the IHM upon ATP binding. Alternatively, the data may suggest that there is an isomerization between competent and incompetent states in the absence of nucleotide, which has been proposed to explain the bi-exponential kinetics of ATP binding to myosin in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geeves et al., 2000</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, further work will be necessary to define the specific structural and kinetic pathway for transition into and out of the IHM, and current and future IHM FRET biosensors could lead the way in this important area of study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Structural mechanism of IHM and impact of E525K</title><p>Presently, there is no high-resolution structure of the cardiac myosin IHM. The work of PadrÃ³n and colleagues has created a model based on the tarantula thick filaments (5TBY) but using the human cardiac myosin sequence, which has been extremely useful for mapping potential head-head and head-tail interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alamo et al., 2017</xref>). The recent cryo-EM structures of smooth muscle myosin in the 10 S conformation provide more models of the IHM, which have some similarities and some differences compared to 5TBY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heissler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scarff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The E525K mutation was identified in a genetic study as a de novo variant of high clinical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lakdawala et al., 2012a</xref>). Previous structural analysis of cardiac myosin further implicates the mutation due to its location on a flat, broad region of myosin known as the mesa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spudich, 2015</xref>). The E525 residue is located in the lower 50 kDa region of the myosin motor domain in Helix Q of the helix-loop-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colegrave and Peckham, 2014</xref>), which is known to be crucial for actin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">VÃ¡rkuti et al., 2012</xref>). From the perspective of the myosin mesa, E525 is in the central region of the âmesa trail,â a region of the mesa shown to interact directly with S2 in formation of the IHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nag et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodhead and Craig, 2020</xref>). Electrostatic attraction between the mesa trail of the BH and S2 is believed to underlie a crucial BH/S2 priming interaction in the formation of the IHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alamo et al., 2017</xref>). Previous structural analyses indicate that the central mesa trail (rich in positively charged residues) interacts with the Ring 1 region of S2 (rich in negatively charged residues), and these complementary charged patches likely encourage formation of the IHM. Disruption of the charge distribution in the BH/S2 interaction region could cause complete elimination of the IHM, promoting myosin heads to populate the open or force-generating state, as has been proposed with many HCM mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). E525 is a negatively charged residue within the positively charged mesa trail and may function normally to repel Ring 1/mesa interactions, helping maintain the delicate balance of attractive/repulsive forces required for the precise functioning of the IHM. A charge-reversal point mutation, such as E525K, that increases the positive surface charge of the mesa trail likely would strengthen the Ring 1/mesa interaction in the BH, thus promoting the formation of the IHM. Importantly, E525, as well as many other charged residues in the mesa trail and Ring 1 of S2, is well conserved across species and myosin isoforms, suggesting a critical role for electrostatic interactions between BH/S2 in the formation of the auto-inhibitory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodhead and Craig, 2020</xref>). Without a high-resolution structure of the cardiac muscle myosin IHM, specific side chain residues in the BH/S2 interaction have not been confirmed. However, our collective data presented here coupled with previous conservation analyses indicate that E525 may be a critical residue in forming the IHM. This is further supported by our molecular modeling of the IHM, in which the introduced lysine residue at 525 of the BH is within several Angstroms of several acidic residues in the S2 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>An alternative mechanism by which a mutation can enhance the formation of the IHM is by favoring a conformation of an intermediate that precedes IHM formation (e.g. allosteric mechanism). There is little information about the allosteric mechanisms that mediate IHM formation, while several studies have proposed that the pre-power stroke conformation of the motor domain may favor IHM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alamo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robert-Paganin et al., 2018</xref>). Our single turnover measurements with E525K and WT S1 suggest that they have a similar ability to populate the SRX state in S1 (~5%), and this small fraction of SRX formation is independent of ionic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that E525K enhances the IHM and SRX state via electrostatic interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of DCM</title><p>Determining mutation-associated alterations in cardiac muscle myosin structure and function can lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inherited cardiomyopathies such as HCM and DCM. A leading hypothesis is that HCM mutations enhance myosin-associated force and power, while DCM mutations essentially do the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Debold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spudich, 2014</xref>). So far, mutations in myosin associated with HCM and DCM have been found to have diverse effects on myosin motor function, including altering ATPase activity, actin sliding velocity, duty ratio, and load dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ujfalusi et al., 2018</xref>). However, HCM mutations have been shown to cluster preferentially in the head-head and head-tail interaction interfaces, likely weakening interactions that underlie the SRX state, leading to greater availability of heads for actin interaction and thus to hypercontractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trivedi et al., 2018</xref>). The current study demonstrates that a DCM mutation can do just the opposite, dramatically stabilizing the SRX state, suggesting the possibility that other mutations may have a similar effect. A decrease in the number of available myosin heads in the thick filament would have a profound impact on contractile force and fit well with the hypocontractility hypothesis. Thus, therapeutic strategies that can destabilize the IHM and SRX state would be a logical strategy for treating DCM. However, unlike HCM, which primarily impacts sarcomeric genes, DCM is more heterogeneous and associated with a variety of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yotti et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, treating DCM with an SRX state destabilizer may be feasible regardless of the underlying genetic cause since it could accomplish the overall goal of enhancing contractility. The E525K mutant provides great insight into an energy conservation mechanism that may underlie the development of the DCM phenotype in this patient population. Moreover, our data indicate that it can serve as a model mutation to deepen our understanding of the SRX biochemical state and IHM structural state in beta-cardiac myosin.</p><p>The E525K mutation clearly stabilizes the SRX state and IHM in the M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP construct, while it enhances the actin-activated ATPase activity in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Remarkably, the mutationâs ability to stabilize the IHM through electrostatic interactions between the BH and S2 seems to dominate the effects on ATPase activity in M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP. Future studies with M2Î² E525K S1 will investigate how this mutation structurally and biochemically enhances intrinsic actin-activated ATPase activity and impacts motile function. Other future investigations will examine how this intriguing mutation alters ensemble force production, given the enhanced intrinsic ATPase activity of the motor domain but dramatically stabilized SRX/IHM state in M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP.</p><p>It is important to point out some of the limitations and alternative interpretations of the results in the current study. The M2Î² 15HPZ.GFP was examined with mouse light chains intrinsic to the C2C12 myocyte expression system, which could alter the impact of the E525K mutation. It has been suggested that full-length myosin in a thick filament environment can further stabilize the SRX state through interactions of IHMs with each other along the helical tracks of heads and with other thick filament proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craig and PadrÃ³n, 2022</xref>). Interestingly, mutations measured in purified HMM qualitatively had the same impact on the SRX state in a thick filament preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gollapudi et al., 2021</xref>). The FRET approach is a biosensor of the IHM structural state, while the open state is not visible by FRET, preventing us from directly determining the mole fraction of the IHM and open states. The FRET distances in the current approach are not in the ideal range (0.5â1.5 R<sub>0</sub>) for measuring precise distances by FRET. Finally, EM provides a snapshot of a fraction of myosin molecules, while the solution measurements (single turnover and FRET) provide information on the entire ensemble. The EM studies also have the limitation that the charge of the EM grid can influence the stability of the IHM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Summary</title><p>In summary, we examined a human cardiac myosin construct with 15 heptads in its coiled coil and used EM imaging to show that it can form the conserved, auto-inhibited conformation known as the IHM. We also used a novel IHM FRET sensor to monitor the formation of the IHM in solution and determined that it correlates well with the SRX state with slow ATP turnover. Furthermore, we discovered that a DCM charge reversal mutation (E525K) in the motor-tail interface can greatly enhance the stability of the IHM conformation and SRX state. We conclude that this elegant method of regulation, which essentially sequesters myosin heads to balance the mechanical and energetic demands of the heart, is highly sensitive to modifications that alter the electrostatic interactions important for stabilizing the auto-inhibited conformation. Thus, future studies will investigate other DCM mutations that may also stabilize the IHM and SRX state as well as determine how other physiological factors and disease states alter this important regulatory mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Cy3ATP (1 mM stock) and 2â-deoxy-ATP labeled with N-Methylanthraniloyl at the 3â-ribose position (mantATP; 10 mM stock) were purchased from Jena Biosciences.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kathleen M Ruppel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Your manuscript has been reviewed by two expert referees and examined by myself. We all found the study timely and of great potential interest. However, both referees had substantial questions that must be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Referee #2 and myself were concerned about the low activity and poor quality of the movement of the 15 heptad construct. To rule out a substantial population of dead myosins, you should examine the high salt ATPase activity (K<sup>+</sup>ATPase). In addition, this reviewer also felt that you should do some characterization of the S1 construct bearing the mutation. Reviewer #1 felt that you did not deal sufficiently well with three published papers (Anderson 2018, Rohde 2018 and Chu 2021). All of us were concerned that the different techniques reported different ratios of SRX:DRX states (assuming that these correspond to the folded:unfolded conformations). I had a concern about Figure 4. I presume that the molecules are in the open conformation before the addition of the Cy3ATP. Given the magnitude of the highest rate constants that are measured in Figure 4 at 2.5 Î¼m Cy3ATP, the folding must be fast if the data in E and F are reporting the rate of Cy3ATP binding and not the rate of folding. Again, fits, residuals and more information on the replications, etc are merited here. For example, what [Cy3ATP] was used in A and B? It must be the lowest values used looking at the amplitudes in A compared to the range of amplitudes in the higher nucleotide concentration ranges. What do the traces look like at high nucleotide where the rates should be much faster?</p><p>I am also appending the two reviews verbatim since each referee has numerous points for you to address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are no fluorescence spectra showing energy transfer.</p><p>2. It would be helpful to provide expected FRET distances for this pair.</p><p>3. In all cases where single and bi-exponentials are used it would be good to see the fits and residuals (supplementary would be fine).</p><p>4. Figure 4: I was very confused about what this assay was telling us, the fact you see a slower second-order binding constant would imply that the molecules are in the SRX/DRX combinations before nucleotide is applied, which would suggest that nucleotide-free myosin is in the IHM state. To my knowledge, IHM is stabilized by ADP.Pi and wouldn't exist without nucleotide. If the argument is that the signal follows the folding then that should occur at the rate constant for hydrolysis.</p><p>In addition, please explain why amplitudes of the whole combined transients are plotted instead of the individual processes. My thoughts would be that the two separate processes could have different affinities and therefore they should be plotted separately. Also, how well can the slow rate constants be determined with only a 30s acquisition? What are the errors and how many repeats have been made for these observations? These error values should be in the figure legend.</p><p>5. The discussion on using FRET (page 6 second to the last paragraph) was confusing (for me). The fluorescence lifetimes measured were stated to not have consistency, but then these values were used in Figure 5D to claim E525K was more folded than WT at higher salt. I wondered if the two lifetimes could actually represent the dynamics of an SRX-DRX transition? How would that pan out on the timescale of the experiment performed?

Last section before the summary and future directions: Surely the fact that nearly 100% of HMM forms SRX at 20 mM KCl should suggest that the signal there represents a fully IHM molecule if the hypothesis is correct. The use of mava would also help here, mava is known to both slow down the ATPase and also allow the formation of IHM. There are conditions, where mava will push nearly everything into the SRX, if you don't see further formation of the FRET sensed IHM then that would suggest this isn't a great IHM sensor. Following the work of Anderson would really help here. They saw approx. 50% SRX without mava that went up to 100% at 25 mM Kac.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The author's claim that E525K myosin has a lower kcat value is based on ATPase data from 15-<italic>hep</italic> constructs which have unusually low activity and extremely high KATPase values (higher than the highest actin concentration used to generate these curves for WT protein). These not only raise doubts about the quality of the protein but will also result in erroneous extrapolated values. The authors should ideally use the S1 constructs to compare kcat values, they already have the viruses for those proteins. The authors should also provide gel images of the purified 15 <italic>hep</italic> proteins showing the three polypeptide chains.</p><p>2. It is not clear, and the authors do not discuss, what the fast and slow phases in the Cy3ATP-binding experiments correspond to. WT and E525K proteins have dramatically different proportions (65% vs. 25% of Afast respectively) of the two phases at low salt- a condition where they have similar SRX (STO assays) and IHM (FRET efficiency) proportions. What is the salt dependence of the rates and proportions of these two phases for WT and E525K proteins? It may help the authors to speculate about the origin of these two phases. It appears from panel 4B that these rates are different for E525K at low vs. high salt, but the authors don't comment on that.</p><p>3. The authors should discuss the limitation in the revised manuscript that the R0 value of the FRET pair used here doesn't allow precise measurement of the distances being probed here to be made and refrain from converting FRET efficiency values to distances.</p><p>4. While it is great that the FRET efficiency values calculated from TR-FRET analysis agree well with the values obtained from Cy3ATP binding experiments at low and high salt, it is not ideal to generate a salt-dependence of the FRET efficiency from TR-FRET experiments from just two data-points as shown in Figure 5D. It may be better to present that data as a comparison within 5A itself without drawing a line through them.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dilated cardiomyopathy mutation E525K in human Î²-cardiac myosin stabilizes the interacting heads motif and super-relaxed state of myosin&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The main concern deals with the idea of 2 different apo-state 15HPZ populations ('open' and 'alt') that differ with respect to their ATP binding affinity. There are some cases in the myosin literature where two exponential nucleotide binding transients have been detected for various myosins, and often the idea of a slow equilibrium between a competent and an incompetent conformation of the myosins has been proposed as opposed to two static populations with inherently different binding rates (See Geeves et al. JBC 275:21624, 2000 for example). Have you considered this? The other concern is that ATP binding to apo-Î²-cardiac HMM has been reported in the literature to be fit to a single exponential using different experimental set-ups/detection methods:</p><p>a.

We demonstrate, surprisingly, that this mutation enhances actin-activated ATPase activity by increasing the k<sub>cat</sub> and reducing the K<sub>ATPase</sub>. We feel the E525K S1 results are extremely interesting since they demonstrate that the mutation is capable of stabilizing the SRX state even though the motor domain has enhanced intrinsic ATPase activity (see discussion on page 10). We did not perform in vitro motility with the E525K S1 construct since we felt this was another question that is tangential to the main focus of the current paper. Mainly, the question of how E525K specifically alters the intrinsic motor and ATPase activity will be reported in a separate paper that can provide mechanistic details on how the mutation alters myosin motor domain function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 felt that you did not deal sufficiently well with three published papers (Anderson 2018, Rohde 2018 and Chu 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>We have enhanced our discussion of the Anderson, Rohde, and Chu papers in the discussion (see page 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All of us were concerned that the different techniques reported different ratios of SRX:DRX states (assuming that these correspond to the folded:unfolded conformations).</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the single turnover and IHM FRET are fairly consistent in terms of the KCl dependance of the SRX:DRX and IHM:Open ratios (pages 4-6 and Figures 3&amp;5). We agree that the EM, although it follows the same trend as the single turnover and FRET, has quite different fractions in the IHM than we observe in solution. We have discussed that this is likely caused by the interaction of the HMM with the EM grid surface, which disrupts the IHM conformation (see pages 6-7). To further address the question of the degree of variability in the EM experiments we have compared three separate preparations and examined the fractional amounts of IHM and open conformations in the WT and mutant (pages 6-7, Figure 6). We suggest surface interactions are known to affect protein conformation and are common in approaches that require attaching a protein to a surface (e.g. EM, AFM). We attempted to minimize these effects by minimizing the contact time of HMM with the grid before staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I had a concern about Figure 4. I presume that the molecules are in the open conformation before the addition of the Cy3ATP. Given the magnitude of the highest rate constants that are measured in Figure 4 at 2.5 Î¼m Cy3ATP, the folding must be fast if the data in E and F are reporting the rate of Cy3ATP binding and not the rate of folding. Again, fits, residuals and more information on the replications, etc are merited here. For example, what [Cy3ATP] was used in A and B? It must be the lowest values used looking at the amplitudes in A compared to the range of amplitudes in the higher nucleotide concentration ranges. What do the traces look like at high nucleotide where the rates should be much faster?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail to Figure 4. We now include the residuals of the fits in panels A and B. We added the concentration of Cy3ATP (1 ÂµM) and M2Î² (0.25 ÂµM) to the figure legend. We updated panels A and B by labelling the y-axis to fluorescence, instead of normalized fluorescence. We believe this generated confusion in the previous figure when comparing the y-axis in panels A and B with amplitudes in panels C and D. We did use 1 ÂµM Cy3ATP final for these experiments which is a concentration that achieved saturation of the FRET amplitude (see panels C and D).</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we enhanced the discussion of the Cy3ATP binding rate constants (page 5 and Figure 4âfigure supplements 3 and 4). We agree that the folding into the IHM is relatively rapid following Cy3ATP binding. We have fit the fluorescence transients to a kinetic scheme in which ATP binding is followed by a transition into the IHM, which is rate-limited by the rate of ATP binding under the conditions of our experiments. We also find that since both the fast phase and the slow phase are dependent on ATP concentration, our data fits best to two conformations of myosin in the absence of nucleotide. We propose that one conformation is the open conformation, which binds ATP similar to single headed S1, and the second conformation is an alternative conformation that binds ATP more slowly. We speculate that the alternative conformation could be the IHM or another conformation of the motor domain, however further study is necessary to examine this question (see Discussion page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Figure 4: I was very confused about what this assay was telling us, the fact you see a slower second-order binding constant would imply that the molecules are in the SRX/DRX combinations before nucleotide is applied, which would suggest that nucleotide-free myosin is in the IHM state. To my knowledge, IHM is stabilized by ADP.Pi and wouldn't exist without nucleotide. If the argument is that the signal follows the folding then that should occur at the rate constant for hydrolysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model suggests there are two conformations of nucleotide-free HMM before mixing with Cy3ATP, which gives rise to the fast and slow ATP concentration-dependent rate constants. We suggest the fast rate constant, which is similar to S1, is the open state and the slow component is an alternate conformation. Our model also suggests that the folding occurs fast relative to the ATP binding step. It is true that the alternate conformation could be the IHM even though previous work predicts that the IHM would only form after ATP binding and hydrolysis. Therefore, we suggest further study is necessary to examine the possibility that the IHM may form in nucleotide-free conditions (see pages 5, 8-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, please explain why amplitudes of the whole combined transients are plotted instead of the individual processes. My thoughts would be that the two separate processes could have different affinities and therefore they should be plotted separately. Also, how well can the slow rate constants be determined with only a 30s acquisition? What are the errors and how many repeats have been made for these observations? These error values should be in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>The amplitudes of the slow and fast components were combined to obtain the overall formation of the IHM conformation in low and high salt conditions. We feel total amplitude is the most informative in comparing the low and high salt conditions. We now also report the amplitudes of both phases in low salt and high salt conditions (see Figure 4âfigure supplement 2). We added that each data point represents 3 repetitions from 1 preparation and the errors represent standard error of the fit. A summary of the rate constants and errors is given in Table 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The discussion on using FRET (page 6 second to the last paragraph) was confusing (for me). The fluorescence lifetimes measured were stated to not have consistency, but then these values were used in Figure 5D to claim E525K was more folded than WT at higher salt. I wondered if the two lifetimes could actually represent the dynamics of an SRX-DRX transition? How would that pan out on the timescale of the experiment performed? How long were the samples incubated before measurement? And therefore, how much ATP was hydrolyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the confusing statement about consistent differences in the short and long components of the lifetime decay, since this comment is relevant to distance distribution analysis which was not performed in this study. The myosin samples were equilibrated in the appropriate buffer conditions for 10 minutes on ice, incubated with Cy3ATP for one minute at roomÂ temperature, and measured by TCSPC. The TCSPC measurements were performed within a 30-45 second period (see Methods, page 13). We estimate that most of the myosin would be in the ADP.Pi state during the measurements.</p><p>Since the lifetimes are on a nanosecond timescale any structural changes on the millisecond and microsecond timescale can be observed by performing transient time resolved FRET (TR2-FRET), which requires specialized instrumentation. In the equilibrium experiments performed in this study we assume there is a distribution of open and IHM structural states and our results will be an ensemble average of the structural states populated in solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We updated Figure 6 (pages 6-7) to demonstrate the similar trend in the data in all 3 preparations, in terms of the folded versus unfolded conformations detected. The absolute fraction of HMM molecules in the folded/unfolded states did vary from prep to prep, which we believe is due to variations in surface interactions with the EM grid from one experiment to the next. However, the ratio of folded WT/folded E525K was similar in each prep which we feel is the best comparison to make. We found a consistent 4-fold increase in the number of folded molecules in the mutant compared to the WT 15HPZ.GFP (Figure 6 and Table 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

We hypothesize that both WT and E525K are mostly fully open in the Apo state at high salt. Upon ATP binding WT does not favorably transition into the IHM while E525K is still capable of making this transition (see revised section of the Results â page 5-6). Also, we revised the following sentence in the Discussion to clarify this point âWe also found that high salt shifts the equilibrium toward the Open conformation in the absence of nucleotide for both WT and E525K, while only the mutant can transition efficiently into the IHM upon ATP bindingâ. Also, in the discussion we removed the reference to the suggestion that the alternate or incompetent state could be the IHM (see Discussion â page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these literature results, we think it is reasonable to ask that you examine the binding of Cy3ATP to the myosin constructs directly to complement the FRET experiments.

We found that the fluorescence transients were best fit to a three-exponential function, with two phases that are dependent on Cy3ATP concentration and a third phase that is independent. The third nucleotide-independent slow phase could be an isomerization of the Cy3 fluorophore in the active site. The two different Cy3ATP isoforms have been shown to have distinct fluorescence signatures, which can complicate interpretations of the fluorescence transients of the mixed isomer (Oiwa et al. 2003, Biophys J. 84: 634-642). Since we are monitoring FRET by donor quenching (GFP) the slow phases in the Cy3 fluorescence does not contribute to the FRET signal. Overall, we do observe two rate constants that are linearly dependent on Cy3ATP concentration as we do in the FRET studies.</p><p>The direct binding results are in agreement with our model that suggests there are two static states with different ATP binding kinetics. However, after looking more closely at the Geeves model, we conclude that the direct binding data does not rule out the possibility that there are two states in the absence of nucleotide that are in equilibrium, one that is competent to bind nucleotide and another incompetent. At this range of Cy3ATP concentrations (0.25-2.5 ÂµM) the Geeves model would likely observe two rates that are linearly dependent on Cy3ATP concentration . Therefore, we are in favor of not including the direct Cy3ATP binding measurements because they do not provide additional evidence about the kinetic mechanism. Also, the results are a distraction from the main theme of the paper which is focused on the correlation between the SRX and IHM states and the impact of the E525K mutation. In order to explain the direct binding results it would require significant space and an additional supplementary Figure. Also, there is the issue of the 3rd exponential that is not defined.</p><p>Therefore, we have revised the paragraph in the Results (page 5-6) and in the Discussion (see page 9) to discuss the other possible kinetic mechanism (competent vs incompetent states in equilibrium). We include diagrams of both models in the supplemental data for clarity (see Figure 4âfigure supplement 3).</p></body></sub-article></article>
