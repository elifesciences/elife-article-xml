Accordingly, many bacteria are equipped with active chromosome and plasmid partition systems belonging to the ParABS family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter and Funnell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lutkenhaus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>). Basic ParABS systems comprise two proteins, ParA and ParB, and a centromere-like, cis-acting DNA element called <italic>parS</italic>. The ParA proteins of this family are ATPases with a characteristic deviant Walker-A motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Motallebi-Veshareh et al., 1990</xref>) and bind non-specific DNA (nsDNA) in an ATP-dependent manner by forming a DNA binding-competent dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davey and Funnell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leonard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, ParA proteins localize to the bacterial chromosome (the nucleoid) <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebersbach and Gerdes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hatano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>ParB is typically a dimeric sequence-specific DNA binding protein that binds tightly to the <italic>parS</italic> consensus sequences that mark the DNA cargo to be partitioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mori et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pillet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Most ParABS systems have multiple copies of a ParB dimer binding consensus sequence that collectively constitute a <italic>parS</italic> site. F-plasmid has a <italic>parS</italic> sequence cluster (<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, also called <italic>sopC</italic>) composed of 12 repeats of a 16 bp consensus sequence, each separated by 27 base-pair spacer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Helsberg and Eichenlaub, 1986</xref>). The ParBs of known chromosomal and plasmid Par systems such as P1 and F bind to <italic>parS via</italic> a helix-turn-helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schumacher and Funnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schumacher et al., 2010</xref>). These HTH–ParB proteins also associate with several kilobases of DNA surrounding a <italic>parS</italic> site <italic>in vivo</italic> in a proximity-dependent manner without obvious sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). This activity, known as ParB spreading, is believed to be essential for proper function of these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2014</xref>) and results in the formation of a large nucleo-protein complex (the partition complex) around the <italic>parS</italic> site on the DNA to be partitioned. Mutations in the <italic>B. subtilis parB</italic> gene blocking spreading and causing partition deficiency have been identified within the Box II region (GXRR) of the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2014</xref>), a highly conserved motif among HTH–ParB homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamaichi and Niki, 2000</xref>). Recently, several groups reported that HTH–ParB proteins have CTPase activity and the Box II residues play key roles in CTP binding and hydrolysis, suggesting that ParB spreading is driven by an active process dependent on energy derived from CTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>ParB interacts with ParA <italic>via</italic> its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ravin et al., 2003</xref>) and activates nsDNA-bound ParA dimer’s ATPase, releasing it from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ah-Seng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scholefield et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watanabe et al., 1992</xref>). In the absence of ParB stimulation, the ATP turnover of ParA is low, typically around one ATP per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ah-Seng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scholefield et al., 2011</xref>). Because of this slow basal ATPase rate, and since the majority of cellular ParB molecules is concentrated at the partition complexes due to ParB spreading, ATP hydrolysis by ParA and dissociation from the nucleoid is expected to occur principally in the vicinity of partition complexes. Biochemical studies of P1 ParA ATPase showed a significant time delay before activation of ParA for DNA binding after ATP binding, predicting a significant free bulk-diffusion period for ParA before reactivation for nsDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). This, along with <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hatano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ringgaard et al., 2009</xref>), led to a prediction that the nucleoid proximal to a partition complex would become depleted of ParA (the ParA depletion zone) and the proposal of a diffusion-ratchet model for plasmid segregation by the ParABS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The diffusion-ratchet model is based on the premise that the nucleoid-bound ParA-ATPase activation by plasmid-bound ParB generates a local ParA depletion zone on the nucleoid, forming a nucleoid-bound ParA concentration gradient around the partition complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). The interaction of plasmid-bound ParB with the ParA gradient on the nucleoid results in a cargo position-dependent free-energy difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara and Kaneko, 2011</xref>). Binding of ParB to ParA reduces the system free-energy, therefore moving the cargo to a higher ParA concentration lowers the system free-energy. This cargo position-dependent free-energy difference translates to a directional motive force on the ParB bound cargo. The generation of sufficient cargo motive force to overcome thermal diffusion was demonstrated in cell-free reconstitution experiments showing that a bead coated with <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA is driven across an nsDNA-coated flow cell surface in the presence of ParA<sub>F</sub>, ParB<sub>F</sub>, and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>). In some <italic>in vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging experiments, ParA has been observed to undergo pole-to-pole oscillations along the length of a nucleoid with a partition complex chasing the receding edge of a ParA distribution zone on the nucleoid, further supporting the diffusion-ratchet model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hatano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ringgaard et al., 2009</xref>). Variations of this model have also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Gall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McLeod et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Generating persistent directional motion by the diffusion-ratchet model requires a balance between the ParA–ParB association/dissociation dynamics prior to ATP hydrolysis and the steps and kinetic parameters that govern ATP hydrolysis. For example, if every ParA–ParB association resulted in instantaneous ATP hydrolysis and dissolution of the ParA–ParB bonds linking the partition complex (cargo) and the nucleoid, no cargo driving force would result. Conversely, if each bond persisted too long, the cargo would remain immobile on the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the detailed biochemical reaction steps leading to ParB activation of DNA-bound ParA-ATPase and the subsequent release of ParA have not been determined.</p><p>In order to advance our quantitative understanding of the ParABS system mechanism, we investigated the assembly and disassembly kinetics of ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> complexes that form prior to ATP hydrolysis using F-plasmid ParA<sub>F</sub>B<sub>F</sub>S<sub>F</sub> (also called SopA/B/C) as a model system. Employing a TIRF microscopy-based nsDNA-carpet assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vecchiarelli et al., 2013</xref>), we first examined the stoichiometry of the nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> complexes that accumulate in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. We investigated impacts of different ParB<sub>F</sub>-cofactors (<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> and CTP) or ParB<sub>F</sub> mutations that hinder ParB<sub>F</sub> dimerization, <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-binding, CTPase activity, or ParA<sub>F</sub> ATPase activation. We then studied how the same set of cofactors or ParB<sub>F</sub> mutations influenced ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATPase activation by ParB<sub>F</sub>. Our results showed that ParB<sub>F</sub> formed complexes with nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> in which both ParB<sub>F</sub>-interacting faces of the ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers were occupied by the N-terminal ParA<sub>F</sub>-activation domain of ParB<sub>F</sub>. All such complexes observed in the presence of ATPγS exhibited similar, slow dissociation kinetics from nsDNA compared to ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers in the absence of ParB<sub>F</sub> so long as both ParB<sub>F</sub>-interacting faces of the ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers were occupied by ParB<sub>F</sub> N-terminal domains. Binding of ParB<sub>F</sub> N-terminal domains at both ParB<sub>F</sub> interaction faces is also necessary for efficient ATPase activation of nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers. Strikingly, the ParB<sub>F</sub> cofactors, CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, acted synergistically to accelerate the assembly of pre-ATP hydrolysis ParB<sub>F</sub>–ParA<sub>F</sub> complexes on nsDNA. In addition, a magnetic tweezers-based DNA condensation assay revealed that stable DNA condensation by ParB<sub>F</sub> required both CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub>.</italic> These observations suggested that CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> promote both ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> and ParB<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> interactions. The compaction of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA by ParB<sub>F</sub> in the presence of CTP recapitulated the salient features of the condensed ParB spreading partition complex observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that ParB<sub>F</sub> in the presence of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> and CTP closely reflects the functional state of ParB<sub>F</sub> in the partition complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, ParB<sub>F</sub> in these conditions accelerated ATP turnover by the nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> no more than twofold compared to ParB<sub>F</sub> without <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> and CTP, to a modest ~80 h<sup>−1</sup>. These findings have important implications for the diffusion-ratchet model of F-plasmid partition by the ParAB<italic>S</italic> system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here, we investigated the ParA–ParB interactions that lead to accelerated ATP hydrolysis by ParA and how they are impacted by <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> and CTP. First, we addressed the nature of nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> complexes. In the presence of ATP, ParA<sub>F</sub> forms DNA binding-competent dimers and binds the nsDNA-carpet without ParB<sub>F</sub>. Upon forming a complex with ParB<sub>F</sub>, ParA<sub>F</sub> becomes activated for ATP hydrolysis and the complex rapidly disassembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vecchiarelli et al., 2013</xref>), impeding characterization of the complex. Therefore, we studied DNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> complexes that accumulate prior to ATP hydrolysis by using non-hydrolysable ATPγS. ParA<sub>F</sub> is not expected to form DNA binding competent dimers efficiently in the presence of ATPγS based on the study of the closely related ParA<sub>P1</sub> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). However, we found ParB<sub>F</sub> promotes conversion of ParA<sub>F</sub> to a DNA binding competent state in the presence of ATPγS (see below). Hence, in this study, we infused ParA<sub>F</sub>-eGFP and ParB<sub>F</sub>-Alexa647, or other fluorescent-labeled ParB<sub>F</sub> variants, preincubated at room temperature for 10 min with ATPγS into an nsDNA-carpeted flow cell and quantified the densities of the two DNA-associated proteins by imaging the flow cell surface with TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). ParA<sub>F</sub> alone at the concentration used here (1 μM, all protein concentrations are expressed as monomer concentrations) does not efficiently bind DNA in the presence of ATPγS as expected, and only low-level steady state density (less than ~200 monomers per μm<sup>2</sup>) of ParA<sub>F</sub>-eGFP was detected on the DNA-carpet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The observed DNA dissociation rate constant of ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATPγS (~6 min<sup>−1</sup>) is similar to that of ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATP estimated by FRAP or by washing the flow-cell with nsDNA-containing buffer (~4.5–6 min<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vecchiarelli et al., 2013</xref>). ParB<sub>F</sub>-Alexa647 (2 μM) did not bind the DNA-carpet to a significant level in the 300 mM K-glutamate buffer used in this experiment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of flow cell setup for visualizing the binding and dissociation of fluorescent proteins on DNA-carpet.</title><p>ParA<sub>F</sub>-eGFP and ParB<sub>F</sub>-Alexa647 proteins were flowed over a dense carpet of nsDNA attached to the supported lipid bilayer coated surface of a flow cell.

A laminar boundary separates the two solutions downstream of the flow convergence point at the Y-junction. At the midpoint across the flow channel, downstream but close to the flow convergence point where the observations are made, the DNA-carpet area is exposed to the syringe content of the higher infusion rate. When the infusion rates of the two syringes are switched, the laminar boundary moves across the observation area and the solution flowing over the area switches. By switching the infusion rates of the two syringes repeatedly, multiple DNA-carpet-bound protein complex assembly and wash cycles can be recorded.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65651-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Monomeric ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup>-mCherry can activate ParA<sub>F</sub> for nsDNA binding in the presence of ATPγS by forming a ~1:1 complex.</title><p>Protein sample solution in the presence of ATPγS (1 mM) was infused into nsDNA-carpeted flow cell at a constant flow to monitor the protein binding to the nsDNA, and the sample solution was switched to a wash buffer containing ATPγS to monitor protein dissociation from nsDNA.

ParB<sub>F</sub> at various concentrations was infused into a flow cell containing ~5 kbp DNA tethers that anchored magnetic beads to the coverslip surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The tethers contained either 12 <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> consensus sequence repeats at their midpoints (<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-DNA), or no <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> sequence (nsDNA). The protein sample was infused while the DNA tethers were stretched at 5 pN force, preventing DNA condensation. To allow DNA condensation by bound ParB<sub>F</sub> molecules, the force was dropped to 0.05 pN and the tether extension was monitored for 30 s. To assess the stability of DNA condensation by ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers, tether extension was monitored after increasing the force to 5 pN. In the absence of CTP, we only observed condensation at very high concentrations of ParB<sub>F</sub> (&gt;5 µM) and did not see a significant difference between <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing and non-specific tethers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> inset). However, in the presence of CTP, 50 nM ParB<sub>F</sub> robustly condensed <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA tethers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> purple). These condensed protein-DNA complexes resisted 5 pN extension force, requiring many minutes at 5 pN tension to de-condense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The slow de-condensation took place through a series of abrupt steps, which we interpret as stepwise opening of large DNA loops held by multiple ParB<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Condensation was comparable for DNA molecules that were topologically constrained, i.e., could be supercoiled, or unconstrained (nicked), suggesting that condensation is not a consequence of topological changes in the DNA caused by ParB<sub>F</sub> translocating away from <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed some condensation events with <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> containing tethers in the presence of CDP, but these events were rarer, required higher ParB<sub>F</sub> concentrations, and were almost completely de-condensed within 5 s of raising the force to 5 pN, in stark contrast to condensation in the presence of CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, light blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since this experiment was also carried out using CDP that contained a compound hydrolysable by ParB<sub>F</sub>, contribution of this compound to the limited tether condensation cannot be ruled out. In contrast, ParB<sub>F</sub> was unable to substantially condense DNA tethers lacking <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> sequences, even in the presence of CTP, and rare condensation events were quickly reversed by the application of 5 pN force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, dark blue). Addition of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA fragments together with ParB<sub>F</sub> and CTP did not rescue the inability to condense tethers lacking <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, indicating that <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> cannot act <italic>in trans</italic> to promote ParB spreading and condensation of DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Our results indicate that both ParB<sub>F</sub> binding faces of the nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers must be occupied by a ParB<sub>F</sub> N-terminal domain for ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>).

However, most ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers in partition complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> are likely in the CTP- and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated state, spreading over a <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-proximal DNA region. CTP or <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> binding alters the ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer structure to prevent a single ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer from providing both copies of the N-terminal domain to occupy both binding faces of a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer, necessitating two ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers, each providing one N-terminal domain to a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>, bottom).

This energy barrier partially decouples ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> association–dissociation dynamics from ATP hydrolysis, which triggers ParA<sub>F</sub> dissociation from the nucleoid.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65651-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The clearest indication that both ParB<sub>F</sub>-interacting faces of the nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer must be occupied by the N-terminal domain of ParB<sub>F</sub> for ATPase activation came from experiments using artificial ParB<sub>F</sub> constructs. We showed that monomeric ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup> stimulates ParA<sub>F</sub> ATPase with a clear sigmoidal concentration dependence, indicating that one molecule of ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup> binding to one side of a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer cannot fully activate the ParA<sub>F</sub> ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When ATP hydrolysis was blocked by using non-hydrolysable ATPγS, ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup>-mCherry formed an equimolar complex with ParA<sub>F</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Thus, the ParA<sub>F</sub> forms a complex with ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup>-mCherry bound at both ParB<sub>F</sub>-interacting faces of the ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer prior to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; top). Consistently, an artificially dimeric ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup> construct, ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup>-mCherry-EcoRI<sup>E111Q</sup>, efficiently activated ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATPase with hyperbolic concentration dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of CTP or <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, the ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer is held together by the C-terminal self-dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom) with dimerization <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of ~19 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this state, the N-terminal halves of the monomers are thought to be separate from each other according to the SAXS envelope of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, one dimer could straddle a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer with each N-terminal ParA<sub>F</sub>-interaction domain interacting with one of the two faces of a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, middle).</p><p>In contrast, when bound by CTP the CTPase domains in a ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer fold to form a single globular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The two ParA<sub>F</sub>-interaction domains emanating from this dimeric domain are unlikely to reach both sides of a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer, necessitating an A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex for ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom). In theory, it is possible that a chain of (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> might form, but the 1:2 protein stoichiometry observed in the presence of ATPγS indicates such a configuration is unfavored. A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complexes formed in the presence of CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA fragments contained almost no <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that after binding <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, CTP-ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers convert to a low <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-affinity state while remaining topologically bound to the DNA and spreading to surrounding DNA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). The A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex formed in the presence of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA fragments, even without CTP, contained significantly less than a stoichiometric amount of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that association with nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer lowers the affinity of ParB<sub>F</sub> for <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, perhaps shifting the structure closer toward <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated ParB<sub>F</sub>-CTP.</p><p>The ParB:ParA stoichiometry change from 1:1 to 2:1 caused by <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) did not occur with the Box II mutant ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>R121A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is possible that when a ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer binds <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, the adjacent CTPase domains of the two monomers adopt a mutually interacting folded state akin to the CTP-bound state even without CTP, promoting a Box II dependent dimerized domain structure. This may disfavor formation of the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex, favoring the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex that was observed.</p><p>All the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complexes we observed in the presence of ATPγS dissociated from nsDNA more slowly (k<sub>off</sub> = 0.5–1 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) compared to ParA<sub>F</sub> in the absence of ParB<sub>F</sub> (~6 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For the case of monomeric ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup>, which dissociated from ParA<sub>F</sub> more rapidly, the presence of 10 μM ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup> in the wash buffer restored the low apparent nsDNA dissociation rate constant of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Nevertheless, ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers in these complexes appear to be primed for further conformational change toward less stably DNA-associated state. Upon dissociation of ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup> from the A<sub>2</sub>B<sup>1-42</sup><sub>2</sub> complex, ParA<sub>F</sub> dissociated from the DNA-carpet within a second or so, much faster than the ATPγS-ParA<sub>F</sub>-dimer that has not yet formed a A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> or A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>).</p><p>Our single-molecule DNA condensation measurements indicate that CTP-bound ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers are activated by contacting <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> to load <italic>in cis</italic> onto the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-carrying DNA in numbers exceeding the copy number of the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-consensus sequence (ParB spreading) as shown by others for chromosomal ParBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), and condense the DNA forming an <italic>in vivo</italic> partition complex-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although the magnetic tweezers instrument used in this study did not allow direct measurement of the number of ParB<sub>F</sub> molecules contained in the condensed DNA, the large number of de-condensation steps observed when high tension was applied is consistent with the presence of a large number of ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers in the condensed DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). CDP failed to support efficient condensation of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-carrying DNA by ParB<sub>F</sub> and the limited condensation observed, which could be due to the contaminating material in the CDP used, was disrupted far more readily than CTP-supported condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our results show that DNA-condensation is caused by ParB<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> interactions forming DNA-looping bridges without requiring other protein factors. Combined with evidence indicating that <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated ParB<sub>F</sub>–CTP adopts a unique conformational state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), we favor the view that DNA-bridging capability, mediated by inter-dimer ParB<sub>F</sub> interaction, is another attribute of this ParB<sub>F</sub> state.</p><p>Our observation indicates that the state of ParB<sub>F</sub> discussed above is maintained after release from <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA. ParB<sub>F</sub> associates with nsDNA-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> dimers forming the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex with a faster apparent assembly rate in the presence of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> and CTP together than with either CTP or <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> alone. This observation is consistent with the decreased half-saturation concentration in the ATPase activation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). According to the sliding clamp model of spreading ParB–CTP dimers proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>, ParB<sub>F</sub>–CTP dimers loaded onto a short <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA fragments would quickly slide off the DNA as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>. Since our ATPase activation assay and the DNA-carpet-bound A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex assay in the presence of CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> were done using a short linear <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA fragment, the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated state of the ParB<sub>F</sub>–CTP dimers we described in this study must remain in this ‘activated’ state for an extended period after sliding off the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> fragment. Accordingly, the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complexes bound to the DNA-carpet in the presence of CTP, ATPγS and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> fragments contained almost no <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> acts as a catalyst to convert ParB<sub>F</sub>–CTP dimers from a pre-activation state to an activated state capable of faster A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex assembly. This notion is also consistent with the observation that significantly less than a stoichiometric concentration of <italic>parS</italic> DNA relative to ParB is sufficient for full activation of the ParB CTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Although the ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers in this activated state failed to load efficiently onto DNA lacking <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> sequences <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), in the absence of contrary evidence, the parsimonious assumption is that this ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer retains the conformation of spreading ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers that remain loaded on the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA <italic>in cis</italic>. Thus, we propose that the functional properties of ParB<sub>F</sub> we observed in the presence of CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, both in facilitating assembly of A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complexes and in activating ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATPase, reflect those of the majority of ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers in partition complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our study, together with previous studies, indicates that the ATP turnover rates of ParABS systems are slow because of multiple, slow kinetic steps. These slow steps are strategically placed in the reaction pathway in order to tune the system and drive the motion of the partition complex through the diffusion-ratchet mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara and Kaneko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). Even at saturating concentrations of ParB<sub>F</sub> in the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated CTP-bound state, the maximum ATP turnover rate of ParA<sub>F</sub> remained modest (~80 ATP/ParA<sub>F</sub>-monomer/hour; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The slow reactivation of ParA nucleoid binding after ATP hydrolysis likely dominates the overall ATPase cycle time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). The presence of a large fraction of ParA<sub>F</sub> in the DNA-unbound state during the steady-state ATPase assay was evidenced by the fact that the half-saturation concentration of ParB<sub>F</sub> (in the presence of CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>) forming the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex was ~0.2 μM, while the total ParA<sub>F</sub> concentration was 1 μM, suggesting less than ~20% of ParA<sub>F</sub> was in the nsDNA-bound state ready to interact with ParB<sub>F</sub>. <italic>In vivo</italic> the reactivation rate is likely lower since nucleoid-bound ParA is only fully activated on encountering the partition complex, which lowers the concentration of ParA in the cytosol waiting to be reactivated. The lower precursor concentration slows the nucleoid rebinding rate of ParA non-linearly because reactivation involves a relatively fast nucleotide-dependent reversible ParA dimerization with apparent <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of ~2 μM, followed by a slow conformational step. This makes the process dimerization-limited at lower precursor ParA concentrations according to the study of ParA<sub>P1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas this slow ParA reactivation and rebinding process, which allows the maintenance of the nucleoid-bound ParA concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), is a critical element of chemophoresis driven motility, the rate of ParA-ATPase activation by ParB is another important factor. In particular, efficient chemophoresis force generation relies on ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> interactions achieving a local quasi-equilibrium prior to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugawara and Kaneko, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that there is a significant energy barrier associated with the conformational transition of a ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> complex to achieve ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The resulting local time delay, in addition to the fact that two ParB dimers are required to bind a ParA dimer to activate its ATPase, would partially decouple the pre-ATP hydrolysis ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> reversible interaction steps from the ATP hydrolysis step. This delay would in turn permit ParB–ParA binding to approach local quasi-equilibrium, increasing the efficiency of ParA distribution gradient sensing and motive force generation by the partition complex. In addition, this slow activation step would prevent possible over-depletion of the local nucleoid-bound ParA<sub>F</sub> as the partition complex establishes the ParA<sub>F</sub> depletion zone.</p><p>Disassembly of the ATP-bound A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex might be slow prior to ATP hydrolysis considering the stability of the complexes in the presence of ATPγS. Thus, we propose the energy barrier postulated above is positioned immediately prior to formation of this complex rather than between this complex assembly and ATP hydrolysis. A slow step after formation of the stable complex would prolong the lifetime of the link between the nucleoid and the partition complex impeding partition complex motion without permitting the reversible ParA<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> interaction to approach equilibrium. We consider this conformational transition is likely the step synergistically accelerated by CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>. We note that CTP-activated ParB<sub>F</sub> stimulates ParA<sub>F</sub> ATPase with sigmoidal concentration dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting two ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers separately bind a ParA<sub>F</sub> dimer during a pre-equilibrium binding phase, forming a transient B<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex. We imagine the slow conformational step proposed here might be assisted by the property of the CTP/<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers that promotes inter-dimer interactions as suggested by the magnetic-tweezers experiments, stabilizing the interaction between the two ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers within a complex, depicted as conversion of B<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex to A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub> complex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. This might explain the higher assembly rate and stability of the complex formed with <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated ParB<sub>F</sub>-CTP. Yet, CTP and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA do not significantly increase the ATP turnover rate of ~80 h<sup>−1</sup>, indicating that the proposed kinetic delay time must be a small fraction of the ATPase cycle time (~45 s), for which we believe the rate limiting step resides in the reactivation process of ParA for nsDNA binding after ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>). Assembly of the A<sub>2</sub>B<sup>1-42</sup><sub>2</sub> complex perhaps does not experience this time delay due to fewer steric constraints, but ParB<sub>F</sub><sup>1-42</sup> dissociates more readily compared to full-length ParB<sub>F</sub>. If two CTP-bound and <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-activated ParB<sub>F</sub> dimers independently associating with a nucleoid-bound ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATP dimer is important for efficient partition complex motive force generation by the chemophoretic principle as proposed above, one might be able to design a mutant ParB<sub>F</sub> that can activate ParA<sub>F</sub>-ATPase by forming an A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex even in the presence of CTP, which would significantly affect plasmid partition efficiency. Efforts to generate such ParB<sub>F</sub> mutants are currently under way.</p><p>This study demonstrates how <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>, along with CTP, has wide-reaching roles in the F-plasmid ParABS system; not only in ParB<sub>F</sub>’s ability to spread from <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> and promote ParB<sub>F</sub>–ParB<sub>F</sub> interactions for partition complex compaction, but also in ParB<sub>F</sub> dimer interactions with ParA<sub>F</sub>. However, we still need to investigate how the ParB<sub>F</sub> CTPase activity is impacted by <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> in different states of the ParB<sub>F</sub>–<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> complex and its interaction with the ParA<sub>F</sub>-DNA complex. More generally, in order to understand how the system is orchestrated to achieve system dynamics that result in robust plasmid segregation, improved understanding of the microscopic kinetic parameters is essential. Many details of the system dynamics still remain to be addressed to understand the full picture of the ParABS partition mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

The absorption signal increase after subtraction of background time course in the absence of enzyme was converted to released Pi concentration increase based on phosphate titration measurements. The CTP hydrolysis rate was calculated from the initial slope of the time course curve, which typically started after ~7 min deadtime for the plate setting up. Substrate specificity was examined comparing Pi release from four ribonucleoside triphosphates. Attempt to examine inhibition of the CTPase activity by CDP or to detect CDP binding to ParB<sub>F</sub> was postponed when the CDP used in this study was found to release Pi upon incubation with ParB<sub>F</sub>.

The fused silica slide was cleaned by soaking overnight in a solution of Nochromix (Sigma)-sulfuric acid, followed by extensive rinsing with de-ionized water, drying by blowing nitrogen gas, followed by oxygen plasma treatment (South Bay Technology Inc). The Y-shaped flow path pattern was cut out of the transfer tape using a laser cutter before the flow cell assembly.

Excess SUVs were washed out with 500 μl warmed, degassed TN150MC buffer at 100 μl/min. 300 μl of a solution of 1 mg/ml neutravidin (Thermo Fisher) in warmed, degassed TN150MC buffer was then infused at a rate of 100 μl/min into the flow cell and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Excess neutravidin was washed out with TN150MC buffer as above, and the flow cell infused with 100 μl of a solution containing 1 mg/ml biotinylated sonicated salmon sperm DNA (as prepared above) in warmed, degassed TN150MC buffer, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The ports of the flow cell were sealed with parafilm and stored at 4°C for up to a week.</p><p>Prior to use, excess DNA was removed by infusion of 300 μl 0.22 μm filtered and degassed TIRFM buffer (50 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 300 mM K-glutamate, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml α-casein, 0.6 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 10% glycerol) with addition of 1 mg/ml α-casein and 1 mM ATPγS and the flow cell incubated at room temperature for 30 min.</p><p>Conversion of the fluorescence signal detected in TIRF microscopy to the DNA-carpet-bound protein densities was done following the procedure described in the legend of Figure 2—figure supplement 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vecchiarelli et al., 2016</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>For FRAP experiments, 488 nm solid-state and 630 nm diode lasers were focused to the back focal plane of the objective through an appropriate dichroic mirror (Di01-R405/488/561/635-25x36, Semrock) through the objective lens to illuminate a ~5 or ~10 μm (for 488 nm or 630 nm, respectively) diameter spot in the center of the sample area. The laser power was adjusted for ~80% bleaching with 5 s exposure for the eGFP or Alexa 647 signals, and four cycles of bleaching/recovery were recorded for each sample and averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Magnetic tweezers-based DNA condensation assay</title><p>The magnetic tweezers setup and assays conducted with it were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seol and Neuman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seol et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The ability of ParB<sub>F</sub> to condense <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA (spDNA) was tested by a custom-built magnetic tweezers setup. In brief, two permanent magnets were used to apply force to micron-sized magnetic beads individually tethered to the coverslip of a one inlet flow cell by 5 kb pET28a plasmid-derived DNA tethers. The distance the magnets were held from the beads, and hence the force exerted upon them was controlled by a linear motor that vertically positions the magnets.</p><p>Five kilo-base DNA substrates were generated by PCR using either pET28a-<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> plasmid (for <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA) or pET28a as templates. pET28-<italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> DNA plasmid was generated by cloning 570 bp DNA segment containing 12 repeats of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> native sequence from F-plasmid into pET28a between the BamHI and SphI restriction sites.</p><p>Primers used for the PCR contained an extra non-complementary 15 nt at their 5' ends to encode BsaI restriction sites. The PCR yields a 5.2 kb product incorporating two BsaI restriction sites at its termini. Digestion of this product was followed by ligation with 500 bp DNA ‘handles’ containing either multiple biotin or digitoxin labels. These handles were also generated by Taq-based PCR using pBlueScript II KS as the template, pBlueScript II KS forward (5'- <named-content content-type="sequence">GCT GGG TCT CGG TTG TTC CCT TTA GTG AGG GTT AAT TG</named-content>) and pBlueScript II KS reverse (5'- <named-content content-type="sequence">GCT GGG TCT CGT GGT TTC CCT TTA GTG AGG GTT AAT TG</named-content>) primers and either 60 µM biotin-16-dUTP or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche). This results in a 5 kb DNA tether, which can be attached to a streptavidin-coated magnetic bead at one end and an anti-digoxigenin coverslip surface at the other.</p><p>ParB<sub>F</sub> samples were prepared in modified ATPase buffer (50 mM HEPES.KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, 10 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1% Tween-20) and infused into a flow cell containing tethered magnetic beads held at 5 pN of force. After the chamber was filled, the flow was stopped, and the force reduced to 0.05 pN. The height of beads was tracked by analysis of diffraction rings generated by illumination of the beads from above and observed with an objective positioned below the flow cell. The extent of condensation by ParB was monitored by the decrease in the height of the beads at 0.05 and 5 pN as compared to controls without protein.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to helpful suggestions and discussion of our colleagues Barbara Funnell, David Lane, Michiyo Mizuuchi, Andrea Volante, Min Li, Masaki Osawa, William Carlquist, and Shannon Mckie, to Esme Neuman for help in preparation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, and to Min Li for help in preparation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>.

Two main findings are presented: a change in stoichiometry of ParA-ParB interactions upon ligand binding and ligand dependent DNA condensation by ParB. The authors have thoroughly and appropriately responded to all comments. The textual changes and additional experiments (e.g. with relaxed DNA) have significantly improved the manuscript. The paper paves the way for future research on the intricate ParA-ATP ParB-CTP parS interplay.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CTP and <italic>parS</italic> control ParB partition complex dynamics and ParA-ATPase activation for ParABS-mediated DNA partitioning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stephan Gruber (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interaction between ParBF and CTP itself (in the presence/absence of parSF) has not received much attention from the authors. How strong does ParBF bind to CTP? Does ParBF bind CTP in the absence of parSF? How fast does ParBF hydrolyze CTP in the presence/absence of parSF? This information is very important to fully assess the results in this manuscript, especially those where all components: ParAF, ParBF, ATPyS, CTP, parSF are present. (Some of the initial information is already in Soh et al. 2019, but those were preliminary observations.)</p><p>2) According to the presented model, the stoichiometry of ParA-ParB interactions in the presence of CTP and/or parS could be changed by providing additional flexibility in the connection between the N-terminal ParA-interacting peptide in ParB and the ParB CTP domain. If indeed the stoichiometry is critical, then such ParB mutants are expected to feature plasmid partitioning defects. If this exp can be performed, it would be important to show as it will be directly relevant to the most important finding in this manuscript i.e. the stoichiometry of ParA-B interaction +/- CTP.</p><p>Other major concerns worth addressing if feasible:</p><p>3) The work reported in this manuscript relies on the recruitment of ParA-ATPgS to DNA, which is apparently inefficient when compared to ParA-ATP (Vecchiarelli, 2013?). This fact (if indeed true) needs to be stated more explicitly in the text, currently it is only indirectly implied. Is there a way to test selected findings in a more physiological setting using ATP (e.g. with ParA active site mutants)?</p><p>4) The results from the ParB DNA condensation experiments are intriguing. Could the authors estimate/determine the (local) concentration of ParB needed for DNA compaction? Similarly, it would be helpful to investigate whether progressive condensation of DNA occurs indeed by sequential recruitment of ParB dimers to the parS site (Figure 6A). Would DNA compaction arrest upon blockage of parS?</p><p>5) From the magnetic-tweezers (MT) experiments, Taylor et al. suggested that &quot;Our results show that DNA-condensation is caused by ParBF-ParBF interactions forming DNA-looping bridges without requiring other protein factors&quot;. The dominant view of the field, before the discovery of CTP, is that ParB-ParB forms protein-mediated bridges that condense DNA. Now that we know ParB most likely form a sliding clamp on DNA, there is a possibility that the sliding causes DNA supercoiling, akin to how RNAP/PNCA runs on DNA, and that DNA supercoiling causes the reduction in DNA extension in the MT experiment. Can Taylor et al. distinguish between the two possibilities? May be repeating the MT experiments with a nicked DNA to dissipate any accumulated supercoiling?</p><p>6) Does ParBF bind CDP in the presence/absence of parSF? Experiments in this manuscript suggest that it does (Figure 5F, Figure 6B-C), but other chromosomal ParBs are not known to bind to CDP.</p><p>7) The other intriguing area is how ParBF CTPase activity is affected by the presence of ParA and this in itself has important implications for the &quot;diffusion-ratchet&quot; model. Taylor et al. might want to investigate this in the future, but maybe the authors can mention this in the Discussion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65651.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interaction between ParBF and CTP itself (in the presence/absence of parSF) has not received much attention from the authors.

We had preliminary data for the ParB<sub>F</sub> CTPase activity, but we did not have publishable data. We carried out a new set of CTPase measurements in the presence and absence of <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> to estimate the apparent CTP <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>, which are now presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and described on page 15, lines 295-304 (line numbers are for Print Layout View without Markup display).</p><p>We are also very much interested in the characterization of the ParB<sub>F</sub> CTPase activity in the presence of ParA<sub>F</sub> and other cofactors. However, we wish to approach this subject in a systematic manner, if possible, including the study of the ParB CTPase activity in the presence of ATP hydrolysis by ParA. However, because g-<sup>32</sup>P-CTP is not readily available (and removal of contaminating CDP from a-<sup>32</sup>P-CTP is not easy compared to removal of π from g-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP as done for our ATPase assay substrate), we are currently evaluating the technical options available to us. Completing this project under current working conditions will take a substantial length of time and incorporating this study would not only cause lengthy delay in publication of the current manuscript, but also make it excessively long. Therefore, we plan to carry out a comprehensive study separately to be published in a follow up paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to the presented model, the stoichiometry of ParA-ParB interactions in the presence of CTP and/or parS could be changed by providing additional flexibility in the connection between the N-terminal ParA-interacting peptide in ParB and the ParB CTP domain.

We indeed have been considering construction of such artificial mutants to support the hypothesis.</p><p>However, the N-terminal region of plasmid ParBs such as F or P1 are longer than chromosomal ParBs, and the boundary between the ParA-interaction domain and the CTPase domain remains somewhat ambiguous, necessitating a few preliminary experiments before we can finalize the design of the mutant protein. Since we are still limited in our capacity to carry out experiments, inclusion of these experiments in the current manuscript would cause substantial delay in publication. In the revised manuscript we included predictions for such mutants and provide an overview of our future plans in relation to these mutants in the Discussion (page 27, lines 535-540).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major concerns worth addressing if feasible:</p><p>3) The work reported in this manuscript relies on the recruitment of ParA-ATPgS to DNA, which is apparently inefficient when compared to ParA-ATP (Vecchiarelli, 2013?).

We added clarifications of this point in the revised manuscript (Page 7, lines 133-136).</p><p>However, the difference in the nsDNA binding property of ParA-ATPgS and ParA-ATP appears subtle. For example, at higher ParA concentrations ParA-ATPgS binds DNA more efficiently without ParB. It is possible some ATPase active site mutant could be found that would allow us to carry out experiments in the presence of ATP. However, to date we have not found a mutant that renders DNA binding dependent on ParB in the presence of ATP. Use of the mutant ParA that binds nsDNA in the presence of ATP without ParB would require a new experimental protocol, which is yet to be established. Therefore, we will wait for the next stage of the project to pursue possible use of the ATPase-defective ParA in the characterization of the ParA-ParB complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The results from the ParB DNA condensation experiments are intriguing.

Would DNA compaction arrest upon blockage of parS?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this important limitation in our current experiment. In this study, the magnetic tweezers instrument was not equipped with fluorescence imaging capability so we were not able to quantitate ParB<sub>F</sub> spreading around the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic> site during DNA condensation. Therefore, we cannot directly estimate the number of ParB<sub>F</sub> molecules involved in condensing DNA. However, in line with recently published findings from other groups concerning chromosomal ParBs, we believe our results are consistent with the notion that the tightly condensed state of the <italic>parS<sub>F</sub></italic>-containing DNA in our experiments contains a large number of ParB<sub>F</sub> molecules. Our results as well as published work from other groups predict that blockage of parS would arrest DNA compaction. However, this has not been directly tested. In the revised manuscript, we added a statement to clarify these points in the Discussion on page 23, lines 448-452. We are currently preparing an experimental design for the next stage of our study to address a number of unanswered questions including the points raised by the reviewers here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) From the magnetic-tweezers (MT) experiments, Taylor et al. suggested that &quot;Our results show that DNA-condensation is caused by ParBF-ParBF interactions forming DNA-looping bridges without requiring other protein factors&quot;.

To address this insightful possibility, we have included a comparison of the compaction of nicked DNA versus supercoilable DNA by ParB. We could distinguish nicked DNA from “coilable” (rotationally constrained) DNA by twisting the individual DNA molecules in the magnetic tweezers prior to ParB<sub>F</sub> binding. Twisting intact coilable DNA results in plectoneme formation, evidenced by a decrease in the DNA extension, whereas the extension of nicked or torsionally unconstrained DNA is insensitive to twisting. We found that condensation by ParB was comparable for both rotationally constrained and unconstrained DNA molecules, suggesting that DNA condensation by ParB is unlikely due to “effective supercoil generation by ParB moving along DNA”. In the revised manuscript, we added this result as Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and added text explaining this on page 19, lines 355-358.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does ParBF bind CDP in the presence/absence of parSF? Experiments in this manuscript suggest that it does (Figure 5F, Figure 6B-C), but other chromosomal ParBs are not known to bind to CDP.</p></disp-quote><p>Our earlier results suggested that CDP (2 mM) likely binds ParB<sub>F</sub> under our reaction conditions. However, the difference from the results of experiments without C-nucleotides was relatively subtle. As a response to the reviewer’s comment, we attempted to examine CDP binding to ParB<sub>F</sub> by biophysical methods and also tried to measure the apparent <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> of CDP for the CTPase activity. However, we encountered technical difficulties, which we eventually determined arose from the fact that the CDP preparation we used was contaminated by a small but significant quantity (~2-3%) of a compound that acts as a substrate of ParB<sub>F</sub>, releasing Pi (very likely to be CTP, but we have not yet directly determined the identity of the contamination). We examined several batches of CDP obtained from several sources, but failed to identify a CDP preparation free of this contamination. We have not been able to locate a commercial source of higher quality CDP and purification of CDP under current lab operating conditions would result in further substantial delays. In addition, even if we succeed in obtaining CDP essentially free of this contaminant, some of the experiments in the paper that involved CDP are currently not readily repeatable in a timely fashion; the first author who carried out these experiments had to leave the country last year and will not be able to return to repeat the experiments, and the instrument used for the study is currently undergoing reconfiguration to address a failed laser illumination system.</p><p>Fortunately, in the current paper the experiments that involved CDP were done essentially as control experiments to be compared with the results of experiments involving CTP, and the impacts of the relatively low concentration of the contaminant, if any, appears relatively minor. In other words, the results of the experiments involving CDP were clearly different from those in the presence of CTP but not dramatically different from those without C-nucleotides, indicating that either CDP does not significantly bind ParB<sub>F</sub> under the conditions used, or if bound, it likely does not significantly change the behavior of ParB<sub>F</sub> for the properties examined in most of the experiments. Therefore, the above finding did not appear to have substantial impacts on the general conclusions of the current paper. We described this finding on page 16, lines 305-312 (and Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). In order to avoid confusions we also eliminated a small fraction of the data (Figure 5B, Figure 5F- CDP data in the original manuscript), interpretation of which are ambiguous in light of this finding. We edited the manuscript at number of additional places to reflect this new finding, such as page 19, lines 362-364.</p><p>We note that Osorio-Valeriano et al., showed ParB<sub>MX</sub> binds CDP with a low affinity, but their measurement also used CDP supplied by Sigma with the same catalog number as used in our experiments, which was found to contain the contaminant. Therefore, the published <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> for CDP may not be accurate.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment, which prompted us to examine the CDP-ParB interaction and led us to find the problem we were unaware of. We are planning on purification of the nucleotides when the required equipment becomes accessible to us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The other intriguing area is how ParBF CTPase activity is affected by the presence of ParA and this in itself has important implications for the &quot;diffusion-ratchet&quot; model. Taylor et al. might want to investigate this in the future, but maybe the authors can mention this in the Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the response to major comment 1), we are very interested in expanding our study to address the questions suggested here. Ideally, a sensitive and nucleotide-specific CTPase assay in the presence of ATPase activity in the reaction would be nice. If this turns out to be difficult, we may start the study under conditions where ATP hydrolysis does not take place either by using ATPgS or a mutant ParA.</p><p>For the current manuscript, as suggested, we mentioned this point in the Discussion as one of several remaining questions to be addressed by future study on page 27, lines 544-545.</p></body></sub-article></article>
