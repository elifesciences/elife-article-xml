could be balanced between dispersing and reproduction. Most studies concern the regulatory mechanisms underlying the stimulation of wing morph in aphids, but relatively little research addresses the molecular basis of wing loss. Here, we found that, while developing normally in winged-destined pea aphids, the wing disc in wingless-destined aphids degenerated 30-hr postbirth and that this degeneration was due to autophagy rather than apoptosis. Activation of autophagy in first instar nymphs reduced the proportion of winged aphids, and suppression of autophagy increased the proportion. <italic>REPTOR2</italic>, associated with TOR signaling pathway, was identified by RNA-seq as a differentially expressed gene between the two morphs with higher expression in the thorax of wingless-destined aphids. Further genetic analysis indicated that <italic>REPTOR2</italic> could be a novel gene derived from a gene duplication event that occurred exclusively in pea aphids on autosome A1 but translocated to the sex chromosome. Knockdown of <italic>REPTOR2</italic> reduced autophagy in the wing disc and increased the proportion of winged aphids. In agreement with REPTOR’s canonical negative regulatory role of TOR on autophagy, winged-destined aphids had higher <italic>TOR</italic> expression in the wing disc. Suppression of <italic>TOR</italic> activated autophagy of the wing disc and decreased the proportion of winged aphids, and vice versa. Co-suppression of <italic>TOR</italic> and <italic>REPTOR2</italic> showed that ds<italic>REPTOR2</italic> could mask the positive effect of ds<italic>TOR</italic> on autophagy, suggesting that <italic>REPTOR2</italic> acted as a key regulator downstream of <italic>TOR</italic> in the signaling pathway. These results revealed that the TOR signaling pathway suppressed autophagic degradation of the wing disc in pea aphids by negatively regulating the expression of <italic>REPTOR2</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pea aphid</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>developmental plasticity</kwd><kwd>REPTOR2,</kwd><kwd>TOR</kwd><kwd>wing disc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (no. 2022YFD1400800)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yucheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.

The loss of such ability has occurred in numerous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roff and Fairbairn, 1991</xref>). The wingless morph has evolved to optimize resource allocation from dispersal to reproduction, which facilitates population expansion under suitable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mole and Zera, 1993</xref>). Alternation between the wing morphs in aphid offspring is strongly influenced by maternal experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braendle et al., 2006</xref>). Pea aphids are recognized as a compelling laboratory model to study regulatory mechanisms underlying wing dimorphism, most notably through maternal population density (herein refers to as maternal density). It has been shown that ecdysteroids, miR-9b-ABCG4-insulin signaling, and two laterally transferred viral genes (<italic>Apns-1</italic> and <italic>Apns-2</italic>) are responsible for producing winged offspring in parthenogenetic females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parker and Brisson, 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the phylogenetic evidence suggests that winged morph in aphids is a default developmental pattern, while the wingless morph is secondarily derived, from their winged ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braendle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miyazaki, 1987</xref>). Thus, how wingless morph is controlled under favorable conditions needs to be studied, as such information will help to elucidate the differentiation of wing dimorphism in aphids.</p><p>Tissue degradation is a common developmental process in insects executed by programmed cell death (PCD), such as autophagy and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). During metamorphosis, <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary glands, midgut and other larval tissues are removed by PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). For example, suppression of apoptosis or autophagy or both could delay the degeneration of salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry and Baehrecke, 2007</xref>). Suppressing autophagy, but not apoptosis, severely interferes with the removal of the midgut during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denton et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that tissue-specific degeneration required different types of PCD. Furthermore, histological examinations in pea aphids show that the second instar nymphs of the winged-destined morph obviously possess a pair of wing discs, whereas wingless-destined morph does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ogawa and Miura, 2013</xref>). Since the wing bud and the full wing are developed from the wing disc, it would be interesting to know whether and how PCD controls the fate of the wing disc cells, ultimately resulting in the wingless morph.</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved nutrient-sensing TOR (the target of rapamycin) pathway has been implicated in regulation of fecundity, life span as well as tissues degradation of insects under different nutritional conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Katewa and Kapahi, 2011</xref>). TOR coordinately regulates the balance between growth and autophagy in response to cellular and physiological conditions as well as environmental stresses such as intracellular amino acid availability and accessible energy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Shortage of dietary amino acid depletion or starvation, inhibits TOR activity, which is known as a crucial step for autophagy induction in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2016</xref>). Downregulation of TOR signaling pathway seems to be necessary for autophagic degradation to occur in different insect tissues such as the salivary gland and midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry and Baehrecke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denton et al., 2012</xref>). TOR suppresses autophagy by directly phosphorylating multiple residues of autophagy-related proteins or repressing the transcription of autophagy-related genes. TOR phosphorylates Atg13, causing reduced affinity between Atg1 and its binding proteins and subsequently repressed autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puente et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, TOR also phosphorylates Ser527 and Ser530 of REPTOR (repressed by TOR) to prevent its entry into nucleus where REPTOR targets autophagy-related genes and suppresses their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we identify a novel gene <italic>REPTOR2</italic> in pea aphids by comparing the transcriptome of wingless-destined versus winged-destined aphids at 24-hr postbirth. Since <italic>REPTOR2</italic> has a higher expression in thorax of wingless-destined aphids, we hypothesized that <italic>REPTOR2</italic> activates autophagic degradation in the wing disc to produce the wingless morph. Likewise, winged-destined aphids have a stronger TOR activity to suppress autophagy in the wing disc to develop into full wings. Experimentally, we specifically determined: (i) the time point to initiate PCD in the wing disc, (ii) the PCD type that was responsible for wing disc degeneration, and (iii) the role of REPTOR2 and TOR signaling cascade in determination wing dimorphism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of maternal density and duration on the proportion of winged offspring</title><p>To efficiently sample winged offspring, we examined how maternal density and duration affected the proportion of winged offspring. Compared to the adults individually housed, the adults housed in groups of 2, 4, and 8 in a petri dish for 8-hr led to higher proportions of winged offspring, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since two adults were sufficient to produce over 80% winged offspring, we then tested different contact time periods on the proportion of winged morph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Apparently, 4-hr was sufficient to induce &gt;90% winged offspring, and 2-hr induced a moderate effect (approximately 50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, two adults with 4-hr contact duration continuously produced over 80% winged offspring for 3 days, followed by a small reduction afterward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, to eliminate a strain-specific induction, three other pea aphid strains were also tested for two adults and 4-hr duration; even the strain with the lowest proportion of winged offspring exceeded 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wing dimorphism in pea aphids is transgenerational with high sensitivity to maternal density and duration, and first instar nymphs at 30-hr postbirth is a critical stage for developmental plasticity of the wing disc.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two female adults in a petri dish can efficiently induce a high proportion of winged offspring.

Fate of the wing disc is presumably determined by maternal signals triggered by environmental signals such as population density, physical contact, and the presence of natural enemies, as wing dimorphism in aphids is transgenerational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braendle et al., 2006</xref>). It has been reported that ecdysteroids and miR-9b are the molecules that transduce maternal crowding signals to embryos, leading to a high proportion of winged offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). However, few studies have focused on the role of the wing disc degradation at the onset of the nymphal stage in forming wing dimorphism. In this study, we demonstrated that a novel gene <italic>REPTOR2</italic>, highly expressed in the first instar nymphs of wingless-destined pea aphid morph 12-h postbirth, activated autophagy in the wing disc and resulted in its degeneration as early as 30-h postbirth. Different types of PCD have been reported to activate in tissue degeneration in many insect orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Wing discs of soldier ant and some sex-dependent wingless morphs of lepidopterans are degenerated by apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujiwara and Ogai, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niitsu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sameshima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rajakumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rajakumar et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, apoptosis did not seem to be necessary in wing disc degradation in aphids. Instead, typical features of autophagic cell death occurred at 30-h postbirth in wingless-destined morphs. Our results supported a model concerning aphid wing disc degeneration and development: Once experienced crowding, maternal aphids increased TOR expression in first instar nymphs. This was followed by the repression of REPTOR2 and autophagic degradation in the wing disc, thereby causing a high proportion of winged offspring. For the solitary maternal group on the other hand, TOR activity was arrested in the first instar offspring, and REPTOR2 and autophagy were subsequently activated in wing disc, leading to a high proportion of wingless offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Given the high expression in thorax of wingless-destined morph at early first instar nymphal stage, it was likely that REPTOR2 transduced the TOR signaling to activate autophagic degeneration of the wing disc in a tissue-specific manner.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the TOR signaling pathway-controlled wing disc degeneration of the first instar pea aphid nymphs.</title><p>All treatments, indicated along the top, were applied to wingless maternal aphids.

For instance, activation of TOR activity in honeybees is responsible for the developmental transition from facultatively sterile workers to reproductive queens, while repressing TOR activity could induce worker characters in queen-destined individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michalak et al., 2007</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis in maternal crowding of pea aphids suggested that genes functionally related to TOR signaling pathway were differentially expressed in mother aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parker et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the canonical pathway of TOR-REPTOR-autophagy may be responsible for developmental plasticity of the wing disc in aphids, in accordance with lower TOR abundance in wingless-destined morph. Suppression of TOR in <italic>Drosophila</italic> upregulates the expression of autophagy-related genes via phosphorylation of Ser527 and Ser530 in REPTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, pea aphid <italic>REPTOR2</italic> is predicted to contain a conserved BRLZ domain that is capable of binding to GTAAACAA, the binding motif of FOXO as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>). FOXO is a transcription factor that relays the insulin signaling to insect wing dimorphism. In the planthopper, activating insulin signaling transforms short-winged to long-winged morph via repressing the FOXO activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of FOXO inhibits the development of the long-winged morph by suppressing vestigial (Vg) expression during the wing-morph decision-making stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). It appears that FOXO and REPTOR2, respectively, relay the insulin and TOR signaling cascades to control wing dimorphism in planthoppers and aphids. Alternatively, the BRLZ domain is required to form REPTOR/REPTOR-BP homo/hetero-dimer complex which conveys negative regulation of TOR signaling on genes related to autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>). Our results are consistent with the canonical pathway regulated by TOR in that either knockdown of <italic>REPTOR2</italic> or activation of TOR could attenuate autophagy in the wing disc. These results suggest that <italic>REPTOR2</italic> from pea aphids served as a transcription factor to exert a negative effect on TOR-regulated autophagy initiation.</p><p>Insulin signaling is known to determine the wing-morph switch in planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and is also responsible for production of winged offspring regulated by miR-9b-ABCG4 cascade in brown citrus aphid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, insulin could enhance TOR signaling by releasing the negative feedback of Akt on the tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blagosklonny et al., 2009</xref>). It has been shown that embryos derived from pea aphids subjected to crowding treatment have higher insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grantham et al., 2019</xref>). This may lead to stronger TOR signaling in the first instar offspring, which could suppress wing disc autophagy and increase the proportion of winged aphids.</p><p>Gene duplication is a major source for novel gene production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prince and Pickett, 2002</xref>), which has become an important mechanism regulating phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), including manipulating wing polyphenism in insects. For instance, a duplicated <italic>fs3</italic> (follistatin 3) determined the wingless morph formation for male pea aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Another duplicated gene <italic>InR2</italic> (insulin receptor 2) was highly expressed in the wing bud of the planthopper that served as a regulatory switch of short-winged morph formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, different from other seven aphid species with single copies of REPTOR, pea aphids possess two REPTOR genes. Although it has lost 2 exons, <italic>ApREPTOR2</italic> has higher similarity in coding sequence with <italic>ApREPTOR1</italic>, but shares little similarity in the flanking regions. This is in agreement with the chromosomal distribution results indicating that <italic>ApREPTOR1</italic> is located in A1 chromosome while <italic>ApREPTOR2</italic> is in X chromosome. <italic>ApREPTOR2</italic> is likely a duplicate from <italic>ApREPTOR1</italic>, followed by translocating from A1 to X chromosome. This may also warrant the reproductive role of sexual female in pea aphids because most sexual females are monomorphic wingless, whereas males that contain just single X chromosome are dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brisson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the aphid wing polyphenism, differential expression of diverged paralogous genes could represent an adaptive response to particular environmental challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shigenobu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brisson et al., 2010</xref>). Evidently, <italic>ApREPTOR2</italic>-regulated wing disc degradation is significant for the winged- versus wingless-destined aphids, whereas the expression of its paralog <italic>ApREPTOR1</italic> was unaffected by wing morphs or tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These results indicated that <italic>ApREPTOR2</italic> rather than the canonical <italic>REPTOR</italic> activated a tissue-specific degradation in the wing disc and not a systemic PCD.

Coding sequences of homologous genes of REPTOR, including LOC100168197 (<italic>REPTOR1</italic>, <italic>A. pisum</italic>), LOC103309809 (<italic>REPTOR2</italic>, <italic>A. pisum</italic>), Mca07599.t1 (<italic>M. cerasi</italic>), g26487.t1 (<italic>M. persicae</italic>), LOC112600553 (<italic>M. secchari</italic>), LOC114124537 (<italic>A. gossyppii</italic>), g1773.t1 (<italic>R. padi</italic>), LOC113558611 (<italic>R. maidis</italic>), and jg23767.t1 (<italic>E. lanigerum</italic>), were obtained from NCBI and AphidBase. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE v3.8.1551 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edgar, 2004</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis was performed in IQ-TREE v2.1.4-beta with HKY+F+G4 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Minh et al., 2020</xref>) and the phylogenetic tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/</ext-link>). Genomic sequences of orthologous regions of REPTOR were obtained from <italic>M. persicae</italic> (v2.0), <italic>R. maidis</italic> (v1.0), and <italic>E. lanigerum</italic> (v1.0), which have chromosome-level genome assemblies available at Aphidbase. Sequences were compared with NCBI blast v2.2.26 and homologous sequences were linked by the gray color when sequences matched to positive strand and by the red color when sequences matched to negative strand. Dot plots were generated using MUMmer v3.23. MapGene2Chrom v2.1 was used to analyze the chromosomal distribution of two pea aphid REPTOR genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mg2c.iask.in/mg2c_v2.1/">http://mg2c.iask.in/mg2c_v2.1/</ext-link>). Conserved domains of REPTOR were identified by SMART (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</ext-link>). The amino acid sequences of REPTOR homologs from <italic>A. pisum</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> were downloaded from GenBank and aligned with <italic>ApREPTOR2</italic> using MUSCLE v3.8.1551.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (Chicago, IL) and GraphPad software. All data were checked for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Student’s t tests were used to analyze the relative area of the wing disc, percentage of autophagic cells, the number of autophagosomes per wing disc, intensity ratios of ATG8/DAPI, TUNEL/ DAPI, REPTOR2/DAPI, and TOR/ DAPI, percentage of winged aphids, and quantification of gene expression for two-group comparisons. ANOVA was used to analyze the effects of maternal density and contacting duration on the proportion of winged offspring, and proportion of winged offspring in each day for 4-hr contacting treatment with two female adults.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Primers used for the study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83023-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83023-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in SRA under accession ID PRJNA857589.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Wing dimorphism in Acyrthosiphon pisum</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA857589/">PRJNA857589</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank our colleagues Prof. Jinfeng Chen for his support in genetic analysis and Prof. Chenzhu Wang for his advises in project coordination and manuscript writing.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not establish a direct link between REPTOR2 and TOR. New data is needed unambiguously show that suppression of TOR signalling works through REPTOR2 to induce autophagy of the wing primordium. Both reviewers suggest specific experiments that could be done, relating to measuring REPTOR2 expression in dsTOR animals and performing double knockdown experiments.</p><p>2) Clarifications are required about data structure and statistical analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The methods utilized are appropriate for the study and generally sufficient to support the main findings of the paper. Nevertheless, I have a number of recommendations for how the manuscript and study can be improved.</p><p>1) A major conclusion of the study is that the &quot;results suggest that REPTOR2 from pea aphids served as a transcription factor to exert a negative effect of TOR signaling on autophagy initiation&quot; (L267). The model is therefore that suppression of TOR signaling works through REPTOR2 to induce autophagy of the wing primordium. However, as implied by Figure 5, the study does not unambiguously place REPTOR2 downstream of TOR in the regulation of wing dimorphism. To demonstrate this, the authors need to conduct an epistatic analysis, which appears to be straightforward given the tools utilized in the study. Specifically, the authors should show the effects of the suppression of TOR signaling in inducing autophagy of the wing primordium and production of wingless aphids, either by dsTOR.RNAI or amino acid deprivation (Figure 4 C, D, G, H), should be significantly reduced or eliminated when REPTOR1 is also suppressed by dsREPTOR2.RNAi (Figure 4 M, N). Such a demonstration, which could be achieved by feeding aphids both dsTOR.RNAI and dsREPTOR2.RNAi, would substantially strengthen the findings of the paper, and is, to my mind, an essential experiment.</p><p>2) While it seems likely that TOR activates REPTOR2 directly through phosphorylation (there is a physical association between TOR and REPTOR in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), the observation that REPTOR2 expression is elevated in WLD nymphs (Figure 3 H, I) means that there may also be a transcriptional response also. Demonstrating that REPTOR2 expression is elevated upon suppression of TOR signaling would strengthen a direct relationship between the two.</p><p>3) It is not clear how the data from Figure 1F were collected. The authors state that the winged and wingless morphs of A.pisum cannot be distinguished until the third instar, so they utilize a culturing technique to increase the proportion of WLD or WD nymphs to ~90% (Figure S1). Nevertheless, the data in Figure 1F showing the area of the wing primordia in WD versus WLD shows a 100% separation in the area between both morphs by 36h after birth. I am surprised that at least one of the nymphs raised in the WLD-inducing conditions did not show WD development, or one of the nymphs in the WD-inducing conditions did not show WLD development. The figure legend states that there were &gt;16 replicates for each group so just by probability alone, at least one of the ostensibly WLD nymphs are actually winged, or one of the ostensibly WD nymphs are wingless. A back-of-an-envelope calculation, where the probability of generating a winged or wingless morph is 0.9, and there are 32 trials suggests the probability of getting 100% WLD or WD nymphs in each treatment is 0.034, which is unlikely (and below the significance threshold of 0.05).</p><p>4) The authors used a culture technique that generates ~50% winged/wingless morphs to explore how the knockdown of REPTOR2 and TOR affects the ratio of WLD and WD. While, within experiments, the results show significant changes in ratio with an experimental treatment, the percentage of winged aphids is highly variable among the controls, to the same extent as the observed effect size. For example in Figure 1I, 3-MA significantly increases the percentage of winged aphids from ~55% (control) to ~65% (treatment), but the control treatment for the rapamycin treatment (EtOH) in Figure 1H is also ~65%. Indeed, across the study, the percentage of winged aphids in the control groups range from ~40% (Figure 4F) to ~65% (Figure 1H). This variability is troubling, and while I don't feel that it compromises the results, the authors may consider using culture conditions that are more consistent, for example by conducting their knockdowns in the conditions where &gt;90% of the offspring are expected to be one morph or the other.</p><p>5) Figure 3J: The hypothesis suggests that the knockdown of REPTOR2 should decrease the expression of autophagic genes since they are upregulated in WLD nymphs (Figure 2D). This is only true for two genes. The authors may like to speculate as to why they did not observe a robust transcriptional response to dsREPTOR2.RNAi treatment.</p><p>6) In general, the paper suffers from a lack of transparency with regard to statistical methods. In particular, while some of the bar charts include all the data (e.g. Figure 1F), almost all the others do not (e.g. all the figures showing mean percentage winged aphids). Although the sample sizes are provided in the legends, standard error bars are not sufficient to capture the true data. Box plots capture both means, but also the distribution of the underlying data, and would be more appropriate for this study. The authors should also provide all their data as a Supplementary file, not just the gene expression data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the introduction, I think a more thorough discussion of the Target of Rapamycin pathway would help.

Thus, the area of the wing primordia of selected WD vs. WLD aphids showed a 100% separation 36h post birth. Furthermore, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 exhibited an insect culturing protocol for sampling 100% WLD-nymphs and ~90% WD-nymphs (Figure1A), which could also better help us to separate WLD- and WL-nymphs, and obtain the clean data on wing primordia of two morphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors used a culture technique that generates ~50% winged/wingless morphs to explore how the knockdown of REPTOR2 and TOR affects the ratio of WLD and WD.

Ideally, the control group should maintain a ~50% of the winged morph for the evaluations (Rapamycin, 3-MA or TOR dsRNA) to be unbiased. We followed the culture technique by Vellichirammal et al. (2017) and carefully repeated every batch of the control. However, we were unable to avoid variations between batches. Therefore, we focused our comparisons on differences between the treatment and control. In fact, this level of variation among controls is commonly seen in other publications, as listed below.</p><p>Parker BJ, Brisson JA. 2019.

For example, only two autophagic genes <italic>Ulk1</italic> and <italic>ATG8</italic> displayed oscillation expression throughout the light/dark cycle in mouse liver (Ma et al., 2011). Activating autophagy in response to starvation is highly conserved in eukaryotic cells. However, only one autophagic gene <italic>Atg8a</italic> was up-regulated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body under starvation stress (Zinke et al., 2002; Juhasz et al., 2007).

The autophagic genes could be regulated by other transcription factors. Similar with current study, only a few autophagic genes could be regulated. For example, ATG8 and ATG9 could be upregulated by transcription factor EB (TFEB) when HeLa cells were starved while ATG8, ATG1 and ATG5 were regulated by transcription factors E2F1 in DNA damage-induced autophagy (Settembre et al., 2011; Polager et al., 2008).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Gorski SM, Chittaranjan S, Pleasance ED, Freeman JD, Anderson CL, Varhol RJ et al.
