assemblies that link chromosomes to microtubules of the mitotic and meiotic spindle. It is still poorly understood how efficient, centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly is accomplished from hundreds of individual protein building blocks in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Here, by combining comprehensive phosphorylation analysis of native Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> subunits with biochemical and functional assays in the model system budding yeast, we demonstrate that Cdk1 phosphorylation activates phospho-degrons on the essential subunit Ame1<sup>CENP-U</sup>, which are recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF-Cdc4. Gradual phosphorylation of degron motifs culminates in M-phase and targets the protein for degradation. Binding of the Mtw1<sup>Mis12</sup> complex shields the proximal phospho-degron, protecting kinetochore-bound Ame1 from the degradation machinery. Artificially increasing degron strength partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a <italic>cdc4</italic> mutant, while overexpression of Ame1-Okp1 is toxic in SCF mutants, demonstrating the physiological importance of this mechanism. We propose that phospho-regulated clearance of excess CCAN subunits facilitates efficient centromere-dependent kinetochore assembly. Our results suggest a novel strategy for how phospho-degrons can be used to regulate the assembly of multi-subunit complexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>SCF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE-2886/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böhm</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Garcia</surname><given-names>Elsa</given-names></name><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Garcia</surname><given-names>Elsa</given-names></name><name><surname>Westermann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>649124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loog</surname><given-names>Mart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001837</institution-id><institution>Estonian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRG550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loog</surname><given-names>Mart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007821</institution-id><institution>University of Tartu</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TK143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loog</surname><given-names>Mart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2033 – 390677874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Garcia</surname><given-names>Elsa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cell cycle machinery regulates the assembly of the multi-protein kinetochore complex by targeting excess subunits for degradation via the proteasome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinetochores form a dynamically regulated binding interface between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle, a connection that is essential to partition the genetic material equally during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggins, 2013</xref>). As chromatin-bound multi-protein complexes, kinetochores assemble exclusively at centromeres. Biochemical experiments have elucidated the connectivity between multiple subcomplexes in the context of an assembled kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>), and structural biology has started to define the organization of these building blocks at atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). It is, however, still poorly understood how kinetochore proteins first assemble into stable subcomplexes and then associate into higher-order structures with the correct stoichiometry specifically at the centromere.</p><p>Budding yeast centromeres are attached to kinetochore microtubules during almost the entire vegetative cell cycle. Upon replication, kinetochores assemble quickly on both sister chromatids to ensure effective bi-orientation. Live cell imaging experiments suggest that kinetochore assembly upon replication of centromere DNA occurs rapidly and is completed within 10–15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). This is remarkable as even the relatively simple kinetochores in budding yeast consist of more than 40 different proteins. These protein subunits assemble in two layers: the inner kinetochore comprises 16 subunits, which are collectively called the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN, or Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> in budding yeast). The CCAN contains the essential protein Mif2<sup>CENP-C</sup>, which contacts and organizes many other subunits of the CCAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klare et al., 2015</xref>) and, among other subcomplexes, the COMA complex, which consists of the conserved subunits Ctf19<sup>CENP-P</sup>, Okp1<sup>CENP-Q</sup>, Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup>, and Ame1<sup>CENP-U</sup>, of which Ame1 and Okp1 are essential for cell viability in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). The CCAN directly binds to a specialized nucleosome by recognizing the histone H3 variant Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup> via the Mif2 and Ame1-Okp1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anedchenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischböck-Halwachs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Killinger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The outer kinetochore forms a microtubule-binding layer with the KMN network at its core. As this network lacks DNA-binding proteins, it relies on the CCAN for centromere recruitment. The Knl1c (Spc105c in yeast), Mis12c (Mtw1c in yeast), and Ndc80c subcomplexes are necessary to efficiently couple dynamic microtubules to centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>) and also form a regulated recruitment platform for components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joglekar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">London et al., 2012</xref>). The outer yeast kinetochore also includes a ring-forming protein complex called the Dam1c, which is required for robust coupling of the KMN network to dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tien et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A number of control mechanisms for kinetochore assembly have been described, and the best studied examples have defined the regulation of the histone H3 variant Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup>. High levels of Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup> lead to its mis-incorporation into non-centromeric loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ranjitkar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Hooser et al., 2001</xref>) and can promote the formation of ectopic kinetochores and genetic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildebrand and Biggins, 2016</xref>). In budding yeast, Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup> protein levels are controlled via regulated proteolysis involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase Psh1, which prevents mis-incorporation of Cse4 into chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ranjitkar et al., 2010</xref>). Additional links between the ubiquitin-proteosome system and kinetochore assembly in budding yeast are provided by the Mub1/Ubr2 E3 ligase complex, which regulates the level of the Dsn1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2013</xref>). Whether similar regulatory systems operate for other kinetochore subunits and how they may contribute to kinetochore assembly is currently not known.</p><p>Phospho-regulation plays an important role for multiple aspects of kinetochore function. The Ipl1<sup>AuroraB</sup> kinase regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachments during error correction to ensure sister chromatid bi-orientation, and it also promotes kinetochore assembly by phosphorylating the Mis12c subunit Dsn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimitrova et al., 2016</xref>). The major regulator of the mitotic cell cycle Cdc28<sup>Cdk1</sup>, on the other hand, promotes outer kinetochore assembly in human cells by stimulating the phospho-dependent recruitment of Ndc80 via CENP-T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huis In 't Veld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, in budding yeast the Cnn1-Ndc80c interaction is negatively regulated by Mps1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from these examples, however, it is still unclear how phospho-regulation is linked to cell cycle progression and which aspects of kinetochore function may be affected.</p><p>Here we set out to define mechanisms of phospho-regulation in the context of the budding yeast inner kinetochore. We identify multiple Cdk1 substrates in the yeast Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> complex and demonstrate that a subset of these sites constitute phospho-degron motifs that are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and recognized by the SCF-Cdc4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Our results reveal a molecular link between the core cell cycle machinery and key protein subunits of the inner kinetochore that serves to couple kinetochore subunit turnover to cell cycle progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping of native phosphorylation sites identifies multiple candidate Cdk1 substrates in the yeast CCAN</title><p>To investigate the phosphorylation status of native yeast CCAN subunits, we affinity-purified TAP-tagged components representing major CCAN subcomplexes (Chl4<sup>CENP-N</sup>-TAP, Mcm16<sup>CENP-H</sup>-TAP, Cnn1<sup>CENP-T</sup>-TAP, Mhf1<sup>CENP-S</sup>-TAP, Mhf2<sup>CENP-X</sup>-TAP) from log-phase yeast extracts and identified phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry.

The phosphorylation of the Ame1-Okp1 complex was dependent on the hydrophobic patch, a known substrate docking region in Clb5 and Clb2 cyclins, and a slightly stronger docking potentiation was seen in case of Okp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation analysis of the essential constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) subunit Ame1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Organization of the essential CCAN component Ame1<sup>CENP-U</sup> and localization of phosphorylation sites. Ame1 shows a Cdk1 phosphorylation cluster (T31, S41, S45, S52, S53, S59, S101) at the N-terminus.

For the subsequent analysis, we focused on seven N-terminal phosphorylation sites as the two C-terminal sites Ser277 and Ser323 were not phosphorylated by Cdc28-Clb2 in vitro. To analyze the functional role of Ame1 phosphorylation, we mutated the cluster to either alanine (Ame1-7A) or glutamic acid (Ame1-7E) to eliminate or mimic phosphorylation, respectively. We integrated Flag-tagged Ame1 constructs under their endogenous promoter with these mutations into yeast and analyzed cell extracts by western blotting. Analysis of log phase extracts showed that wild-type Ame1 displayed multiple slowly migrating forms that were eliminated in the 7A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, Ame1-7E migrated much more slowly than wild-type, its position in SDS-PAGE corresponding to the most slowly migrating forms of Ame1-WT. Ame1-7A and -7E mutants were viable when expressed as the sole source of Ame1 in the cell. In an anchor-away approach, in which endogenous Ame1 is removed from the nucleus upon addition of rapamycin, both Ame1-7A and -7E variants supported viability with little difference in growth rate on rich media compared to wild-type Ame1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of internal truncations, which maintained the essential Mtw1c-binding N-terminus (residues 1–15), showed that deleting the region harboring the entire phospho-cluster (Δ31–116) yielded a slow growth phenotype, while a more extensive deletion was inviable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We conclude that Ame1 phosphorylation is not required for viability, but the N-terminus contributes to an important aspect of Ame1 function, even when the Mtw1-binding domain is retained.

By contrast, Okp1 expressed from the same plasmid showed no change in protein level in the different Ame1 mutants, arguing that differences in plasmid stability or mitotic retention cannot be the cause for the observed effect on the Ame1 protein level. In order to simplify quantification of the Ame1 signal, whole-cell extracts were treated with lambda phosphatase. This resulted in a collapse of the slowly migrating forms of Ame1-WT.

This experiment confirmed the accumulation of Ame1 phosphorylation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As the steady-state protein level is determined by the rate of protein translation versus degradation, and the rate of production should be unaffected in these experiments, we reasoned that non-phosphorylatable Ame1 mutants may accumulate due to impaired protein degradation. The levels of Cse4, part of the centromeric nucleosome and a direct binding partner of Ame1-Okp1, have been shown to be regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis via the E3 ubiquitin ligase Psh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ranjitkar et al., 2010</xref>).

Analysis of Ame1 protein levels after 5 hr of expression in the presence of galactose showed that preventing phosphorylation on Thr31 had relatively little effect on Ame1 level when compared to the wild-type. By contrast, preventing phosphorylation at Ser41, Ser45, or Ser52/53 led to accumulation of the protein, roughly similar to preventing phosphorylation altogether in the 7A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We prepared the analogous Ame1 mutants as recombinant Ame1-Okp1 (AO) complexes for in vitro kinase assays to evaluate the contribution of these individual sites to overall Ame1 phosphorylation. Autoradiographs showed that in addition to Ame1 also Okp1 can be phosphorylated by Cdc28-Clb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ame1-WT appeared as two separated phosphorylated forms after in vitro phosphorylation. The Ame1-T31A mutant displayed a similar phosphorylation pattern, while the phosphorylation of Ame1-4A was clearly decreased, with only the fast migrating Ame1 form remaining. The Ame1-7A mutant completely eliminated Cdc28-Clb2 phosphorylation in vitro. Preventing phosphorylation on either Ser41/Ser45 or Ser52/Ser53 allowed some residual phosphorylation, but clearly decreased phosphorylation compared to wild-type. We conclude that the residues responsible for Ame1 level regulation in vivo are major targets for Cdc28 phosphorylation in vitro. Further analysis confirmed that mutating the candidate Cdk1 site Ser26 in Okp1 to alanine prevented Cdc28 phosphorylation and that the Ame1-7A/Okp1-1A complex was completely refractory to Cdc28 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Post-translational modification via phosphorylation can be mechanistically linked to the control of protein stability via the generation of so-called phospho-degrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skowyra et al., 1997</xref>).

How does this relate to the regulation of endogenous Ame1? To test this, we constructed Ame1 mutants expressed from their endogenous promoter. To simplify the complex phosphorylation pattern of wild-type Ame1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>), we generated alanine mutants that either allowed phosphorylation of the motifs 1 and 2, but prevented phosphorylation of the remaining sites (Ame1-3A, CPD only), or, conversely, prevented motif 1 and 2 phosphorylation, but allowed the remaining sites to be phosphorylated (Ame1-4A, CPD null). Western blotting showed that motif 1/2 phosphorylation of endogenous Ame1 was cell cycle dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). S-phase-arrested cells displayed a single slowly migrating Ame1 form in addition to unmodified Ame1, while M-phase-arrested cells were maximally phosphorylated with two slowly migrating forms becoming apparent. In the Ame1-4A mutant (CPD null), all slowly migrating forms were eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We followed Ame1 phosphorylation over the course of the cell cycle after release from alpha-factor. Consistent with the analysis of the arrests, we observed that motif 1/2 phosphorylation occurred in a stepwise manner with fully phosphorylated forms appearing 30 min into the cell cycle. FACS analysis demonstrated that by this time cells had completed replication and were in M-phase with a 2C DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, phosphorylated Ame1 forms gradually diminished between minute 30 and 60 and only unmodified Ame1 and a single slowly migrating form remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This indicates that degron motifs on authentic Ame1 are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and lead to disappearance of the phosphorylated forms in M-phase. We additionally analyzed Pds1 degradation kinetics in different Ame1 mutants over the cell cycle. Ame1-3A phosphorylation was highly reproducible, while Ame1-4A eliminated all phosphorylation events observable by shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). Interestingly, Ame1 mutants in which only phosphorylation on motif 1 was allowed (Ame1-5A1) or only on motif 2 (Ame1-5A2) also largely eliminated the characteristic stepwise phosphorylation of Ame1-3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), showing that full phosphorylation is mutually dependent on the presence of both motif 1 and motif 2.

We show that an important function of Cdk1 phosphorylation is to generate phospho-degron motifs on selected inner kinetochore subunits, including the essential COMA subunit Ame1, which are then recognized by the conserved ubiquitin ligase complex SCF with its phospho-adapter Cdc4. We note that Ame1 and Mcm21 peptides were also identified in a large-scale proteomic study geared towards enriching peptides simultaneously regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, ubiquitination of COMA subunits was detected for Okp1 (on residue Lys57) and Mcm21 (on residue Lys229).</p><p>While Cdk1 has been thought to promote kinetochore assembly in most contexts investigated so far, our study indicates that it can also act as a negative regulator of kinetochore assembly by targeting subunits for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This seems counterintuitive at first, given that kinetochores perform their essential role in segregating sister chromatids during mitosis. There are, however, important aspects in which the inner kinetochore subunit Ame1 differs from previously studied SCF substrates: while, for example, the Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 is fully degraded at the G1-S transition to allow replication initiation, our experiments indicate that only a subset of Ame1 is phosphorylated and subjected to the SCF-dependent pathway. Our biochemical experiments furthermore suggest that the pool of Ame1 regulated by this mechanism corresponds to molecules that are not bound to their binding partner within the kinetochore, the Mtw1c. Such excess Ame1 subunits were also present in our GAL-induced overexpression setting, in which we initially characterized the SCF-dependent regulation of Ame1. While this experiment creates an artificial situation in which the cell is challenged with an increased level of Ame1, this scenario likely also applies to the natural kinetochore assembly process. To ensure effective assembly during S-phase, free kinetochore subcomplexes must be present in excess amounts, otherwise they would become limiting for assembly and prevent the effective formation of a new kinetochore. However, these excess subunits could pose two challenges: first, they could favor ectopic assembly, which would lead to genetic instability. This is most critical for complexes that can effectively nucleate the formation of new kinetochores, such as Cse4. Also COMA might be an important target for regulation in this regard because it is near the top of the assembly hierarchy, contacts multiple other inner kinetochore subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2019</xref>), and contains DNA-binding elements. Second, excess free subcomplexes may compete with centromere-bound complexes for binding partners, thereby decelerating kinetochore assembly and making it less effective. It may therefore be beneficial for the cell to ‘funnel’ kinetochore assembly towards the centromere by preferentially destabilizing unassembled complexes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Mtw1c binding of Ame1-Okp1 subcomplexes shields degron phosphorylation in vitro and Mtw1c removal enhances Ame1 phosphorylation at the discovered motifs in vivo. This Mtw1c binding sensitive phosphorylation could ensure that only free, unused subcomplexes are removed by degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). From a structural standpoint, kinetochore subcomplexes typically combine relatively short, structured segments (often coiled-coil domains) with large unstructured domains that are the preferred targets of phosphorylation. In this context, phospho-degrons could be ideally suited as assembly sensors for kinetochores since they allow to distinguish excess subunits from properly assembled ones. By placing individually weak degron signals on separate subunits, the cell may allow COMA assembly from AO and CM complexes, while phosphorylation of the assembled COMA then creates stronger composite binding sites for Cdc4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for SCF-mediated regulation of COMA assembly at the budding yeast kinetochore.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme illustrating stepwise phosphorylation of the degron motif on Ame1 by Cdk1 and protection from phosphorylation within the kinetochore.

(<bold>B</bold>) Cell cycle regulation of COMA complex stability; for details, see discussion. In S-phase, COMA is only partially phosphorylated, allowing assembly at the kinetochore. In M-phase, free COMA is fully phosphorylated and targeted for degradation, while kinetochore-bound COMA is protected.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67390-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, we propose the following model for COMA phospho-regulation by Cdc28<sup>Cdk1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>): initial phosphorylation on Ame1 motifs 1 and 2 starts in S-phase but is not complete before M-phase. This ensures that sufficient free subcomplexes are available for kinetochore assembly. In parallel, the observation that individual degrons on AO or CM are weak permits COMA assembly from its subcomplexes. In M-phase, full degron phosphorylation destabilizes assembled COMA complexes, unless they are bound to the Mtw1 complex, which shields the degrons. The proper timing of phosphorylation is critical in this model. Premature phosphorylation of COMA would target it for destruction too early, likely compromising kinetochore assembly in S-phase. This could be the reason why the Ame1 phospho-sites are only gradually phosphorylated in vivo. Conversely, placing the stronger CPD<sup>ILTPP</sup> phospho-degron into Ame1 compromised growth in otherwise wild-type cells, but partially rescued the growth phenotypes of <italic>cdc4-1</italic> mutants. This argues that indeed key mitotic SCF substrates reside at the inner kinetochore. Our study adds to the description of molecular links between SCF and centromeres. Notably, a recent study has identified Cse4 as an SCF substrate in budding yeast and shown that Cse4 overexpression aggravates the growth defects of SCF mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, assembly and turnover of CBF3 complexes are defective in SCF mutants and both complexes contain Skp1 as a subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaplan et al., 1997</xref>). Skp1 mutants also influence the levels of the Mis12 complex at human kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies and Kaplan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gascoigne and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>), indicating that SCF-mediated regulation may be a conserved aspect of kinetochore biology.</p><p>While our experiments strongly implicate Ame1 as a Cdk1 and SCF substrate, they also show that the Ame1-7A mutant effectively prevents phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro, but does not induce a strong mitotic delay such as the <italic>skp1-3</italic> mutant. We speculate that the Ame1-7A mutant is not sufficient to fully prevent the mitotic defects of SCF, and additional phospho-targets must exist. We note that the Ame1-7A mutation leads to an increased Okp1 level in the <italic>cdc34-2</italic> mutant background, suggesting that it contributes to Okp1 level regulation at least under these specific conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, Okp1 itself appears to accumulate even more strongly in the <italic>cdc4-1</italic> mutant than Ame1. This makes it likely that additional, yet undiscovered degron signals exist. These could involve both non-consensus sites phosphorylated by Cdk1 and also kinases in addition to Cdk1, as is the case for multiple other SCF substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faustova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kõivomägi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Örd et al., 2019a</xref>). An additional key substrate may be Okp1, and some Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation sites (e.g., Ser70) have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holt et al., 2009</xref>), which are not direct Cdk1 sites. Potential kinases include Cdc5/Plk1 and indeed Ame1 residues Ser52/Ser53 constitute candidate Polo-box binding sites, and human CENP-U has been established as a kinetochore receptor for Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singh et al., 2021</xref>). Systematic analysis of kinetochore phosphorylation sites in SCF mutants may help to reveal the most crucial sites in the future. In addition, in vitro reconstitution of kinetochore complex binding to SCF can provide additional information on molecular requirements for binding and ubiquitination.</p><p>Previous work has defined the role of SCF-Cdc4 at the G1-S transition, but has also shown that Cdc4, as well as Cdc34 or Cdc53, remain essential genes in <italic>sic1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwob et al., 1994</xref>), demonstrating that there must be additional key substrates. Furthermore, SCF mutants that complete replication arrest at G2-M with a short spindle and an activated mitotic checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goh and Surana, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwob et al., 1994</xref>) (our unpublished observations). The relevant substrates for this mitotic function of SCF-Cdc4, however, have so far remained elusive. Our experiments indicate that Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> subunits are cell cycle-dependent substrates of SCF-Cdc4 and open up the possibility that regulation of kinetochores by SCF makes a critical contribution to the metaphase-anaphase transition. They also reveal that in addition to the well-established relationship between kinetochores and the E3 ligase APC/C, which regulates the metaphase-anaphase transition via the mitotic checkpoint complex, kinetochores are also molecularly linked to SCF, the other major RING-type E3 ligase complex that regulates the eukaryotic cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">S288C</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">See Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent, gene (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">See Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Flag (monoclonal, peroxidase conjugated)</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">A8592</td><td valign="top">1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-myc 9E10 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Catalog #626801</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mouse secondary (from sheep)</td><td valign="top">Cytiva LifeSciences</td><td valign="top">Catalog #NA931</td><td valign="top">1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-tubulin (monoclonal, peroxidase conjugated)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnologies</td><td valign="top">sc-53030</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">α-factor</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">1 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Hydroxyurea</td><td valign="top">US Biological Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">H9120</td><td valign="top">0.2 M</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Nocodazole</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">M1404-50MG</td><td valign="top">15 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Benomyl</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">45339-250MG</td><td valign="top">15–30 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Rapamycin</td><td valign="top">Diagonal</td><td valign="top">370.940.010</td><td valign="top">1 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cycloheximide</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">C7698-1G</td><td valign="top">50 µg/ml</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Vectors for protein expression and yeast strain generation.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Plasmid</th><th valign="top">Description</th><th valign="top">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top"><italic>Bacterial expression</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pSW698</td><td valign="top">pST39-Mtw1/Nsl1/Nnf1/6xHis-Dsn1</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hornung et al., 2014</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pSW900</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1/Ame1-6xHis</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hornung et al., 2014</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMLU16</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1/Ame1-7A-6xHis (T31A, S41A, S45A, S52A, S53A, S59A, S101A)</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMB91</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1/Ame1-S52A+S53A-6xHis</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMB92</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1/Ame1-T31A-6xHis</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMB93</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1/Ame1-S41A+S45A-6xHis</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMB94</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1/Ame1-4A-6xHis (S41A, S45A, S52A, S53A)</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMB109</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1-S26A/Ame1-6xHis</td><td valign="top">This study</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">pMB110</td><td valign="top">pST39-Okp1-S26A/Ame1-4A-6xHis (S41A, S45A, S52A.

bacterial cells were grown at 37°C until OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 and subsequently induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. Expressions were conducted overnight at 18–20 °C. Expression of Mtw1c and MN constructs was performed in BL21 (DE3; Novagen) and AO was expressed in Rosetta 2(pLys) (DE3) cells (EMD Millipore). Cdc28-Clb2 was overexpressed in the protease-deficient yeast strain DDY1810 overnight at 30°C using 2% galactose. Lysis, wash, and elution buffers as well as chromatography steps varied for the different protein complexes and are described in the individual sections. The Poly-Histidine fusion proteins were isolated with HisTrap HP 5 ml columns. The kinase complex was isolated using IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow and calmodulin sepharose 4B affinity resin (both GE Healthcare). In the last step of all bacterially expressed proteins, the protein was passed over a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column that was appropriate for the proteins size while elution of proteins was measured by absorbance at 280 nm using an Äkta FPLC System connected to a Windows-based laptop running the UNICORN control software. All proteins were concentrated to the desired concentration except the kinase complex and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before stored at −80°C until usage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mtw1c</title><p>The Mtw1 complex (Mtw1c) used in this study includes an N-terminal 171 amino acid truncation of the Dsn1 subunit and an N-terminal 6xHis tag at the same protein.

Final rapamycin concentration in plates or liquid media was 1 μg/ml. For protein stability assays, cells were treated with rapamycin for 180 min, followed by the addition of cycloheximide (CHX) with a final concentration of 50 µg/ml. Serial twofold dilutions of overnight cultures were prepared on 96-well plates in minimal medium starting from OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4 for anchor-away approach or 0.5 for overexpression approach. The dilutions were spotted on YPD medium with and without rapamycin or on minimal medium with either glucose or raffinose + galactose (2% each) and grown at 30°C for 2–3 days. To confirm phenotypes observed in the serial dilution assays for Ame1 mutants, Ame1 hemizygous deletion strains were used to introduce Ame1 wild-type or phospho-mutants at an exogenous locus before haploid spores were produced. Pds1-13xMyc was integrated exogenously into haploid strains for cell cycle experiments. For overexpression of proteins, pESC two-micron plasmids were transformed into haploid wild-type or SCF mutant strains without integration into the genome and clone pools were used for further analyses. Selective pressure was used for maintenance of the plasmids. Expression of integrated proteins was checked for all created yeast strains by protein extraction from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kushnirov, 2000</xref>) and western blotting against the respective tags of individual proteins (see Key resources table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>GAL overexpression</title><p>For overexpression studies, strains containing two-micron plasmids were grown overnight in YEPD.

Lysis was generated through mechanic disruption using acid-washed glass beads and vortexing for 1.5 min at 4°C, 1 mM DTT in the lysis buffer, and additionally 0.1% NP-40. The supernatant was spun at high speed and protein concentration was measured using Bradford Reagent. 30 µl lysate with 2 mg/ml protein concentration was treated with 1 µl of lambda phosphatase (NEB) for 30 min at room temperature.

For performing the simulations, the control peptide in the crystal structure was removed and manually replaced by the candidate peptides, with further optimization using the FlexPepDock webserver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">London et al., 2011</xref>). All the simulations were performed using the AMBER software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2014</xref>).

GaMD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2015</xref>) were performed in explicit solvent using a TIP3P water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) box with sufficient counterions (Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup>) to ensure the overall electroneutrality of the system. The parameters of the ions were taken from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joung and Cheatham, 2008</xref>). Periodic boundary conditions were implemented along with Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) for computing the long-range electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheatham et al., 1995</xref>). The systems were minimized in two steps (using 10,000 conjugate gradient and 10,000 steepest descent cycles for both steps). In step 1, the protein-peptide complex was restrained using a force constant of 50 kcal/mol A<sup>−2</sup>, and only the ions and solvent molecules were allowed to relax. In step 2, the restraints were removed, and the whole assembly was allowed to relax. The minimized systems were heated to room temperature (40 ps) and underwent equilibration (5 ns). Finally, GaMD simulations were performed for 100 ns (three replicas, NPT). The trajectories were processed using the Cpptraj code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roe and Cheatham, 2013</xref>), and the downloadable version of the Ligplot tool was used to create 2D interaction plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wallace et al., 1995</xref>). For the clustering of the GaMD replicas, we utilized the concepts of hierarchical agglomerative clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shao et al., 2007</xref>), with a cutoff distance of 3 Å between any identified clusters.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mathias Peter and Sue Biggins for providing strains and plasmids.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper presents convincing genetic and biochemical evidence that the kinetochore protein Ame1(CENP-U) contains a phospho-degron which regulates its stability, and that phosphorylation of this degron is reduced when Ame1 is bound to another kinetochore protein, Mtw1(Mis12). These findings led the authors to an interesting model: they suggest that cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of phosphodegrons in kinetochore proteins may allows cells to have an abundance of kinetochore proteins during kinetochore assembly in S-phase, ensuring efficient assembly, but avoid any excess kinetochore proteins during mitosis, when they could be detrimental. This is an attractive model for kinetochore biology that merits further exploration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Differentially accessible Cdc4 phospho-degrons regulate Ctf19<sup>CCAN</sup> kinetochore subunit stability in mitosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that the binding of the Mtw1 complex shields the Ame1 phosphodegron is arguably one of the most significant and interesting claims made in this paper. However, the evidence presented to support this claim relies exclusively on in vitro data. Thus, this part is out of balance with other parts of the paper where some in vivo correlations are attempted/made. All reviewers felt that this finding requires additional confirmation in vivo.</p><p>This could take several forms. For example:</p><p>– Determining the phosphorylation status of Ame1 at kinetochores (or on chromatin) versus in the soluble fraction. This could be done in skp1-3 mutants in order to avoid degradation of the phosphorylated Ame1.</p><p>– Using mutants in which Mtw1c or Ame1 cannot bind to one another.</p><p>– Depletion of Mtw1c, measuring Ame1 amount and phosphorylation.</p><p>2) The simplification of the phosphorylation patterns of Ame1 to CPD-only and CPD-null for tracking throughout the cell cycle (Figure 6) is logical, but it would be good to see the data for WT Ame1.</p><p>3) Some additional evidence on the functional consequences of the phosphoregulation is required: does a failure to remove the phosphorylated pool indeed lead to mitotic defects, or does precocious phosphorylation/degradation lead to kinetochore assembly defects? Some experimental possibilities are listed below. We do not expect all to be addressed, but some evidence beyond of what is currently shown is needed.</p><p>– Figure 1 shows that expressing Ame1 phosphomutants has no impact on general viability. However, it would be interesting to characterize whether these mutants result in any modest mitotic phenotypes or cell cycle delays, including in a colony sectoring assay for mini-chromosome loss or other sensitized assays.</p><p>– If Ame1 is precociously degraded in S-phase, kinetochore assembly should be impaired. It may be possible to test this with the Ame1-CPD-ILTPP mutant, or by finding another way to induce precocious phosphorylation or degradation.</p><p>– The model predicts changes in Ame1 abundance throughout the cell cycle. Whether this is consistent with the data in Figure 6 is not entirely clear. Do the authors think that only a minor pool is affected? In the absence of clearer data, the authors should use caution in their wording throughout the paper.</p><p>– The model strongly predicts that the mitotic degradation of Ame1 does not impact its abundance at centromeres. Some measurement (fluorescence of a tagged Ame1 or a ChIP on centromere DNA) of Ame1 at centromeres before and through mitosis would help instill confidence in the proposal.</p><p>4) The reviewers suggest several modifications to the text that should make it easier to follow the authors' arguments:</p><p>4a) Discussion of the results in Figure 8:</p><p>The section 'overexpression of COMA is toxic to cells' reads a bit like an afterthought, or perhaps an attempt to address the critique that the paper focuses on Ame1 at the expense of other COMA/CCAN components. This section should either be experimentally strengthened or could be incorporated into previous sections. With respect to strengthening: the authors argue that expressing proteins of the COMA complex in excess could result in ectopic kinetochore assembly. If maintaining this claim, this should be assessed by looking at the localization of COMA proteins following overexpression.</p><p>The growth assay shows that overexpression of COMA is toxic, but this toxicity does not seem to be aggravated by making COMA non-phosphorylatable – suggesting that phosphorylation is largely irrelevant in the overexpression toxicity. Why the phosphomutants show less accumulation than the WT in this assay remained unclear.</p><p>4b) More consistent use in the Results section of a summary sentence stating the conclusions of the experiments described, prior to moving on to the next set of experiments, would make it much easier to follow the text.</p><p>The text as a whole could use copyediting, in particular a few commas need to be added to separate clauses and make sentences clearer.</p><p>4c) Citations:</p><p>Some citations in the introduction (particularly the review articles) are a bit dated, and more updated citations could be added instead of or in addition to what is already cited.</p><p>The discussion and citations could include papers that have touched on connections between SCF and the centromere/kinetochore in human cells, for example Davies/Kaplan JCB 2010 and Gascoigne/Cheeseman JCB 2013, and the results by Au/Basrai PLoS Genetics 2020 maybe deserve a little more discussion with respect to the influence of SCF on budding yeast mitosis. In line 1016, the paper cited may not be the one that the authors intended to cite.</p><p>4d) Title and abstract:</p><p>– The title does not reflect the central model. As it stands, it is about 'subunit' stability with no context or proposal for what this would accomplish for chromosome segregation to occur with high fidelity.</p><p>– Abstract lines 30-32 are hard to understand. The version of the same sentence in the introduction paragraph to the main text works better.</p><p>– Abstract lines 42/43: &quot;…phospho-regulated clearance of excess CCAN subunits protects against ectopic kinetochore assembly and contributes to mitotic checkpoint silencing&quot;. This sentence would benefit from rewording for two reasons:</p><p>(i) The authors suggest that ectopic kinetochores may form if the CCAN phospho-regulation fails. This seems unlikely, since the excess kinetochore subunits will not have a binding platform on chromatin. However, an excess of soluble kinetochore proteins may compete for binding partners with the kinetochore-bound pool, and this may result in some mitotic defects.</p><p>(ii) It is unclear how the authors imagine that the observed phosphoregulation contributes to checkpoint silencing. The fact that SCF mutants arrest with an active checkpoint does not necessarily mean that the SCF or Ame1 degradation contributes actively to checkpoint silencing.</p><p>4e) Legends:</p><p>Generally, please provide more information in the legends. For example, in Figure 2, explain YEPD and YEPR; in Figure 4A/B mention that overexpression is used; in Figure 6A, explain how the different arrests were obtained. The diagram in the upper-right corner of Figure 1 appears to be intended as part of Figure 1a; this could be made clearer both visually and in the figure legend. In the legend to Supplementary Figure 2, A and B are reversed compared to the actual figure.</p><p>4f) Main text:</p><p>Line 65: the term 'inner centromere' is used for where the CCAN is located. 'Inner centromere' generally refers to the inter-kinetochore space on the chromatin between kinetochore-forming chromatin where the CPC is located in many species. I think 'inner kinetochore' is better to use here.</p><p>Lines 68-72: the wording suggests that Mif2/CENP-C and COMA make up the entirety of the CCAN. Reword to make it clear that you are merely highlighting these two components. As it is, this is likely to cause confusion later when you mention other CCAN subunits and list representatives of each major subcomplex (lines 126-127) without introducing these other components. Similarly, the introduction of the KMN network should more clearly explain the relationship between this network and the CCAN.</p><p>Lines 85-93: The introduction of the concept that CENP-A nucleosome assembly can lead to a new kinetochore is not clearly written. It starts with the idea of CENP-A overexpression in experiments and in the context of cancer. It then goes to tether-experiments of some CCAN components to chromosome arms sites in human cells, and then back to mechanisms in budding yeast for degrading overexpressed CENP-A. This is difficult to follow. In budding yeast, CEN DNA seems to drive the show. That being said, excess components not at centromeres would titrate out other components or otherwise poison faithful kinetochore assembly. The point that there is danger to kinetochores can be made without invoking ectopic kinetochore formation.</p><p>Line 87: one example of many in which the authors use a human gene name without the yeast equivalent, then soon thereafter (ex: line 93) use the yeast version. This should be standardized across the manuscript (or at least in the introduction/discussion) to avoid causing confusion.</p><p>Lines 130-136: The explanation for why the authors chose to pursue Ame1 phosphorylation and exclude other CCAN subunits with promising phosphorylation motifs (for example: Mcm21, Nkp1) is incomplete/insufficient.</p><p>Line 146 &quot;Okp1 is a better substrate for.… Cdk1-Clb5&quot; – this seems to depend on what one compares to. Compared to Ame1, yes, but even Okp1 seems a better substrate for Cdk1-Clb2 than for Cdk1-Clb5. Please re-phrase. The following sentence only mentions hp-dependence of Okp1, although Ame1 phosphorylation also seems to depend on the hp.</p><p>Line 184: The graph in Figure 2C lacks the quantification of the 7E mutant. Either only cite 2B, or add the 7E data to 2C.</p><p>Line 189: first example of a few in which a yeast mutant is given by name without explanation of what it represents. This example in particular is the first mention of mad1 in the text and so a reader who is unfamiliar with the field is unlikely to understand the relevance of the experiment presented. In some cases, better explanations of yeast strains are provided in the figure legends than in the text. A brief explanation of what mad1 is (in this example) would be very helpful to a non-expert reader.</p><p>Line 194: Please define the abbreviation AO-or avoid it altogether.</p><p>Lines 390-401: This paragraph is a bit hard to follow without the context provided in the last sentence. Perhaps it could be reorganized to make it easier for the reader to follow and understand the significance of the results described.</p><p>On line 422, the authors refer to Figure 3 a,b as showing stabilization of Ame1 in the absence of SCF. However, it is actually Figure 4 that shows this.</p><p>Line 443 &quot;other kinases must contribute&quot;: There are likely other phosphorylation site, but it seems formally possible that those are CDK1 sites – albeit not fitting the consensus.</p><p>Line 519: &quot;does not fully prevent SCF regulation of the inner kinetochore&quot;. It may be better to say &quot;does not fully prevent the mitotic effects of SCF&quot; or something along these lines, leaving out &quot;inner kinetochore&quot;-since SCF may well act on other mitotic structures than the inner kinetochore.</p><p>Table 2: The phosphoglycerate kinase antibody may not have been used in this paper?</p><p>(5) Other technical suggestions:</p><p>– Multiple phosphorylated forms of Ame1 exist and run differently on a gel, which may influence the protein level comparisons in Figure 2B/E and S2.

However, the evidence presented to support this claim relies exclusively on in vitro data. Thus, this part is out of balance with other parts of the paper where some in vivo correlations are attempted/made. All reviewers felt that this finding requires additional confirmation in vivo.</p><p>This could take several forms. For example:</p><p>– Determining the phosphorylation status of Ame1 at kinetochores (or on chromatin) versus in the soluble fraction. This could be done in skp1-3 mutants in order to avoid degradation of the phosphorylated Ame1.</p><p>– Using mutants in which Mtw1c or Ame1 cannot bind to one another.</p><p>– Depletion of Mtw1c, measuring Ame1 amount and phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have constructed several new yeast strains to address this important point. In particular, we have combined Ame1-3A and -4A mutants with Mtw1-FRB in an anchor-away strain, which allows removal of the Mtw1 complex from the nucleus and follow Ame1 phosphorylation specifically at the identified motifs 1 and 2. The results of the experiment are shown in the new Figure 7C-E. Upon removal of Mtw1c from the nucleus, phosphorylation at motif 1 and 2 gradually increases over time (<bold>7</bold>D). Using this anchor-away setting we also analyzed the stability of phospho-forms of Ame1 in presence or absence of the binding partner Mtw1c. Upon inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, slowly migrating forms of Ame1 disappeared when Mtw1 was removed from the nucleus, but persisted when Mtw1c was still present (<bold>7</bold>E). Taken together, these in-vivo results complement the in vitro analysis on degron shielding by the Mtw1 complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The simplification of the phosphorylation patterns of Ame1 to CPD-only and CPD-null for tracking throughout the cell cycle (Figure 6) is logical, but it would be good to see the data for WT Ame1.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have included the cell cycle experiment also for Ame1-WT in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A. The blot shows a dynamic phosphorylation pattern with phosphorylated Ame1 forms accumulating and some of them disappearing around min 60. The complexity of the pattern justifies the use of the Ame1-3A mutant to deconvolve the phosphorylation events and specifically analyze motif 1 and 2 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some additional evidence on the functional consequences of the phosphoregulation is required: does a failure to remove the phosphorylated pool indeed lead to mitotic defects, or does precocious phosphorylation/degradation lead to kinetochore assembly defects? Some experimental possibilities are listed below. We do not expect all to be addressed, but some evidence beyond of what is currently shown is needed.</p><p>– Figure 1 shows that expressing Ame1 phosphomutants has no impact on general viability. However, it would be interesting to characterize whether these mutants result in any modest mitotic phenotypes or cell cycle delays, including in a colony sectoring assay for mini-chromosome loss or other sensitized assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a colony sectoring assay (Hieter et al., Cell 1985) to analyze differences in chromosome segregation fidelity between the Ame1 mutants. We find a modest increase in mis-segregation for the Ame1-7A mutant versus wild-type, the <italic>ctf19</italic> deletion strain serves as a positive control in this experiment.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Chromosome transmission fidelity experiment: Transmission of a chromosome fragment containing the SUP11 gene is assayed (Hieter et al.</title><p>, 1985).

We see a subtle delay when phosphorylation is prevented at motif 2 (S41 S45), based on Pds1 degradation kinetics and in the FACS plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>, C), although the difference is so modest it may still be within the range of experimental variation.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Western blot analysis of Ame1-3A (phosphorylation at S41/45 and S52/53 allowed) versus Ame1-5A1 (phosphorylation at S41 S45 prevented).</title><p>B.

Because of the subtlety of the effect, we show this additional analysis only here. In the manuscript, we have added additional explanations to the discussion, why the described Ame1 phospho-null mutant do not show stronger phenotypes, and how additional degron sequences can be identified and analyzed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If Ame1 is precociously degraded in S-phase, kinetochore assembly should be impaired. It may be possible to test this with the Ame1-CPD-ILTPP mutant, or by finding another way to induce precocious phosphorylation or degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have characterized the Ame1-CPD<sup>ILTPP</sup> mutant further by crossing it to selected inner KT mutants predicted to be impaired in kinetochore assembly.

We have improved the Discussion section to better cover this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The model strongly predicts that the mitotic degradation of Ame1 does not impact its abundance at centromeres.

This section should either be experimentally strengthened or could be incorporated into previous sections. With respect to strengthening: the authors argue that expressing proteins of the COMA complex in excess could result in ectopic kinetochore assembly. If maintaining this claim, this should be assessed by looking at the localization of COMA proteins following overexpression.</p><p>The growth assay shows that overexpression of COMA is toxic, but this toxicity does not seem to be aggravated by making COMA non-phosphorylatable – suggesting that phosphorylation is largely irrelevant in the overexpression toxicity. Why the phosphomutants show less accumulation than the WT in this assay remained unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this section felt somewhat disconnected from the rest of the paper. We have removed the original Figure 8 and the corresponding section from the revised manuscript and include the information on the toxicity of overexpressing the entire COMA complex now as a separate panel in the new Figure 4D instead. We feel that this experiment is necessary to demonstrate the overall importance of COMA level regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b) More consistent use in the Results section of a summary sentence stating the conclusions of the experiments described, prior to moving on to the next set of experiments, would make it much easier to follow the text.</p><p>The text as a whole could use copyediting, in particular a few commas need to be added to separate clauses and make sentences clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Results section to improve readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4c) Citations:</p><p>Some citations in the introduction (particularly the review articles) are a bit dated, and more updated citations could be added instead of or in addition to what is already cited.</p><p>The discussion and citations could include papers that have touched on connections between SCF and the centromere/kinetochore in human cells, for example Davies/Kaplan JCB 2010 and Gascoigne/Cheeseman JCB 2013, and the results by Au/Basrai PLoS Genetics 2020 maybe deserve a little more discussion with respect to the influence of SCF on budding yeast mitosis. In line 1016, the paper cited may not be the one that the authors intended to cite.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have removed the “Daniel et al.” citation from line 1016. We have added the citations Kaplan JCB2010 and Gascoigne/Cheeseman 2013 to the Discussion section (line 519 ff.) We also updated some of the citations in the introduction (e.g. line 80 ff, line 90).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4d) Title and abstract:</p><p>– The title does not reflect the central model. As it stands, it is about 'subunit' stability with no context or proposal for what this would accomplish for chromosome segregation to occur with high fidelity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have used the sentence from the introduction in the revised abstract (line 30). We have rephrased the title to make it more specific for the findings regarding Ame1 and to avoid too general claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Abstract lines 30-32 are hard to understand. The version of the same sentence in the introduction paragraph to the main text works better.</p><p>– Abstract lines 42/43: &quot;…phospho-regulated clearance of excess CCAN subunits protects against ectopic kinetochore assembly and contributes to mitotic checkpoint silencing&quot;. This sentence would benefit from rewording for two reasons:</p><p>(i) The authors suggest that ectopic kinetochores may form if the CCAN phospho-regulation fails. This seems unlikely, since the excess kinetochore subunits will not have a binding platform on chromatin. However, an excess of soluble kinetochore proteins may compete for binding partners with the kinetochore-bound pool, and this may result in some mitotic defects.</p><p>(ii) It is unclear how the authors imagine that the observed phosphoregulation contributes to checkpoint silencing. The fact that SCF mutants arrest with an active checkpoint does not necessarily mean that the SCF or Ame1 degradation contributes actively to checkpoint silencing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these valuable points. We note that excess inner kinetochore proteins that contain DNA or chromatin-binding domains could be more susceptible to induce ectopic kinetochore formation than excess outer kinetochore components. We fully agree that titrating away subunits from the kinetochore-bound pool by excess unbound subunits is another important problem. We now mention both of these possibilities in the revised discussion (line 478 ff). We have removed the point on checkpoint silencing from the revised abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4e) Legends:</p><p>Generally, please provide more information in the legends. For example, in Figure 2, explain YEPD and YEPR; in Figure 4A/B mention that overexpression is used; in Figure 6A, explain how the different arrests were obtained. The diagram in the upper-right corner of Figure 1 appears to be intended as part of Figure 1a; this could be made clearer both visually and in the figure legend. In the legend to Supplementary Figure 2, A and B are reversed compared to the actual figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected these points in the legends to Figures 2, 4 and 6 of the revised manuscript. We have corrected the numbering in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4f) Main text:</p><p>Line 65: the term 'inner centromere' is used for where the CCAN is located. 'Inner centromere' generally refers to the inter-kinetochore space on the chromatin between kinetochore-forming chromatin where the CPC is located in many species. I think 'inner kinetochore' is better to use here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording and now use the term “inner kinetochore”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 68-72: the wording suggests that Mif2/CENP-C and COMA make up the entirety of the CCAN. Reword to make it clear that you are merely highlighting these two components. As it is, this is likely to cause confusion later when you mention other CCAN subunits and list representatives of each major subcomplex (lines 126-127) without introducing these other components. Similarly, the introduction of the KMN network should more clearly explain the relationship between this network and the CCAN.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the respective section to improve readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 85-93: The introduction of the concept that CENP-A nucleosome assembly can lead to a new kinetochore is not clearly written. It starts with the idea of CENP-A overexpression in experiments and in the context of cancer. It then goes to tether-experiments of some CCAN components to chromosome arms sites in human cells, and then back to mechanisms in budding yeast for degrading overexpressed CENP-A. This is difficult to follow. In budding yeast, CEN DNA seems to drive the show. That being said, excess components not at centromeres would titrate out other components or otherwise poison faithful kinetochore assembly. The point that there is danger to kinetochores can be made without invoking ectopic kinetochore formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-organized this section starting at line 85, and have removed the CCAN tethering experiments to streamline the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 87: one example of many in which the authors use a human gene name without the yeast equivalent, then soon thereafter (ex: line 93) use the yeast version.

The following sentence only mentions hp-dependence of Okp1, although Ame1 phosphorylation also seems to depend on the hp.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this point in the revised manuscript to make our statement more precise (line 143 ff). The respective section now reads: “Quantitative phosphorylation analysis confirmed that in the Ame1-Okp1 complex, Clb2-Cdk1 preferentially phosphorylated Ame1, whereas Clb5-Cdk1 preferred Okp1. The phosphorylation of the Ame1-Okp1 complex was dependent on the hydrophobic patch, a known substrate docking region in Clb5 and Clb2 cyclins, and a slightly stronger docking potentiation was seen in case of Okp1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 184: The graph in Figure 2C lacks the quantification of the 7E mutant.
