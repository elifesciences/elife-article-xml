activity in the ascending auditory pathway. The rate of IHC action potential bursts is modulated by inner supporting cells (ISCs) of Kölliker’s organ through the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup>-channel TMEM16A (ANO1). Here, we show that conditional deletion of <italic>Ano1</italic> (<italic>Tmem16a</italic>) in mice disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves within Kölliker’s organ, reduces the burst-firing activity and the frequency selectivity of auditory brainstem neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), and also impairs the functional refinement of MNTB projections to the lateral superior olive. These results reveal the importance of the activity of Kölliker’s organ for the refinement of central auditory connectivity. In addition, our study suggests the involvement of TMEM16A in the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, which may also apply to other tissues expressing TMEM16A.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TMEM16A</kwd><kwd>ANO1</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>Kölliker's organ</kwd><kwd>auditory system</kwd><kwd>refinement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HU 800/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hübner</surname><given-names>Christian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>priority program 1608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strenzke</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name><name><surname>Moser</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Rübsamen</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01EW1706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hübner</surname><given-names>Christian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Ano1</italic> deletion disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves within Kölliker’s organ, reduces burst-firing activity and frequency selectivity of auditory brainstem neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, and impairs the functional refinement of its projections to the lateral superior olive.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Before hearing onset around postnatal day 12 (P12) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shnerson and Pujol, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>), the afferent auditory system exhibits cochlea-driven spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lippe, 1994</xref>).

Similar to developing motor and visual systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson and Landmesser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>), patterned activity of auditory neurons was proposed to promote activity-dependent refinement of auditory circuits before hearing onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clause et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clause et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the developing inner ear, non-sensory inner supporting cells (ISCs) form a transient epithelial structure known as Kölliker’s organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hinojosa, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2019</xref>). ATP released from ISCs through connexin hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzarda et al., 2020</xref>) activates purinergic receptors in a paracellular manner, leading to cell volume decrease of ISCs and cochlear Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tritsch and Bergles, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>). It was proposed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup>-channel TMEM16A, which is expressed in ISCs, might be the pacemaker for spontaneous cochlear activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, spontaneous osmotic cell shrinkage was shown to be mediated by TMEM16A-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux, which forces K<sup>+</sup> efflux from ISCs and thus the transient depolarization of IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Thereby, bursting activity of nearby IHCs, which will later respond to similar sound frequencies, becomes synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eckrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), establishing a possible scenario for tonotopic map refinement in central auditory structures.</p><p>Using <italic>Ano1</italic> conditional knockout mice, we show that TMEM16A not only modulates ISC volume but also drives the amplification of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves within the cochlea. Prior to hearing onset, knockout mice show reduced burst firing of neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), downstream of SGNs and neurons of the cochlear nucleus. Moreover, the frequency selectivity of individual MNTB neurons is diminished shortly after hearing onset (P14) pointing toward reduced refinement of auditory connections. Indeed, neurons from the lateral superior olive (LSO) received twice as many functional MNTB afferents in knockout mice compared to wildtype littermates. Taken together, these results suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup>-channel TMEM16A plays a significant role in the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and contributes to the refinement of auditory brainstem circuitries prior to hearing onset.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TMEM16A is required for the generation of cochlear Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves</title><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup>-channel TMEM16A is expressed in ISCs of Kölliker’s organ (for a schematic representation of a part of the organ of Corti, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; for a differential interference contrast [DIC] image, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yi et al., 2013</xref>) and is activated by an ATP-induced increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). The opening of TMEM16A triggers Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux, followed by K<sup>+</sup> efflux and cell shrinkage. The ensuing rise of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> drives electrical activity of immature IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

The TMEM16A signal in the cochlea migrates at a slightly higher molecular weight compared to the salivary gland, which might be explained by a difference in glycosylation or tissue-specific splicing. In cKO mice, the bands corresponding to TMEM16A were shifted to a smaller size, confirming that the knockout was successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinze et al., 2014</xref>).

The characteristic frequencies (CFs) of the recorded MNTB neurons, that is, the frequency value at which the neuron is excited with the lowest intensity , ranged between 5.3 and 30.5 kHz and did not differ between the two groups (mean CF ± SEM: WT = 15.4 ± 1.1 kHz [n = 25]; cKO = 16.2 ± 1.3 kHz [n = 32]; p=0.51, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test). MNTB neurons recorded from wildtype mice showed the typical V-shaped FRAs with acoustically driven excitation sharply narrowing toward lower intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

For wildtype mice, the median [25%, 75% quartiles] was Q<sub>10</sub> = 5.5 [4.7, 9.2], Q<sub>20</sub> = 4.6 [3.8, 6.8], and Q<sub>30</sub> = 3.6 [3.4, 5] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Overall CF threshold levels tended to show a larger variability in knockout compared to wildtype mice (cKO: –7.3 dB SPL to 48.3 dB SPL; WT: –8.4 dB SPL to 18.7 dB SPL). Furthermore, the sound-evoked firing properties of the MNTB neurons in cKO mice were also affected.

The large increase in MNTB input width in cKO mice reveals that LSO neurons located in the medial high-frequency region of the nucleus not only received input from neurons of the high-frequency (medial) region of the MNTB, but also from neurons in the mid-nuclear region tuned to lower frequencies.

The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup>-channel TMEM16A, which is expressed in Kölliker’s organ shortly before hearing onset, mediates spontaneous osmotic cell shrinkage of ISCs, which forces K<sup>+</sup> efflux and thus the transient depolarization of IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Thereby, bursting activity of nearby IHCs, which will later respond to similar sound frequencies, becomes synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eckrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), establishing a possible scenario for tonotopic map refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tritsch and Bergles, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that disruption of TMEM16A in the inner ear impairs prehearing cochlear activity and spontaneous burst firing as well as sensitivity and frequency selectivity of sound-evoked firing of MNTB neurons. Finally, we show that these alterations in prehearing auditory activity severely impair the refinement of the MNTB-LSO pathway.</p><p>Spontaneous activity of Kölliker’s organ is characterized by recurrent ATP-dependent changes in cell volume and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of ISCs. The decreases in cell volume reflect the passive movement of water associated with Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux upon activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup>-channel TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). In WT mice, we detected spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and volume changes of ISCs as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>). In cKO mice, however, volume changes were absent and Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves were reduced to local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Changes in cell volume can serve as a mechanical stimulus that activates robust and large ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Praetorius and Leipziger, 2009</xref>) and, in turn, ATP release through connexin hemichannels is attributed to the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves through the cochlear epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anselmi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schütz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mammano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jovanovic and Milenkovic, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzarda et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, TMEM16A-dependent volume changes may amplify ATP release via connexin hemichannels and thus promote the propagation of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. ATP-mediated amplification of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may further activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated TMEM16A Cl<sup>-</sup> channels in a positive feedback mechanism. First support of this model comes from our observation that the purinergic receptor blocker suramin abolished Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in WT cochlea (as also shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>) but did not affect the size of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cKO mice.</p><p>In corneal endothelial cells, which express TMEM16A as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2010</xref>), mechanical stimuli can induce similar ATP- and connexin hemichannel-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomes et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomes et al., 2005b</xref>). Airway, submandibular gland, olfactory epitehlium and biliary epithelia also express TMEM16A and can generate ATP-release-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves following mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hegg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dutta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felix et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grygorczyk and Hanrahan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Homolya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homolya et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romanenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ryu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanderson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watt et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, a positive feedback mechanism between TMEM16A and ATP receptors may also apply to other epithelia.</p><p>To analyze the impact of the disruption of TMEM16A on the auditory pathway, we performed in vivo juxtacellular recordings in the MNTB of cKO mice before and shortly after hearing onset. Burst-firing pattern of MNTB neurons was often completely absent or severely diminished in P9 cKO mice. MNTB neurons from P14 cKO mice also showed markedly diminished firing rates, indicating that they cannot respond to moderate-to-high-intensity stimulation with sufficient firing rates that are normally observed in wildtype littermates. As high sound intensities are coded by high firing rates, interaural-level differences might be affected and hence also sound source localization in cKO mice. Furthermore, individual MNTB neurons recorded from P14 cKO mice responded to sound stimuli from a much larger frequency range compared to wildtype mice. The reduced frequency selectivity could result from superfluous functional projections from globular bushy cells (GBCs) onto MNTB neurons. At P2, MNTB neurons receive on average 9.3 inputs from GBCs, which after a short period of intense competition and pruning end up in one calyx of Held, usually by P9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holcomb et al., 2013</xref>). Because the elimination of excessive inputs is probably activity-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holcomb et al., 2013</xref>), reduced bursting activity in cKO mice might result in MNTB neurons that receive more than one input and thus show broadened FRAs.</p><p>To test whether projection patterns between auditory nuclei in cKO mice are indeed altered, we examined MNTB projections to the LSO, a part of the sound localization pathway in which refinement has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clause et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim and Kandler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2019</xref>). The necessary spatial resolution was achieved with a fast galvanometric photolysis system, which allowed a fivefold improvement in area resolution compared to fiber optic-based uncaging systems used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clause et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim and Kandler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim and Kandler, 2010</xref>). In cKO mice, the number of functional connections of single LSO afferents (MNTB input area) and the respective mediolaterally covered area, that is, the area along the tonotopic axis (MNTB input width), was twice as large as in wildtype. Since it has been reported that LSO neurons normally lose about 50% of their afferents during the first two weeks of postnatal development of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noh et al., 2010</xref>), the present results imply that silencing of synaptic connections was strongly diminished in cKO mice.</p><p>Processes that underlie sensory network refinement are well studied in the visual system: Before onset of vision, bursting activity of retinal ganglion cells leads to the refinement of their projections to lateral geniculate nucleus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wong et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Penn et al., 1998</xref>). This process depends on the duration of bursts, inter-burst intervals, and the synchronization of bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stellwagen and Shatz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Torborg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butts et al., 2007</xref>), and was proposed to follow Hebbian plasticity rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hebb, 1949</xref>). Similar mechanisms also apply for the auditory system, where neighboring IHCs show synchronized bursting activity before the onset of hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, the firing patterns are less synchronized in cKO mice since simultaneous K<sup>+</sup> release is not triggered in the absence of TMEM16A-mediated Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Because synchronized bursting activity of neighboring IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>) is faithfully relayed to the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritsch et al., 2010</xref>), it is likely that LSO neurons receive desynchronized MNTB inputs in cKO mice. In WT mice, GABA spillover from MNTB axon terminals can lead to the excitation of nearby synapses via pre- and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weisz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>) and thus likely contributes to the synchronization of MNTB inputs. In cKO mice, however, the shorter bursting will diminish GABA spillover, thus further compromising the synchronization of MNTB inputs. Hence, only in WT mice tonotopically similar axons that overlap in the LSO can be simultaneously active and get strengthened, possibly via glycinergic LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach and Kandler, 2020</xref>), whereas tonotopically distinct axons that have less overlap in the LSO get silenced following associative plasticity rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hebb, 1949</xref>). This assumption is in agreement with the recent discovery that synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals of neighboring outer hair cells (OHCs) is required for proper refinement of afferent projections onto OHCs as well as the maturation of OHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ceriani et al., 2019</xref>). The synchronization of OHC activity is also mediated by ATP release from supporting cells, namely, Deiter’s cells, during the first two postnatal weeks in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Besides spontaneous activity of ISCs, IHC-firing patterns are also modulated by cholinergic medial olivocochlear efferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sendin et al., 2014</xref>), which transiently innervate immature IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simmons et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simmons et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Warr and Guinan, 1979</xref>). In mice that lack the α9 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α9 KO mice), this cholinergic input is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clause et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that α9 KO mice show more subtle changes in the bursting behavior of MNTB neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clause et al., 2014</xref>) than our cKO mice suggests a prevalent role of the activity of ISCs in shaping firing patterns of the early auditory pathway prior to onset of hearing. Still, our results showed reduced synaptic refinement before hearing onset similar to those of α9 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clause et al., 2014</xref>) and otoferlin KO mice, which exhibit drastically diminished spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2019</xref>) due to disrupted glutamate release from IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). While otoferlin KO mice have almost no discernible bursting activity, cKO mice showed a drastic reduction of the number of bursts. In contrast, the number of bursts was not changed in α9 KO mice. Firing rates within bursts did not differ between cKO and WT mice, but were 70–80% higher in α9 KO compared to WT mice. Overall firing rates, however, do not differ between both KO models. Consequently, we infer that the overall firing rate and firing rates within bursts, as well as the number of bursts, do not influence the physiological refinement of the MNTB-LSO pathway. Notably, the duration of bursts was markedly reduced in both KO mice (50% in α9 KO and 56% in cKO mice). Average ISIs, however, were significantly longer in cKO and shorter in α9 KO mice. Thus, it seems that both subtle and drastic changes in the temporal pattern and/or the duration of bursts can lead to a severe disruption of tonotopic maps. These changes have permanent consequences since tonotopic refinement of MNTB-LSO projections does not continue after hearing onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walcher et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, α9 knockout mice display diminished sound localization and sound frequency processing after hearing onset as revealed by behavioral studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clause et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whether TMEM16A-mediated prehearing activity has a similar impact on hearing after hearing onset remains to be determined. While ABR measurements in our study did not reveal gross alterations in signaling along the lower auditory pathway, our recordings from individual auditory brainstem neurons showed significantly elevated sound thresholds. We note that the discrepancy between significantly indistinguishable ABR thresholds and significantly elevated auditory thresholds of single MNTB neurons could arise for several reasons. First, by the nature of population vs. single-neuron responses, a direct correspondence is not warranted. Secondly, we speculate that the poorer tonotopic refinement of the auditory circuitry might have contributed to the higher thresholds of MNTB neurons involving cochlear excitation from IHCs off the peak of the traveling wave. However, other reasons cannot be excluded and a trend toward higher ABR thresholds was apparent for 6 and 24 kHz tone bursts.</p><p>The elevated sound thresholds and frequency selectivity that we observed in cKO mice at P14 could indicate impaired auditory processing after hearing onset. This is supported by findings showing that mutations in ion channels (hemichannel, gap junctions, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) involved in prehearing activity of Kölliker’s organ are linked to congenital deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Majumder et al., 2010</xref>). Recent publications have established a causal connection between the bursting patterns of the ascending auditory system and the tonotopic refinement of MNTB projections to the LSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clause et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2019</xref>), and our work supports this notion. Moreover, our results link the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in developing supporting cells as a peripheral mechanism contributing to the refinement of ascending circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In brief, inner ears were fixed at room temperature (RT) in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 11.5 hr. Inner ears from mice older than P5 were decalcified in 10% EDTA (PBS) at 4°C for 12 hr to up to 48 hr depending on the age of the mouse. Inner ears were cryoprotected with solutions with increasing sucrose concentrations (10–30% sucrose [PBS]) and kept in tissue Tek (Sakura) at 4°C. Embedded inner ears were shock frozen using a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cryosections (10 µm) of inner ears were cut in the coronal plane using a cryostat (Leica CM3050S cryostat).

Coronal brainstem slices (300–400 µm) were cut on a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1200S) in ice-cold dissection solution containing (in mM) 50 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 75 sucrose, 25 D-glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 2 Na pyruvate (280 mOsmol, pH 7.2). The solution was oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> during dissection. A single brain slice per animal was obtained, which contained the MNTB and LSO to reach a maximum possible preservation of connections between these two nuclei. Slices recovered for 30 min at 36°C and for an additional 30 min at RT in oxygenated recording solution containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 18 D-glucose, and 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (290 mOsmol, pH 7.2). For electrophysiological recordings, brain slices were transferred to a recording chamber, mounted on an upright microscope (Axio Examiner A.1, Zeiss), and perfused with oxygenated recording solution at a speed of 2 ml/min using a pressure-driven perfusion system (ALA-VM8, ALA Instruments). The LSO was identified using a digital camera (C10600 Orca R<sup>2</sup>, Hamamatsu). Recordings were made from neurons with bipolar morphology from the medial (high frequency) region of the LSO in order to obtain comparable results and because the highest degree of refinement was reported for this frequency region (Sanes and Siverls, 1991). Electrodes had a resistance of 4–5 MΩ (Biomedical Instruments) when filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 54 potassium gluconate, 56 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 sodium phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 0.3 NaGTP, and 2 MgATP (285 mOsmol, pH 7.2). Recordings were done in current-clamp in the whole-cell configuration at RT, and LSO neurons were held at 70 mV. Currents were acquired with an Axon CNS MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and lowpass filtered (3 kHz) and digitized (3 kHz) with a Digidata 1440A analog-to-digital converter (Molecular Devices) using the pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Photolysis of caged glutamate</title><p>Presynaptic MNTB neurons were localized by local uncaging of 120 µM MNI-caged glutamate trifluoroacetate (Femtonics) that was added to the recording solution. Uncaging of glutamate was controlled by a fast galvanometric photolysis system (UGA40, Rapp OptoElectronic) that was triggered via a TTL impulse. A 405 nm continuous diode laser (DL405, Rapp OptoElectronic) was used as a light source. Laser flashes were delivered through a light guide of 20 µm diameter (Rapp OptoElectronic) with a ×10 water-immersion objective that produced circular spots of 20 µm diameter in the focal plane. For mapping, a virtual grid was defined over (and around) the MNTB harboring 250,300 grid points (spaced 20 µm apart) using the UGA-40 control 1.1 software (Rapp OptoElectronic). Each grid point represented one uncaging site. Laser pulses of 10 ms duration were delivered with 6 s delay time between uncaging sites. This resulted in reproducible LSO-MNTB input maps confirmed by rescanning in some cases. Only one MNTB map was obtained per mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Reconstruction and analysis of MNTB-LSO input maps</title><p>Events were detected with template search methods during a 20 ms window starting from the onset of the laser illumination. Peak amplitudes of the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were measured (Clampfit 10.2 software, Molecular Devices). Each uncaging site that evoked PSP amplitudes greater than 2 mV in the recorded LSO neuron was considered as a functional MNTB-LSO connection and marked as colored square according to the following color code: yellow = depolarizations &gt; 2 mV, orange &gt; 10 mV, red = action potential. Stimulation sites that evoked PSPs smaller than 2 mV or no PSPs were considered as unresponsive MNTB areas and were left blank. The total area covered by all colored squares was defined as the MNTB input area. The analysis of the MNTB input area was done in pixels (1 pixel represents 1 µm<sup>2</sup>). The MNTB input area was calculated by multiplying the size of an uncaging site (~400 px) by the number of colored squares. The MNTB input area was normalized to the cross-sectional area of the MNTB. MNTB borders were determined by two investigators (one of them was blind to the mouse group) using images taken from the slices during the experiment. The result represents the MNTB input area in percent. The MNTB input width was calculated by measuring the maximal distance of stimulations sites that evoked depolarizations greater than 10 mV along the mediolateral axis. This distance was normalized to the mediolateral length of each MNTB. The result expresses the input width in percent along the tonotopic axis of the MNTB. On rare occasions, responses could be elicited from uncaging sites slightly ventral or dorsal to the defined MNTB boundaries in mice of both genotypes. These sites were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spatial resolution of glutamate uncaging</title><p>The spatial resolution was assessed by direct current-clamp whole-cell recordings from MNTB neurons. The holding potential was –70 mV and the electrode resistance was 34 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 54 potassium gluconate, 56 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 sodium phosphocreatine, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 0.3 NaGTP, and 2 MgATP (285 mOsmol, pH 7.2). A virtual 10 × 10 grid was defined over the recorded MNTB neuron with uncaging points spaced 10 μm apart. The ‘action potential-eliciting distance’ was defined as the maximal distance from the center of the uncaging site to the center of the cell body at which uncaging produced action potentials in the recorded MNTB neuron. The action potential-eliciting distance was measured for the mediolateral and dorsoventral direction of the MNTB. We used the determined action potential-eliciting distance to define the uncaging parameters for the mapping experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vivo recordings in the MNTB</title><p>Juxtacellular single-unit recordings were performed in mice before or right after hearing onset (P8, P14). Animals were anesthetized with an initial intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/g body weight; Ketavet, Pfizer) and xylazine hydrochloride (5 µg/g body weight; Rompun, Bayer). Throughout recording sessions, anesthesia was maintained by additional subcutaneous application of one-third of the initial dose, approximately every 90 min. The MNTB was approached dorsally and typically reached at penetrations depths of 5000–5500 μm.</p><p>The experimental protocol for acoustic stimulation and single-unit recording was described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, auditory stimuli were digitally generated using custom-written MATLAB software (The MathWorks Inc, Natick) at a sampling rate of 97.7 kHz. The stimuli were transferred to a real-time processor (RP2.1, Tucker-Davis Technologies), D/A converted and delivered through custom-made earphones (acoustic transducer: DT 770 pro, Beyer Dynamics). Two recording protocols were used: (i) pure tone pulses (100 ms duration, 5 ms rise-fall time, 100 ms interstimulus interval) were presented within a predefined matrix of frequency/intensity pairs to determine the excitatory response areas of single units. CF (sound frequency causing a significant increase of unit’s action potential spiking at the lowest intensity), the respective threshold, Q-values (Q<sub>n</sub>, a measure of the unit’s sharpness of tuning calculated as the ratio of CF to bandwidth at n = 10, 20 and 30 dB above threshold), and maximum discharge rates were computed from the response area and used for the next protocol. (ii) Spontaneous neuronal discharge activity was assessed in the absence of acoustic stimulation to determine the average firing rate and CV of ISIs (ISIs = time that passes between two successive action potentials). Regularity of spontaneous discharge activity was quantified by CV, calculated as the ratio of standard deviation of ISIs and mean ISI. Additional analysis was done for MNTB units recorded in P8 mice, where spontaneous spiking discharges are grouped in bursts followed by periods of greatly reduced discharge activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>). We used a statistical test based on gamma probability distribution of ISIs to determine the number and duration of bursts, and number of spikes per burst within each single-cell recording.</p><p>For the juxtacellular single-unit recordings, glass micropipettes (GB150F-10, Science Products) were pulled on a horizontal puller (DMZ universal puller, Zeitz) to have a resistance of 5–10 M when filled with 3 M KCl. The recorded voltage signals were amplified (Neuroprobe 1600, A-M Systems), bandpass filtered (0.3–7 kHz), digitized at a sampling rate of 97.7 kHz (RP2.1, Tucker-Davis Technologies), and stored for offline analysis using custom-written MATLAB software. Three criteria were used to classify single-unit recordings: (i) changes in the spike height did not exceed 20%, (ii) uniform waveforms, and (iii) signal-to-noise ratio at least 8:1. The principal neurons of the MNTB were identified by the complex waveform of the recorded discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guinan and Li, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Histological verification of the recording site was done by iontophoretic injection of Fluorogold (4 µA for 7 min). The animal was perfused 4–6 hr after injection with 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 5% PFA. The brain was cut on a vibratome (Microm HM650), and the tissue sections (100 µm thick) were visualized under the fluorescent microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss). An example of a recording site is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Auditory brainstem response</title><p>ABR recordings were conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jing et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, mice (P13–14) were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a combination of ketamine (125 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg). The ECG was constantly monitored to control the depth of anesthesia. The core temperature was maintained constant at 37°C using a temperature-controlled heat blanket (Hugo Sachs Elektronik–Harvard Apparatus). Note that in these small immature mice the temperature probe could not be placed rectally, contributing to the relatively long latencies and greater variability of the ABR waves. ABR peaks IV (~5.3 ms) and V (~7 ms) were very small and were thus excluded from analysis. For stimulus generation, presentation, and data acquisition, the TDT System II (Tucker-Davis Technologies) was used that was run by the BioSig32 software (Tucker-Davis Technologies). SPLs were provided in dB SPL root mean square (RMS) (tonal stimuli) or dB SPL peak equivalent (clicks) and were calibrated using a 1⁄4 inch Brüel and Kjær microphone (model 4939). Tone bursts (6/12/24 kHz, 10 ms plateau, 1 ms cos<sup>2</sup> rise/fall) or clicks of 0.03 ms were presented at 40 Hz or 20 Hz, respectively, in the free field ipsilaterally using a JBL 2402 speaker. The difference potential between vertex and mastoid subdermal needles was amplified (50,000×) and filtered (400–4000 Hz, NeuroAmp) and sampled at a rate of 50 kHz for 20 ms, 1300× to obtain two mean ABRs for each sound intensity. Hearing threshold was determined with 10 dB precision as the lowest stimulus intensity that evoked a reproducible response waveform in both traces by visual inspection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics and statistical significance</title><p>For statistical analysis, the SigmaPlot 12.5 (Systat Software Inc) and GraphPad Prism software were used. Datasets with normal (Gaussian) distribution were assessed by unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests (two-tailed distribution) if not said otherwise. For datasets with non-Gaussian distribution, the nonparametric Mann–Whitney rank-sum test was used. For analysis of the intensity dependence of ABR amplitudes and latencies and of ABR thresholds across frequencies, two-way ANOVA was used. If the data were normally distributed, the results are displayed as means ± standard error of means (s.e.m.) and otherwise as medians with the respective 25% and 75% quartiles. Mean cumulative distributions of inter-event intervals and distribution of ISIs between wildtype and cKO groups were compared using the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the chi-square test, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To avoid assigning too much weight on high rate-spiking cells, distributions were created by pooling n random ISIs for each cell within the two groups (n = lowest number of events recorded in any of the cells). A statistical test based on gamma probability distribution of ISIs was used to determine the number and duration of bursts and number of spikes per burst within each single-cell recording. In brief, we assumed that action potential firing of MNTB neurons is a random Poisson-like process. In this way, the probability to encounter one ISI in time period τ is p=1-e<sup>-λτ</sup>, where λ stands for neuronal firing rate. Next, the probability to encounter <italic>k</italic> ISIs during the time period τ as <italic>k</italic>-fold convolution of exponential distribution density was calculated, thereby yielding gamma distribution of waiting times for <italic>k</italic> ISIs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewers feel the results represent a significant advance. However the context in which many of the results was provided was not complete. This is the basis of most of the comments.</p><p>1) The author recapitulate the impact of the TMEM KO on spontaneous activity in the cochlear nucleus as reported in Wang et al., which all the reviewers feel is an important validation. However, the authors conclude that TMEM16A is upstream of ATP release from inner supporting cells, which is the opposite of which has been proposed by the previous study. There are no independent experiments supporting this claim – so either additional experiments need to be done, or the appropriate caveats to this model needs to be addressed. The authors are encouraged to read the detailed comments of Reviewer 3 on this matter.</p><p>2) The evidence that the data supports a claim of &quot;axonal refinement&quot; is perhaps overstated given the lack of anatomical evidence. Either the authors should provide additional data on this (Reviewer #1 comments) or more explicitly compare their results to the nAChR alpha9 KO study from the Kandler lab, which coupled similar uncaging methods with axon refinement (Reviewer #3 comments). Note the suggestions from Reviewer 3 to address this issue do not require additional experiments.</p><p>3) Although there are many suggestions from all three Reviewers, the authors are particularly encouraged to address the many points made by Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The biggest question has to do with the overall impact of these findings and whether they represent a significant advance.</p><p>1. The authors need to clarify whether their results in Figure 1 (the impact of KO on spontaneous activity) contain novel findings or do they recapitulate the results of the Bergles lab using whole animal KOs. Specifically, they do not provide evidence that the TMEM16 KO is upstream of ATP release, as they conclude.</p><p>2. The conclusion that this disruption of activity leads to reduction in refinement in the early auditory pathway is based entirely on physiological measurements and therefore no change in axonal projection is directly observed. It appears there might be other interpretations of their findings. I will focus primarily on the mapping of MNTB inputs to the LSO, which was achieved by glutamate uncaging – I think the configuration is making a slice that contains both the MNTB and the LSO (it would be great for authors to clarify this). Then a neuron in LSO is recorded in current clamp while glutamate uncaging occurs over the MNTB, driving individual neurons to fire action potentials. They find that MNTB neurons from a larger area all synapse onto a single LSO neuron, indicating a lack of refinement. That is one interpretation of these findings but there are many others, such as changes in local circuitry. The authors would need to do more experiments to reach this conclusion. For example, they could do experiments in voltage clamp to assay impact of excitatory vs inhibitory inputs to assay which is more responsible for membrane potential changes. Second they should use these method to demonstrate that they see a change in this distribution across development to make clear that this refinement occurs at the same ages that spontaneous activity is disrupted. Finally, the authors need to provide axon reconstructions to support the idea of the map refinement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very well written and beautiful study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well written, and well-presented paper. As described in the &quot;Public Review&quot; portion, most weaknesses are limited to interpretations of results and fitting the work more clearly into the existing literature, so as to not over-state the novelty of the work.</p><p>Details:</p><p>– In the abstract, the final sentence does not fit with existing literature and is not supported by the presented data.

This line of the abstract, as well as lines 165-166, state the opposite. However, your data does not adequately disprove the Bergles lab hypothesis and does not address which part of the pathway initiates the calcium wave process. Omit these lines or provide stronger evidence. This will also include re-writing the title of the paper, as there is no evidence that TMEM16A itself initiates the wave patterns, although it is one molecule in the chain.</p><p>– In figure 1 what was the total amount of time used for statistics? The 6 seconds of data shown is an extremely short time window, and not adequate to capture the variable timescales of the calcium waves.</p><p>– Line 113 – an extra space in the p-value.</p><p>– Results section beginning line 154: Tritsch et al. 2007 reports the effect of suramin in reducing crenellations in inner supporting cells. In the same paper the crenellations were associated with calcium waves. Therefore, the experiment reported here is extremely similar to previously published work and this other work should be cited.</p><p>– Figure 2 fonts are too small.</p><p>– Please discuss how the changes in burst patterns detailed in figure 2 compare to previously published studies linking aberrant cochlear spontaneous activity with impaired MNTB-LSO tonotopic projections that use nearly identical techniques (Clause et al. 2014).</p><p>– Line 207 – spell out approximately.</p><p>– MNTB neurons have higher thresholds, but ABR studies show normal thresholds.

This finding is not new on its own but in connection with the data provided by Wang et al. and the fact that the ATP-dependent propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves was abolished in an organ-on-chip recordings of ISCs devoid of connexin30 (Mazzarda, D'Elia et al. 2020), it suggests that TMEM16A may amplify ATP release from ISCs via connexin hemichannels due to changes either in cell volume or in membrane potential. This hypothesis does not oppose the conclusions from Wang et al., but rather puts a new perspective on an apparently complex bi-directional interplay between ATP release and TMEM16A activation.

We now spelled out “approximately”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– MNTB neurons have higher thresholds, but ABR studies show normal thresholds. Please speculate as to why.</p></disp-quote><p>While we did not observe significant differences in threshold, there was a tendency toward increased ABR thresholds e.g. at 6 and 24 kHz and for clicks. The mean increase in hearing thresholds that we found in cKO mice using in vivo electrophysiology seems to contradict our ABR measurements that did not reveal significant differences in hearing thresholds between TMEM16A cKO mice and the wildtype littermates recorded at the same age. In general, there are two fundamental differences between these two techniques. First, in vivo electrophysiological recordings allow measuring the hearing thresholds of individual cells, whereas the ABR technique measures the sum response of all auditory neurons. Second, in vivo electrophysiological recordings show responses from a neuron within a defined nucleus of the auditory brain stem (in our case the MNTB). In contrast, the different peaks in the ABR waveform show responses generated by neurons from the level of the auditory nerve (wave I) to the superior olivary complex including MNTB, MSO and LSO (wave III). In P14 mice, waves IV and V are unclear and usually excluded from analysis due to the young age of the animals. Hence, we speculate that the differences in hearing thresholds that we detected in individual MNTB neurons using in vivo electrophysiology may be blunted by ABR measurements, which measure the summed response of many neurons from several auditory brain stem nuclei. Another possibility is that the cKO MNTB neurons recorded that were responding to tonotopically less constrained input showed increased thresholds for pure tones for this reason: i.e. were responding not just to the peak of the cochlear vibration but also to both tails. However, we cannot exclude other possible reasons for the discrepancy.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment we now added a phrase to the discussion:</p><p>“We note that the discrepancy between significantly indistinguishable ABR thresholds and significantly elevated auditory thresholds of single MNTB neurons could arise for several reasons. […] However, other reasons cannot be excluded and a trend toward higher ABR thresholds was apparent for 6 and 24 kHz tone bursts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 283-284 would benefit from a very quick statistical test to demonstrate no difference between the CFs of MNTB neurons in the mutant and control groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

We agree and replaced “complex bi-directional interplay” by “positive feedback mechanisms” (e.g. line 385).</p><p>Furthermore, we clearly state that propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves were first reported by Tritsch et al. (lines 376-377).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the only change made regarding the receptive field refinement is to call it &quot;physiological refinement&quot; with no discussion of potential mechanisms. Please clarify how you think frequency selectivity is altered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The reduced frequency-selectivity could result from superfluous functional projections from globular bushy cells (GBC) onto MNTB neurons (lines 409-414). We further briefly report on mechanisms identified in the visual system. Together with data from the auditory system this allows us to present a possible scenario, why tonotopical refinement might be compromised upon disruption of TMEM16A (lines 426-445).</p></body></sub-article></article>
