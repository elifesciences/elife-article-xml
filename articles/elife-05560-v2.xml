by abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in the cornea. SCD-associated mutations have been identified in the gene encoding UBIAD1, a prenyltransferase that synthesizes vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Here, we show that sterols stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase, which is subject to sterol-accelerated, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation augmented by the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol through an unknown mechanism. Geranylgeraniol inhibits binding of UBIAD1 to reductase, allowing its degradation and promoting transport of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi. CRISPR-CAS9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1 relieves the geranylgeraniol requirement for reductase degradation. SCD-associated mutations in UBIAD1 block its displacement from reductase in the presence of geranylgeraniol, thereby preventing degradation of reductase. The current results identify UBIAD1 as the elusive target of geranylgeraniol in reductase degradation, the inhibition of which may contribute to accumulation of cholesterol in SCD.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05560.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05560.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05560.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People with a rare genetic disorder called ‘Schnyder corneal dystrophy’ gradually lose their vision, because their corneas become increasingly cloudy. This cloudiness is caused by a build-up of excessive amounts of cholesterol, and the disorder itself is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes a protein called UBIAD1. Researchers have previously discovered that the UBIAD1 protein is involved in making vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, but it is not clear how this protein also helps to control cholesterol levels in the cornea.</p><p>An enzyme called HMG CoA reductase makes a molecule that is used to make cholesterol and many other similar sterol molecules. A ‘feedback loop’ operates in cells to control the amount of the reductase and prevent cholesterol from becoming too high or too low. Sterol molecules, together with another molecule called geranylgeraniol, participate in this feedback loop by promoting the destruction of the reductase enzyme. Here, Schumacher et al. reveal a link between UBIAD1 and the reductase that may explain how UBIAD1 contributes to the production of excess cholesterol in patients with Schnyder corneal dystrophy.</p><p>The experiments show that, in the presence of sterol molecules, UBIAD1 can bind to HMG CoA reductase to protect the reductase from being destroyed by other proteins. Geranylgeraniol—which stops the UBIAD1 protein from binding to the enzyme—is required to completely destroy the reductase enzyme. However, when UBIAD1 is missing, the reductase enzyme is destroyed even in the absence of geranylgeraniol.</p><p>Furthermore, the experiments show that the genetic mutations linked to Schnyder corneal dystrophy lead to the production of versions of the UBIAD1 protein that bind to the reductase enzyme even when geranylgeraniol molecules are present. This prevents the normal breakdown of the reductase enzyme, which could lead to the build up of cholesterol in the cornea of individuals with the disorder.</p><p>Schumacher et al.'s findings show that the UBIAD1 protein helps to control the levels of cholesterol in cells by protecting the HMG CoA reductase enzyme from destruction. These findings may aid the development of new therapies to lower cholesterol levels in cells, which may help patients with Schnyder's corneal dystrophy and other conditions caused by high cholesterol levels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05560.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05560.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ER associated degradation</kwd><kwd>cholesterol metabolism</kwd><kwd>prenyltransferase</kwd><kwd>vitamin K</kwd><kwd>isoprenoid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Scientist</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL20948-37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM112409-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBose-Boyd</surname><given-names>Russell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inhibition of sterol-accelerated degradation of HMG CoA reductase by the vitamin K2 synthetic enzyme UBIAD1 may contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol that is associated with Schnyder corneal dystrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SCD (Schnyder corneal dystrophy) is a rare autosomal dominant eye disease that is characterized by bilateral opacification of the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klintworth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiss, 2009</xref>). The clinical manifestation of SCD can be apparent early in life, usually within the first decade. Thereafter, opacification of the cornea progresses slowly and ultimately leads to reduced visual acuity, which is postulated to be caused by light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiss, 2009</xref>). The significance of this visual impairment is highlighted by the frequency in which corneal transplant surgery is utilized in treatment of SCD; approximately 50% of SCD patients ≥50 years of age undergo corneal transplant surgery for restoration of normal vision acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weiss, 2007</xref>). The frequency of the procedure increases to greater than 70% for SCD patients 70 years and older. Analyses of corneas removed from SCD patients during transplantation surgery revealed a marked accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and lesser accumulation of esterified cholesterol and phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCarthy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaynor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism may underlie pathogenesis of the disease. Systemic dyslipidemia has been reported to be associated with some, but not all cases of SCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thiel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownstein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crispin, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In 2007, two groups independently identified SCD-associated mutations in the gene encoding UBIAD1 (UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiss et al., 2007</xref>). UBIAD1 (also known as TERE1) was first described as being absent or markedly diminished in bladder and prostate tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGarvey et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2003</xref>) and belongs to the UbiA superfamily of prenyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heide, 2009</xref>). These enzymes, which are found in a wide variety of species, contain 8–10 transmembrane helices and catalyze transfer of isoprenyl groups to aromatic acceptors, producing a diverse range of molecules including ubiquinone, chlorophylls, hemes, vitamin E, and vitamin K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forsgren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakagawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bonitz et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, UBIAD1 catalyzes transfer of the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to menadione (vitamin K<sub>3</sub>) derived from plant-derived phylloquinone (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>), generating MK-4 (menaquinone-4, vitamin K<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakagawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirota et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been proposed that UBIAD1 mediates polyprenylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate to produce 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (PPHB), an intermediate in the synthesis of CoQ10 (coenzyme Q10 or ubiquinone-10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mugoni et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05560.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biosynthesis of cholesterol and menaquinone-4 (MK-4, vitamin K<sub>2</sub>) in mammalian cells.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05560.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05560.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05560-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>To date, 24 UBIAD1 mutations have been identified in ∼50 SCD families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nickerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowinska et al., 2014</xref>). Several of these mutations alter amino acid residues that localize to the active site of the UBIAD1 prenyltransferase domain as determined by molecular modeling using structural models of bacterial and archaeal UbiA prenyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bräuer et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nickerson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Li, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Cells from patients harboring four SCD-associated mutations (N102S, D112N, and G177E/R) exhibited reduced MK-4 biosynthetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nickerson et al., 2013</xref>). A possible link between UBIAD1 and cholesterol metabolism was provided by co-immunoprecipitation studies that showed an association of UBIAD1 with the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nickerson et al., 2013</xref>). However, the relevance of this association to regulation of cholesterol metabolism and pathogenesis of SCD is not clear.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-localized reductase catalyzes reduction of HMG CoA to mevalonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This reaction constitutes a rate-limiting step in synthesis of cholesterol as well as nonsterol isoprenoids such as the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups that are transferred to many cellular proteins and utilized in synthesis of ubiquinone, heme, and dolichol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casey and Seabra, 1996</xref>). Multiple feedback mechanisms converge on reductase to ensure a constant supply of nonsterol isoprenoids, while avoiding overaccumulation of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</xref>). This feedback system is exploited therapeutically by a group of competitive inhibitors of reductase called statins, which trigger regulatory responses that result in the lowering of plasma levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol and thereby reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stossel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marais et al., 2014</xref>). Statins also block production of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids that govern feedback regulation of reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>). Thus, a marked accumulation of reductase occurs in livers of statin-treated animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kita et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reihner et al., 1990</xref>), which can blunt the cholesterol-lowering effects of these drugs. This accumulation results in part, from slowed ERAD (ER-associated degradation) of reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakanishi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ravid et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The ERAD of reductase is initiated by intracellular accumulation of sterols, which causes the enzyme to bind to ER membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2003b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Insig binding occurs through the membrane domain of reductase, which contains eight membrane-spanning helices and precedes a large cytosolic domain with enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liscum et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roitelman et al., 1992</xref>). Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases gp78 and Trc8 facilitate ubiquitination of cytosolically exposed lysine residues in the membrane domain of reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). This ubiquitination marks reductase for recognition by the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities)-ATPase VCP/p97, which mediates extraction of reductase across ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). Once extracted, ubiquitinated reductase is then released into the cytosol and delivered into the proteolytic chamber of the 20S proteasome through reactions mediated by the proteasome 19S regulatory particle, which contains six AAA-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehlinger and Walters, 2013</xref>). Geranylgeraniol, the alcohol derivative of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, augments sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase but does not appreciably affect sterol-induced ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>). This observation led to the notion that geranylgeraniol augments post-ubiquitination steps in reductase ERAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, geranylgeraniol enhances sterol-induced membrane extraction and cytosolic dislocation of reductase as judged by assays carried out in vitro and in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song and DeBose-Boyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elsabrouty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05560.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Insig-mediated, sterol-accelerated degradation of HMG CoA reductase in mammalian cells.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05560.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05560.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05560-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>In the current studies, we use proximity-dependent biotinylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) to identify UBIAD1 as an associated protein of the membrane domain of reductase, which is necessary and sufficient for sterol-accelerated ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gil et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skalnik et al., 1988</xref>). Endogenous UBIAD1 binds to reductase in sterol-treated cells as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. This sterol-induced binding is inhibited by geranylgeraniol, releasing UBIAD1 for translocation from membranes of the ER to the Golgi. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of UBIAD1 relieves the geranylgeraniol requirement for reductase ERAD. UBIAD1 harboring the SCD-associated N102S mutation resists geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase and remains associated with the protein in the ER, thereby blocking sterol-accelerated degradation of reductase. These studies identify UBIAD1 as the elusive target of geranylgeraniol in the ERAD of reductase and provide insight into mechanisms through which the nonsterol isoprenoid modulates the reaction. Moreover, our results suggest that slowed ERAD of reductase may contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol observed in SCD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify proteins that associate with reductase, we employed a novel chimeric protein composed of the membrane domain of reductase (amino acids 1–346) fused to the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA*, which features proximity-dependent biotinylation of the chimera's near-neighbor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). Cells stably expressing high levels of the reductase-BirA* chimera were subjected to treatment with the oxysterol 25-HC (25-hydroxycholesterol) in the presence of biotin. Following treatments, cells were harvested and lysed; the lysates were then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads to capture biotinylated proteins that were subsequently identified by tandem mass spectrometry.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows an experiment in which we used co-immunoprecipitation to measure the interaction of endogenous reductase with several proteins that were identified as associated with the reductase-BirA* chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). SV-589 cells, a line of transformed human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 1984</xref>), were depleted of sterols and subsequently treated in the absence or presence of 25-HC. Following treatments, the cells were harvested for lysis in detergent-containing buffer; the resulting lysates were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against reductase. Immunoblot analysis revealed that treatment of cells with 25-HC triggered co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous reductase with Insig-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4); the control ER membrane protein calnexin failed to interact with reductase, regardless of the absence or presence of 25-HC (lanes 5 and 6). ERGIC-53 similarly failed to appear in the anti-reductase immunoprecipitates (lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, lamina-associated peptide-2 (lanes 7 and 8), peroxiredoxin-4 (lanes 11 and 12), PGRMC2 (lanes 13 and 14), and annexin-A1 (lanes 15 and 16) co-precipitated with reductase in both the absence and presence of 25-HC; the significance and specificity of these interactions are unclear. In the absence of 25-HC, a small amount of UBIAD1 (UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1) appeared in the pellet fraction of the reductase immunoprecipitation (lane 17); this appearance was markedly enhanced when the cells were subjected to treatment with 25-HC (lane 18).</p><p>UBIAD1 belongs to the UbiA superfamily of prenyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heide, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bonitz et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to other UbiA prenyltransferases, UBIAD1 is very hydrophobic; the human enzyme is comprised of 338 amino acids and is predicted to contain at least eight transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Besides its regulated association with reductase (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nickerson et al., 2013</xref>), we chose UBIAD1 for further examination owing to the observation that mutations in the UBIAD1 gene are associated with SCD, which may result from dysregulated cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCarthy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaynor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>).

This sterol-induced co-precipitation continued after prolonged incubation (top panel, lanes 7–14), even though the total amount of reductase was reduced by accelerated degradation (second and fourth panels, lanes 12 and 14). The structurally related 1,1-bisphosphonate esters SR-12813 and Apomine mimic 25-HC in accelerating reductase ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roitelman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sever et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>).

The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 was markedly diminished when the cells were depleted of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids through incubation in medium containing LPPS (lipoprotein-poor serum) and the reductase inhibitor compactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, panels 3 and 4). Notably, localization of Golgi-localized GM130 was unaffected by depletion of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (compare panels 2 and 4). The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 was restored in sterol- and nonsterol isoprenoid-depleted cells by the addition of geranylgeraniol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, panel 5), but not by the addition of 25-HC (panel 7). A repeat experiment confirms that sterol and nonsterol isoprenoid depletion disrupted the Golgi localization of UBIAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, this localization was restored by geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol, 25-HC, or cholesterol. We obtained similar results with SV-589 cells stably transfected with pCMV-Myc-UBIAD1 encoding Myc-tagged human UBIAD1.

In UBIAD1 knockdown cells, 25-HC stimulated complete degradation of reductase, even in the absence of geranylgeraniol (lanes 5–8). Nearly identical results were obtained using an siRNA duplex targeting a different region of the UBIAD1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Geranylgeraniol also augmented the ERAD of reductase that was stimulated by Apomine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top panel, lanes 1–4); however, the 1,1-bisphosphonate ester caused reductase to become completely degraded in UBIAD1 knockdown cells (lanes 5–8). Results consistent with those observed using RNAi were obtained in cells subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1. In wild type SV-589 cells, Apomine stimulated reductase ERAD through a mechanism augmented by geranylgeraniol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top panel, lanes 1–4), whereas the compound caused complete degradation of reductase in cells deficient in UBIAD1 (designated UBIAD1<sup>−</sup>) (lanes 5–8). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows that in a time-dependent fashion, geranylgeraniol augmented Apomine-induced degradation of reductase in SV-589 cells (compare lanes 1–6 with lanes 7–12).

Considering that SCD is an autosomal dominant disorder, we reasoned that overexpression of UBIAD1 harboring the SCD-associated N102S mutation would block reductase ERAD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows that when overexpressed in SV-589 cells, the T7-tagged membrane domain of reductase became degraded in the presence of 25-HC and geranylgeraniol (top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Co-expression of a plasmid encoding wild type UBIAD1 stabilized reductase in a dose-dependent fashion and 25-HC plus geranylgeraniol continued to accelerate its ERAD (lanes 3–10). Notably, the highest level of wild type UBIAD1 co-expressed with reductase blunted the enzyme's accelerated degradation (lanes 11 and 12). Co-expression of UBIAD1 (N102S) also stabilized the membrane domain of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, top panel, compare lane 1 with lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), suggesting the protein continued to bind to the enzyme.

As previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2014</xref>), the reaction is initiated by accumulation of sterols, which triggers binding of Insigs to reductase and results in its gp78/Trc8-mediated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jo et al., 2011</xref>). We find in the current study that the oxysterol 25-HC and the 1,1-bisphosphonate ester Apomine, which mimics 25-HC in accelerating reductase ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roitelman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sever et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>), trigger binding of reductase to UBIAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), a prenyltransferase that mediates synthesis of the vitamin K<sub>2</sub> derivative MK-4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The sterol-induced binding of UBIAD1 to reductase appears to follow the action of Insigs as indicated by inhibition of the association by RNAi-mediated Insig knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast to the action of sterols, the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol, which augments sterol-accelerated reductase ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>), inhibits formation of the UBIAD1-reductase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Geranylgeraniol also regulates the subcellular localization of UBIAD1. The prenyltransferase primarily localizes to Golgi membranes when cells are cultured in sterol-replete FCS-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 is disrupted when cells are switched to sterol-depleting medium containing LPPS and the reductase inhibitor compactin, which depletes cellular stores of nonsterol isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</xref>). Remarkably, Golgi localization of UBAID1 is restored by the addition of geranylgeraniol, but not of 25-HC or farnesol, to cells deprived of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>). We conclude from these observations that geranylgeraniol-mediated disruption of the UBIAD1-reductase complex allows for the translocation of UBIAD1 from ER membranes to the Golgi and for membrane extraction, cytosolic dislocation and proteasomal degradation of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05560.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for role of UBIAD1 in sterol-accelerated degradation of HMG CoA reductase.</title><p>In sterol-deprived cells, both reductase and UBIAD1 localize to membranes of the ER. The intracellular accumulation of sterols in ER membranes triggers binding of reductase to Insigs, resulting in its ubiquitination by Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases gp78 and Trc8 and association with UBIAD1. Geranylgeraniol becomes phosphorylated to produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which enhances reductase degradation by binding to UBIAD1, causing its displacement from reductase-Insig. This displacement allows for transport of UBIAD1 to the Golgi and membrane extraction, cytosolic dislocation, and proteasomal degradation of reductase. We postulate that the SCD-associated N102S or G177R mutations in UBIAD1 abrogate binding of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. As a result, UBIAD1 (N102S) and (G177R) do not translocate to the Golgi and remain associated with reductase in the ER, thereby blocking its membrane extraction, cytosolic dislocation, and proteasomal degradation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05560.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05560.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05560-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p>The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> predicts that UBIAD1 inhibits sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase and that geranylgeraniol relieves this inhibition by triggering displacement of UBIAD1 from the protein. In support of this notion, we observed that RNAi-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1 eliminates the requirement of geranylgeraniol for maximal degradation of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The continuance of accelerated reductase degradation in UBIAD1-deficient cells is consistent with the proposal that UBIAD1 mediates a step in the reaction downstream the action of Insigs. In future studies, efforts will be undertaken to delineate mechanisms through which UBIAD1 retards reductase ERAD. Geranylgeraniol is required for extraction of ubiquitinated reductase across the ER membrane through a reaction that is mediated by the AAA-ATPase VCP/p97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, one likely mechanism for the inhibitory effects of UBIAD1 on reductase ERAD may involve inhibition of the association of ubiquitinated reductase with VCP/p97 or one of its ubiquitin-binding cofactors, thereby preventing its subsequent membrane extraction.</p><p>In addition to revealing the molecular mechanism through which geranylgeraniol modulates reductase ERAD, the current results help to explain how cells maintain synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids, while avoiding overproduction of cholesterol. In 1979, Faust, Brown, and Goldstein found that in the absence of LDL, cells accumulate reductase to produce mevalonate for conversion into primarily cholesterol and other sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faust et al., 1979</xref>). The addition of LDL to cells partially suppressed reductase, limiting production of mevalonate. As a result, incorporation of mevalonate into cholesterol was reduced, whereas incorporation of the molecule into nonsterol isoprenoids such as CoQ10 was enhanced. We postulate that LDL failed to completely suppress reductase due to its binding to UBIAD1 and resultant inhibition of sterol-accelerated degradation. This residual reductase produces a small amount of mevalonate that is preferentially diverted into nonsterol isoprenoids. Once appropriate levels of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate accumulate in cells, the isoprenoid binds to UBIAD1, causing its release from reductase, which subsequently becomes degraded. Released UBIAD1 then translocates to the Golgi where it synthesizes PPHB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mugoni et al., 2013</xref>) and perhaps MK-4. Thus, substrate-regulated transport of UBIAD1 ensures that products of the enzyme are only produced when cellular demands for other nonsterol isoprenoids as well as sterols have been met. Studies are currently underway to appraise this notion and to determine whether Golgi-localized UBIAD1 is enzymatically active to synthesize MK-4 and PPHB, whereas the ER-localized enzyme is not. Moreover, the role of reductase in ER to Golgi trafficking of UBAD1 will be investigated.</p><p>The significance of geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement of UBIAD1 from reductase is revealed through the study of SCD-associated mutants of the prenyltransferase. Consistent with the autosomal dominant phenotype of SCD, disease-associated N102S and G177R mutants of UBIAD1 inhibit sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The molecular basis for this inhibition is suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, which show that UBIAD1 (N102S) resists geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase. Subcellular localization studies show that in FCS-cultured cells, wild type UBIAD1 localizes to the Golgi, whereas the N102S and G177R mutants of the enzyme appear defective in Golgi trafficking and remain sequestered within the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Mutation of the asparagine residue in bacterial UbiA prenyltransferases that corresponds to N102 markedly diminishes substrate binding and enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Li, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we postulate that binding of UBIAD1 to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate produced by phosphorylation of geranylgeraniol triggers displacement of wild type UBIAD1 from reductase, allowing the protein to translocate to the Golgi. In contrast, the N102S and G177R mutants of UBIAD1 exhibit reduced affinity for geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and thus, remain associated with reductase in the ER, thereby inhibiting its sterol-accelerated ERAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This inhibition may contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol that is observed in corneas of SCD patients. It will be important in future studies to develop a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate-binding assay for mammalian UBIAD1 and to determine the subcellular localization and effect of the other 18 SCD-associated UBIAD1 mutants on reductase ERAD.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study has identified UBIAD1 as the elusive molecular target of geranylgeraniol in reductase ERAD. They have also revealed a potential mechanism whereby mutations in UBIAD1 cause the accumulation of cholesterol in corneas of SCD patients. Finally, results of this study indicate the existence of a novel link between the synthesis of MK-4 and cholesterol. Further investigation of this link is merited owing to the potential for development of novel therapies that accelerate reductase ERAD to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol and retard corneal accumulation of cholesterol that characterizes SCD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>We obtained MG-132 from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs (affinity-purified) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); digitonin was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); geranylgeraniol and farnesol from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX); biotin was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); and 25-hydroxycholesterol from Steraloids (Newport, RI).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study presents a series of experiments that identifies UBIAD1 as an HMG CoA reductase interactor that regulates its degradation in a geranylgeraniol (GGOH)-dependent manner. Dominant mutations in UBIAD1 that cause Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) disrupt this regulation. The work resolves a long-standing question of how GGOH enhances the sterol-dependent degradation of mammalian HMGR, which has been a consistent yet mysterious feature of HMGR degradation as studied by this group for a number of years. The results make sense, and lead to a number of hypotheses and perhaps distinct therapeutic approaches for Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy. The topic and findings should be of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and open up several future areas for study. Nevertheless, some aspects of the study require clarification and a modest amount of new experimentation to fully support the authors' conclusions. The following three points were deemed essential to the central conclusions, while the 'minor comments' below are more peripheral.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is the central result, and it is worth making it completely convincing by presenting a time course of reductase degradation in wild type versus UBIAD knockout cells. Ideally, this would be done by radiolabeled pulse-chase, but even a western blot at different times after 25-HC or Apomine treatment would provide a clear picture of what is happening. This is important because the steady state levels of reductase are different in wild type and knockout cells, complicating the comparison. Thus, a carefully controlled and quantified time course would help to directly show different rates of degradation.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors analyze the levels of transfected HMG membrane domain (residues 1-346) and not the endogenous protein. This is important since the effect of WT and mutant UBIAD1 on this truncated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and on endogenous reductase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, Lysate) appears quite different. While the steady state levels of the truncated protein significantly increase upon UBIAD1 transfection, the endogenous protein does not seems to change much. Can the authors please explain the rationale for using the truncated membrane domain, or if possible, present data with the full-length protein?</p><p>3) Due perhaps to the relatively modest effects of UBIAD on reductase, there appears to be a fair amount of sample-to-sample variability (as noted in several of the 'Minor comments' below). While consistent trends from multiple different approaches make an overall convincing case, certain individual experiments were less convincing to some reviewers. In particular, the key result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> is not totally convincing and quantification of independent experiments would help to validate the conclusion that N102S is GGOH-insensitive.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The reductase-BirA* strategy for identifying interacting partners should be documented. The approach is clearly useful for finding membrane protein interactors, and it is likely that readers will want to apply this to other systems if it is robust.

Ideally, this would be done by radiolabeled pulse-chase, but even a western blot at different times after 25-HC or Apomine treatment would provide a clear picture of what is happening. This is important because the steady state levels of reductase are different in wild type and knockout cells, complicating the comparison. Thus, a carefully controlled and quantified time course would help to directly show different rates of degradation</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. A new experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is now included in the revised manuscript.

This is important since the effect of WT and mutant UBIAD1 on this truncated form (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>) and on endogenous reductase (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8A</italic></xref><italic>, Lysate) appears quite different. While the steady state levels of the truncated protein significantly increase upon UBIAD1 transfection, the endogenous protein does not seems to change much. Can the authors please explain the rationale for using the truncated membrane domain, or if possible, present data with the full-length protein?</italic></p><p>The experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> was designed to determine the effect of UBIAD1 (N102S) on sterol-accelerated degradation of reductase. We utilized the truncated membrane domain of reductase because this region of the protein is both necessary and sufficient for sterol-accelerated degradation (Skalnik et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem., and Gil et al., 1985, Cell). We have observed in unpublished studies that the membrane domain of reductase appears to be more susceptible to accelerated degradation than the full-length form, which could explain why UBIAD1 stabilizes the membrane domain of reductase more than the full-length protein. The difference in stability between the membrane domain of reductase and the full-length protein may be attributable to the C-terminal catalytic domain, which is known to form a tetramer that likely has to be unassembled prior to proteasomal degradation. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now included experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>) that compare the ability of wild type and mutant (N102S) UBIAD1 to block degradation of full-length reductase. Results similar to those with the truncated membrane domain of reductase were obtained with the full-length enzyme.</p><p><italic>3) Due perhaps to the relatively modest effects of UBIAD on reductase, there appears to be a fair amount of sample-to-sample variability (as noted in several of the 'Minor comments' below). While consistent trends from multiple different approaches make an overall convincing case, certain individual experiments were less convincing to some reviewers. In particular, the key result of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8A</italic></xref> <italic>is not totally convincing and quantification of independent experiments would help to validate the conclusion that N102S is GGOH-insensitive</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ assessment that the effects of geranylgeraniol on displacement of N102S UBIAD1 from reductase are modest. Thus, we have included in the revised manuscript an additional two independent experiments that demonstrate UBIAD1 (N102S) is more resistant to geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase than its wild type counterpart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). We previously showed that reductase remains in the ER when cells are treated with sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (see Hartman et al., 2010, J. Biol. Chem, 285:19288). The current observations show that: 1) geranylgeraniol triggers translocation of UBIAD1 to the Golgi in sterol and nonsterol isoprenoid-depleted cells; and 2) UBIAD1 (N102S) remains sequestered in ER membranes. Thus, we conclude the most likely mechanism of action for UBIAD1 in reductase degradation involves its geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase, which allows reductase degradation and translocation of UBIAD1 to the Golgi. UBIAD1 (N102S) exhibits reduced affinity for geranylgeraniol (or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) and remains associated with reductase in the ER, thereby blocking its degradation.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The reductase-BirA* strategy for identifying interacting partners should be documented. The approach is clearly useful for finding membrane protein interactors, and it is likely that readers will want to apply this to other systems if it is robust. Unless there is a compelling reason otherwise, I recommend including a figure and appropriate supplemental table documenting the interactors identified and where among these UBIAD1 ranked. It would be worth noting if known interactors (e.g., Insigs and ubiquitin ligases) were observed as expected</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now included in the revised manuscript the documentation of proteins identified as associated proteins of the reductase-BirA* chimera. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>, we excised three segments from a colloidal blue-stained gel of proteins that co-purified with reductase-BirA*. These segments were subjected to trypsin digestion and the proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. We identified 15 proteins from these segments that gave spectral counts greater 4; these proteins are indicated in the figure. In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, we used co-immunoprecipitation to confirm the association of the identified protein with endogenous reductase. Some of the proteins did not associate with reductase, while others bound in both the absence and presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). UBIAD1 was the only protein that exhibited sterol-regulated association with endogenous reductase. This feature, along with a previous report for an association between reductase and UBIAD1, and accumulation of cholesterol in SCD, prompted us to focus attention on UBIAD1. We did not identify Insigs or the ubiquitin ligases that mediate reductase ubiquitination in the three segments of the gel that were selected for protein identification. The molecular weights of the selected segments did not correspond to those of the ubiquitin ligases.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, reductase levels increase substantially during the time course, even with 25-HC.

Yet, in later experiments (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>), 4 hours with 25-HC results in what appears to be ∼90% degradation. Please clarify this apparent discrepancy</italic>.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have replaced the previous time-course experiment with a new one that measures the association of UBIAD1 with reductase. The results show that UBIAD1 appears in the reductase immunoprecipitates after 30 min of treatment and continues to co-precipitate with reductase at later times, even though total reductase is reduced by accelerated degradation.</p><p><italic>3) In many of the figures, relative reductase levels in the starting lysate and after the IP are different.

Please comment on this in the text or figure legend so a reader is not confused</italic>.</p><p>We believe some of these differences may result from experimental variability or by slight differences in rates of degradation among different experiments. We attempted to eliminate this variability by blocking degradation of reductase using the proteasome inhibitor MG-132; however, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>, MG-132 blocks degradation of reductase, but inhibits its binding to UBIAD1. It should also be noted that we have observed sterol- or Apomine-induced binding of UBIAD1 to reductase in at least 10 independent experiments of the current manuscript. To further confirm that geranylgeraniol inhibits sterol-induced binding of reductase to UBIAD1, we have included a repeat experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The authors discuss a role for UBIAD1 after Insig binding and ubiquitination.

This suggests that UBIAD1 stabilizes the reductase-Insig complex, but is not absolutely required for the interaction. It should be noted that in the absence of UBIAD1, sterols continue to accelerate degradation of reductase. This indicates that UBIAD1 acts downstream Insig in the degradation of reductase and is not absolutely required for the reaction. Moreover, data indicate that geranylgeraniol modulates the subcellular localization of UBIAD1 and considering that geranylgeraniol mediates a post-ubiquitination step in reductase degradation, we conclude the action of UBIAD1 follows that of Insig.</p></body></sub-article></article>
