However, due to the intrinsic complexity of tissues it remains challenging to pinpoint niche-independent effects of circulating factors on specific cell populations. Here, we describe a method for the encapsulation of human and mouse skeletal muscle progenitors in diffusible polyethersulfone hollow fiber capsules that can be used to profile systemic aging in vivo independent of heterogeneous short-range tissue interactions. We observed that circulating long-range signaling factors in the old systemic environment lead to an activation of Myc and E2F transcription factors, induce senescence, and suppress myogenic differentiation. Importantly, in vitro profiling using young and old serum in 2D culture does not capture all pathways deregulated in encapsulated cells in aged mice. Thus, in vivo transcriptomic profiling using cell encapsulation allows for the characterization of effector pathways of systemic aging with unparalleled accuracy.</p></abstract><kwd-group

important determinant of organismal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demontis et al., 2013</xref>). Supporting this notion, several features of tissue aging can be slowed or reversed by heterochronic parabiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bert, 1864</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conboy et al., 2015</xref>). Restoration of a youthful systemic environment has been shown to improve the function of muscle, heart, liver, brain, and other tissues in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loffredo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruckh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the positive effects of young blood on aged tissues appear to be milder than the pronounced negative effects of aged blood on young tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rebo et al., 2016</xref>). This observation suggests the presence of dominant pro-aging factors in the systemic circulation, which cross-talk with local tissue niches to induce the global decline in organ function associated with old age. Recent studies have aimed at identifying the circulating factors involved in systemic aging, and some of the experimental interpretations have led to considerable controversy in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conese et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It has long been known that a range of endocrine hormones are perturbed in later stages of life. Aging affects the somatotroph axis leading to decreased levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2000</xref>). Levels of sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen drop in aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Medicine, 2004</xref>). Old age is also associated with increased systemic inflammation that often goes along with a metabolic syndrome attributed to insulin resistance and an excessive flux of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dominguez and Barbagallo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franceschi and Campisi, 2014</xref>). Next to these broad biological processes, several distinct pro- and anti-aging factors have been identified in the systemic environment. These include growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), eotaxin, β2-microglobulin, and transforming growth factor-β, which negatively affect brain or muscle tissue in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yousef et al., 2015</xref>). Factors activating Notch, growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2), on the other hand, have been suggested to have rejuvenating effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conboy and Rando, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahmoudi et al., 2019</xref>), although the role of GDF11 is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egerman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egerman and Glass, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schafer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, transcript levels of the prolongevity protein Klotho in circulating extracellular vesicles decrease with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sahu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The modulation of age affected signaling pathways, represents a promising alternative to supplying or inhibiting systemic factors for rejuvenation. However, the study of pathways that are responsive to systemic changes is complicated by the heterogeneous composition of tissues, which contain a multitude of cell types that communicate through secreted short-range signals. Systemic factors do not always act in a direct manner on tissue-resident cell populations but can instead trigger paracrine propagation and modulation of signals through accessory cell types in the niche. In the intestinal crypt, paneth cells are known to transmit systemic signals induced by caloric restriction to intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yilmaz et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, fibro-adipogenic progenitors, an age-affected support cell population for skeletal muscle stem cells, are highly susceptible to systemic cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biferali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lukjanenko et al., 2019</xref>). Factors in the aging circulation also alter accessory cell signaling in the neurogenic niche, which contributes to neural stem cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). These examples illustrate that profiling of aging pathways that are directly affected by systemic long-range signaling factors requires an approach that allows to subtract the pervasive noise generated by the heterogeneous tissue environment.</p><p>Here, we present a method that allows for the encapsulation of homogeneous cell populations in diffusible hollow fiber capsules that can be transplanted subcutaneously to profile the effects of an aged systemic environment in the absence of short-range cellular interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This approach makes it possible to expose cells from multiple species and different genetic backgrounds to heterotypic physiological environments to characterize gene-environment relationships. It provides a paradigm to disentangle direct effects mediated by systemic signals from cell intrinsic programming and input relayed by accessory cells in the tissue niche.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber capsules for transcriptomic profiling of long-range systemic signals.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scheme outlining interactions in the tissue niche in the context of the systemic circulation.

Importantly, PES fibers are biocompatible, have low immunogenicity, and become vascularized when subcutaneously implanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter et al., 1999</xref>). In order to maximize the number of encapsulated cells and, at the same time, allow for adequate oxygen diffusion throughout the capsule, we selected a tubular HFM with an outer diameter of 0.9 mm and an inner diameter of 0.7 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The spongy-like, cross-linked architecture of PES-HFM allows for the diffusion of molecules up to 280 kDa freely through the membrane but prevents infiltration by cells. To provide a suitable adhesion matrix, cells were embedded in growth factor reduced Matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kleinman et al., 1982</xref>).

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining of cryosections from capsules that were kept in culture for 10 days revealed that over 90% of the cells remained viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). Indicative of proper oxygen and nutrient supply, cell density increased slightly in capsules in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref>). Following 10 days in culture, hskMPs and mskMPs were distributed across the entire diameter of the capsules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, f</xref>). Over the 10-day encapsulation time course, hskMPs and mskMPs showed a mild ≤37% reduction in the number of cells positive for the myogenic marker Pax7, while ≥80% of the cells remained positive for MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–l</xref>). Indicating that the capsule 3D context favors the maintenance of myogenic markers, hskMPs in classic 2D culture downregulated Pax7 and MyoD expression by 62% and MyoD by 37% over the same 10-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). No apparent difference in the distribution of mitochondria was observed when hskMPs or mskMPs in 2D culture were compared to encapsulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>).

Growth factor deprivation over a 4-day differentiation period induced a robust ≥80% reduction of Pax7 in hskMPs and mskMPs, reduced MyoD by 43% in human cells, and, in spite of spatial restraints due to 3D embedding, increased the terminal differentiation marker myosin heavy chain (MHC) by ≥170% in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m-s</xref>). After encapsulation, proliferative cells could be recovered from the capsules by enzymatic liberation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

The animals were anesthetized, and incisions were made on the back slightly posterior to each scapula. Three to four capsules containing hskMPs or mskMPs were introduced in varying locations into the subcutaneous fascia over the ribcage separated by 3–5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Next to many exclusively niche controlled processes, we observed an overlap with respect to an upregulation of Myc and E2F targets, as well as a downregulation of myogenesis and EMT. Collectively, these results demonstrate that aging is associated with an increased abundance of systemic inflammatory molecules that correlates with higher activity of Myc and E2F transcription factors, cellular senescence, and a reduced differentiation potential of myogenic progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Exposure to aged serum only captures a fraction of systemically affected pathways</title><p>We next set out to determine whether the systemic aging signature we observed using encapsulated cells in vivo can be reproduced using a simple cell culture paradigm. To this end we exposed hskMPs in 2D culture for 4 and 10 days to young and aged human serum, isolated RNA, and performed and genome-wide transcriptomic profiling. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that aged human serum led to a weak induction of pathways at day 4, while more gene categories and a partial overlap with the profile obtained from encapsulated myogenic progenitors in old mice was observed at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1k, l</xref>). In particular, the top three pathways, Myc targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and E2F targets, were similarly induced by aged human serum in vitro and in encapsulated myogenic progenitors in old mice. Counterintuitively, the category myogenesis was upregulated by aged serum in vitro after both 4 and 10 days of exposure. Moreover, other gene set categories such as fatty acid metabolism that were induced in both encapsulated cells in old mice and in aged freshly isolated myogenic progenitors were not affected by aged serum in vitro.</p><p>After both 4 or 10 days of exposure of hskMPs to aged human serum in vitro, we observed a robust response in downregulated gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1m, n</xref>). However, in particular, the top downregulated gene sets showed poor overlap with the profile obtained from encapsulated hskMPs or mskMPs in aged mice or in freshly isolated old myogenic progenitors. Moreover, myogenesis, which was consistently downregulated in both encapsulated cells and in freshly isolated cells in the aged condition, was not repressed by aged serum in vitro.</p><p>In contrast to our observations using encapsulated cells, we observed that aged human serum in vitro did not increase the abundance of senescence-associated β-galactosidase positive cells or affect the fusion index of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5a–f</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that the effects of systemic aging observed in encapsulated myogenic progenitors in old mice can only partially be reproduced in vitro.</p><p>We conclude that cell encapsulation allows to capture the transcriptional effects of systemic aging on myogenic progenitors at unprecedented resolution. Long-range signals in the aged circulation lead to a deregulation of a broad spectrum of pathways, including an activation of Myc and E2F transcription factors, as well as an induction of anti-myogenic and senescence-related processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that encapsulation of syn- and xenogeneic cells allows for systemic transcriptional profiling independent of short-range heterogeneous cellular interactions. The effects of aged serum on cells in 2D culture only partially overlapped with our observations in encapsulated cells in young and old mice. This result supports the notion that certain factors in the systemic circulation are unstable in vitro or have a very short half-life. Compared to other types of capsules that have been used in mice, for instance planar macroencapsulation devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lathuilière et al., 2014</xref>), hollow fiber capsules are miniaturized to a diameter of 0.7 mm and a length of 1 cm that can be varied according to need. PES is one of the most frequently used polymers in medical applications and, due to its low immunogenicity, has been studied extensively in the context of artificial organs and medical devices used for blood purification in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Samtleben et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tullis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Werner et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). Underlining its biocompatibility, we observed that subcutaneous implantation of PES capsules did not induce systemic inflammatory markers.</p><p>The myofascia of the ribcage is extensively vascularized and in proximity to bone and skeletal muscle. Thus, resembling the endogenous niche environment of myogenic cells, it was well suitable as an implantation site for our study. However, for investigation of other cell types that require implantation in different tissues or organs, the hollow fiber capsule format may not be ideal and may have to be adapted. Further miniaturization of the capsules would likely yield insufficient mRNA for bulk transcriptomics and either extensive amplification or single-cell sequencing would be required for downstream processing. Given, the broad interest of the aging field in using skeletal muscle stem cells as a model system for tissue maintenance and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drew, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evano and Tajbakhsh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gopinath and Rando, 2008</xref>), we selected myogenic progenitors for our profiling experiments. We observed that after viable proliferative cells can be enzymatically liberated from the capsules. Thus, our method is not limited to bulk transcriptomic profiling, but could also be modified to allow for single-cell sequencing or for the in vitro study of long-lasting intrinsic adaptations induced by exposure to an aged systemic environment.</p><p>Worldwide, the population of aged individuals has grown to an unprecedented size, and by 2050 more than 430 million people will be over the age of 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drew, 2018</xref>). The characterization of bona fide aging signatures in defined cell populations independent of the heterogeneous niche context could potentially allow for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the systemic treatment of age-associated cellular dysfunction in frail individuals. Importantly, cell encapsulation allows to filter out the dominant noise of the aged tissue that is in direct contact with the cell population of interest. Only long-range signaling factors are able to diffuse over the capsule membrane, which allows to read out effects of these molecules independent of extracellular matrix, heterologous cell-cell contacts, and short-range paracrine growth factors secreted by accessory cells in the tissue. Therefore, in contrast to profiling of cells directly extracted from aged niches or following parabiotic pairing, encapsulation allows to obtain a pure and unbiased transcriptional signature of the systemic environment in defined cell types of choice and makes this amenable to cellular signaling across different species. As such, encapsulation is not an alternative to studying cells in their endogenous niche, but a complementary approach that allows to dissect specific questions on systemic versus tissue-mediated interactions.</p><p>Using gene set enrichment analysis, we observed that the aged systemic environment induces senescence, is anti-myogenic, and activates the Myc and E2F family of transcription factors in both mouse and human myogenic progenitors. E2F1, which interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, has been shown to have a role in promoting cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimri et al., 2000</xref>). Mice haploinsufficient for Myc exhibit an increased life span and are resistant to osteoporosis, cardiac fibrosis, and immunosenescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofmann et al., 2015</xref>). Rapalogs, which inhibit the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, increase life span and delay hallmarks of aging in many species. It has been shown that the rapalog RAD001, counter-regulates Myc in aged kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shavlakadze et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, Myc is known to be induced by mitogens and inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with these observations, we detected significantly increased levels of systemic proinflammatory factors in aged mice. Interestingly, fundamental biological mechanisms, such as RNA processing and inflammation-related processes affected in our encapsulation study, were also changed in brain tissue of heterochronic parabionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baruch et al., 2014</xref>). Altogether, our study suggests that these cellular mechanisms are a consequence of systemic aging that occur independent of the influence of heterologous tissue-resident accessory cells. In contrast, comparison to myogenic cells directly isolated from skeletal muscle tissue indicates that processes such as apoptosis are imposed by the aged niche and are not directly affected by the systemic environment.</p><p>Importantly, our protocol is not limited to aging and might also allow to assess the impact of other multisystemic conditions on defined cell populations of interest. Moreover, in future applications, the combination of encapsulation technology with genetically engineered or induced pluripotent stem cell derived cells could allow to study systemic effects under controlled physiological conditions at an unprecedented level of detail.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human skeletal myoblasts (hskMPs, Lonza, CC-2580) isolated from donated human tissue of 20-year-old healthy Caucasians were used at passages 3–5 after obtaining permission for their use in research applications by the Cantonal Ethical Commission of Canton de Vaud (CER-VD).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Mashinchian et al., describes an innovative approach to dissect the effects of an age-associated systemic environment on myogenic progenitors encapsulated in diffusible artificial capsules and engrafted into young and old mice. They describe a method whereby mouse and human myogenic progenitors are suspended in a hydrogel matrix which is then cultured within thin plastic capsules that are placed subcutaneously below the skin of young and aged mice for 10 days, followed by transcriptomic analyses of the cell contained within the capsule.</p><p>The novelty of this manuscript stems from the development of a method to dissect the systemic environmental effects of aging.</p><p>This idea is of high interest and deserves further development, as it would provide a simplified model to understand the impact of the milieu on cell type-specific phenotypes, limiting inputs from direct cell-cell interactions. Studies of cultured cells directly implanted in different physiological environments in vivo would be a powerful tool to inform in vivo and ex vivo experiments, including but not limited to parabiosis studies.</p><p>In its current state, however,</p><p>(a) the submission lacks evidence that the method uncovers targets that would have been missed using a simpler approach (i.e. treating the cells in 2D or 3D culture with yng vs aged sera), making it hard to conclude whether the in vivo transplantation method provides an advantage over conventional approaches;</p><p>(b) conclusions about validating aging associated targets first identified by others are based exclusively on transcriptomics analysis, with no further validation;</p><p>(c) and as this is a methods submission, substantial additional basic characterization and validation is needed to establish robustness and reliability of the approach, at least for myogenic progenitors and ideally for at least another relevant cell type.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Studies should include (but not be limited to) descriptive and quantitative 3-D immunocytochemistry for markers indicative of overall architecture, structure and integrity of cytoskeleton and organelles, and quantitative measures of general and cell type-specific function (e.g. mitochondrial function, others relevant to muscle progenitor function). The capsule approach should also be validated functionally with 'positive' controls where the systemic response is already defined and well characterized. Those studies should also define the interindividual variation for the responses 'read' by the inserts.</p><p>Vascularization and other potential changes in the capsules after exposure to the in vivo milieu should be characterized and demonstrated using adequate quantitative approaches, providing scale bars in images, quantitative analyses for outcomes, etc.</p><p>To appropriately evaluate the transcriptomic studies the RNA yields per insert need to be clearly shown, using units of mass per unit volume or mass per insert. If average RNA yields from capsules inserted in young animals are taken as &quot;100%&quot; then it is unclear where the variance in percent values for the 'young' group arises from.</p><p>Because the stated goal of the studies is to develop a general tool, the usefulness of the encapsulation system for the study of more than one cell type should be demonstrated.</p><p>The authors use the word 'niche' as equivalent to cell-cell contacts – however these are only one component of a biological niche, that also include the specific local non-cellular milieu (i.e. specific nutrient and ion composition and levels, as well as specific secretomes, among other factors).</p><p>The sites where inserts were implanted (e.g. spaces that interface different organ systems, or specific areas of organs such as brain) are actually specific 'niches' that are different from the general circulation. The text needs to be revised such that suggested interpretation of the data obtained using the cell encapsulation approach described needs to be revised throughout the text.</p><p>The authors state that they would profile proinflammatory markers to &quot;determine whether Myc induction is due to elevated systemic proinflammatory markers&quot;. The relation is one of association, not causation, so this sentence and others where association is described as causation need to be corrected.</p><p>The authors need to address the following points:</p><p>a) Is the assay necessary: The current gold standard to investigate direct effects of yng vs aged humoral factors on a specific cell population is to treat the cell population in culture with sera and then evaluate downstream cellular and molecular changes. Therefore, to demonstrate the value proposition of moving to the proposed in vivo assay, it is critical to show that the method is sensitive enough to detect known biology, that it can identify new biology, and that the new biology could not be discovered using the current gold standard approach.</p><p>b) Is the assay predictive: At the moment, the evidence that Myc and E2F are induced in aged myogenic cells is based on transcriptomic studies, and the conclusion that this aberrant signaling is driven by inflammatory processes is based on correlation to sera profiling. Further, validation of Myc / E2F as elements of an aging signature is based on comparison of comparing the transcriptomic profiling of myogenic progenitors culture in the capsules to freshly isolated muscle stem cells and brain tissue. Additional modes of validation are warranted to demonstrate the relevance of Myc / E2F in muscle cells and the predictive nature of the method.</p><p>c) Is the assay optimized: The rationale for assay design criteria lack justification and therefore seem arbitrarily selected, which is unusual for a method paper. For example; (a) how was the analysis time-point selected to be Day 10? How does this choice relate to obtaining data that predicts aging factors that directly modulate muscle stem cells?; (b) was there a rationale in selecting a cell seeding density that is close to that used in skeletal muscle tissue engineering applications to create differentiated myotubes?; (c) with muscle stem cells as the desired comparator, were there desired criteria with regards to the differentiation status of the cells within the capsule?; (d) two reconstituted basement membrane (human and mouse) ECMs (~200 pascals) and TrueGel a non-adherent hydrogel (~10 kPa) were compared as scaffolds – what was the rationale for selecting these particular materials as it related to your experimental design?; (e) etc</p><p>While the authors performed an elegant analysis to demonstrate that the myogenic progenitors remain viable and maintain stem cell attributes in capsules, the differentiation assay is based on fuzzy MyHC immunofluorescence and the stained cells do not show multinucleated phenotype as expected. Can the authors comment on the reason their cells did not fuse, or alternatively provide higher resolution images showing multinucleated fibers? This is of particular importance given that they refer to this assay as &quot;terminal differentiation&quot;- however do not provide sufficient evidence of multinucleated muscle formation.</p><p>The authors need to validate using an additional assay aside from RNA-seq (i.e. RT-qPCR or immunofluorescence) the upregulation of select Myc or E2F targets in myogenic progenitors exposed to the aged mouse environment. On a similar note, they need to provide a full or at least partial list of these target genes.</p><p>Given the upregulation of targets of E2F it will be of interest to compare the expression level of canonical cell cycle regulators and senescent markers in myogenic progenitors exposed to old and young mouse environments. It is of further interest to assess if cells exposed to aged environment demonstrate less proliferation via EDU or Ki67 staining and upregulation of senescent markers.</p><p>The category &quot;Myogenesis&quot; is reported as one of the two primary downregulated clusters in myogenic cells exposed to an aged mouse environment. To corroborate this interesting observation, it will significantly strengthen the manuscript if the authors assess whether myogenic progenitors exposed to an old mouse environment exhibit reduced myogenic differentiation potential. This can be done via quantification of MyHC staining or analysis of myotube fusion index between cells exposed to the two conditions.</p><p>The RNA-Seq data analysis points to downregulation of inflammatory response in cells exposed to old vs. young systemic environment, however the authors also concomitantly report on elevated levels of systemic inflammation markers detected in blood of aged mice. Can the authors comment or discuss the discrepancy between these two opposing observations?</p><p>The comparison to a previously published dataset from a parabiosis trial is an underdeveloped off-shoot and the message the authors wish to convey is supported by thin data analysis. The authors need to expand their analysis or discussion on the significance of this observation or alternatively consider removing it from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57393.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Studies should include (but not be limited to) descriptive and quantitative 3-D immunocytochemistry for markers indicative of overall architecture, structure and integrity of cytoskeleton and organelles, and quantitative measures of general and cell type-specific function (e.g. mitochondrial function, others relevant to muscle progenitor function).</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed cell type-specific function of encapsulated cells by staining for the muscle stem cell self-renewal marker Pax7, the myogenic proliferation/activation marker MyoD, and the differentiation marker myosin heavy chain (Figure 2g-s). As suggested, we also performed a staining of mitochondria and the actin cytoskeleton in encapsulated cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a-e). In addition, we now provide staining and quantification of the proliferation marker Ki-67, the senescence marker β-galactosidase, and the differentiation marker myosin heavy chain in encapsulated cells after in vivo exposure to a young and aged systemic environment, as well as after culture in aged human serum in vitro (Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The capsule approach should also be validated functionally with 'positive' controls where the systemic response is already defined and well characterized.

Thus, we chose to sequence myogenic progenitors exposed to young and aged human serum in vitro as an additional control experiment and reference point (Figure 4—figure supplement 4a,b). This experiment revealed that some of the main pathways that were deregulated in encapsulated cells in aged mice are similarly affected by aged serum in vitro. Importantly, in spite of this overlap, we observed that certain aging pathways are differentially regulated between the in vivo encapsulation condition and the in vitro paradigm using serum, which supports the notion that some systemic factors have a very short half-life or are not stable under cell culture conditions and can only be detected in the flux of the circulation. In addition, we demonstrate that the expression profiles of freshly isolated muscle stem cells from old mice partially overlap with the profile we observed using encapsulated cells in vivo (Figure 4e, Supplementary file 1i,j). Thus, we compared our novel in vivo profiling method to multiple positive reference points and the data supports and strengthens our conclusion that cell encapsulation allows for efficient profiling of systemic aging.</p><p>To account for interindividual responses in quantifications, we always provide datapoints representing the different mice and capsules. For instance, each bar in the graphs in figure 3 represents a different mouse and the overlaid datapoints signify different capsules obtained from the respective animals. In all other in vivo experiments, except the bioinformatic analysis, the values of each capsule from different mice are overlaid as datapoints with the bars representing averages. For instance, for the quantifications in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, each datapoint overlaid with a given bar represents a capsule explanted from a different mouse. All bioinformatic analyses include statistical analyses testing for significant differences in gene expression across biological replicates (i.e. independent RNA from capsules obtained from different mice or cell culture replicates) after correction for multiple testing through the false discovery rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Vascularization and other potential changes in the capsules after exposure to the in vivo milieu should be characterized and demonstrated using adequate quantitative approaches, providing scale bars in images, quantitative analyses for outcomes, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide scalebars in all representative images for each readout after exposure to the in vivo milieu, as well as quantitative analysis with statistics that clearly specifies biological replicates (please also see response above).</p><p>The molecular weight cut-off of the capsules is 280 kDa, which is considered too small for cells to pass through. Thus, we could not detect any CD31 positive endothelial cells that are indicative of host derived vascularization in the devices (Figure 3—figure supplement 1b). To address other potential changes in the capsules, we now provide staining and quantification of the proliferation marker Ki-67, the senescence marker β-galactosidase, and the differentiation marker myosin heavy chain in encapsulated cells after in vivo exposure to a young and aged systemic environment (Figure 4—figure supplement 3a-f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To appropriately evaluate the transcriptomic studies the RNA yields per insert need to be clearly shown, using units of mass per unit volume or mass per insert.

Thus, we replicated the majority of our study with two different myogenic cell types: Primary mouse myogenic progenitors and primary human myogenic progenitors. We now also elaborate in the discussion of our manuscript regarding the potential usefulness of our method for other non-myogenic cell types and how the system may have to be adapted for other tissues and organs .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use the word 'niche' as equivalent to cell-cell contacts – however these are only one component of a biological niche, that also include the specific local non-cellular milieu (i.e. specific nutrient and ion composition and levels, as well as specific secretomes, among other factors).</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the meaning of &quot;niche&quot; accordingly we illustrated the different components (short- and long-range signaling factors, ECM, and cell-cell contacts) in figure 1a.

In addition, in the discussion we elaborate again regarding different niche components:</p><p>&quot;cell encapsulation allows to filter out the dominant noise of the aged tissue that is in direct contact with the cell population of interest. Only long-range signaling factors are able to diffuse over the capsule membrane, which allows to read out effects of these molecules independent of extracellular matrix, heterologous cell-cell contacts, and short-range paracrine growth factors secreted by accessory cells in the tissue.&quot; .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sites where inserts were implanted (e.g. spaces that interface different organ systems, or specific areas of organs such as brain) are actually specific 'niches' that are different from the general circulation.

Thus, due to its resemblance to the niche environment of tissue resident myogenic progenitors, it was well suitable as an implantation site for our study. However, for investigation of other cell types that require implantation in different tissues or organs the hollow fiber capsule format may not be ideal and may have to be adapted. Further miniaturization of the capsules would likely yield insufficient mRNA for bulk-sequencing and either extensive amplification or single-cell sequencing would be required for downstream processing.&quot; .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that they would profile proinflammatory markers to &quot;determine whether Myc induction is due to elevated systemic proinflammatory markers&quot;.

Therefore, we designed a study in which we exposed hskMPs in 2D culture for four and ten days to young and aged human serum, isolated RNA, and performed and genome wide transcriptomic profiling. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that aged human serum led to a weak induction of pathways at day four, while more gene categories and a partial overlap with the profile obtained from encapsulated myogenic progenitors in old mice was observed at day ten (Figure 4—figure supplement 4a and Supplementary file 1k,l). In particular, the top three pathways, Myc targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and E2F targets were similar induced by aged human serum in vitro and in encapsulated myogenic progenitors in old mice. Counterintuitively, the category myogenesis was upregulated by aged serum in vitro after both four and ten days of exposure. Moreover, other gene set categories such as fatty acid metabolism that were strongly induced in both encapsulated cells in old mice and in aged freshly isolated myogenic progenitors, were not affected by aged serum in vitro.</p><p>After both four or ten days of exposure of hskMPs to aged human serum in vitro, we observed a robust response in downregulated gene sets (Figure 4—figure supplement 4b and Supplementary file 1m,n). However, in particular the top downregulated gene sets showed poor overlap with the profile obtained from encapsulated hskMPs or mskMPs in aged mice or in freshly isolated old myogenic progenitors. Moreover, myogenesis, which was consistently downregulated in both encapsulated cells and in freshly isolated in the aged condition, was not repressed by aged serum in vitro.</p><p>Importantly, in contrast to our observations using encapsulated cells, we observed that aged human serum in vitro did not increase the abundance of senescent β-galactosidase positive cells or affect the fusion index of the cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 3a-f and 5a-f). Overall, we demonstrate that the effects of systemic aging observed in encapsulated myogenic progenitors in old mice, can only partially be reproduced in vitro. These observations support the notion that certain systemic factors have a very short half-life or are not stable under cell culture conditions and can only be detected in the flux of the circulation.</p><p>To adapt the manuscript to these new broader conclusions, we decided to change its title to &quot;In-Vivo Transcriptomic Profiling using Cell Encapsulation Identifies Effector Pathways of Systemic Aging&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Is the assay predictive: At the moment, the evidence that Myc and E2F are induced in aged myogenic cells is based on transcriptomic studies, and the conclusion that this aberrant signaling is driven by inflammatory processes is based on correlation to sera profiling.

As outlined above, by performing an in vitro experiment using myogenic progenitors exposed to young and aged serum we validated Myc and E2F target genes as markers of systemic aging (Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and Supplementary file 1k-n). Importantly, in-depth functional validation of specific targets would take years of engineering, aging, and analysis of cell-type specific knockout mice. We hope the reviewer agrees that this goes beyond the scope of a single publication and that follow-up studies may be better suited for such a substantive undertaking. However, we'd like to highlight that our results fall well in line with the published literature. As mentioned in the discussion of our manuscript , it has been shown that mice haploinsufficient for Myc exhibit an increased lifespan and are resistant to osteoporosis, cardiac fibrosis and immunosenescence (Hofmann et al., Cell, 2015). Rapalogs, which inhibit the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, increase life span and delay hallmarks of aging in many species. It has been shown that the rapalog RAD001, counter-regulates Myc in aged kidneys (Shavlakadze et al., J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci, 2018). Moreover, E2F1, which interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, has been shown to have a role in promoting cellular senescence (Dimri et al., Mol Cell Biol, 2000).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Is the assay optimized: The rationale for assay design criteria lack justification and therefore seem arbitrarily selected, which is unusual for a method paper. For example; (a) how was the analysis time-point selected to be Day 10?</p></disp-quote><p>As now explained in the Results section of our manuscript, differentiating hskMPs take about ten days until myonuclear acquisition is completed (Cheng et al., Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 2014). In addition, based on the well-known timing of myogenic differentiation in vitro<italic>,</italic> we analyzed two time-points that cover early differentiation (4 days) and chronic adaptations in later stages (10 days) in the presence of young and aged serum (Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and Supplementary file 1 k-n). This in vitro experiment showed that after ten days a significantly higher number of pathways are affected than at the four day time point. Thus, in order to account for eventual differentiative effects of the systemic environment and to obtain a robust response in our profiling experiments, we decided to focus on the ten day time point for in vivo analysis of the capsules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does this choice relate to obtaining data that predicts aging factors that directly modulate muscle stem cells?;</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we compared the pathways affected in encapsulated myogenic cells in young and old mice to the aging profile of freshly isolated tissue resident muscle stem cells (Figure 4e).

Primary myogenic progenitor culture is traditionally performed in rich artificial media containing only about 20% fetal bovine serum, while encapsulated cells in vivo are exposed to the constant flux of the systemic circulation. Therefore, to take possible pro-differentiative effects into consideration and let the encapsulated cells equilibrate, we decided to give them ten days before analysis, which, as mentioned above, is the time typically required to complete myonuclear acquisition in differentiating 2D culture (Cheng et al., Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) two reconstituted basement membrane (human and mouse) ECMs (~200 pascals) and TrueGel a non-adherent hydrogel (~10 kPa) were compared as scaffolds – what was the rationale for selecting these particular materials as it related to your experimental design?; (e) etc</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal was to identify a substrate that contains as little growth factors as possible allowing for an unbiased readout of systemic signals and at the same time keeping the cells viable. In addition, our selection of substrates was based on their commercial availability making it possible for researchers that want to implement our protocol to get easy access to the materials. Growth factor free Matrigel performed best with regard to these criteria (Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors performed an elegant analysis to demonstrate that the myogenic progenitors remain viable and maintain stem cell attributes in capsules, the differentiation assay is based on fuzzy MyHC immunofluorescence and the stained cells do not show multinucleated phenotype as expected. Can the authors comment on the reason their cells did not fuse, or alternatively provide higher resolution images showing multinucleated fibers? This is of particular importance given that they refer to this assay as &quot;terminal differentiation&quot;- however do not provide sufficient evidence of multinucleated muscle formation.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, the effects of the systemic environment on the balance of myogenic progenitor proliferation vs differentiation are not well studied and it is possible that the cells in the capsules react differently from what we usually observe in 2D culture. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that the images we show are actually very thin cross sections of the cylindrical capsules. Thus, except myotubes that by chance differentiated exactly in the plane of the section, they will show up as oblong MyHC positive structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to validate using an additional assay aside from RNA-seq (i.e. RT-qPCR or immunofluorescence) the upregulation of select Myc or E2F targets in myogenic progenitors exposed to the aged mouse environment. On a similar note, they need to provide a full or at least partial list of these target genes.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm our findings regarding Myc and E2F targets, we performed quantitative PCR using mRNA isolated from capsules containing hskMPs that were exposed to the systemic environment in young and aged mice for ten days. This experiment confirmed age-mediated induction of the Myc target small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A' (Snrpa1) and the E2F target transferrin receptor (Tfrc) that were part of the respective gene sets upregulated in encapsulated cells in old mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,d and Supplementary file 1d,e)</p><p>In addition, we performed an in vitro experiment using myogenic progenitors exposed to young and aged serum, which further validated Myc and E2F target genes as markers of systemic aging (Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and Supplementary file 1k-n).</p><p>We now also provide a list of Myc and E2F target genes in encapsulated cells after exposure to systemic aging in vivo (Supplementary file 1d,e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the upregulation of targets of E2F it will be of interest to compare the expression level of canonical cell cycle regulators and senescent markers in myogenic progenitors exposed to old and young mouse environments. It is of further interest to assess if cells exposed to aged environment demonstrate less proliferation via EDU or Ki67 staining and upregulation of senescent markers.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point we performed staining and quantification of the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the senescence marker β-galactosidase in encapsulated cells after in vivo exposure to a young and aged systemic environment (Figure 4—figure supplement 3a-d). While proliferation was not affected, the number of senescent cells was increased in encapsulated cells in the aged condition. Interestingly, cells exposed to young or aged serum in vitro did not show such changes (Figure 4—figure supplement 5a-d). Thus, exposure to an aged environment via in vivo encapsulation is sensitive to senescence, a well validated mechanism of geriatric conversion, while in vitro exposure to aged serum fails to recapitulate this important hallmark of aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The category &quot;Myogenesis&quot; is reported as one of the two primary downregulated clusters in myogenic cells exposed to an aged mouse environment. To corroborate this interesting observation, it will significantly strengthen the manuscript if the authors assess whether myogenic progenitors exposed to an old mouse environment exhibit reduced myogenic differentiation potential. This can be done via quantification of MyHC staining or analysis of myotube fusion index between cells exposed to the two conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a myosin heavy chain staining and quantified the fusion index of cells after encapsulation in young and aged mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 3e,f). This experiment confirmed a reduction of the myogenic capacity of the cells upon exposure to systemic aging. Once again, exposure to aged serum in vitro failed to recapitulate this phenotype (Figure 4—figure supplement 5e,f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The RNA-Seq data analysis points to downregulation of inflammatory response in cells exposed to old vs. young systemic environment, however the authors also concomitantly report on elevated levels of systemic inflammation markers detected in blood of aged mice. Can the authors comment or discuss the discrepancy between these two opposing observations?</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion of our paper, we elaborate regarding a role of Myc signaling in mediating inflammatory responses and cite Liu et al., (please see below for the full reference). Nevertheless, we agree that it is intriguing that in spite of higher levels of proinflammatory systemic cytokines, certain inflammatory processes appear to be downregulated as a consequence of exposure to systemic aging. It is possible that, compared to immune cells whose response to pro-inflammatory molecules is well characterized, stem cells react non-canonically.</p><p>Liu, T., Zhou, Y., Ko, K.S., and Yang, H.
