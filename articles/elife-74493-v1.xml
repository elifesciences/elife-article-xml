recall. Dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been proposed to perform associative computations in other PC types by detecting conjunctive activation of different afferent input pathways, initiating afterdepolarization (ADP), and triggering burst firing. Implementation of such operations fundamentally depends on the actual biophysical properties of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes; yet little is known about these properties in dendrites of CA3PCs. Using dendritic patch-clamp recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute slices from male rats, we report that, unlike CA1PCs, distal apical trunk dendrites of CA3PCs exhibit distinct forms of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Besides ADP-type global Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, a majority of dendrites expresses a novel, fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike type that is initiated locally without bAPs, can recruit additional Na<sup>+</sup> currents, and is compartmentalized to the activated dendritic subtree. Occurrence of the different Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike types correlates with dendritic structure, indicating morpho-functional heterogeneity among CA3PCs. Importantly, ADPs and dendritically initiated spikes produce opposing somatic output: bursts versus strictly single-action potentials, respectively. The uncovered variability of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes may underlie heterogeneous input-output transformation and bursting properties of CA3PCs, and might specifically contribute to key associative and non-associative computations performed by the CA3 network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>CA3 pyramidal cell</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ spike</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>burst</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CoG 771849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makara</surname><given-names>Judit K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55008740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makara</surname><given-names>Judit K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011019</institution-id><institution>National Research Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K-124824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makara</surname><given-names>Judit K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dendritic patch-clamp recordings combined with two-photon imaging and glutamate uncaging reveal two types of regenerative calcium spikes in the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendrites play a critical role in the integration and plasticity of synaptic inputs. Voltage-dependent ion channels and passive electrical properties of dendrites enable neurons to perform various forms of linear and nonlinear input-output transformation. In particular, cortical pyramidal cell (PC) dendrites are thought to support multiple types of regenerative dendritic spikes (d-spikes), including Na<sup>+</sup> spikes (mediated by voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels [VGNCs]), NMDA spikes (mediated by NMDARs), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (mediated by voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [VGCCs]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). While Na<sup>+</sup> and NMDA spikes can be generated locally in individual thin dendrites of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ariav et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are thought to represent mostly global dendritic events that are responsible for bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Francioni and Harnett, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magee and Carruth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stuyt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Williams and Stuart, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Studies in hippocampal CA1PCs and neocortical layer 5 PCs (L5PCs) have shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are generated in the main apical trunk efficiently upon widespread synaptic depolarization in distal (tuft) dendrites concomitant with backpropagating action potentials (bAPs), and manifest as an afterdepolarization (ADP) producing a characteristic burst of additional APs (also called complex spike burst [CSB]) at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harnett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>). These results led to a concept that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes can act as an associative dendritic signal that translates a specific input pattern (coincident activation of proximal and distal input pathways) into a burst output (a reliable form of downstream synaptic information transfer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lisman, 1997</xref>) and induce synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>). However, the question emerges: Do Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes ubiquitously serve such a canonical role in PCs, or do different PC types express Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes with different properties, allowing them to support other input-output transformations and computations?</p><p>A particularly interesting PC type to explore these questions are hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). These neurons play a fundamental role in hippocampal associative learning and memory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kesner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McNaughton and Morris, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolls, 2007</xref>), forming a recurrent network governed by input from the dentate gyrus via mossy fibers (MFs) and the entorhinal cortex (EC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Witter, 2007</xref>). CA3PCs frequently produce bursts of APs both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hablitz and Johnston, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kowalski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mizuseki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong and Prince, 1978</xref>). Investigating CSB generation in CA3PCs, we have recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>) that CA3PCs are heterogeneous regarding their intrinsic CSB firing propensity, and the required synaptic input patterns for evoking CSBs can be diverse as well: while in a subset of CA3PCs associative inputs drive bursts, in other CA3PCs even inputs restricted to single dendrites can efficiently produce CSBs. However, the dendritic factors underlying this diversity remained to be explored. Little is known about the generation mechanisms and properties of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in CA3PCs. Early studies using blind microelectrode recordings observed putative dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes to which bursting was attributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuñez and Buño, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 1979</xref>). Later, direct patch-clamp recordings in CA3PC dendrites revealed and dissected Na<sup>+</sup> and NMDA spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandalise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>), but Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes have not been specifically examined. Intriguingly, unlike several widely studied PC types (e.g., CA1 or L5) that typically have a long or once bifurcating main apical trunk, the primary apical trunk of CA3PCs bifurcates after a relatively short distance into multiple higher-order intermediate branches. This structure creates separate apical subtrees that may represent independent, parallel integrative units for dendritic processing, allowing interactions between the radially layered inputs: detonator-type MF synapses onto proximal trunks in str. lucidum, recurrent/associative inputs onto str. radiatum dendrites, and long-range EC inputs targeting distal apical branches in str. lacunosum-moleculare. However, whether individual higher-order dendritic families express Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes with specific characteristics and function remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we performed patch-clamp recordings from higher-order apical dendrites of CA3PCs (alone or simultaneously with their soma) combined with two-photon (2P) Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in the dendritic tree. We report that these dendrites support surprisingly heterogeneous forms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes that differ from that found in CA1PC dendrites. Besides relatively prolonged ADP-type global Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, a majority of CA3PC dendrites expresses a novel form of fast spike (termed dendritically initiated [DI] spike) that is efficiently triggered without bAPs, is mediated by a combination of fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents, and is compartmentalized to the activated dendritic family. Finally, we show that ADP type and DI spikes produce opposing forms of somatic output: bursts versus strictly single APs, and thereby may actively promote different firing modes in morpho-functionally different CA3PCs. The unique properties of DI spikes, such as their fast kinetics and anti-bursting effect, fundamentally differ from the classical associative role of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, suggesting that they may enrich the computational repertoire of CA3PCs with novel, cell type- or circuit-specific functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of regenerative spikes in CA3PCs dendrites</title><p>To directly investigate active dendritic properties of CA3PCs, we performed dual soma-dendrite current-clamp recordings combined with two-photon imaging in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Categorization by this simple criterion well matched with subjective categorization of events by visual inspection (&lt;0.2% mismatch of events that were confidently categorized to either group by human eye).

On the other hand, fast dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes were generated in a subset of experiments (n = 4) by large (I<sub>inj</sub>; ≥ 600 pA) current injections into the dendrite. These events appeared with very short latency (&lt;7 ms) on the initial depolarizing phase of the step and attenuated strongly from dendrite to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–j</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Both of these fast spike types disappeared after the application of 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) in the bath, confirming that they were mediated by VGNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, n = 12 experiments; local spikes were present in two of these experiments under control conditions; see also later the effect of TTX in single-site dendritic recordings).</p><p>In the majority of dual recordings (17 of 21), we also observed slower regenerative voltage responses that we considered to be putative dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These spikes were elicited with relatively longer latency or at the steady-state depolarized phase, and had highly heterogeneous kinetics (see below). We classified putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes into two broad groups based on their initiation characteristics. The first, ‘classical’ group consisted of regenerative ADP forms, that is, responses that followed a bAP with an additional voltage peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). ADPs had a wide range of kinetics. In some dendrites, the ADP manifested as a sustained depolarization that triggered additional APs and gradually built up a prolonged, slowly decaying ADP driving a burst of APs (‘slow ADP,’ &gt;~ 50–100 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In other cases, the ADP occurred as a transient regenerative voltage response following 1–3 APs (‘fast ADP,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>), which either remained subthreshold or evoked additional AP(s) at the soma.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Diverse dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike forms in soma-dendrite dual recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of experiments.

The dominant Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike type often depended on the I<sub>inj</sub> level, with ADPs evoked at smaller and DI spikes evoked at higher I<sub>inj</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and f</xref>). Furthermore, in some dendrites different Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike types occurred intermingled within the same depolarizing trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). As in dual recordings, both ADPs and DI spikes were associated with large Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals measured in dendritic segments &gt; 80 μm (mean ± SEM: 215 ± 9 μm) distal to the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Bath application of 200 μM Ni<sup>2+</sup> eliminated all types of putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, whereas bAPs and dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes were spared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>). These results confirmed that VGCCs played a fundamental role in mediating ADPs and DI spikes. Interestingly, the amplitude of DI spikes, measured at threshold I<sub>inj</sub> (see Materials and methods for amplitude measurement criteria), was larger (25.4 ± 1.7 mV, n = 30) than that of fast ADPs (16.2 ± 1.8 mV, n = 18; Mann–Whitney test p=0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). This difference was not explained by different dendritic distance of the recordings from the soma (DI spikes: 259 ± 12 μm, ADPs: 243 ± 10 μm, Mann–Whitney test p=0.601, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), and the amplitude of neither spike type correlated with distance (Spearman correlation: ADP: <italic>R</italic> = −0.260, p=0.296, n = 18; DI: <italic>R</italic> = −0.297, p=0.110, n = 30), suggesting a difference in the spike generation mechanism rather than simple distance-dependent variation of spike properties.</p><p>We next addressed the question of whether the soma or the dendrite is more likely to first generate a regenerative spike upon dendritic depolarization. When the patch pipette was positioned at relatively proximal dendritic locations (&lt;~150 μm from soma), somatic APs were always evoked first by dendritic depolarization. However, at more distal dendritic locations DI Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes were often evoked before bAPs, and this propensity depended on the strength of I<sub>inj</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>, ratio at 300 pA: 0.13 ± 0.04, n = 70; 400 pA: 0.26 ± 0.05, n = 75; 500 pA: 0.38 ± 0.05, n = 82; p=0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test) but was independent from the distance from soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>, Spearman correlation <italic>R</italic> = −0.031, p=0.778, n = 82). Thus, DI spikes can be evoked efficiently by local depolarization of medial-distal apical trunks of CA3PCs without any preceding somatic activity.</p><p>To test whether the distinct forms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes observed by I<sub>inj</sub> could be also evoked by more physiological forms of stimulation, we next performed experiments employing synaptic stimulation on the trunk using 2P glutamate uncaging (2PGU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k and l</xref>). We patched dendrites (n = 10 experiments, 230 ± 17 μm from soma) and stimulated 20 clustered spines located along the same dendrite at 171–441 μm distance from the soma quasi-simultaneously 5× at 40 Hz by adjusting the laser power to produce moderately suprathreshold stimulation (bAP or dendritic spike evoked by any of the last three of the five stimuli). To avoid activation of confounding slow NMDA spikes, these experiments were performed in the presence of an NMDAR blocker in the bath (D-AP5, 50 μM). Synaptic stimulation was able to elicit characteristic and well-distinguishable ADPs and DI spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3n</xref>) either separately (ADP only: 3/10 dendrites, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l</xref>; DI spike only: 4/10 dendrites, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3m</xref>) or in combination (1/10 dendrites). In the two dendrites with no d-spikes by moderate stimulation, stronger stimuli could activate ADPs (data not shown). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike profile of the dendrite evoked by uncaging was similar to that seen with I<sub>inj</sub> via the pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l and m</xref>), and DI spikes had amplitudes comparable to that typically evoked by I<sub>inj</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3o</xref>). These results confirm that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike form is an inherent property of the dendrite, and separate Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike modes can be elicited by a wide range of stimuli that reach sufficiently strong local depolarization.</p><p>The surprisingly variable properties of putative dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes found in CA3PC dendrites prompted us to compare these spikes to the well-characterized Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes of CA1PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magee and Carruth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we performed similar experiments in the apical trunks of CA1PCs, at 227–457 μm distance from soma (n = 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In most CA1PCs, dendritic depolarization by 300–600 pA I<sub>inj</sub> evoked VGCC-mediated ADPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a–c, g</xref>), but the required I<sub>inj</sub> to trigger the spikes was higher than that in CA3PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref>). Furthermore, DI spikes were not observed in CA1PC trunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3e</xref>), and accordingly, bAPs were always evoked before Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3f</xref>).</p><p>Thus, active properties of CA3PC trunk dendrites fundamentally differ from those of CA1PCs, indicating that the repertoire and roles of dendritic computation can vary in different types of rat PCs. Curiously, however, some features of CA3PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes resembled those recently described in L2/3PCs in cortical slices removed from human patients (hL2/3PCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, the DI spikes we observed in CA3PCs shared several properties with a novel type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in hL2/3 PCs: they were characterized by bAP-independent initiation, fast rise and large amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), which inversely scaled with increasing I<sub>inj</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–e</xref>). In some dendrites (6 out of 12 tested), the depolarization level-dependent reduction in amplitude created a window of dendritic stimulus strength where APs could be specifically triggered by these dendritic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), similarly to that described in hL2/3PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>). A systematic comparison of the parameters of DI spikes in CA3PCs to those reported for hL2/3PCs revealed remarkable qualitative similarities with moderate quantitative differences (CA3PC: amplitude at threshold I<sub>inj</sub>: 25.43 ± 1.74 mV, n = 30; width at half amplitude: 6.43 ± 0.75 ms, n = 18; exponential decay constant [tau] of normalized amplitude vs. I<sub>inj</sub>: 0.47; hL2/3PC parameters from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>: amplitude: 43.8 ± 13.8 mV; width: 4.4 ± 1.4 ms; tau: 0.39).

Therefore, we examined in more detail the possibility that VGNCs contribute in some form selectively to DI spikes. First, we determined which parameters of the spike were most affected by TTX. Our analysis showed that the reduction of spike amplitude was largely caused by a drop in peak voltage (from –0.8 ± 2.2 mV to –15.6 ± 1.3 mV, n = 17, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>) rather than the modest increase in spike threshold (from –27.2 ± 1.0 mV to –23.7 ± 1.0 mV, n = 17, p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e and f</xref>).

As an independent confirmation of the involvement of VGNCs in the generation of DI spikes, replacement of a majority of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the ACSF with the large cation NMDG<sup>+</sup> (which permeates less through VGNCs) produced a similar effect to that of TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c and g</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that DI spikes can be mediated by a hybrid mechanism, whereby initiation of a fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike can recruit regenerative activation of VGNCs that further amplify and sharpen the voltage response, with the two components blending smoothly into a rapid and transient combined dendritic spike.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Different Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike types obey distinct compartmentalization rules</title><p>The distinct characteristics of fast and slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike components raise the question whether their propagation and compartmentalization properties are also different.

We first used the high-affinity dye OGB-1 to be able to detect even small increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a reporter of spike propagation within and across dendritic compartments. We found a strong difference between fast and slow spikes in their propagation properties (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, p&lt;0.001 for kinetic group, p=0.005 for location, p&lt;0.001 for interaction). Slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (width &gt;60 ms) were accompanied by large (likely dye-saturating) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals both in d1 and d2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and c</xref>, n = 5 cells, p=0.781, Tukey’s post hoc test), and even in basal dendrites (measured in n = 3 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), indicating efficient propagation across major bifurcation points or even the entire dendritic tree.

Therefore, we examined the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike phenotype and morphological properties of CA3PCs in our dataset. In almost all of our fluorescently labeled cells, we unambiguously confirmed the presence of TEs. The estimated coverage of the proximal trunk(s) by TEs varied widely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>) and was inversely correlated with the length of first-order apical trunk(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, Spearman correlation <italic>R</italic> = −0.495, p&lt;0.001, n = 89), confirming previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fitch et al., 1989</xref>) and suggesting a gradient of morpho-functional properties of regular CA3PCs. We found that the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike profile was correlated with these basic anatomical features of CA3PCs. First, CA3PCs expressing DI spikes in the recorded dendrite (with or without ADPs) had on average twice as high TE coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, ADP-only: 40 ± 5 μm, n = 19; DI: 84 ± 8 μm, n = 35, Mann–Whitney test: p&lt;0.001) than ADP-only cells. Second, cells with DI spikes had shorter primary trunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, ADP-only: 128 ± 11 μm, n = 20; DI: 57 ± 5 μm, n = 41, Mann–Whitney test: p=0.002) and more often had multiple first-order trunks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>, ADP-only: 1 ± 0, n = 20; DI: 1.49 ± 0.11, n = 41, Mann–Whitney test: p&lt;0.001) than ADP-only cells. Interestingly, although the distance of the dendritic patch pipette from the soma was similar in the two electrophysiological groups (ADP-only: 276 ± 15 μm, n = 20; DI: 260 ± 10 μm, n = 41, Mann–Whitney test: p=0.282, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), the dendritic path between the pipette and soma contained more branch points in the case of dendrites with DI spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>, ADP-only: 4.15 ± 0.36, n = 20; DI: 5.97 ± 0.35, n = 39, Mann–Whitney test: p&lt;0.001).

The widely accepted idea is that the primary effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes on output is the generation of bursts. ADP-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes indeed served such a role: they often triggered additional somatic spike(s) to produce short (2–3 APs) or long (&gt;3 APs) series of APs or bursts after the first initiating AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a and b</xref>). In contrast, DI spikes never evoked more than a single somatic AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a–c</xref>). Furthermore, compared to simple bAPs (s-APs), the bAP evoked by DI spikes (Ca-APs) was followed by a faster repolarization rate (ratio of dV/dt<sub>min</sub> (Ca-APs/s-APs): 1.29 ± 0.04, p=0.001, Wilcoxon test compared to 1) and enhanced fast afterhyperpolarization (difference of AHP V<sub>min</sub> (Ca-AP ˗ s-AP): –2.68 ± 0.34 mV, p=0.001, Wilcoxon test compared to 0) in the dendrites (n = 13, pooled dual [n = 5] and dendrite-only [n = 8] recordings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as larger AHP at the soma (s-AP: –3.21 ± 0.89 mV, Ca-AP: –4.70 ± 1.12 mV, measured in n = 5 dual recordings, p=0.043, Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c, d and f</xref>).

While ADP-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been described in apical trunks of various PC types, their properties have rarely been systematically evaluated and compared. We found that the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes underlying ADPs in CA3PCs are typically longer lasting (on average approximately threefold) than similar type Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in CA1PC trunks. We also showed that slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes appear globally throughout the apical (or even the whole) dendritic arbor, and they are most prevalent in CA3PCs with relatively long single primary trunks. These properties altogether well align with the high burst propensity observed in deep distal CA3PCs, which show this morphological feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>). At this point, it is not clear whether slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes are evoked <italic>ab ovo</italic> as a ‘global’ dendritic spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Connelly et al., 2015</xref>) or they have a specific generation zone from where they invade the arbor. The results suggest that the long primary apical trunk acts as a designated generation site for slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, but it is also possible that this dendritic trait simply correlates with other features (possibly including passive and/or active ion channel-mediated dendritic properties) that promote slow spike generation.</p><p>In addition to slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, depolarization also evoked a novel fast form of DI spikes in a large fraction of CA3PC trunk dendrites. DI spikes are generated by fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, which, if large enough, can recruit subsequent contribution by regenerative VGNC activation. Especially when combined into such hybrid d-spike, fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes can produce large enough depolarization in a window above threshold stimulation to efficiently evoke a tightly coupled AP at the soma. Curiously, these APs are immediately followed by enhanced repolarization and AHP both at dendrite and soma, cutting off depolarization and actively blocking burst firing. As a result, DI spikes produced strictly single APs, a form of input-output transformation that is the opposite of that generally proposed for Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. This means that the regular spiking firing profile of certain CA3PCs may be not simply due to a lack of d-spikes (or other mechanisms) promoting bursts, but instead due to a specific form of local dendritic spikes that actively produces non-bursting, regular spiking firing phenotype. From another point of view, DI spikes might serve to amplify certain local apical synaptic input forms without strong perisomatic dendritic activity (i.e., no bAPs) to promote an output, yet they do so in a way that prevents switching to burst firing, which can be preserved for signaling different input patterns, for example, associative input conjunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting aspect of DI spikes is their semi-compartmentalization: they propagate well towards distally in the dendritic subtree belonging to the depolarized intermediary trunk, but they propagate poorly proximally and fail near the major bifurcation zone ~100 μm from the soma. Thus, dendritic families composed of higher-order trunks with connected daughter branches can correspond to independent spatial units of synaptic integration and/or plasticity (~3–5 units per cell). This represents a ‘mesoscale’ level of compartmentalization that is intermediate between global and local (branch specific) d-spikes. One might speculate that DI spikes could be particularly suited to promote compartmentalized induction of synaptic or intrinsic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>) plasticity because the evoked single APs, backpropagating from the soma to other parts of the dendritic arbor, would likely be inefficient to induce substantial plasticity outside the spike-generating dendritic family. Such compartmentalized plasticity could lead to biased wiring of correlated synaptic inputs targeting specific apical subtrees. It remains to be seen whether such mesoscale connectivity structure exists in CA3PCs, in addition to the fine-scale clustering of inputs previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, due to their strong attenuation, DI spikes are challenging to detect and likely remain overlooked with somatic voltage recording techniques; multisite measurements in dendrites and soma, for example, with fast voltage imaging techniques will be required to uncover this form of input-output transformation in vivo.</p><p>While we classified the dendrites based on whether they expressed DI spikes, it is likely that large transient ADPs that we also observed in some of the dendrites were mediated by a similar fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike mechanism to that producing DI spikes. In fact, in several dendrites smaller I<sub>inj</sub> evoked fast ADPs, whereas at higher I<sub>inj</sub> DI spikes occurred. We speculate that at weaker depolarization the arrival of a bAP can provide the necessary stimulus to trigger the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike that therefore appears as an ADP; the inactivation of VGNCs during the initializing bAP may prevent their further contribution to the spike. In contrast, stronger depolarization can itself initiate the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, which in turn can trigger an additional Na<sup>+</sup> spike component to develop the full fast hybrid DI spike. Notably, a substantial fraction of CA3PCs coexpressed different types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Altogether, the various forms of fast and slow dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in the complex branching apical tree provide particularly large room for specific input-output transformations in CA3PCs depending on the strength and actual spatiotemporal pattern of activity of the three different sources of afferent synaptic inputs.</p><p>Further studies are required to elucidate the biophysical mechanisms and implications of the diverse spike characteristics. In particular, future work is needed to resolve whether the diversity may be explained by differences in the molecular composition or functional properties of various VGCC subtypes producing kinetically different Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avery and Johnston, 1996</xref>) or other, particularly K<sup>+</sup> channel types (e.g., specific voltage-dependent or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels), as well as the role of passive properties. While ion channels may be regulated in an activity- or state-dependent fashion, the observed correlation of functional and morphological properties of CA3PCs suggests an at least partially rigid organization of d-spike mechanisms in different dendritic compartments (although proximal apical CA3 dendritic morphology is plastic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Juraska et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McEwen and Magarinos, 1997</xref>). A reasonably long primary trunk appears to allow the generation of slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes with a low threshold that can be reached both by synaptic/dendritic and somatic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>), whereas higher-order trunks may be diverse individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike generators. It needs to be studied by future work how the summation of the various d-spikes at the soma finally determines the shape and burstiness of AP output. It will be also interesting to explore the theoretical aspects of how the complex rules driving specific output responses and plasticity mechanisms evoked by different state-dependent input combinations can contribute to the postulated pattern separation and pattern completion functions of the CA3 network during spatial navigation and memory processes.</p><p>The functional properties of DI spikes we discovered in rat CA3PCs resemble those recently described for dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (called dCaAPs) in L2/3PCs of the human neocortex derived from patients operated for epilepsy or tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>). Except for somewhat different amplitudes, the kinetics and the inverse relationship of amplitude with depolarization of these spikes in rat CA3PCs was similar to that in hL2/3PCs. While dCaAPs of human neurons were present in TTX (similar to our results), comparison of spike properties before and after TTX application was not reported; therefore, it remains to be determined whether dCaAPs in human neurons have similar hybrid Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> spike components as DI spikes in rat CA3PCs. Altogether, our results contradict the idea that DI Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes would have developed to support human specific cortical computations. Instead, it is intriguing to speculate that DI spikes may contribute to basic circuit computation motifs shared by hippocampal CA3 and superficial cortical PCs, for example, related to their intermediate position in a sequential chain of input processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shepherd, 2011</xref>). Finally, the presence of DI Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons of healthy rats is a strong indication for their physiological role and argues against a possibility that the expression of these spikes in human neurons could have been related to disease or pharmacological treatment.</p><p>Altogether, our results point out that different types of PCs may utilize different structure-function models for dendritic computations (i.e., different architecture of hierarchical and parallel nodes of nonlinear synaptic integration) that allow complex forms of input-output transformations. The cell-type-specific forms of dendritic spikes raise the idea that active dendrites may support circuit-specific computations, whereas the heterogeneity within a principal cell class suggests that PC subpopulations may be dedicated to perform different information processing functions. Elucidating how these diverse models are employed in vivo under behaviorally relevant conditions of natural complex excitatory input patterns, inhibition, and neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>) will be a major step towards understanding how single-cell computations can serve the network functions underlying appropriate and flexible behaviors to adapt to environmental challenges.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Hippocampal slice preparation</title><p>Adult male Wistar rats (7–12 weeks old, RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:RGD_737929">:RGD_737929</ext-link>) were used to prepare 400-µm-thick slices from the hippocampus as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>), according to methods approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine, and in accordance with the Institutional Ethical Codex, Hungarian Act of Animal Care and Experimentation 40/2013 (II.14), and European Union guidelines (86/609/EEC/2 and 2010/63/EU Directives). Animals were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and quickly perfused through the heart with ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): sucrose 220, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 28, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 7, glucose 7, Na-pyruvate 3, and ascorbic acid 1, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The brain was quickly removed and slices were prepared in cutting solution using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica, Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). Slices were incubated in a submerged holding chamber in ACSF at 35°C for 30 min and then stored in the same chamber at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Patch-clamp recordings</title><p>Slices were transferred to a custom-made submerged recording chamber under the microscope where experiments were performed at 32–34°C in ACSF containing (in mM) NaCl 125, KCl 3, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.3, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 25, Na-pyruvate 3, and ascorbic acid 1, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Neuron were visualized using Zeiss Axio Examiner or Olympus BX-61 epifluorescent microscope with water immersion lens (63× or 60× during recording, 20× or 10× for overview z-stacks, Zeiss or Olympus). Higher-order apical dendritic trunks in str. radiatum were patched under oblique or Dodt contrast illumination. After establishing the dendritic whole-cell configuration, cells were loaded for &gt;10 min to visualize the soma and dendritic tree by 2P imaging. Neurons were carefully inspected for TEs on thick parent dendrites (to verify they were CA3PCs), and that no main dendritic trunk was cut. In dual recordings, the soma was patched subsequently, guided by 2P imaging. Neurons included in this study were all recorded in different slices, typically from different animals.</p><p>Dendritic (6–10 MΩ) and somatic (4–6 MΩ) patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mM) K-gluconate 134, KCl 6, HEPES 10, NaCl 4, Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP 4, Tris<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, phosphocreatine 14 (pH = 7.25) complemented with 50 µM Alexa Fluor 594 and 100 µM Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) or Oregon Green BAPTA-6F (OGB-6F) (all fluorescent dyes from Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). Electrophysiological results were similar using OGB-1 and OGB-6F, and therefore results obtained with different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dyes were pooled.</p><p>Current-clamp whole-cell recordings were performed using BVC-700A amplifiers (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) in the active ‘bridge’ mode, filtered at 3 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz. Series resistance was typically between 15 and 30 MΩ at the soma and 25–60 MΩ at the dendrite (if possible, reduced by gently blowing into the pipette), frequently checked and compensated with bridge balance and capacitance compensation. Membrane potentials (V<sub>m</sub>) are reported without correction for liquid junction potential (~10 mV). The baseline V<sub>m</sub> was kept at –68 to –72 mV with appropriate constant current injection. Dendritic V<sub>m</sub> of CA3PCs ranged between –53 and –73 mV, R<sub>in</sub> was 105 ± 3 MΩ. In all dual recordings, somatic V<sub>m</sub> was more negative than –60 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>). A set of experiments were performed on apical trunk dendrites of CA1PCs at ~230–460 μm dendritic distance from the soma; experiments were identical to those in CA3PCs except that V<sub>m</sub> was held between –64 and –68 mV. Dendritic V<sub>m</sub> of CA1PCs ranged between –59 and –62 mV, and R<sub>in</sub> was 44 ± 9 MΩ.</p><p>TTX, NBQX disodium salt, D-AP5 (Tocris), and NiCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma) were prepared in stock solution in distilled water, stored at –20°C (NiCl<sub>2</sub> at room temperature) and dissolved to final concentration into bubbled ACSF before application. To reduce extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration, in some experiments NaCl was replaced with equal concentration of NMDGCl in the ACSF. Modified ACSF solutions were applied for at least 10 min before testing their effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two-photon imaging and uncaging</title><p>A dual galvanometer-based two-photon scanning system (Bruker, formerly Prairie Technologies, Middleton, WI) was used to image the patched neurons and to uncage glutamate at individual dendritic spines as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makara and Magee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>). Two ultrafast pulsed laser beams (Chameleon Ultra II; Coherent, Auburn, CA) were used: one laser at 920 or 860 nm for imaging OGB dyes and Alexa Fluor 594, respectively, and the other laser tuned to 720 nm to photolyze MNI-caged-L-glutamate (Tocris; 10 mM in ACSF) that was applied through a puffer pipette with an ~20–30 μm-diameter, downward-tilted aperture above the slice using a pneumatic ejection system (PDES-02TX, NPI, Tamm, Germany). The intensity of the laser beams was independently controlled with electro-optical modulators (model 350-80, Conoptics, Danbury, CT). Linescan Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements were performed with 6–8.8 μs dwell time at ~200–300 Hz.</p><p>Glutamate uncaging was performed at a clustered set of 20 spines on the patched apical trunk using 0.5 ms uncaging duration at each spine with 0.1 ms intervals between synapses, repeated five times at 40 Hz (i.e., gamma burst stimulus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>). Uncaging laser power was adjusted to yield compound voltage responses near the threshold of regenerative events (bAPs or dendritic spikes), preferably so that both subthreshold and suprathreshold responses could be evoked. The average amplitude of the voltage response at the first pulse was 19.2 ± 2 mV (n = 10 dendrites).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis of voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings was performed using custom-written macros in IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). For calculating input resistance and soma-dendrite voltage transfer, we measured the steady-state voltage change to 50 pA, 300 ms hyperpolarizing step current injections from baseline V<sub>m</sub>. In cells with a high rate of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), the above electrophysiological properties were not determined.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are expressed as ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = (F(t)-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F(t) is fluorescence at a given time point and F<sub>0</sub> is the mean fluorescence during 50 ms preceding the depolarizing I<sub>inj</sub>. To measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), traces were aligned to the initial rise (300–400 mV/s dV/dt value) of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike, and we calculated the difference between the maximum average of 10 (OGB-1) or 3 (OGB-6F) consecutive points following the spike and the average of the 20–50 ms period preceding the spike. Note that this measurement may slightly overestimate the amplitude. Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces and some of the electrophysiological traces were slightly smoothed (binomial filter, N = 1) for display purposes only.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike properties were quantified using I<sub>inj</sub> levels at or 100 pA above the lowest I<sub>inj</sub> evoking the spike, unless otherwise indicated. Usually 5–10 traces were recorded with each I<sub>inj</sub> level, and data were averaged. Where multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes occurred within a trace, we analyzed the one with the largest amplitude, which was most often the first event.</p><p>ADPs were defined as regenerative depolarization initiated by one or two preceding APs. Fast ADP amplitude was measured on events that showed additional rising phase and clear peak following the initiating AP(s). We avoided ADP amplitude measurement in cases where the peak could not be defined (such as with constant decay of voltage or due to the generation of a consecutive AP) and when the ADP-evoking AP was preceded by &gt;2 APs in the burst. ADP peak amplitude was measured from the V<sub>m</sub> immediately preceding the first AP initiating the ADP. We note that this measurement likely overestimates the true Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplitude due to the tail of the decaying AP on which the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike is riding. Slow ADPs did not have a clear peak; amplitude was measured as the maximum sustained depolarization between consecutive APs in the burst compared to the V<sub>m</sub> immediately preceding the first initiating AP. Width at half amplitude of ADPs was not determined due to the uncertain rise and amplitude.</p><p>DI spikes were defined as regenerative events that were not initiated by APs. Peak amplitude of the DI spike was determined in cases where voltage reached a clear peak (either alone or before evoking a consecutive AP). The threshold of DI spikes was measured at the inflection point where voltage began to deviate from subthreshold baseline depolarization. This was sometimes difficult to determine, and when possible (at I<sub>inj</sub> experiments) it was aided by extrapolating to the baseline where voltage returned to after the spike, or by fitting a double exponential to the initial subthreshold voltage response to the step current injection. Width (at half amplitude) of DI spikes was measured on smoothed traces (binomial filter, N = 10) on spikes with at least 5 mV amplitude and when no APs were evoked. The parameters of pharmacologically isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (measured in TTX or NMDG) were determined the same way as those of DI spikes.</p><p>The dV/dt ratio, used to support distinguishing Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes and simple APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), was defined for each dendritic regenerative event as dV/dt<sub>pre</sub>/dV/dt<sub>peak</sub>, where dV/dt<sub>peak</sub> is the maximum dV/dt value during the event, and dV/dt<sub>pre</sub> is the maximum dV/dt value in the 1.5–9 ms time window preceding dV/dt<sub>peak</sub>.</p><p>To quantify the number of evoked APs by suprathreshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), results obtained at the threshold level of I<sub>inj</sub> (and if not enough events, at threshold +100 pA) evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes were analyzed, in those experiments where at least three Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike events (ADP or DI spike) with evoked APs were recorded. DI spikes were included in the analysis only if they were clearly separable from the evoked AP. ADP events were analyzed only after steady-state voltage was reached by I<sub>inj</sub>. APs following ADPs were considered to be evoked by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike if they occurred before the depolarized V<sub>m</sub> returned to 3.5 mV above the baseline but maximum within 300 ms time window after the first AP, with &lt;100 ms preceding interspike interval.</p><p>When measuring the impact of DI spikes on the AHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), in order to ensure that temporal voltage changes did not affect our comparison, we restricted our analysis to those cells where both Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike-evoked APs (AP<sub>Ca</sub>) and simple APs (AP<sub>s</sub>) were evoked at the same I<sub>inj</sub> level, either within the same traces at the steady-state depolarization phase or on intermittent traces within the same time window.</p><p>To calculate the propensity of dendritic spikes evoked by 2PGU, traces with moderate stimulus strength were used, that is, where regenerative events (bAPs and/or d-spikes) were evoked only on any of the last three pulses of the gamma burst. The relative ADP and DI spike probability (range: 0–1) was calculated by dividing the number of traces displaying the respective d-spike type by the total number of suprathreshold traces (minimum n = 3).</p><p>Transfer of steady-state voltage signals in dual recordings was determined using hyperpolarizing current injection either to the soma or dendrite, and calculating the ratio of the resulting voltage deflection at the two locations. Attenuation of dendritic spikes was measured as the ratio of amplitudes at the dendrite and the soma. The somatic peak of fast ADPs was in some cases masked by the AHP of the AP; these cases were not included in the analysis.</p><p>We note that the number of measurements varies for different parameters due to the specific criteria applied for their analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Morphological analysis</title><p>Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence was used for morphological analysis. Dendritic morphological and distance measurements were performed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) on stacked images collected at the end of the experiment. Dendritic length and distance were measured on the collapsed 2P stacks by manually drawing a segmented line along the dendrite. TEs were identified as large, lobular, complex spine-like postsynaptic structures on first- or higher-order trunks near the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chicurel and Harris, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raus Balind et al., 2019</xref>). The total coverage of dendrites by TEs was estimated as the sum of the length of freehand lines drawn manually along the dendritic segments where TEs were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our samples are similar to or exceed those reported in previous publications and that are generally employed in the field. Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistica software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK). Usually nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon test for two paired groups, Mann–Whitney test for two unpaired groups, Spearman correlation) were used, which do not make assumptions about the distribution of data. For data with mixed-factor design, two-way repeated measures ANOVA test was used with Tukey’s test for post hoc comparisons; in these analyses, all data passed the Levene test. All statistical tests were two-tailed. Differences were considered significant when p&lt;0.05. In all figures, population data are represented by symbols and error bars showing mean ± SEM: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed according to animal protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine, and in accordance with the Institutional Ethical Codex, Hungarian Act of Animal Care and Experimentation 40/2013 (II.14), and European Union guidelines (86/609/EEC/2 and 2010/63/EU Directives).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74493-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data generated and analysed during the study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

The authors convincingly distinguish dendritic sodium spikes from the calcium spikes that they describe in this study. They classify dendritically initiated calcium spikes into those that follow axo-somatic spikes (ADP-type) and those that are 'independently' initiated in the dendrites. They demonstrate differences in spatiotemporal spread of ADP-type vs. independent dendritic calcium spike events, with independent spikes showing fast kinetics with enhanced compartmentalization. They demonstrate that a fraction dendritically initiated independent calcium spikes result in single axo-somatic spikes, and not an axo-somatic burst that is typically associated with slow dendritic calcium events. The authors rightly emphasize cell-type dependence of dendritic physiology across different neuronal subtypes, and underscore the need to account for these differences in understanding single-neuron physiology, by employing dendritic recordings. I believe that this systematic characterization study provides novel insights into CA3 dendritic physiology, and into the comparative physiology across dendrites in different neuronal subtypes, and is complete by itself as an important stand-alone contribution to the neuroscience literature.</p><p>1. Important: I presume that the recordings reported here were performed in the presence of synaptic receptor blockers. The ACSF composition doesn't seem to report this. Please state this. This is important because if synaptic receptors weren't blocked some of the interpretations might have to be revisited given the strong recurrent circuitry and spontaneous activity in the CA3 circuit.</p><p>2. I am not entirely convinced with the nomenclature of 'independent' spikes. Across neurons, it is well-established that dendritic spikes need not always result in axo-somatic action potentials (Golding et al., Neuron, 2001; Larkum et al., Science, 2009) – irrespective of the depolarizing current (Na/Ca/NMDAR) that yields the dendritic spike. Even in vivo recordings point to a higher prevalence of dendritic spikes compared to axo-somatic spikes (e.g., Moore et al., Science, 2017). Thus, it is clear that there are dendritic spiking events that are independent of axo-somatic spiking across neuronal subtypes. Thus, this confusing new nomenclature is non-essential, and simply to the jargon. I agree that it is important to distinguish dendritically initiated events from ADP-type events that are initiated by (or require or follow) axo-somatic spikes and those that are dendritically initiated. But, traditionally the independent dendritic events have simply been referred to as dendritic spikes. The authors might want to consider this and avoid further jargon.</p><p>3. The Discussion section repeats several points. Instead the authors might want to focus on future directions, especially relating to mechanistic bases and implications associated with the findings reported here.</p><p>For instance, I believe that future follow-up studies could probe the biophysical mechanisms behind the reported physiological characteristics: (i) the dendritic electrogenesis of calcium events, and the role of the location of electrogenesis in some of the reported heterogeneities; (ii) branch-specific heterogeneities in calcium spike generation, and the role of dendritic morphology and different regenerative and restorative conductances in mediating such heterogeneities; (iii) the mechanistic basis of the spatio-temporal distinctions observed between ADP-type and independent calcium spike events, especially focusing on the contributions of cable-theoretic vs. active components in the spatiotemporal spreads of fast vs. slow events; (iv) the mechanistic basis for the larger AHP associated with independent dendritic calcium spike events and why they result in single spikes while ADP-like events result in burst, including the role of calcium-activated potassium channels that express in abundance in these cell types; (v) the mechanistic basis for the reduction in the amplitude of dendritic calcium events with depolarization, including inactivation of voltage-gated calcium and sodium channel triggered by what is traditionally referred to as depolarization-induced block of spiking (in this case dendritic spiking); and (vi) the implications of their observations to CA3 neuronal and network physiology, especially given the recurrent circuitry impinging on the SR, the detonator synapses impinging on the SL and the distal entorhinal inputs – in the context of specific postulated functions of the CA3 network in spatial navigation, pattern completion, etc.</p><p>4. For future studies, the authors might want to consider using Methyl Sulphate or Methanesulphonate as the charge-carrying anion. Gluconate acts as a weak calcium buffer, and thereby affecting normal function of calcium-activated potassium channels. Given the important role of this channel subtype in CA3 pyramidal neuron physiology, the authors might want to avoid Gluconate for future studies (at least in a subset of recordings, given instabilities associated with the charge-carrying anions other than Gluconate).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of active dendrites in a poorly studied neuron, CA3 pyramidal neurons from slices of rat hippocampus. The authors used exceedingly difficult methods for their study, and the results and conclusions follow closely from their experiments. They conclude that there are two types of regenerative Ca events or spikes in the dendrites of these cells, which they call, fast &quot;ADP&quot; spikes and slower &quot;independent&quot; spikes. As expected, the slower events spread widely in dendrites while the fast events remain more local. Also, the ability to generate the slow events roughly correlates with cell morphology and the density of mossy fiber thorny excrescences. Finally, they find that the two types of events trigger somatic firing differently.</p><p>The authors used 1-sec long depolarizing current injections from either the soma or dendrites to trigger these events. The presence of dendritic Ca spikes is completely dependent on the various types of voltage-gated ion channels expressed in dendrites. These channels include the multiple types of Ca channels, fast and persistent Na channels, numerous types of K channels, and HCN channels. The authors used TTX to separate the role of Na channels in these events and a non-selective Ca channel blocker to show that the events were indeed Ca dependent, but no other pharmacology was used to explore the role of some of the other dendritic channels. For example, separating inactivating T-type and non-inactivating L-type channels in the generation of these events would have been interesting. Also, inactivating K channels (Kv4 or A-type) have been shown to play a major role in regulating regenerative events in dendrites of many cell types but the authors did not explore or mention these channels. The authors thus provide no mechanism or explanation for the different Ca events.</p><p>The 1-sec step current injection is an unphysiological stimulus. Subtle differences in Ca spikes could very well be dependent on the stimulus given and whether or not inactivation of Ca and K channels played a role in their generation. The results would have been more convincing with more physiological forms of stimulation such as synaptic stimulation, glutamate uncaging, or α-function current injection to test whether the Ca events were dependent on the long current injection.</p><p>In summary, this is an interesting, important and well-done study that is limited in its conclusions by the unphysiological stimulus used and the lack of a mechanism for the two types of Ca events.</p><p>Some of my criticisms of this paper are described above. I could not recommend publication without the authors addressing some of them. In particular, the authors must demonstrate with additional experiments that the separation of the Ca events into two modes is not dependent on the 1-sec current injection. They should use one of the methods mentioned above. Current injection waveforms that mimic synaptic conductance changes would probably be the easiest, or, even better, using a dynamic clamp that simulates the conductance changes from single or trains of synaptic input.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74493.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We stimulated 20 spatially clustered spines quasisynchronously 5 times at 40 Hz, with laser power producing moderately suprathreshold activity (evoking bAP or d-spike on the last 3 pulses). To avoid activation of confounding slow NMDA spikes, the experiments were performed in the presence of an NMDAR blocker in the bath (D-AP5, 50 µM). The above synaptic stimulation was able to elicit characteristic and well distinguishable ADPs and independent (now termed ‘dendritically initiated’ or DI) spikes either separately (ADP only: 3/10 dendrites, DI spike only: 4/10 dendrites) or in combination (1/10 dendrites). We also found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike type evoked by uncaging corresponded well to that evoked by I<sub>inj</sub> via the pipette.

After assessing the dendritic spike profile by 1-sec-long I<sub>inj</sub> under control conditions, we repeated the stimulation after bath application of a cocktail of AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers (10 µM NBQX and 50 µM D-AP5) for 10-15 minutes. We found that blockade of excitatory synaptic activity had no impact on the regenerative events (n=4 experiments), including ADP-type (n=3) and dendritically initiated (n=1) spikes.

Instead the authors might want to focus on future directions, especially relating to mechanistic bases and implications associated with the findings reported here.</p><p>For instance, I believe that future follow-up studies could probe the biophysical mechanisms behind the reported physiological characteristics: (i) the dendritic electrogenesis of calcium events, and the role of the location of electrogenesis in some of the reported heterogeneities; (ii) branch-specific heterogeneities in calcium spike generation, and the role of dendritic morphology and different regenerative and restorative conductances in mediating such heterogeneities; (iii) the mechanistic basis of the spatio-temporal distinctions observed between ADP-type and independent calcium spike events, especially focusing on the contributions of cable-theoretic vs. active components in the spatiotemporal spreads of fast vs. slow events; (iv) the mechanistic basis for the larger AHP associated with independent dendritic calcium spike events and why they result in single spikes while ADP-like events result in burst, including the role of calcium-activated potassium channels that express in abundance in these cell types; (v) the mechanistic basis for the reduction in the amplitude of dendritic calcium events with depolarization, including inactivation of voltage-gated calcium and sodium channel triggered by what is traditionally referred to as depolarization-induced block of spiking (in this case dendritic spiking); and (vi) the implications of their observations to CA3 neuronal and network physiology, especially given the recurrent circuitry impinging on the SR, the detonator synapses impinging on the SL and the distal entorhinal inputs – in the context of specific postulated functions of the CA3 network in spatial navigation, pattern completion, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the Reviewer that the above points are pressing questions to answer. While we have discussed our main questions for future directions to some extent in the original Discussion, we have now elaborated on the text to highlight them more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For future studies, the authors might want to consider using Methyl Sulphate or Methanesulphonate as the charge-carrying anion. Gluconate acts as a weak calcium buffer, and thereby affecting normal function of calcium-activated potassium channels. Given the important role of this channel subtype in CA3 pyramidal neuron physiology, the authors might want to avoid Gluconate for future studies (at least in a subset of recordings, given instabilities associated with the charge-carrying anions other than Gluconate).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion; we will test methylsulphate in future dendritic experiments. We would like to note that in our previous study (Raus Balind et al., 2019 Nat Comm) we did not find differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike-driven complex spike burst propensity of CA3PCs using methysulphate vs gluconate in the pipette solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Some of my criticisms of this paper are described above. I could not recommend publication without the authors addressing some of them. In particular, the authors must demonstrate with additional experiments that the separation of the Ca events into two modes is not dependent on the 1-sec current injection. They should use one of the methods mentioned above. Current injection waveforms that mimic synaptic conductance changes would probably be the easiest, or, even better, using a dynamic clamp that simulates the conductance changes from single or trains of synaptic input.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments using multisite two-photon glutamate uncaging at trunk synapses near the dendritic recording pipette. We stimulated 20 spatially clustered spines quasisynchronously 5 times at 40 Hz, with laser power producing moderately suprathreshold activity (evoking bAP or d-spike on the last 3 pulses). To avoid activation of confounding slow NMDA spikes, the experiments were performed in the presence of an NMDAR blocker in the bath (D-AP5, 50 µM). The above synaptic stimulation was able to elicit characteristic and well distinguishable ADPs and independent (now termed ‘dendritically initiated’ or DI) spikes either separately (ADP only: 3/10 dendrites, DI spike only: 4/10 dendrites) or in combination (1/10 dendrites). We also found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike type evoked by uncaging corresponded well to that evoked by I<sub>inj</sub> via the pipette. These new data are included in the revised manuscript as Figure 3k-o and described in the Results (ln. 253-269).</p><p>The results thus confirm that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike form is an inherent property of the dendrite, and that separate Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike modes can be elicited by wide range of stimuli that reach sufficiently strong local depolarization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
