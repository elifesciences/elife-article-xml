different demersal, benthic, or pelagic juveniles. This process of transformation is characterized by a myriad of hormone-induced changes, during the often abrupt transition between larval and juvenile phases called metamorphosis. Thyroid hormones (TH) are known to be instrumental in triggering and coordinating this transformation but other hormonal systems such as corticoids, might be also involved as it is the case in amphibians. In order to investigate the potential involvement of these two hormonal pathways in marine fish post-embryonic development, we used the Malabar grouper (<italic>Epinephelus malabaricus</italic>) as a model system. We assembled a chromosome-scale genome sequence and conducted a transcriptomic analysis of nine larval developmental stages. We studied the expression patterns of genes involved in TH and corticoid pathways, as well as four biological processes known to be regulated by TH in other teleost species: ossification, pigmentation, visual perception, and metabolism. Surprisingly, we observed an activation of many of the same pathways involved in metamorphosis also at an early stage of the larval development, suggesting an additional implication of these pathways in the formation of early larval features. Overall, our data brings new evidence to the controversial interplay between corticoids and thyroid hormones during metamorphosis as well as, surprisingly, during the early larval development. Further experiments will be needed to investigate the precise role of both pathways during these two distinct periods and whether an early activation of both corticoid and TH pathways occurs in other teleost species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>life cycle transition</kwd><kwd>endocrine control</kwd><kwd>genome</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Epinephelus malabaricus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcriptomic analyses of Malabar grouper show pathways known to be involved in metamorphosis are also upregulated at an early stage of larval development, suggesting an additional function during early development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most teleost fishes have a stage-structured life cycle that includes a transition between larval and juvenile phases known as metamorphosis; this transition is regulated by TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laudet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McMenamin and Parichy, 2013</xref>). Of all teleost fishes, flatfishes experience one of the most extreme metamorphosis, with significant changes occurring in their body organization and appearance during this period, switching from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schreiber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). However, metamorphic changes are not always as pronounced in other fish species. For example, the metamorphosis of zebrafish is mainly marked by relatively discrete pigmentation changes that appear to be regulated by TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guillot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Walpita et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Metamorphosis in teleost fishes is not only marked by visible changes in the body, but also by a range of ecological, physiological, biochemical, and behavioral changes. These changes are thought to be initiated and coordinated by a surge of TH, which regulates various signaling pathways through the action of specific transcription factors known as thyroid hormone receptors (TRα, TRβ). For example, there is evidence that TH is associated with the transition between oceanic and coral reef environments in the convict surgeonfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holzer et al., 2017</xref>), controls pigmentation changes in zebrafish, clownfish, and grouper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Salis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>), regulates ossification processes in zebrafish and flatfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campinho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pelayo et al., 2012</xref>) and is involved in the shift of visual perception by controlling the expression of opsin genes in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roux et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Volkov et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, it has also been suggested that the metabolic changes that occur during larval development in teleosts may be regulated by TH, as demonstrated in clownfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roux et al., 2023</xref>). Of note in some cases, like groupers (elongated spines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colin and Koenig, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kohno et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Powell and Tucker, 1992</xref>) or carapids (vexillum appendage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Govoni, 1984</xref>), some changes occur very early on and are considered as temporary specialization of the pelagic larval stages, serving as anti-predator defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Moster, 1981</xref>), flotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nonaka et al., 2021</xref>) or camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leis and Carson-Ewart, 2000</xref>). It is still unclear if these are late developmental processes occurring after hatching or early manifestations of metamorphosis.</p><p>Besides the TH signaling pathway, other actors have been shown to be important in metamorphosis regulation. For example, studies have provided clear evidence that corticoids and TH are interacting together to regulate amphibian metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Denver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paul et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sachs and Buchholz, 2019</xref>). But as far as we know, there is limited information available regarding the interaction between corticoids and TH during fish metamorphosis. Although a synergistic effect of cortisol and TH has been observed in flatfish metamorphosis (advancement of morphological changes), there has been insufficient investigation into the communication between corticoids and TH pathways during teleost metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jesus et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Jesus et al., 1990</xref>). More research is needed, and the use of genomic analysis would be a good way to investigate which pathways are associated with early larval development and metamorphosis.</p><p>The use of high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as transcriptomics, has made it possible to study gene expression in greater detail, especially when combined with a high-quality annotated genome, which has enabled the identification of genes that may be involved in the key biological changes that occur during metamorphosis. These techniques have provided valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive metamorphosis in teleost fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mazurais, 2011</xref>). Most of the studies investigating the transcriptomic changes during marine fish larval development have been focused on commercial fish species used in aquaculture to: (<italic>i</italic>) gain insight into the key biological processes that occur, (<italic>ii</italic>) identify the genes involved in these processes, and (<italic>iii</italic>) find ways to improve rearing conditions to ensure high survival rates and harmonious development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mazurais, 2011</xref>). However, these studies rarely mention metamorphosis to explain the onset of the various processes occurring during the transition between larval and juvenile stages. This is another reason why studying the molecular changes occurring during the larval development of the Malabar grouper <italic>Epinephelus malabaricus</italic> is very relevant. In addition, as mentioned above, groupers display elongate appendages during early larval development that disappear over time, providing an interesting way to study the development of these enigmatic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colin and Koenig, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jesus et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Our study will thus allow for a better understanding of the biological processes at play during the early larval development and metamorphosis, and to understand the carry-over effect in the context of aquaculture. Indeed, it is well known that rearing conditions may impact welfare and growth at later stages and understanding the molecular changes occurring during the development of this species might be useful to enhance survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dingeldein and White, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gagliano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Ward and Slaney, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Grouper (Family Serranidae, Subfamily Epinephelinae) are a group of fish of both economic and ecological importance. Inhabiting temperate and tropical waters of eastern and southern regions Indo-Pacific region, East Atlantic, Mediterranean regions, and the intertropical American zone, they comprise 165 species in 16 genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Craig and Heemstra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pierre et al., 2008</xref>). Ecologically, groupers provide a wide variety of important functions as large top-level predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ribeiro et al., 2021</xref>). However, due to their high economic value on the food market, more than 40 species are at risk of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sadovy de Mitcheson et al., 2013</xref>). This has led to the widespread development of grouper aquaculture farms, which produced 155,000 tons per year according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015, with 95% of global production occurring in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">FishStatJ, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rimmer and Glamuzina, 2019</xref>). Despite wide variations in growth rate, body size, and color, groupers share many biological traits and lifestyles, such as protogynous hermaphroditism, complex social structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heemstra, 1993</xref>), and a biphasic lifestyle. Like many marine fishes, groupers larvae hatched after 24–48 hr of embryonic development giving rise to a transparent elongated larvae surrounded by an embryonic fin fold. After a couple of days melanophores colonize the tail (after the anus) and the gut. Shortly after the elongated appendages composed of two pelvic spines and the second dorsal spines both displaying melanophores at their tips appear. The elongation of these spines occurs before notochord flexion and their regression is concomitant with the appearance of the adult-like body pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kohno et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Powell and Tucker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hussain and Higuchi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sawada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawabe and Kohno, 2009</xref>). Their regression as well as the development of the adult-like body pattern has been demonstrated to be under the control of TH in <italic>E. coioides</italic> suggesting that it corresponds to the TH-regulated metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jesus et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain insight into the molecular pathways involved in grouper larval development, we assembled a chromosome-scale genome sequence of <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> and conducted a transcriptomic analysis of nine developmental stages ranging from freshly hatched larvae to roughly two-month-old juveniles. We investigated the expression patterns of genes involved in the TH pathway and four biological processes known to be regulated by TH in other teleost species during the metamorphosis step: ossification, pigmentation, visual perception, and metabolic transition. In addition, we used the TH pathway and downstream-regulated biological processes activation as indicators to look for the potential involvement of corticoids during larval development. We observed the activation of the TH pathway during the regression of fin spines, which in other grouper species coincides with the surge of TH and marks the beginning of metamorphosis. Interestingly, the activation of the TH pathway at this stage was associated with the activation of corticoid pathways as well as the four biological processes we investigated. Especially noteworthy is the observation of an early activation of the two regulatory pathways (TH and corticoids) occurring before the formation of the elongated fin spines during early larval development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome assembly, phasing, scaffolding, and annotation</title><p>A total of 46 Gbp of PacBio HiFi reads (~43 X coverage, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were assembled into a fully haplotype phased genome of the Malabar grouper (<italic>Epinephelus malabaricus</italic>) with the primary phase consisting of 298 contigs across 1.09 Gbp genome length, a contig N50 of 7.4 Mbp, and a genome level BUSCO completeness of 93.6% with 1.3% duplication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Indeed, the cluster analysis shows 2651 genes upregulated on D03 and to a lesser degree on D32 (clusters 1 and 2), 1515 genes upregulated on D32 (cluster 3), and 785 genes upregulated on D32 and to a lesser degree on D03 (cluster 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Unsurprisingly, these two transitions, D01 to D03 and D18 to D32, also show the highest number of differentially expressed genes with 14,830 genes (7151 up, 7,679 down) between D01 and D03, and 10,774 genes (5320 up and 5454 down) between D18 and D32 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that there are two major events occurring in terms of gene expression: one early on, at day 3, and one later around day 32. This last event corresponds to the separation between the intermediate and late developmental phases and is concomitant with the regression of the elongated spines, an overall change of shape, and progression of the pigmentation. In other grouper species, the regression of the elongated spines corresponds to the onset of metamorphosis and is associated with an increase in TH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jesus et al., 1998</xref>). However, the very early event is more striking as such a global gene expression change very early on has, to our knowledge, never been reported in other teleost fish species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Two periods of activation of the TH signaling pathway during grouper post-embryonic development</title><p>We investigated the expression patterns of key genes involved in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis (<italic>tshb, trhr1a, trhr1a-like, trhr1b, trhr2</italic>) as well as in TH synthesis (<italic>tg, tpo, nis</italic>), TH metabolism (<italic>dio1, dio2, dio3</italic>), and finally the genes encoding thyroid hormone receptors (<italic>trα, trαβ, trβ</italic>). These genes all play important roles in the regulation of TH levels and TH signaling in the body and understanding their expression patterns during larval development can illuminate the underlying mechanisms that drive this process.</p><p>The gene encoding the pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (<italic>tshb</italic>) is strongly expressed very early on during larval development at D01, decreases from D03, and then strongly increases again at D32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Accordingly, we also observed two surges of expression for the hypothalamic factors <italic>trhr1aa, trhr1a like, trhr1b</italic>, and <italic>trhr2,</italic> at D03 and between D32 and D60, suggesting two distinct periods of stimulation of TH synthesis, one early on around D03 and one later at around D32. This pattern can also be seen in the expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (<italic>crhb</italic>) and receptors (<italic>crhr1a</italic>, <italic>crhr1b</italic>, and <italic>crhr2</italic>), which stimulates the synthesis of TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denver, 2021</xref>) (see section ‘Possible involvement of corticoid pathways in metamorphosis’ and Figure 6 below). Interestingly, we also observed a peak of expression for <italic>tg</italic> at D03<italic>,</italic> the gene encoding for the TH precursor, and a strong increase of expression starting at D32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The respective order of appearance of TSH and Tg (TSH at D32, Tg after) is consistent with what we would expect but a bit later than expected given the morphological transformation. It would be interesting to revisit this in a future series of experiments, with tighter temporal sampling to study how gene expression and morphological transformation aligned. A similar expression pattern was obtained for <italic>tpo</italic>, the gene encoding for the enzyme adding iodine to TH precursor, as well as for <italic>sis</italic>, the gene encoding for the symporter involved in transferring iodide into thyrocytes. Once produced, TH, particularly T4, are transported into target cells where they convert them into the active form T3 mostly by <italic>dio2</italic> and <italic>dio1</italic> or degraded by <italic>dio3</italic> and <italic>dio1</italic>. As it has been observed for HPT factors, <italic>tg</italic>, <italic>tpo,</italic> and <italic>sis</italic>, we first noticed two peaks of expression of <italic>dio2</italic> with a very early one at hatching (D01) and a second one at D32 suggesting two distinct periods in which active TH (that is T3) is required. In accordance with this observation, we notice a minimal expression of the T3 degrading enzyme <italic>dio3</italic> at these two periods followed by a final late increase after D32. <italic>dio1</italic>, whose net function is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darras and Van Herck, 2012</xref>), shows a regular increase of expression that becomes maximal at the juvenile stages (J) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) expression levels increased throughout the entire larval development with a stronger increase of <italic>trβ</italic> at D60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data reinforce the existence of two distinct periods of TH signaling activity, one early on at D03, and one late at D32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Expression levels of thyroid hormones (TH) signaling pathway genes in <italic>E. malabaricus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TRH: thyroid releasing hormone, TSH: thyroid stimulating hormone.

These observations are consistent with what has been observed in <italic>E. coioides</italic>, in which TH levels peak around 40 dph when the pelvic and second dorsal spines regress and adult-like pigmentation pattern formation is ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jesus et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, the high expression levels of <italic>tshb, trhr, tg, tpo, sis</italic>, <italic>dio3</italic>, and TRs at the very beginning of development (D01-D03) suggest a precocious activation of TH synthesis, which, to our knowledge, has not been observed in groupers nor in other teleost fishes so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Measurements of TH levels during these early development stages showed an early peak of T4 at D03, confirming the early activation of the TH pathway observed with gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TH involvement in elongate appendage and regression</title><p>As mentioned in the introduction, many marine fish larvae present several morphological features that improve larval survival rates during their pelagic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Miller and Kendall, 2019</xref>). This is what we observe in grouper with the formation of elongated spines of the dorsal and pelvic fins that are supposed to have a defensive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawabe and Kohno, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leu et al., 2005</xref>). These spines then regress while adult-like pigmentation pattern appears and TH surge corresponding to the TH-regulated metamorphosis. It is well known that during fish larval development genes involved in ossification are under the controls of TH. In zebrafish, TH control the proper morphogenesis and ossification in the majority of the bones, during post-embryonic development and metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Keer et al., 2019</xref>). This is why we investigated the expression changes of some of these genes in <italic>E. malabaricus</italic>. Interestingly, we observed, once again, two surges in the expression of the following genes: bone gamma-carboxyglutamate (<italic>bglap</italic>)<italic>,</italic> periostin (<italic>postnb</italic>)<italic>,</italic> and phosphate-regulating endopeptidase (<italic>phex</italic>), three key genes implicated in the mineralization of tissues. The first at D13 following the early surge in TH signaling genes, and the second starting at D60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The first surge of gene expression coincides with the appearance and growth of the dorsal and pelvic elongated spines starting at D10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, shown by green arrowhead), while the second surge coincides with the regression of these spines, a process known to be regulated by TH in <italic>E. coioides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jesus et al., 1998</xref>).

To reveal the molecular regulations driving these pigmentation changes, we assessed the expression of key pigmentation genes involved in white (iridophore genes), black (melanophore genes), and yellow (xanthophore genes) pigment cells known to be regulated by TH in zebrafish and clownfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Salis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The expression level of the iridophore gene <italic>flh2a</italic> showed a strong increase from D03, followed by a decrease at D32 and a new surge at D60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The first increase may correspond to the appearance of iridophores on the ventral cavity whereas the second may coincide with the formation of the white bars. In contrast, its paralogue <italic>fhl2b</italic> remained relatively stable throughout the development. Xanthophores start colonizing the larval body at D10, which may explain the increase of the expression level of two xanthophores markers, <italic>gtsm3,</italic> and <italic>perp6</italic>, which play a role in concentrating and trafficking lipophilic pigments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Granneman et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>scarb1</italic>, which is involved in carotenoid deposition in zebrafish, increased slightly at D03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, melanophore genes are displaying a strong increase in their expression level at D03 and D06 that may be related to the colonization of melanophores on the larval body (<italic>tyrp1b</italic>, <italic>tyr</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>During their metamorphosis in the wild, fish larvae also undergo ecological changes such as habitat transition (from ocean to coastal environment) and food habits. It is well known that in many fish species, this ecological transition is accompanied by a change in color vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortesi et al., 2016</xref>). Since TH appeared critical in the regulation of genes involved in vision in salmonids, zebrafish, and clownfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roux et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Volkov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>), we investigated the regulation of genes encoding for visual opsin. We expected to find at least eight visual cone opsin genes in <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> according to the phylogeny of opsin genes in teleosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortesi et al., 2015</xref>) (<italic>opnsw1, opnsw2Aa, opnsw2Ab, opnsw2B, rh2A, rh2B, rh2C, opnlw</italic>) and one rhodopsin gene (<italic>rh1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cortesi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Musilova et al., 2021</xref>). These genes were indeed expressed in our transcriptomic data. We observed that the medium wavelength opsin (<italic>rh2A, rh2B, rh2C</italic>), and the long wavelength opsin (<italic>opnlw</italic>) were highly expressed at the beginning of the larval development (at D03 for <italic>rh2B, rh2C, and opnlw,</italic> and at D10 for <italic>rh2A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These surges of expression are followed by the increase of the expression levels of <italic>opnsw2B, opnsw2Bb, and opnlw</italic> from D32. From D18 the rhodopsin involved in scotopic vision (<italic>rh1</italic>) increases. The expression level <italic>opnsw1</italic> remained low and stable during the entire development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It is again very interesting to note that these changes coincide with both TH signaling peaks. As these genes are regulated by TH in other species and according to the observed expression patterns, we may assume that this is also the case in <italic>E. malabaricus</italic>.</p><p>The timing of cone opsin (<italic>opnsw2a1, opsnw2a2,</italic> and <italic>opnlw</italic>) expression in <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> is similar to <italic>E. bruneus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matsumoto and Ishibashi, 2016</xref>), but different from <italic>E. akaara</italic> where <italic>opnsw2</italic> is strongly expressed early and then decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). However, the expression levels of mid-wavelength opsins and <italic>opnlw</italic> are similar between <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> and <italic>E. akaara</italic>, suggesting their involvement in cone photoreceptor differentiation, while rod photoreceptors differentiate during metamorphosis in <italic>E. akaara</italic> and <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Metamorphosis is accompanied by a metabolic shift</title><p>Because metamorphosis is known to be energetically demanding and because the ecology of the planktonic larvae and the demersal juveniles are different, we investigated metabolic gene expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows the expression profile of the genes encoding for the rate-limiting steps enzymes involved in glycolysis, (phosphofructokinase, <italic>pfkma,</italic> and <italic>pfkmb</italic>), and citric acid cycle (citrate synthase, <italic>cs</italic>; isocitrate dehydrogenase, <italic>idh3a</italic>; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, <italic>ogdhl</italic>, <italic>dlst2</italic>).

The genes involved in the rate-limiting steps of the citric acid cycle (<italic>cs, idh3, dlst</italic>) are more expressed during early larval stages and then decrease progressively. It is also worth noting that several genes involved in both glycolysis and the TCA cycle are encountering these two peaks of expression during the larval development (<italic>gpi1b, aldoaa, gapdh1, pgam1a, pgam1b, pgam2, eno1b, pkma, dlsta, dldh, sdhb, mdh2,</italic> Appendix 6).

Taken together, these results reveal that at the very beginning of the development larval fish mainly rely on the citric acid cycle for aerobic energy production and then switch progressively to anaerobic energy production via glycolysis and lactic fermentation. This trend is similar to what has been observed in other fish species such as sea bass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mazurais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darias et al., 2008</xref>), but contrasts with the situation of other species such as the clownfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roux et al., 2023</xref>). TH are known to play a role in the regulation of metabolism in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mullur et al., 2014</xref>), so it is likely that a similar regulatory process occurs during the development of <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> larvae, as it has been recently observed in the development of clownfish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roux et al., 2023</xref>). Larval development and metamorphosis are very sensitive periods during which larvae must face a myriad of challenges: disperse into the open ocean, find food, escape from predators, locate and swim toward a suitable habitat, metamorphose, and settle. All these challenges are highly demanding in terms of energy, it is thus very important for the larvae to properly allocate this energy to ensure the success of these various challenges. The regulation by TH of genes involved in processes such as glycolysis, lactic fermentation, and citric acid cycle might be a way for larvae to tune their energetic source to enhance their survival and the success of metamorphosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Possible involvement of corticoid pathways in grouper larval development</title><p>Synergistic action of cortisol and THs has been encountered during flatfish larval development and more specifically during its metamorphosis.

Finally, <italic>gr2</italic> expression level increased strongly at D03, then remained stable and increased again at D60. The relatively high expression of the <italic>crhr</italic> genes may suggest an increase in the sensitivity to CRH to mediate the production of POMC by the pituitary gland, a process that seems to occur twice during <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> larval development.</p><p>Concomitantly, a two-step increase in the <italic>star</italic> is observed: first at D03 and a second at D32. This may suggest an increase in the production of cortisol following the high expression of <italic>pomc-a2</italic>. Indeed, POMC is the precursor of the adreno cortico trophic hormone (ACTH) which is the pituitary factor stimulating cortisol production by the inter-renal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Takahashi and Mizusawa, 2013</xref>). The expression levels of genes involved in cortisol production corroborate this hypothesis. Indeed, we observe an increase of expression around D03 and D06 for <italic>fdx1, cyp11a1, hsd3b1, cyp11c1, hsd11b1, hsd11b2</italic>, as well as a second increase of expression from D32 for <italic>fdx1, fdxr, hsd3b1, cyp11c1, hsd11b1, hsd11b2</italic>. Interestingly, measurements of cortisol levels during early larval development (between D01 and D10) showed that cortisol concentration starts to increase from D3, coinciding with the expression levels of the star, and is followed by a stronger increase from D10. Those results first indicate that the HPI axis and cortisol production are activated at the beginning of the larval development around the timing of activation of TH pathway genes between D03 and D10. Second, the transcriptomic data also showed an activation of the corticoid pathway genes around D32 as it has been observed for TH pathway genes. There is contrasting evidence of communication between these two pathways during teleost fish larval development with some data suggesting a synergic and other an antagonistic relationship. In terms of synergy, an increase in cortisol levels concomitantly with an increase in TH levels has been observed in flatfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jesus et al., 1991</xref>), golden sea bream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deane and Woo, 2003</xref>), and silver sea bream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Szisch et al., 2005</xref>). Cortisol was also shown to enhance in vitro the action of TH on fin ray resorption (a phenomenon occurring during flatfish metamorphosis) in flounder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Jesus et al., 1990</xref>. It has also been shown that cortisol regulates local T3 bioavailability in the juvenile sole via regulation of deiodinase 2 in an organ-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arjona et al., 2011</xref>). On the antagonistic side, it has been shown that experimentally induced hyperthyroidism in common carp decreases cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geven et al., 2006</xref>), whereas cortisol exposure decreases TH levels in European eels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Redding et al., 1986</xref>). Given this scattered evidence, the existence of a crosstalk active during teleost larval development and metamorphosis has never been formally demonstrated. The results we obtained in grouper are clearly indicating that the HPI axis is activated during both early development and metamorphosis and that cortisol synthesis is activated during early development. This may suggest that in some aspects, cortisol synthesis could work in concert with TH, as has been shown in several different contexts in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sachs and Buchholz, 2019</xref>), but functional experiments need to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis. It is worth to note, however, that the increase of the gene encoding POMC-A2 may not only be linked to cortisol synthesis as POMC is also a precursor of other hormones and notably melanocytes-stimulating hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Takahashi and Mizusawa, 2013</xref>). Those hormones belong to the melanocortin system that is involved in body pigmentation, but also in social behavior, appetite, and stress physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cone, 2006</xref>). The increase in <italic>pomc-a2</italic> observed during <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> may thus also be involved in the onset of pigmentation pattern. Taken together, these results brought a first insight into the potential role of corticoids in the larval development of <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> and call for functional experiments directly testing a possible synergy. Given the results obtained in our study, <italic>E. malabaricus</italic> could be a good model to investigate the potential role of corticoids and TH in elongate appendages formation during early larval development as well as during metamorphosis and if there is an interplay between the two pathways. Such interplay could have relevant consequences in terms of aquaculture and claim for an examination of the role of stress in regulating fish larval development and impacting metamorphosis triggering.</p><p>Overall, the results obtained in this study revealed a very precocious surge of expression of genes involved in two key hormonal pathways (corticoids and TH) that are known to control ontogenetic transitions, but which are also involved in the regulation of many biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wada, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that the early post-embryonic period in grouper may correspond to such an ontogenetic transition that has been ignored until now and that could be linked to the formation of the specific elongated appendages present in groupers.</p><p>More generally, the fact that the outcome of metamorphosis is very variable from one species to another (e.g. differences in metamorphosis between clownfish, grouper, flatfish, etc.) and that it also allows exquisite acclimation of the juveniles to their local environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denver, 2021</xref>), highlights the capacity of this transitional step, controlled by environmentally connected hormonal systems, to change rapidly in accordance with ecological needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zwahlen et al., 2024</xref>). Finally, considering that rearing conditions during larval metamorphosis in an aquaculture context may impact growth and welfare at later life stages, understanding the molecular changes occurring during the development of a species might prove useful to enhance survival rates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Larval husbandry</title><p>This study was conducted in partnership with the Okinawa Prefectural Sea Farming Center, Motobu-cho, Okinawa, Japan. <italic>Epinephelus malabaricus</italic> larvae and juveniles were obtained from various clutches obtained from natural spawning in 2020, 2021, and 2023.

Continuing with the manufacturer’s protocol, molecules were pulled down with streptavidin beads and processed into an Illumina-compatible sequencing library.

Even though this is more mainstream, the task is still daunting and labor intensive. Currently, high quality and fully annotated genome sequences are of strategic importance in modern biology. The authors make use of the resource to address the endocrine control of an ecologically and developmentally relevant life cycle transition, metamorphosis. As opposed to amphibian and flat fish where body plan changes, fish metamorphosis is anatomically more subtle and much less known, although it is clear that thyroid hormone (TH) signaling is a key player. The authors thus provide a repertoire of TH-relevant gene expression changes during development and across post-embryonic transitions and correlate developmental stages with changes of gene expression. Overall, this work represents a significant advance in the field.</p><p>Fish 'metamorphosis' is well known because it is not as spectacular as amphibians. This work clearly provides technical and theoretical resources to address in a more systematic manner the molecular changes occurring during development and post-embryonic transitions. Heterochrony is a major source of functional and life cycle diversity in fish, which blurs our anatomy-based understanding of fish biology, and has a direct impact on the protocols and rearing procedures used to produce live stocks. This work illustrates how, by using genomics coupled to simple experimental endocrinology, one directly addresses these challenges.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94573.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huerlimann</surname><given-names>Roger</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Natacha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l&amp;apos;Environnement</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Perpignan</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pilieva</surname><given-names>Polina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Miura</surname><given-names>Saori</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hsiao-chian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Izumiyama</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laudet</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ravasi</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Onna-son</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Responses to recommendations</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Describe more precisely how gene expression graphs are built (tissues, reads counts). For example, how were read counts normalized? Were they from DESeq2 data, which only works by comparing two samples?

The normalised expression values are independent of any reference, and therefore will not change from sample and sample as suggested in this comment.

Currently we only have access to the larval and juvenile stages via a collaboration with the Okinawa Prefectural Sea Farming Center, which is an hour drive from our lab, and is limited to the grouper spawning season. If we want to do all what is suggested, we need to have a regular and easy access to the fishes. This would require establishing this model in our marine station, which is not possible due to space and time issues. These groupers grow to a very large size (1-2 m in length, and up to 150 kg in weight) and only mature into males after &gt; 6 years.</p><p>First and foremost, I would advise the authors to extend their TH and cortisol levels measurements to the entire developmental time considered in their analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>For the reasons stated above we could not perform these experiments. We must emphasize that the data regarding TH are available for a closely related species (e.g., Epinephelus coioides, de Jesus et al. 1998) and there is no reason to think that the situation will be drastically different in E. malabaricus. In addition, given that we have now studied several coral reef fish species in the same context (clownfish, surgeonfish, damselfish, gobies) we observed that the transcriptomic data are more robust, more sensitive, and more precise than hormone measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consider carrying out in situ hybridisation of TSH with putative CRH receptors to determine if thyrotrophin could be competent to respond to HPA axis signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree studying the interplay between corticoids and thyroid hormones at the neuroendocrine level would be desirable and we fully agree with the experiment suggested by the reviewer, but this is impossible in our current situation. We are not working with an establish animal model like zebrafish or <italic>Xenopus</italic>, but with a large, long-lived marine fish that reproduces in spawning aggregations and whose husbandry is notoriously difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consider conducting cortisol treatment experiments to functionally determine if indeed cortisol is involved in grouper metamorphosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to do TH and cortisol treatments specifically on the early larval stages corresponding to the early TH peak to see how this would impact the development of the fin spines, but our trials were unsuccessful. The larvae at that stage are extremely fragile and even putting them into small volumes of treatment drugs induced massive mortalities. Again, this would mean establishing this grouper species as a model organism and would require a massive effort to improve larval rearing as discussed above. We feel that our data stands on its own in the meantime and adds valuable information to the existing literature by studying a rarely investigated species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Responses to comments</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript needs proper editing and is not complete. Some wordings lack precision and make it difficult to follow e.g. line 98 &quot;we assembled a chromosome-scale genome of ...&quot; should read instead &quot;we assembled a chromsome-scla genome sequence of ...&quot;. Also, panel Figure 2E is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the suggested change of adding “sequence” in lines 32 and 121. Concerning additional changes, we have carefully edited our manuscript and looked for any incomplete sections. Unfortunately, it is difficult to see what other issues are being raised here without any further information.</p><p>As for panel E of figure 2, it is not missing. The panel is located to the right, just below “Target Cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The shortcomings of the manuscripts are not limited to the writing style, and important technical and technological information is missing or not clear enough, thereby preventing a proper evaluation of the resolution of the genomic resources provided:</p><p>Several RNASeq libraries from different tissues have been built to help annotate the genome and identify transcribed regions. This is fine. But all along the manuscript, gene expression changes are summarized into a single panel where it is not clear at all which tissue this comes from (whole embryo or a specific tissue ?), or whether it is a cumulative expression level computed across several tissues (and how it was computed) etc. This is essential information needed for data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>No fertilised eggs or embryos have been sequenced.

No doubt that it is well done,but especially in the field of genome assembly and annotation, high resolution is VERY cost and time-intensive.

In the present manuscript for grouper we have a peak level of 1.2 ng/g (1,200 pg/g) of T4 and 0.06 ng/g (60 pg/g) of T3. This is a higher level of T4 and comparable level of T3 to what was found in convict tang (Holzer et al. 2017; Figure 2) with 30 pg/g of T4 and 100 pg/g of T3. Of course, there are also examples with higher levels, such as clownfish (Roux et al. 2023; Figure 1), with 10 ng/g (10,000 pg/g) of T4 and 2 ng/g (2,000 pg/g) of T3.</p><p>The differences could be due to different structure of fish tissues and therefore different hormone extraction efficiency, different hormone measurement protocols, different fish physiology, different fish size (e.g., the weighting of tiny grouper larvae is difficult and less precise than in convict tang).

In fact, this is a descriptive study that does not provide any functional evidence to support the claims made.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our paper lacks functional experiments but despite that, the transcriptomic data clearly show the activation of TH and corticoid pathways during two distinct periods: an early activation between D1 and D10, and a second one between D32 and juvenile stage. These data are interesting as they call for further examination of (1) the existence of an early larval developmental step also involving TH and corticosteroids and (2) the possible interaction of corticoids and TH during metamorphosis. This is a question that is certainly not settled yet in teleost fishes and which is of great interest.</p><p>Especially (1) is of interest and importance, since this early activation (unique to our knowledge in any teleost fish studied so far) raises a lot of new questions and once again will certainly be scrutinised by other groups in the years to come, therefore ensuring a good citation impact of this study. We hope that the reviewer, while disagreeing with some our statements, will recognize that our study will be stimulating at that level and that this is what scientific studies should do.</p><p>We acknowledge the descriptive nature of the data and the lack of functional experiments in the Discussion in lines 443 to 445: “This may suggest that in some aspect, cortisol synthesis could work in concert with TH, as has been shown in several different contexts in amphibians, but functional experiments need to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis.” As stated above doing such functional experiment would require establishing the grouper as an experimental model in our husbandry, which currently is not possible due to the large size of the adult fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The consideration that cortisol is involved in metamorphosis in teleosts has never been shown, and the only example cited by the authors (REF 20) clearly states that cortisol alone does not induce flatfish metamorphosis. In that work, the authors clearly state that in vivo cortisol treatment had no synergistic effect with TH in inducing metamorphosis. Moreover, in Senegalensis, the sole pre-otic CRH neuron number decreases during metamorphosis, further arguing that, at least in flatfish, cortisol is not involved in flatfish metamorphosis (PMID: 25575457).</p></disp-quote><p>We will do our best to improve the clarity of the revised manuscript to avoid any misunderstanding about our claims. However, we would like to point out the semantic shift in the reviewer first sentence: Indeed “being involved” is not the same as “cortisol alone does not induce”. In ref 20 the authors explicitly wrote that “Cortisol further enhanced the effects of both T4 and T3, but was ineffective in the absence of thyroid hormones” and in our view this indeed corresponds to ”being involved in metamorphosis”.</p><p>We are not claiming that cortisol alone is involved in metamorphosis as the reviewer suggests, but simply that there is a possible involvement of cortisol together with TH in metamorphosis. We stand on this claim as we indeed observed an activation of corticoid pathway genes around D32, which is sufficient to say it is involved. We do agree that functional experiments will be needed to properly demonstrate the involvement of corticoids in grouper metamorphosis, but this was not possible in the current study as it would imply to set up a full grouper life cycle in lab conditions which is impossible for the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We also mentioned in the discussion that the role of corticoids in fish larval development is still debated, and we agree that this remains a contentious issue. We have clarified the Discussion on this point (lines 375-376, lines 439-464).</p><p>We wrote that “There is contrasting evidence of communication between these two pathways during teleost fish larval development with some data suggesting a synergic and other an antagonistic relationship. In terms of synergy, an increase in cortisol level concomitantly with an increase in TH levels has been observed in flatfish [26], golden sea bream [64] and silver sea bream [65]. Cortisol was also shown to enhance in vitro the action of TH on fin ray resorption (phenomenon occurring during flatfish metamorphosis) in flounder [27]. It has also been shown that cortisol regulates local T3 bioavailability in the juvenile sole via regulation of deiodinase 2 in an organ-specific manner [66]. On the antagonistic side, it has been shown that experimentally induced hyperthyroidism in common carp decreases cortisol levels [67], whereas cortisol exposure decreases TH levels in European eel [68]. Given this scattered evidence, the existence of a crosstalk active during teleost larval development and metamorphosis has never been formally demonstrated. The results we obtained in grouper are clearly indicating that HPI axis is activated during both early development and metamorphosis and that cortisol synthesis is activated during early development. This may suggest that in some aspect, cortisol synthesis could work in concert with TH, as has been shown in several different contexts in amphibians [25], but functional experiments need to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis.” In the revised manuscript, we have also added the interesting case of the Senegal sole mentioned by the reviewer.</p><p>In the last revision, we had also added that our results “brought a first insight into the potential role of corticoids in the metamorphosis of E. malabaricus and call for functional experiments directly testing a possible synergy” meaning that we clearly acknowledge that we are only revealing a hypothesis that remains to be tested. We later follow up with a discussion about the most novel observation and focus of our study, the increase in THs and cortisol during early development, which was unexpected and very intriguing. Again, these results suggest that there might be a link between the two, as has been shown in amphibians. This is typically the kind of results that should encourage more investigations into other fish species. Indeed, this has been pointed out by other authors and in particular by Bob Denver (probably the foremost expert on this topic) in Crespi and Denver 2012: “Elevation in HPA/I axis activity has been described prior to Metamorphosis in amphibians and fish, birth in mammals (reviewed in Crespi &amp; Denver 2005a; Wada 2008)”. B. Denver also adds that: “Experiments in which GCs were elevated prior to metamorphosis or prior to hatching or birth (e.g. Weiss, Johnston &amp; Moore 2007) or inhibited by treatments with GC synthesis blockers (e.g. metyrapone) or receptor antagonists (e.g. RU486, Glennemeir &amp; Denver 2002) demonstrate that GCs play a causal role in precipitating these life-history transitions (also reviewed in Crespi &amp; Denver 2005a; Wada 2008).” We believe the reviewer will be convinced by these elements coming from a colleague unanimously respected in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors need to recognise that the transcriptomic analysis is whole-body and that HPA axis genes are upregulated, which does not mean they are involved in regulating the HPT axis. The authors do not show that in thyrotrophs, any CRH receptor is expressed or in any other HPT axis-relevant cells and that changes in these genes correlate with changes in TSH expression. An in-situ hybridisation experiment showing co-expression on thyrotrophs of HPA genes and TSH could be a good start. However, the best scenario would be conducting cortisol treatment experiments to see if this hormone affects grouper metamorphosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that functional experiments are needed to validate our hypothesis. As the early peaks of expression levels observed for many genes were very intriguing for us, we did carry out thyroid hormones and goitrogenic treatment on young grouper larvae to test their effect on the morphological changes. Unfortunately, such experiments, already tricky on metamorphosing larvae, are even more risky on such tiny individuals just after hatching and we encountered high mortality rates. We must add that because we cannot establish a full grouper life cycle under lab conditions, we have done these experiments in the context of a commercial husbandry system in Japan, which while excellent limits the scope of possible experiments. We were thus not able to provide functional validation of our hypothesis. Such experiments will be a full project in itself, requiring setting up a rearing system suitable for both larval survival and economical constraints related to drug treatments. We were further limited by the spawning times of the grouper in the operational aquaculture farm, which are limited to a short time during each year. So even if we strongly agree with the necessity of conducting such experiments, we think that this is not in the scope of the present paper, but something future research can explore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>High TSH and Tg levels usually parallel whole-body TH levels during teleost metamorphosis. However, in this study, high Tg expression levels are only achieved at the juvenile stage, whereas high TSH is achieved at D32, and at the juvenile stage, they are already at their lowest levels.</p></disp-quote><p>This is exactly our point. We observe two peaks in TSH expression, one at D3 and one at D32. The peak at D3 coincides with high thyroid hormone levels on the same day, and while we have not measured TH at D32, existing literature shows that there is a peak in TH during that time (e.g., de Jesus et al., 1998). Similarly, there is a small peak of Tg at D3. Our manuscript focused more on the upregulation of these genes at D3, which has not been reported before in the literature and raised the question of the role of TH so early in the larval development, outside of the metamorphosis period.</p><p>Regarding the respective levels of TSH and Tg, we first would like to add that their respective order of appearance before metamorphosis (TSH at D32, Tg after) is consistent with what we would expect. We agree however that the strong increase of Tg and TPO expression is later than expected. Therefore, we have added the following sentence in lines 212 to 216: “The respective order of appearance of TSH and Tg (TSH at D32, Tg after) is consistent with what we would expect but a bit later than expected given the morphologicl transformation. It would be interesting to revisit this in a future series of experiments, with tighter temporal sampling to study how gene expression and morphological transformation aligned.“.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is very difficult to conclude anything with the TH and cortisol levels measurements. The authors only measured up until D10, whereas they argue that metamorphosis occurs at D32. In this way, these measurements could be more helpful if they focus on the correct developmental time. The data is irrelevant to their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer, considering that (1) TH levels have already been investigated in groupers coinciding with pigmentation changes and fin rays resorption (Figure 4 in de Jesus et al, 1998), (2) there is also evidence in numerous fish species that TH level increase is concomitant with increase of TH related genes, and (3) we observed in our data an increase in the expression of TH related genes as well as pigmentation changes and fin rays resorption. Based on our experience in fish metamorphosis and the literature we can say confidently that those observations indicate that metamorphosis is occurring between D32 and the juvenile stage. This clearly shows that our inference is correct. Additionally, we would like to reemphasize that from our experience in several fish species transcriptomic data are more robust and precise than hormone measurements.</p><p>However, as we were surprised by the activation of TH and corticoid pathway genes very early in the larval development (at D3), which is clearly outside of the metamorphosis period, we decided to measure TH and cortisol levels during this period of time to determine if whether or not there this surprising early activation was indeed corresponding to an increase in both TH and cortisol. As such observation has never been made in other teleost species (to our knowledge), and as we were wondering if gene activation was accompanied by hormonal increase, the measurements we did for TH and cortisol between D1 and D10 are relevant. In order to clarify our message further, we have changed some of the mentions of</p><p>“metamorphosis” to “larval development” throughout the manuscript and added other improvements to avoid any confusion between the two periods we are studying: early larval development (between D1 and D10) and metamorphosis (between D32 and juvenile stage).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, as stated in the previous review, a classical sign of teleost metamorphosis is the upregulation of TSHb and Tg, which does not occur at D32 therefore, it is very hard for me to accept that this is the metamorphic stage. With the lack of TH measurements, I cannot agree with the authors. I think this has to be toned down and made clear in the manuscript that D32 might be a putative metamorphic climax but that several aspects of biology work against it. Moreover, in D10, the authors show the highest cortisol level and lowest T4 and T3 levels. These observations are irreconcilable, with cortisol enhancing or participating in TH-driven metamorphosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, but we think that there might be a misunderstanding here.</p><p>(1) We clearly observed an increase of TSHb (that occurs between D18 and juvenile stage) and an increase of tg from D32 which coincide with the activation of other genes involved in TH pathway (dio2, dio3, and also a strong increase of TRb). All this and put in the context of what we know from previous grouper studies, clearly supports our conclusion that TH-regulated metamorphosis is starting at around D32 in grouper. We also observed morphological changes such as fin rays resorption and pigmentation changes between D32 and juvenile stage. Such morphological changes have already been associated as corresponding to metamorphosis in groupers (De Jesus et al 1998) as they occur during TH level increase, and they also happen to be under the control of TH in grouper (De Jesus et al 1998). Based on this study but also on studies (conducted on many other teleost species) showing that the increase of TH levels is always associated with an activation of TH pathway genes and morphological and pigmentation changes we concluded that metamorphosis of E. malabaricus occurs between D32 and juvenile stage. We have improved the clarity of the manuscript in several places to make sure that our conclusion is based on our transcriptomic and morphological data plus the available literature.</p><p>(2) We clearly observed another activation of TH related gene earlier in the development between D1 and D10, with a surge of trhrs, tg and tpo at D3. As this activation was very unexpected for us, we decided to focus the analysis of TH levels between D1 and D10 and very interestingly we observed high level of T4 at D3 indicating that THs are instrumental very precociously in the larval development of the malabar grouper which has never been shown before. We declared lines 224-225 that our “data reinforce the existence of two distinct periods of TH signalling activity, one early on at D3 and one late corresponding to classic metamorphosis at D32”. However, we agree that we could have been clearer and clearly explained that this early activation was very intriguing for us and that we wanted to investigate hormonal levels around that period. However, we never claimed anywhere in the manuscript</p><p>that this early developmental period corresponds to metamorphosis. Something else is occurring and both TH and cortisol seem to be involved but further experiments need to be conducted to understand their role and their possible interaction. We have added corresponding statements in the abstract (lines 39-43) and discussion (lines 447 to 449).</p><p>(3) Finally, regarding the comment about cortisol enhancing or participating in TH driven metamorphosis, our data clearly showed an activation of the corticoid pathway genes around metamorphosis (between D32 and juvenile stage) suggesting a potential implication of corticoids in metamorphosis, but we agree with the reviewer that further experiment are needed to test that. We never claimed that cortisol was enhancing or participating in metamorphosis, on the contrary we are “suggesting a possible interaction between TH and corticoid pathway during metamorphosis”. And we also say that our “results brought a first insight into the potential role of corticoids in the metamorphosis of E. malabaricus and call for functional experiments directly testing a possible synergy.” Nonetheless, we agree that some parts of our manuscript can be confusing in regards of cortisol synthesis during metamorphosis as we did not measure cortisol levels between D32 and juvenile stage. We have therefore made changes throughout the Introduction and Discussion to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given this, the authors should quantify whole-body TH levels throughout the entire developmental window considered to determine where the peak is observed and how it correlates with the other hormonal genes/systems in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not measure TH levels at later stages as it has already been measured during Epinephelus coioides metamorphosis and the morphological changes observed in this species around the TH peak corresponds to what we observed in Epinephelus malabaricus around the peak of expression of TH pathway genes (see De Jesus et al., 1998 General and Comparative Endocrinology, 112:10-16). The main focus of this manuscript is the novel observation of the existence of an early activation period observed at D3, and for which we needed TH levels to determine if they were involved in another early developmental process (not related to metamorphosis). Our hypothesis is that this early activation might be related to the growth of fin rays necessary to enhance floatability during the oceanic larval dispersal. As we may have arrived at the explanation of this hypothesis too rapidly without setting up the context well enough, we have made changes to the introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even though this is a solid technical paper and the data obtained is excellent, the conclusions drawn by the authors are not supported by their data, and at least hormonal levels should be present in parallel to the transcriptomic data. Furthermore, toning down some affirmations or even considering the different hypotheses available that are different from the ones suggested would be very positive.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the solidity of the method of our paper and the quality of the results. We agree that there were several parts where our message was unclear. We have addressed these points in the revised version of the manuscript to make sure there is no more confusion between the two distinct periods we studied in this paper (early larval development and metamorphosis). We also made sure that our claims about TH/corticoids interaction during both periods remain hypothetical as we cannot yet, despite trials, sustain them with functional experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
