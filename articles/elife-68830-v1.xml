Planarian flatworms have an extensive stem cell population responsible for regenerating any organ after amputation. Here, we compare planarian stem cell responses to different injuries by either amputation of a single organ, the pharynx, or removal of tissues from other organs by decapitation. We find that planarian stem cells adopt distinct behaviors depending on what tissue is missing to target progenitor and tissue production towards missing tissues. Loss of non-pharyngeal tissues only increases non-pharyngeal progenitors, while pharynx removal selectively triggers division and expansion of pharynx progenitors. By pharmacologically inhibiting either mitosis or activation of the MAP kinase ERK, we identify a narrow window of time during which stem cell division and ERK signaling produces pharynx progenitors necessary for regeneration. These results indicate that planarian stem cells can tailor their output to match the regenerative needs of the animal.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals can repair and regrow body parts through a process called regeneration. Tiny flatworms called planaria have some of the greatest regenerative abilities and can regrow their whole bodies from just a small part. They can do this because around a fifth of their body is made of stem cells, which are cells that continuously produce new cells and turn into other cell types through a process called differentiation.</p><p>Measuring the gene activity in stem cells from planaria shows that these cells are not all the same. Different groups of stem cells have specific genes turned on which are needed to regrow certain body parts. It is unclear whether all stem cells respond to injuries in the same way, or whether the stem cells that respond are specific to the type of injury. For example, stem cells needed to repair the gut may respond more specifically to gut injuries than to other damage.</p><p>Bohr et al. studied how stem cells in planaria respond to different injuries, by comparing an injury to a specific organ to a more serious injury involving several organs. The specific injury was the loss of the pharynx, the feeding organ of the flatworm, while the more serious injury was the loss of the entire head. Within hours of removing the pharynx, stem cells that were poised to develop into pharyngeal cells became much more active than other stem cell types. When the head was removed, however, a wide range of stem cells became active to make the different cell types required to build a head. This suggests that stem cells monitor all body parts and respond rapidly and specifically to injuries.</p><p>These findings add to the understanding of regeneration in animal species, which is of great interest for medicine given humans’ limited ability to heal. Many of the genetic systems that control regeneration in planaria also exist in humans, but are only active before birth. In the long-term, understanding the key genes in these processes and how they are controlled could allow regeneration to be used to treat human injuries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>map kinase pathway</kwd><kwd>FoxA</kwd><kwd>planarian</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Planarian</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM139933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adler</surname><given-names>Carolyn E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006471</institution-id><institution>College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiroor</surname><given-names>Divya A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of a single organ, the planarian pharynx, triggers immediate proliferation and expansion of stem cells required to replace it.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When faced with injury or disease, many animals can repair or even replace damaged tissue. This process of regeneration is observed across animal species, and is often fueled by tissue-resident stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bely and Nyberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sánchez Alvarado and Tsonis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). In response to injury, stem cells accelerate the production of specific types of differentiated cells to repair damaged tissues. For example, in adult mammals, injuries to the intestine, skin, or lung induce stem cells to increase proliferation rates and alter their differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buczacki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stabler and Morrisey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tetteh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that injury can modify the behavior of stem cells to promote repair, but how these changes contribute to tissue regeneration remains unclear.</p><p>The freshwater planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> is an ideal model organism to study the interaction between injury and tissue repair due to their virtually endless ability to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ivankovic et al., 2019</xref>).

Defined by ubiquitous expression of the argonaute transcript <italic>piwi-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>), the planarian stem cell population consists of pluripotent stem cells capable of reconstituting the entire animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>) and likely organ-specific progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scimone et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>).

Within hours of any injury, a general increase in stem cell division occurs, along with vast transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baguñà, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaviño et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sandmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). These changes are only sustained beyond the first day if tissue is removed, in what is referred to as the ‘missing tissue response’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baguñà, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaviño et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). Activated by injury, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) contributes to many of these wound-induced transcriptional changes, in addition to regulating stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shiroor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tasaki et al., 2011</xref>). Because these injury-induced changes have predominantly been characterized by analyzing broad stem cell behaviors, how they regulate the transition from homeostasis to regeneration of particular organs are key issues to resolve.</p><p>Most planarian organs extend throughout the entire body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and injuries often cause simultaneous damage to multiple organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott and Sánchez Alvarado, 2013</xref>). The resulting complex regenerative response has limited our ability to decipher how stem cells respond to damage of particular organs. Unlike most planarian organs, except the eye, the pharynx is anatomically distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler and Sánchez Alvarado, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kreshchenko, 2009</xref>). Importantly, it can be completely and selectively removed without perturbing other tissues by brief exposure to sodium azide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shiroor et al., 2018</xref>). Because only a single organ is removed, pharynx amputation vastly simplifies the regeneration challenge posed to the animal. Previous work identified the forkhead transcription factor <italic>FoxA</italic> as an essential regulator of pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scimone et al., 2014a</xref>). Under homeostatic conditions, <italic>FoxA</italic> is expressed in the pharynx and a subset of stem cells. Pharynx amputation triggers an increase in <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> stem cells, demonstrating that injury expands the pool of pharynx progenitors. These properties allow us to dissect how stem cells respond to loss of a specific organ and are regulated to restore it.</p><p>The ability of planarians to replace exactly the tissues that have been damaged or removed by injury remains one of the outstanding questions in regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mangel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishimura et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that stem cells selectively increase the output of specific progenitors of depleted organs, implying a targeted mode of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thi-Kim Vu et al., 2015</xref>). However, others have shown that stem cells respond indiscriminately to tissue removal, incorporating new cells into tissues regardless of whether they have been damaged, suggesting a non-targeted mode of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these findings, the authors proposed that stem cells non-selectively increase production of any nearby progenitors, determined by the size and position of a wound, rather than the identity of missing tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These two seemingly contradictory models introduce uncertainty into our understanding of the relationship between tissue loss and the stem cell behaviors that ultimately contribute to the regeneration of missing tissues.</p><p>By performing an in-depth analysis of specific populations of stem cells in response to different injuries, we show that stem cells can sense the identity of missing tissues. Inflicting various injuries to both the pharynx and body defines distinct contributions of stem cells to regenerated tissue depending on when they divide relative to injury. Planarian stem cells respond to organ loss by selectively increasing expression of organ-specific transcription factors required for subsequent regeneration. Amputation of non-pharyngeal tissues only amplifies non-pharyngeal progenitors, while removal of pharynx tissue selectively increases pharynx progenitors. This increase in pharynx progenitors, and subsequent pharynx regeneration, depends on stem cell division and the MAP kinase ERK, during defined times after tissue loss. Unlike the pharynx, eye regeneration following selective removal is not dependent on stem cell division or ERK signaling, suggesting that different injuries may require distinct regenerative mechanisms. We propose that, in addition to non-targeted and passive modes of regeneration, stem cell behavior can be altered by the loss of specific tissues, selectively channeling their output towards replacement of missing organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Both targeted and non-targeted mechanisms contribute to pharynx regeneration</title><p>Planarian stem cells have distinct responses to injury depending on whether or not tissue has been removed. Any injury induces a proliferative response within hours, while tissue removal causes a sustained response for up to 4 days, leading to localized proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baguñà, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the initial injury response is a ‘general’ mechanism for repair, whereas the later ‘missing-tissue response’ may be tailored to target the replacement of lost tissue. To evaluate the outcome of stem cell proliferation during these specific injury responses, we altered the timing of stem cell labeling relative to different injuries and analyzed the prevalence of labeled cells in mature organs.</p><p>We labeled stem cells with the thymidine analogue F-ara-EdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neef and Luedtke, 2011</xref>) for 4 hr either immediately or 1 day after pharynx or head amputation. We then analyzed F-ara-EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the pharynx 7 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When F-ara-EdU was applied immediately after amputation (D0), we observed increased F-ara-EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the pharynx following either pharynx or head removal, as compared to intact controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). The timing of this pulse, relative to injury, confirms a previous study showing that amputation stimulates general incorporation of newly generated cells into non-injured tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>). However, F-ara-EdU administration 1 day after amputation (D1) resulted in a specific increase in F-ara-EdU<sup>+</sup> pharynx cells only after removal of the pharynx, but not the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). To determine if increased tissue production requires tissue removal, prior to F-ara-EdU administration we performed incisions anterior to the pharynx, which damaged the body without removing any tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, the number of F-ara-EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the pharynx were comparable to controls, suggesting that tissue removal strongly stimulates production of new tissue, while injury alone does not.</p><p>To determine whether other tissues incorporate new stem cells in a time-dependent manner relative to injury, we analyzed the number of newly generated neurons in the brain by combining F-ara-EdU staining with FISH for the neuronal marker <italic>ChAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). In the newly regenerated brain, head amputation increased F-ara-EdU<sup>+</sup> <italic>ChAT<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons after both F-ara-EdU pulse conditions, as compared to intact controls. However, the number of F-ara-EdU<sup>+</sup> <italic>ChAT<sup>+</sup></italic> brain neurons were comparable to controls after either pharynx amputation or incisions, regardless of when the F-ara-EdU pulse was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Because chemical pharynx removal does not increase production of neural tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), while its surgical removal does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>), non-targeted regenerative mechanisms may require injury to specific types of tissues, such as body-wall muscle, epithelia, or intestine. In fact, amputation-specific transcriptional changes important for regeneration have recently been identified within these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benham-Pyle et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that while cells generated immediately after tissue removal can be broadly deployed to all surrounding tissues, those generated 1 day later are targeted toward only those that are missing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pharynx tissue loss selectively increases pharynx progenitors</title><p>Our data so far indicate that injury channels the output of stem cells towards missing tissues. If this targeted model is true, injuries that do not remove pharynx tissue, like head amputations, should not increase pharynx progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Alternatively, if regeneration is non-targeted, injury should non-selectively increase production of any nearby progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>). If this is the case, head amputation, where pharyngeal tissue is not removed, should also stimulate an increase in pharynx progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To test the response of organ-specific progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to loss of different tissues, we challenged animals with either head or pharynx amputation and analyzed changes in expression of organ-specific progenitor markers within <italic>piwi-1<sup>+</sup></italic> stem cells. First, we labeled pharynx progenitors with double fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) for <italic>piwi-1</italic> and the pharynx-specific progenitor marker <italic>FoxA,</italic> 3 days after pharynx or head amputation. We then quantified pharynx progenitors in the same region, anterior to the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

By contrast, head amputation did not influence the number of pharynx progenitors, which were similar to intact animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To determine when pharynx progenitors emerge and how long they persist, we quantified the number of pharynx progenitors at various times after pharynx amputation and found that they significantly increased 3 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

However, partial removal of the pharynx (~50–80%) caused a significant increase in pharynx progenitors compared to intact controls. We also performed flank resections, which removed tissue from regions adjacent to the pharynx but did not damage the pharynx itself.

However, we did not detect an increase in pharynx progenitors in tails after either pharynx or head amputation as compared to intact controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Although the kinetics of each differed slightly, excretory system (<italic>six1/2<sup>+</sup></italic>), nervous system (<italic>pax6a<sup>+</sup></italic>), and muscle (<italic>myoD<sup>+</sup></italic>) progenitor division increased 2 days after head amputation, while intestinal (<italic>gata-4/5/6<sup>+</sup></italic>) progenitors did not.

This mitotic response appears again to be local, as we did not observe increased division of any of these organ-specific progenitors in tail regions, distant from wounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Even after head amputation, we were unable to detect any dividing eye progenitors (<italic>ovo<sup>+</sup></italic>H3P<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), unless we stalled mitotic exit with the microtubule destabilizing drug nocodazole.

Because this timeframe directly precedes the expansion of pharynx progenitors 3 days after pharynx amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we hypothesized that stem cell division increases to specifically generate the progenitors that are necessary for pharynx regeneration.</p><p>To test this possibility, we blocked stem cell division with nocodazole, which induces a metaphase arrest with as little as 24 hr of exposure, resulting in the accumulation of mitotic (H3P<sup>+</sup>) stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grohme et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molinaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). To specifically inhibit mitosis 1–2 days after pharynx amputation, we soaked animals in nocodazole for 24 hr, beginning 1 day after pharynx amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then assayed pharynx regeneration via recovery of feeding behavior. Animals treated with nocodazole for 24 hr had drastic delays in recovery of feeding, compared to DMSO-treated controls, with only 50% of worms regaining the ability to eat within 20 days, and 100% within 32 days of amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To verify that nocodazole treatment under these conditions delayed pharynx regeneration, we examined pharynx anatomy with the marker <italic>laminin</italic>, which is strongly expressed in the mouth and pharynx, and weakly expressed in the body where the pharynx attaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cebrià and Newmark, 2007</xref>). As expected, while residual <italic>laminin</italic> expression was retained within the body, animals treated with nocodazole 1–2 days after pharynx amputation completely lacked a pharynx with its characteristic layered structure 7 days after amputation and sustained severe defects even up to 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Treatment with nocodazole for a full 48 hr, beginning immediately after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), did not exacerbate the delay in feeding ability or defects in pharynx anatomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These findings suggest that stem cell division outside the 1–2 day window has a minor contribution to pharynx regeneration. To verify this, we soaked animals in nocodazole for 24 hr increments surrounding this 1–2 day window, beginning either immediately, or 2 days after pharynx amputation, which recovered feeding behavior at a similar rate as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Further, animals treated from 0 to 1 days after amputation had only minor defects in pharynx anatomy, while those treated 2–3 days after amputation were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that stem cell division within a critical window of 1–2 days after amputation fuels the majority of pharynx regeneration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Stem cell division within a critical window is required for pharynx regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-mount images of intact animals stained with H3P after treatment with DMSO or nocodazole for 24 hr.

First, we verified that this treatment caused an extensive increase in H3P<sup>+</sup> pharynx progenitors 2 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), illustrating that they were arrested in mitosis. Second, we performed double FISH for <italic>FoxA</italic> and <italic>piwi-1</italic> 3 days after pharynx removal and found that nocodazole treatment caused a dramatic decrease in pharynx progenitors compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Importantly, intact animals treated similarly with nocodazole showed no difference in the abundance of pharynx progenitors compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Therefore, perturbing stem cell division during this brief window specifically impacts the production of pharynx progenitors during regeneration. To determine if stem cell division during other times contributed to pharynx progenitor production, we again exposed animals to nocodazole for 0–1 and 2–3 days after pharynx amputation. While we observed some defects in the production of pharynx progenitors, they were more subtle than those in animals treated for 1–2 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

To determine whether ERK is also required for pharynx regeneration, we exposed animals to PD for 5 days immediately after pharynx amputation and then assayed feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). While DMSO-treated control animals regained the ability to feed within 7 days, animals treated with PD from 0 to 5 days after amputation had substantial delays in feeding, with 50% of worms feeding by day 13 and all worms feeding by day 29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Depending on the timing, delaying administration of MEK inhibitors relative to amputation partially or completely rescues anterior regeneration, and suggests that ERK acts within the first day of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>). To pinpoint when ERK signaling is important for pharynx regeneration, we delayed PD exposure for 1 or 2 days after pharynx amputation, and again assayed feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Animals exposed 1 day after pharynx amputation (1–6 days) had delayed feeding ability, similar to those treated immediately after amputation (0–5 days), suggesting that ERK activity within the first day of amputation is dispensable for pharynx regeneration. Animals exposed 2 days after amputation (2–7 days) regained the ability to feed at rates similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that ERK is essential for regeneration within the first 2 days after pharynx amputation. Therefore, ERK likely acts primarily between 1 and 2 days after pharynx amputation. This timing occurs after the increase in pERK following injury has already subsided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that pharynx regeneration may be facilitated by homeostatic levels of ERK signaling instead of its injury-induced high level activation.</p><p>To verify that the inability of ERK-inhibited animals to feed was caused by defects in regeneration, we analyzed pharynx anatomy 7 days after pharynx amputation with FISH for <italic>laminin</italic>.

PD-exposed animals eventually regenerated a pharynx within about 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that ERK inhibition does not permanently block pharynx regeneration. Therefore, we confirmed the effects of ERK inhibition by repeating pharynx regeneration experiments with UO126 (UO), another potent, but structurally independent, MEK inhibitor and observed the same outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Furthermore, exposure to PD or UO eliminated pERK after pharynx amputation on a western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and also permanently blocked regeneration after extensive anterior tissue removal, for up to 70 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

However, if less tissue is removed, the requirement for <italic>fst</italic> diminishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tewari et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, when we amputated animals pre-pharyngeally and maintained them to PD for 5 days, head regeneration was initially delayed in 100% of animals 7 days after amputation, but eventually occurred in 88% of animals within 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), on a similar timeline as pharynges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To test this, we analyzed <italic>fst</italic> expression, which increases within 6 hr of head amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaviño et al., 2013</xref>), but not until 24 hr after pharynx amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that injury-induced ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) may not always coincide with <italic>fst</italic> upregulation.

Therefore, although pharynx loss eventually induces <italic>fst</italic> expression, regulation of pharynx regeneration via ERK is independent of <italic>fst</italic>.</p><p>Our data suggests that ERK activity is required 1–2 days after pharynx amputation, just prior to the emergence of pharynx progenitors 3 days after amputation. We hypothesized that ERK may promote the production of these progenitors, which we tested by maintaining animals in PD for 3 days following pharynx amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). PD exposure significantly inhibited the increase in <italic>FoxA<sup>+ </sup>piwi-1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells typically observed after pharynx amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Importantly, intact animals treated with PD for 3 days showed no difference in the abundance of pharynx progenitors as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that ERK activity for this duration is not necessary for maintaining pharynx progenitors during homeostasis. Therefore, the decrease in pharynx progenitors following pharynx amputation and PD treatment is likely due to their reduced production, rather than altered survival. To determine when ERK promotes pharynx progenitor production, we exposed animals to PD in 24 hr increments during this 3-day window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). While PD treatment starting 0 or 2 days after pharynx amputation had no effect on pharynx progenitors, treatment starting 1 day after amputation significantly inhibited pharynx progenitor increase, similar to those treated for three full days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Similar experiments with UO yielded the same outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), demonstrating that ERK activity 1–2 days after pharynx amputation promotes the production of pharynx progenitors during regeneration.</p><p>To test whether PD-mediated inhibition of pharynx progenitor production following pharynx loss has long-term consequences on pharynx regeneration, we exposed animals to PD for 0–3 days and 1–2 days after amputation, and assayed feeding behavior. These animals had delays in feeding, although less severe than those treated for five full days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>), presumably because animals start recovering after drug washout. Meanwhile, those treated for 0–1 day after pharynx amputation recovered feeding ability at normal rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>), illustrating that PD exposure that does not affect the production of pharynx progenitors does not delay regeneration. Together, these results indicate that ERK activity 1–2 days after amputation promotes pharynx regeneration by contributing to the increase in pharynx progenitors 3 days after amputation.</p><p>Because ERK signaling regulates broad stem cell division associated with missing tissue in planaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>), the decrease in pharynx progenitor production after drug exposure could be a result of reduced stem cell division. To determine if amputation-induced pharynx progenitor division depends on ERK activity, we exposed animals to MEK inhibitors 1–2 days after pharynx amputation, and analyzed <italic>FoxA<sup>+</sup></italic> H3P<sup>+</sup> stem cells. Neither PD or UO exposure substantially impacted the number of dividing pharynx progenitors as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>), despite an overall decrease in H3P<sup>+</sup> stem cells in the same animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E</xref>). These data indicate that ERK signaling is not required for the selective increase in pharynx progenitor division induced by pharynx loss. Because the timing of ERK’s requirement for increasing pharynx progenitors overlaps with when stem cell division is required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>) 1–2 days after pharynx removal, ERK signaling is unlikely to regulate initiation of pharynx progenitor division. Instead, ERK likely promotes pharynx progenitor production and regeneration by regulating <italic>FoxA</italic> expression and stem cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Stem cell division and ERK phosphorylation are not required for eye regeneration following selective removal</title><p>Unlike pharynx removal, selective removal of the eye does not increase stem cell division or expansion of eye-specific progenitors. Instead, following resection, the eye regenerates by passive homeostatic turnover that is not regulated by the presence or absence of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that eye regeneration, following specific removal, may not have the same requirements as the pharynx. To test whether eye regeneration relies on stem cell division and ERK signaling, we performed eye-specific resections and immediately exposed animals to either nocodazole or MEK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Analysis of organ-specific progenitors after various wounds highlighted shifts in the abundance of these stem cell populations based on the presence or absence of specific organs. We uncovered a mechanism that targets regeneration towards missing tissues, fueled by the division and subsequent expansion of organ-specific progenitors required for regeneration. In particular, we found that pharynx loss induces a selective increase in pharynx progenitor division, 1–2 days after amputation, followed by an ERK-dependent expansion of pharynx progenitors that are channeled towards pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings suggest that in many cases, stem cells can sense the identity of missing tissues to launch their targeted regeneration.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for targeted pharynx regeneration.</title><p>Soon after pharynx loss, stem cells recognize the pharynx is missing and target regeneration toward the pharynx by selectively inducing division of existing <italic>FoxA</italic>-expressing stem cells (red), or expression of <italic>FoxA</italic> in division-competent stem cells, within 1–2 days.

One group proposed a non-targeted model, in which stem cells broadly incorporate into both damaged and undamaged tissue, dependent on indiscriminate amplification of progenitors triggered by nearby wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, a targeted model suggests that stem cells amplify organ-specific progenitors in response to perturbations to organ tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thi-Kim Vu et al., 2015</xref>). By labeling proliferating stem cells with F-ara-EdU at different times after amputation, we have uncoupled the contribution of these two mechanisms to the production of regenerated tissues. Depending on the type of injury, cells generated soon after amputation are channeled into all nearby tissues, even undamaged ones. However, those generated 1 day after amputation are selectively targeted for missing tissues. Importantly, the timing of this targeted mechanism overlaps with an essential peak in pharynx progenitor division, revealing that this mechanism generates organ progenitors necessary for the replacement of missing tissues.</p><p>The cells that regenerate the pharynx are primarily generated through this targeted mechanism, mediated by stem cell division and ERK signaling between 1and 2 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Smaller lesions, such as eye resections, do not stimulate a proliferative wound response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>), nor do they depend on stem cell division and ERK signaling for subsequent regeneration. A previous study proposed that regeneration initiation requires signals regulated by both injury and tissue loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>). If eye removal is not detected as an injury, and is insufficient to trigger a ‘missing tissue signal’, this could explain why eye regeneration, following resection, happens passively via homeostatic cellular turnover in the regenerating eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>). Further, while surgical removal of the pharynx does increase production of neural tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LoCascio et al., 2017</xref>), selective chemical pharynx removal does not, suggesting that non-targeted regeneration may require injury to specific types of tissues, such as body wall muscle or epithelia, in addition to tissue loss. Therefore, multiple avenues lead to regeneration: passive homeostatic turnover in the absence of typical injury responses, and both targeted and non-targeted mechanisms that increase cellular production when tissue is lost.</p><p>Our work highlights several key features that are important to consider for future analysis of regeneration. In particular, depending on the size and severity of the wound, initial injury signals may vary, triggering a differential requirement for stem cell division and regulatory signaling pathways. Our results underscore the distinct requirements for proliferation and ERK activity in regeneration of eyes and the pharynx. Also, the timing of experimentation and analysis should be deliberate, as we show that F-ara-EdU-labeled stem cells are differentially incorporated into regenerating and non-regenerating tissues depending on when they are labeled relative to injury. Another key consideration is the intrinsic heterogeneity of cell populations that are analyzed. Stem cells identified by <italic>piwi-1</italic> and H3P staining encompass cells with different potencies and differentiation states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), which may respond uniquely to the changing environment of a regenerating animal. Therefore, broad analysis of stem cells lacks the resolution required to tease apart the intricacies involved in coordinating regeneration. Restricting our analysis to organ progenitors and even further to those that are actively dividing narrows this focus. However, our observation of the asymmetric and symmetric segregation of <italic>FoxA</italic> in dividing cells suggests that heterogeneity exists even within these subsets of stem cells. Resolving the specific stem cells responsible for driving different modes of regeneration, and when cell fate is established in them, will be an exciting area for future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ERK signaling plays multiple roles during regeneration</title><p>Phosphorylation of ERK promotes regeneration in many animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DuBuc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yun et al., 2014</xref>). In planaria, ERK has been implicated as a regeneration trigger, as it is briefly activated by phosphorylation within minutes of injury and is required for wound-induced transcription, stem cell differentiation and broad stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tasaki et al., 2011</xref>). ERK also functions to re-establish axial patterning during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Umesono et al., 2013</xref>), which depends on a network of positional cues that are expressed in muscle cells throughout the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). Because tissue removal from the body requires re-establishment of these positional cues for regeneration to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rink, 2018</xref>), it has been difficult to distinguish ERK’s roles in organ regeneration.</p><p>Unlike amputations to the body, pharynx removal does not broadly disrupt positional cues, which has allowed us to pinpoint a distinct role for ERK in organ regeneration. Both ERK activity and stem cell division act simultaneously, but independently, 1–2 days after pharynx loss, to drive the expansion of pharynx progenitors 3 days after amputation. These events occur after the injury-induced increase in pERK has subsided. Also, ERK activity is dispensable for pharynx progenitor division. Taken together, these results suggest that an ERK-independent signal triggers division of <italic>FoxA<sup>+</sup></italic> stem cells, and that ERK acts later during organ regeneration to facilitate stem cell differentiation or maintain cell fate.</p><p>Among the ERK-dependent wound-induced genes is <italic>follistatin (fst)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>), which promotes regeneration in ways similar to ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tewari et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, both ERK and <italic>fst</italic> are absolutely essential for regeneration following substantial anterior tissue removal, but become less so if smaller amounts of tissue are removed. This variability may be due to the extent of axial patterning disruption induced by different amputations. In fact, the inability of <italic>fst</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) animals to regenerate is entirely dependent on their failure to reset positional information, as inhibition of <italic>wnt</italic> signals that restrict head formation rescue these regeneration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tewari et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that injury-induced <italic>fst</italic> expression and ERK phosphorylation primarily regulate regeneration initiation by establishing repatterning rather than triggering stem cell behaviors that directly contribute to organ regeneration. ERK inhibition reduces broad stem cell division after tissue removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>), but not the specific increase in division of pharynx progenitors that accompanies pharynx loss, suggesting that not all injury-induced stem cell behaviors may be critical for regeneration. Further, rescuing axial repatterning, and thus regeneration after <italic>fst</italic> knockdown, does not rescue defects in missing tissue-induced stem cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tewari et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the ‘missing-tissue response’ may encompass multiple events including patterning, broad stem cell division, and the generation of organ-specific progenitors that contribute independently to different aspects of regeneration.</p><p>Receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) have been shown to play critical roles in signaling upstream of ERK in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel and Shvartsman, 2018</xref>), making them intriguing candidates for potential regulators of regeneration. In planarians, <italic>egfr-3</italic> is required to activate ERK during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fraguas et al., 2017</xref>) and is also involved in stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fraguas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have highlighted roles for the ligand <italic>egf-4</italic> and the receptors <italic>egfr-1</italic> and <italic>egfr-5</italic> in the differentiation of stem cells into brain, intestinal and excretory tissues, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barberán et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fraguas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rink et al., 2011</xref>). Further, some FGFRL-Wnt circuits restrict pharynx formation to the trunk region, possibly through regulation of <italic>FoxA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>). Whether any of the planarian EGF or FGF ligands or receptors similarly regulate the production of pharyngeal progenitors remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cebrià et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Shifts in stem cell heterogeneity contribute to regeneration</title><p>By studying the dynamics of <italic>FoxA</italic> expression in stem cells after pharynx or head removal, we have uncovered shifts in stem cell heterogeneity that depend on the presence or absence of a particular organ. Intriguingly, we find that both the overall number of <italic>FoxA<sup>+</sup></italic> pharynx progenitors, as well as those that are actively dividing, increase only after pharynx removal. Therefore, stem cells sense the absence of the pharynx and channel their proliferative output toward the population of stem cells required to regenerate it. Combined with our analysis of non-pharyngeal progenitor dynamics after different amputations, our results suggest that the heterogeneity of the stem cell population can be differentially deployed depending on the severity of the injury and the particular tissues that need repair.</p><p>Interestingly, removal of non-pharyngeal tissues like the head, does not increase pharynx progenitor proliferation but nevertheless results in increased F-ara EdU<sup>+</sup> cells within the pharynx, raising a conundrum regarding the source of these cells. One possibility is that other, non-<italic>FoxA<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitors which have yet to be identified, may contribute to pharynx regeneration. However, no other tissue-specific transcription factors or proposed pharynx progenitor markers (<italic>meis</italic>, <italic>twist</italic>, or <italic>dd_554</italic>) appear to be required for pharynx regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scimone et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, a recent study has suggested that planarian stem cells, even those expressing organ-specific transcription factors, may harbor a large degree of plasticity that allows fate switching between stem cell and progenitor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). While this hypothesis has not been tested in the context of injury, it is possible that stem cells generated soon after tissue loss could adopt a pharynx progenitor fate at various times over the course of regeneration, which would not necessarily generate a detectable increase in pharynx progenitors at any one time. It will be interesting to explore the potential of these cells in more detail when true lineage-tracing becomes possible in planarians.</p><p>Surprisingly, stem cell division in a narrow window, 1–2 days following pharynx amputation, is absolutely essential for pharynx regeneration, and coincides with the elevation of pharynx progenitor division that directly precedes their increase 3 days after pharynx amputation. The requirement for division in this brief moment after amputation suggests that stem cells detect tissue loss through transient signals regulated by injury. Indeed, a recent study has identified a population of potentially slow-cycling stem cells, reminiscent of reserve stem cells in mammals, that may be specifically induced to enter the cell cycle by tissue loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bankaitis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molinaro et al., 2021</xref>). Whether this distinct population of stem cells contributes to the regeneration of particular organs is not known. Regulatory signals could either be produced upon injury to promote regeneration, or released from inhibitory cues that might emanate from organs when they are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rink, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ziller-Sengel, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ziller-Sengel, 1965</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent study characterizing transient amputation-induced transcriptional changes revealed that the majority of these changes occur within differentiated cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benham-Pyle et al., 2020</xref>). The possibility of transient signals customized to particular organs and the ability of stem cells to readily sense them may explain how planarians exhibit such rapid and robust regeneration of all organs.</p><p>Cell fate acquisition can occur throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fichelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pauklin and Vallier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soufi and Dalton, 2016</xref>). The increase in <italic>FoxA</italic> expression in both actively dividing stem cells, and those outside of M-phase, does not pinpoint a particular time in the cell cycle where fate acquisition during regeneration might occur. Tissue loss could generate fleeting signals sensed by stem cells that influence them to adopt a specific cell fate during division to compensate for missing tissue. Alternatively, stem cells already expressing organ-specific markers may be poised to divide upon receiving such a signal, allowing them to quickly initiate regeneration upon exit of the cell cycle. Indeed, studies in human hepatoma cell lines have shown that FoxA1 remains attached to chromatin during mitosis, contributing to rapid activation of downstream targets following mitosis during liver differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caravaca et al., 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to explore these possibilities in future studies.</p><p>Mammalian homologs of <italic>FoxA</italic> were the first identified ‘pioneer’ transcription factors, characterized by their ability to engage closed chromatin and drive organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zaret and Mango, 2016</xref>). This raises the possibility that pioneer factors may be viable <italic>in vivo</italic> targets for achieving regeneration of entire organs. In fact, overexpression of a related mammalian transcription factor, <italic>FoxN</italic>, is sufficient to drive regeneration of the thymus in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bredenkamp et al., 2014</xref>). The increased proliferation of stem cells expressing <italic>FoxA</italic> after pharynx removal suggests that activation of pioneer factors may also drive organ regeneration in planaria. Other pioneer factors, including <italic>gata-4/5/6, soxB1-2</italic> and <italic>FoxD</italic>, are also expressed in planarian stem cells and are required for regeneration of the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flores et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">González-Sastre et al., 2017</xref>), sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ross et al., 2018</xref>), and anterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scimone et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vogg et al., 2014</xref>), respectively. Therefore, upregulation of pioneer factors in stem cells may be a general strategy used to initiate organ regeneration. Identifying the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the selective activation of pioneer factors in stem cells may be an ideal approach to understanding how organisms initiate regeneration of targeted organs <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the flexibility and dynamic responses of stem cells to different injuries, and highlights potential mechanisms to activate organ-specific transcriptional programs required for regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Prior to experiments, animals were transferred to static culture and maintained in planaria water supplemented with 50 µg/mL gentamicin sulfate. Animals used for experiments were between 2 and 3 mm in length and starved for approximately 5–7 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Amputations, sodium azide treatment, and tricaine anesthetization</title><p>Pharynx removal was performed by chemical amputation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shiroor et al., 2018</xref>). Planarians (2–3 mm in size) were placed in 100 mM sodium azide diluted in planaria water. After 4–7 min, the pharynx extended out of the body and was plucked off using fine forceps (#72700-D; Electron Microscopy Sciences). Animals were kept in sodium azide for no longer than 10 min, rinsed three times, and then transferred into a fresh dish. For pharynx incisions and partial amputations, animals were soaked in tricaine solution (4 g/L in 21 mM Tris pH 7.5) diluted 1:3 in planaria water which causes the pharynx to extend but not detach. Pharynx incisions were created by using forceps to snip along the length of the pharynx. For partial pharynx amputations, the proximal end of the pharynx was snipped off with forceps or trimmed with a scalpel. To resect eyes, animals were immobilized on moist filter paper, and eyes were scraped out using the tips of fine forceps. All other amputations and injuries were performed with a micro feather scalpel (#72046–15 or #72045–45; Electron Microscopy Sciences). For direct comparisons to pharynx-amputated animals, head-amputated and intact animals were soaked in sodium azide for 2–3 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>F-ara-EdU administration</title><p>Animals were soaked in 0.5 mg/mL F-ara-EdU (Sigma T511293) in planaria water containing 3% DMSO for 4 hr either immediately or 24 hr after amputation and fixed 7 days after amputation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><italic>In situ</italic> hybridizations and immunostaining</title><p>Animals were fixed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, animals were killed in 7.5% N-acetyl-cysteine in PBS for 7.5 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBSTx (PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Worms were then rinsed twice with PBSTx and incubated in pre-warmed reduction solution (PBS + 1% NP-40 + 50 mM DTT + 0.5% SDS) at 37°C for 10 min. Worms were rinsed twice more with PBSTx, dehydrated in a methanol series and stored at −20°C.</p><p>For F-ara-EdU detection, following fixation, animals were rehydrated and bleached in 6% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> overnight.

A cup horn sonicator (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT) chilled to 4°C was used to generate extracts by sonication for a total of 2 min with 1 s pulses at 90% amplitude. Total protein was quantified using a NanoDrop One<sup>C</sup> (Thermo Fisher). After quantification, Bolt LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies B0007) was added to the extracts and 100 µg of each sample was run on a polyacrylamide gel (Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris, Invitrogen NW04125BOX). The gel was transferred onto a PVDF Immobilon membrane (Merck Millipore IPFL00010) using the Pierce Power Blot Cassette system (Thermo Scientific), then treated with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR 927–40000) for 1 hr at RT. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-tubulin (Sigma/Millipore T5168) and rabbit anti-Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Cell Signaling Technologies 4370S), diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer.

Quantification included 30 z-sections (68.4 µm) beginning at the first H3P<sup>+</sup> cell and was normalized to area. Representative confocal images are partial projections of ~5 z-sections from regions that were used for quantification, re-imaged at 4x zoom. For F-ara-EdU quantification, images were captured at 1x zoom. In most cases, the pharynges and brains of each experimental group were imaged from the same animal.

Here, Bohr et al. address this question by comparing how stem cells respond to loss of a single organ (the pharynx) versus loss of many tissues (after head amputation) in the planarian, an organism that can regenerate its entire body from a tiny piece of tissue. The authors find that the stem cells respond to loss of the pharynx by producing more pharynx progenitors; this increase is not observed after removal of non-pharyngeal tissues. Thus, the planarian's stem cells are able to &quot;sense&quot; when certain tissues are missing and target their fates accordingly.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers recognized the potential significance of this work, but also shared the same concerns about sample sizes, lack of biological replicates, and insufficient details about cell quantification. Given the interest in the question being pursued, if these issues can be addressed satisfactorily, a revised paper could be considered here as a new submission. We have included the reviews below and hope you will find the comments helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Bohr et al. explores how planarian stem cells respond to the loss of a specific organ: the pharynx. The previously proposed &quot;target-blind&quot; model of planarian regeneration (LoCascio et al. 2017) posited that stem cells do not respond directly to missing tissues, but rather replace missing cell types based on their normal rates of homeostatic turnover. In contrast, Bohr et al. suggest that planarian stem cells can sense and respond to the loss of specific missing tissues, using the pharynx as a case study. The authors conclude that planarians may use more than one mode of regeneration, depending upon the target being regenerated (eye vs. pharynx).</p><p>The question explored in this paper is of fundamental importance, and providing an alternative model by which planarian stem cells regenerate missing tissues should be of interest to a broad readership. Unfortunately, in its current form, the manuscript presents enticing preliminary findings, rather than robust experimental observations. Currently, the manuscript has limited samples sizes and experimental replicates, which is unfortunate. Because this paper is attempting to refute a previously published model it is critical that the data are clear and convincing. If not, these findings could be summarily dismissed without appropriate debate. If the authors can show the robustness and rigor of their results, and address the major issues listed below, this manuscript would represent a significant contribution to our understanding of planarian regeneration.</p><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, experiments were either not repeated, or the number of biological replicates was not reported. In most cases, it appears that experiments were done only once (with the exception of the drug treatments). Numbers of biological replicates and sample sizes should be explicitly stated and the data from different replicates reported for Figures 1D-G, 2B-D, 3C, 3E-F, 4B, 4D-H, 5C-D, and 6A-E.</p><p>2. The authors do not sufficiently describe their methods for imaging and quantifying cells (Figures 1E, 1G, 2C-D, 3F, 4E-H, 5D, 6B). The size of the area covered to collect these data is unclear. High-magnification images are shown: are these the areas that were imaged? If so, their results could be biased by choosing small regions of interest. Ideally, the authors should quantify more than one region per animal. Also, they do not describe the depth of the z-stacks collected or how these stacks were normalized/standardized across conditions. All their conclusions hinge on the quantification of progenitor populations in response to different amputation paradigms or chemical treatments, so the standards for imaging and quantification must be clearly reported.</p><p>3. Inappropriate statistical tests were used throughout. The use of multiple t-tests amplifies the chance of a Type I error and is especially problematic when up to 7 comparisons were made! The authors should use one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison corrections for all experiments with more than two groups.</p><p>4. Figures 1D-E show that upon pharynx amputation but not head amputation, FoxA+ piwi+ pharynx progenitors increase. These data suffer from the quantification issues highlighted above: how the data were quantified is not sufficiently described, only 3 data points were taken (one per animal), the experiment appears to have been performed only one time, and the wrong statistical test was used. Rather than reporting the number of FoxA+ piwi-1+ cells counted, the authors should quantify the total number of doubly positive cells as a percentage of piwi-1+ cells, as was previously published (Adler et al. 2014). The authors also fail to specify whether the change observed between &quot;3 dpa phx&quot; and &quot;3 dpa head&quot; is significant, which is a material point.</p><p>5. Figure 2D also suffers from the inadequate quantification practices described above. Ideally, FoxA+ cells should be quantified as a percentage of the H3P+ cells observed.</p><p>6. The authors use &quot;stem cell&quot;, &quot;progenitor&quot;, &quot;stem cell progenitor&quot;, and &quot;progenitor stem cells&quot; in a mixed and confusing way throughout the paper. For example, in lines 174-175 the authors state that &quot;proliferation of FoxA+ stem cells precedes the increase in pharynx progenitors.&quot; This refers to FoxA+ H3P+ cells vs. FoxA+ piwi-1+ cells, but the only difference is that the former are stem cells in the act of mitosis. Is a distinction being made? Elsewhere in the paper, FoxA+ piwi+ cells are referred to as stem cells. The terminology used needs more clarity and consistency.</p><p>Along these lines, what is a FoxA+ PSC (Line 168)? Are the authors suggesting that FoxA is a pluripotency marker? Or are the authors saying that tgs<sup>-1</sup> has a more expansive expression pattern and is co-expressed with progenitor markers? If double FISH was performed with the progenitor markers reported (ovo, myoD, gata-4/5/6, six-1/2, and pax6), would they all overlap with tgs<sup>-1</sup>? These experiments need to be performed to make any claims about FoxA expression in the context of pluripotency.</p><p>7. In Figure 3C, how does pharynx regeneration occur over such a long period of time after nocodazole treatment in the 1-2 day window? Does target-blind regeneration occur once this window is missed? The authors should repeat analysis of FoxA+ progenitors at later time points in this condition, and/or show rates of BrdU incorporation into the pharynx with and without nocodazole treatment in this window.</p><p>8. The use of the inhibitor PD in Figure 4 is problematic. No data are shown to verify that phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in these experiments. A citation of previous use is not sufficient. The effect of PD on WT uncut animals with regards to FoxA+ cells is not shown and is a necessary control. To address questions of drug specificity, the authors should corroborate their findings with a second inhibitor of ERK signaling like U0126, which has already been shown to work in planarians (Owlarn et al. 2017).</p><p>9. The conclusion that ERK signaling functions in regulating differentiation but not proliferation is premature (line 249-264). Figures 4E-H should be quantified as percentages of piwi-1+ and H3P+ cells, especially since there is decreased proliferation overall with PD treatment.</p><p>10. The use of head fragments to compare eye regeneration vs. pharynx regeneration is inappropriate. Previous studies have already shown that the absence of eyes is not required to induce ovo+ progenitor amplification (LoCascio et al. 2017). Thus, this is not a surprising result (line 343-345) and the authors are mis-citing previous observations (in the earlier work, head fragments were never described). The region where ovo+ cells was quantified in Figure 6A is not justified or explained. The yellow box is placed in a medial region where ovo+ cells do not normally reside. The authors should image within the laterally positioned ovo+ streams that have been previously described (Lapan and Reddien 2012; LoCascio et al. 2017).</p><p>11. Rather than using head fragments, the authors should repeat the flank resection experiments shown previously (LoCascio et al. 2017). This previous study showed that increased BrdU incorporation into the pharynx occurred following flank resection even though the pharynx was present. That result may have been 1) an artifact of increased BrdU staining due to stimulation of proliferation upon injury, 2) caused by unintentional damage to cells associated with the pharynx, or 3) a response to the loss of FoxA+ progenitor populations that surround the pharynx rather than the loss of the differentiated organ. The authors have the opportunity to revisit this published observation by quantifying the FoxA+ progenitor response during flank resection +/- pharynx. Without these data, this story is incomplete and therefore the conclusion of a targeted regeneration response is not yet convincing.</p><p>12. The negative results that proliferation and ERK signaling are dispensable for eye regeneration in Figure 6 are weak and unconvincing. The regenerated eyes appear smaller; this should be quantified (number of PRNs per eye). If the small pharynges that form in Figures 3D and 4C are considered a deleterious phenotype, why is the same standard not applied to the eye? Also, existing eye progenitors could have been sufficient for eye regeneration in these drug treatments. Furthermore, eyes did not regenerate after nocodazole treatment 50% of the time. Is it not more likely that the observations reported are dosage and timing artifacts? How has proliferation been affected? These observations do not live up to the claims made.</p><p>13. The authors claim that ovo+ cells are not proliferative (H3P+) even in cases where there is eye progenitor amplification (head amputation), but the data are not shown (line 321). They should be. Indeed, previous publications have never shown that ovo+ cells proliferate. This might mean that there are proliferating eye progenitors that precede expression of ovo. The authors should discuss this alternative.</p><p>14. The authors claim that eye regeneration does not require proliferation or ERK signaling but pharynx regeneration does. This conclusion hinges on the gross observation that eyes can regenerate in the presence of nocodazole and PD (see point 12 above). These data are coarse and the interpretations are unconvincing. Instead, their model can be directly tested using BrdU pulse-chase experiments. According to the authors' model, one would predict that following pharynx amputation, the rate of incorporation of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells into the regenerating pharynx should be higher than in uninjured controls. Conversely, the rate of BrdU incorporation into the regenerating eye should remain unchanged between injured (i.e. eye-resected) and control animals (LoCascio et al. 2017). Once the authors have established the prediction above, they have the opportunity to show the effects of nocodazole, PD, and U0126 on BrdU incorporation in the regenerating eye vs pharynx following eye resection and pharynx amputation in the same animal. This way, the authors can directly test the requirement for proliferation and/or ERK signaling in both tissues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Bohr, Shiroor, and Adler investigate how stem cells respond to the loss of specific tissues in planarians. The planarian stem cell population (neoblasts) are distributed throughout the planarian body and include pluripotent stem cells and a wide range of lineage-committed progenitor cells. How this heterogenous pool of cells behave post-injury or amputation is incompletely understood. The discovery of markers to label stem cell progeny have opened the door to investigate stem cells respond to tissue loss. However, the anatomy of planarians makes it difficult to surgically remove or damage specific organs. The PI of this study developed an assay to remove the pharynx by &quot;chemical amputation&quot; to study the mechanisms underlying regeneration of this organ without drastically perturbing or injuring other tissues. Using this approach, this paper investigates how a well-defined population of FoxA+ progenitors respond to pharynx removal at early time-points during the regeneration. Their data suggest that stem cells are able to detect loss of the pharynx and respond by generating significantly more cells fated to become pharynx, whereas amputation of non-pharyngeal tissues does not have an obvious effect on pharynx progenitor specification dynamics. In addition, using pharmacological treatments, the authors show that cell proliferation and ERK signaling are required for the expansion of pharynx progenitors and cell differentiation. In contrast, other cell types in the planarian eye do not appear to require proliferation or ERK signaling, suggesting that stem cell responses &quot;target blind&quot; as suggested in a previous study, but are rather tuned to specific missing tissues.</p><p>This work has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field by advancing our understanding of how the planarian heterogenous stem cell population responds to the loss of a specific organ. However, the report is preliminary as presented. It appears that the authors performed many experiments a single time. In addition, description of the methods is insufficient. Consequently, before this work can be considered for publication, the authors need to chiefly demonstrate the reproducibility of the data and robustness of the observations.</p><p>1. The authors need to replicate experiments to increase the sample size for most experiments.</p><p>2. Details for imaging and quantification should be explicitly stated in the methods, and the reported cell count numbers should be normalized as appropriate for each set of experiments.</p><p>3. Although the authors mention &quot;lineage-tracing&quot; experiments, they do not perform DNA analog pulse-chase experiments to analyze a temporal progression and spatial localization of stem cells to FoxA+ progenitors after pharynx removal. The authors rely on PH3-staining in conjunction with FoxA, and supplementary experiments using the pluripotent stem cell marker tgs<sup>-1</sup> (which was only examined at 1 dpa). Could the authors clarify what they think FoxA+ stem cells represent? Are these self-renewing pluripotent stem cells or lineage-committed progenitors? Can the authors get some insight by scanning their images of PH3+ cells expressing FoxA visibly undergoing metaphase? Are daughter cells uniformly FoxA+ as reflected in the model? At least in one of the cells shown in the nocodazole treated controls it appears that both daughter cells express FoxA (Figure 3). I suggest showing some higher magnification images to support the interpretations/conclusions. Others have posited (e.g., Rink, Chapter 2 of Planarian Regeneration: Methods and Protocols), that not every dividing cell may be a long-term self-renewing stem cell and whether a transient amplifying cells exist or contribute to regeneration in planarians is unknown. Adler and Sánchez Alvarado (2015) discuss the role of transient states and how the transcriptional profiles change in response to regeneration. It wasn't clear to me how the authors think about these cells based on the limited number of experiments and analysis, and there are a few places where the terminology is inconsistent, especially in reference to proliferating ovo+ progenitors (P. 14). The authors need to be clear, and it might be helpful to illustrate their model in one of the early figures or to include it in the final model, which omits tgs<sup>-1</sup> due to the limited number of experiments performed with this marker gene (Figure 7).</p><p>4. The pharynx is complex and there is no data to assess what the contribution of other progenitor populations might be. I don't think or think it is unlikely that FoxA+ progenitors are solely responsible for reconstructing the pharynx. The authors should examine how other progenitor populations behave during the process of pharynx regeneration by extending the timeline of progenitor cell analysis. This would reveal if there is fluctuation in progenitor dynamics as animals regenerate the pharynx or re-scale proportions after pharynx regeneration. For example, can the authors test if they are able to detect a contribution of neural progenitors to regeneration of the pharyngeal nervous system? And if so, when during the regeneration process does it take place in the context of their study?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Bohr et al. examine how the pluripotent stem cell system of planarians responds to organ-specific damage. If and how the differentiation of specific cell types is dynamically regulated is a conceptually fascinating problem in planarians and in general stem cell research. The authors address this problem by comparing the stem cell response between a single-organ amputation (the pharynx) versus broad tissue loss (decapitation). Their findings indicate that only the removal of the pharynx triggers the increased differentiation of pharyngeal cell types, while the loss of non-pharyngeal tissues upregulates the differentiation of progenitors of multiple organs, but not the pharynx. Further, the authors implicate temporally restricted ERK signaling as a regulatory component in the differentiation of pharyngeal cell types. These observations are also important because they contrast with the previously proposed &quot;target blind&quot; model (LoCascio et al., 2017) that posits the differentiation of different cell types at constant relative proportions, with the rate of stem cell divisions as global production rate regulator. In contrast, the observations by Bohr et al. provide further evidence for more flexibility and specificity within the planarian stem cell system (&quot;target consciousness&quot;) in the sense of lineage-specific adjustments in the production rates of specific cell types.</p><p>That said, the manuscript generally suffers from an overly narrow focus. Important questions remain regarding the specificity of the stem cell response to pharynx amputation and multiple experiments lack important controls (see below). Moreover, the authors have overlooked that a &quot;target conscious&quot; progenitor response has already been demonstrated by the selective proliferation of protonephridial marker expressing neoblasts in response to protonephridial damage by RNAi (Vu et al., 2015). As a result, the current manuscript would require substantial additional experimentation to consolidate its findings sufficiently for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. Specificity of the stem cell response</p><p>The central premise of the paper is the selective amplification of pharyngeal progenitors in response to pharynx amputation. This the authors conclude on basis of i) an increase in the absolute number of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells in a specific area, while ii) de-capitation has no effect on the absolute number of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells in the same area. This approach is an insufficient demonstration of specificity, as the known phenomenon of wound-induced stem cell activation might also change the absolute number of specific neoblast subclasses and might do so in an injury-dependent manner.</p><p>To account for this important caveat, the authors need to i) quantify RELATIVE proportions of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells out of total piwi cells (or of total H3P+ cells) and ii) they need to include other organ progenitors in the initial analysis. The latter is also critical because the pharynx is a complex organ comprising descendants of multiple lineages (e.g., muscle, neurons, epidermis) and it is not clear whether the foxA+/piwi-1+ cells indeed serve as a singular origin of all constituting lineages (as assumed by the authors), or if they only provide a subset of pharyngeal cells with a rate-limiting role in pharynx assembly (e.g., pharyngeal muscle). In face of such uncertainty, iii) the quantification of new cell incorporation into the pharynx versus other tissues via BrdU labeling would be necessary to address this caveat and to provide a global perspective on the specificity of the response independent of incompletely characterized marker genes.</p><p>In addition, the following experimental design problems need to be addressed or better documented, including:</p><p>• The authors provide insufficient methodological detail on progenitor quantifications, even though the entire manuscript rests on this assay. What are their criteria for scoring a piwi-1+ cell as double-positive for the often weak and noisy lineage labels? If done &quot;by eye&quot;, was double-blind scoring used? Were all cells in a given Z-stack counted or only specific planes? If the latter, by which criteria were image planes selected for quantification? How were the specific specimens out of an experimental cohort selected for imaging/quantification? Though not necessarily a unique shortcoming of this particular study, these points simply need to be adequately addressed in order to rigorously support quantitative differences between experimental conditions (e.g., specificity).</p><p>• The authors appear not to distinguish at all between technical replicates (e.g., multiple specimens within an experimental cohort) versus biological replicates (independent experimental cohorts). This is significant, because (i), the use of the standard error of the mean (SEM) that the authors employ throughout is not really an appropriate measure for a single biological replicate with 3 animals – the standard deviation (SD) would seem a more appropriate measure in this context (SD). (ii), the number of worms quantified for each experiment is generally low (n=3 animals in Figure 1, 3, 5, 6; n=5 animals in the rest of the figures) given the observed variability in the data (e.g., ~25-30 foxA+/piwi-1+ cells 3d after pharynx amputation in Figure 1E versus 50 cells in figure 1H). Similarly, for kinetic experiments as in Figure 1H or 2C, it is simply crucial to ensure that the error bars include the variation in response dynamics between multiple replicates due to the drift in the baseline fraction of H3P+ cells or varying staining efficiencies (e.g., different batches of animals on different days), rather than the technical variation in a single experimental cohort only. Please address these concerns by adding more specimens and a thorough description of the experimental design.</p><p>2. Timeline of pharynx regeneration</p><p>The pharynx regeneration timeline and associated events that the authors present are insufficiently supported by experimental data. The conclusion in line 215 &quot;that proliferation in a critical window of 1 to 2 days after pharynx amputation produces a population of progenitors that are likely essential for pharynx regeneration&quot; rests (i) on the diagnosis of a &quot;proliferative peak of FoxA+ stem cells that occurs after pharynx amputation (Figure 2C)&quot; (line 202). However, rather than a &quot;proliferative peak&quot;, Figure 2C shows a broad &quot;proliferative plateau&quot; of FoxA+ stem cells between 6h and 3 days after amputation. Similarly, the foxA+/H3P+ quantification after pharynx amputation in Figure 4G also displays a lack of a peak of foxA+/H3P+ from 1d to 2d after amputation. (Ii), the associated nocodazole experiments suffer from the fact that the authors did not quantify the impact of the drug on the abundance of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells during treatment intervals from 0-1d and 2-3d after pharynx amputation. Therefore, the authors cannot rule out that nocodazole treatment might have similar effects on the abundance of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells throughout the 1-3 d post-amputation time interval, with the more severe organ-level phenotype of the 1-2d treatment window being caused by some other effect of the drug (e.g., on the differentiation of another rate-limiting cell type for pharynx regeneration or, conceivably, inhibition of priming neuronal activity ). Similar concern apply regarding the statement in line 242, &quot;… a window 1-2 days after amputation in which activation of ERK signaling is important for pharynx regeneration.&quot; Here, (i) the quantification of the end-stage phenotype of drug treatment during the 1-2d time interval (regain of feeding ability) is missing. (ii) Similarly, the examination of the consequences of PD treatment on foxA+ expression in piwi-1+ cells in panel 4D-H employs drug soaking for 3 days, yet the corresponding end-stage phenotype of 3-day drug treatment is not shown. (iii) the implications of ERK in pharynx regeneration are tentative. Even though the PD compound is initially correctly introduced as &quot;MEK inhibitor&quot;, the authors subsequently switch to the factually wrong &quot;ERK inhibitor&quot; designation (e.g., line 358). Further, additional experimental evidence for the assumed Erk inhibition as the cause of the observed phenotypes would be desirable to rigorously support the conclusion.</p><p>These caveats need to be addressed if a cell biological timeline is to remain part of this manuscript.</p><p>3. Integration with the existing literature</p><p>The authors need to better integrate their findings with the literature. First, they need to cite the findings of Vu et al., which explicitly demonstrated a specific increase in the fractional abundance of piwi-1+/protonephridial marker+ cells in response to RNAi-mediated damage to protonephridia(Vu et al., 2015). As such, this study already demonstrates the main point of Bohr et al., namely that the planarian stem cell system is capable of &quot;target conscious&quot; progenitor provision. In the very least, the authors should credit these results as additional evidence for their model. A further finding that they should discuss is the demonstration by LoCascio et al. (LoCascio et al., 2017) that flank region cut-outs cause a significant increase in pharynx cell incorporation over baseline, despite the absence of injury to the pharynx. How do the authors reconcile the discrepancy between these data and their own? In general, the discussion would benefit greatly from a more explicit comparison between the &quot;target blind&quot; model versus their data, as well as a broader perspective on the regulation of stem cell homeostasis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68830.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers recognized the potential significance of this work, but also shared the same concerns about sample sizes, lack of biological replicates, and insufficient details about cell quantification. Given the interest in the question being pursued, if these issues can be addressed satisfactorily, a revised paper could be considered here as a new submission. We have included the reviews below and hope you will find the comments helpful.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Bohr et al. explores how planarian stem cells respond to the loss of a specific organ: the pharynx. The previously proposed &quot;target-blind&quot; model of planarian regeneration (LoCascio et al. 2017) posited that stem cells do not respond directly to missing tissues, but rather replace missing cell types based on their normal rates of homeostatic turnover. In contrast, Bohr et al. suggest that planarian stem cells can sense and respond to the loss of specific missing tissues, using the pharynx as a case study. The authors conclude that planarians may use more than one mode of regeneration, depending upon the target being regenerated (eye vs. pharynx).</p><p>The question explored in this paper is of fundamental importance, and providing an alternative model by which planarian stem cells regenerate missing tissues should be of interest to a broad readership. Unfortunately, in its current form, the manuscript presents enticing preliminary findings, rather than robust experimental observations. Currently, the manuscript has limited samples sizes and experimental replicates, which is unfortunate. Because this paper is attempting to refute a previously published model it is critical that the data are clear and convincing. If not, these findings could be summarily dismissed without appropriate debate. If the authors can show the robustness and rigor of their results, and address the major issues listed below, this manuscript would represent a significant contribution to our understanding of planarian regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the importance of the questions we have pursued here. However, we would like to clarify that our intention was not to refute the previously published model. This confusion likely arose because of a lack of clarity in our writing. In the current version, we explicitly test the ‘non-targeted’ model with EdU incorporation (Figure 1E,F and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and flank resection experiments (Figure 2D). Our data shows that the ‘targeted’ model is the primary mode by which the pharynx regenerates, but the ‘non-targeted’ model also operates immediately after wounding. We have added an entire section in the discussion to make it plainly apparent to readers that both mechanisms likely operate during regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Throughout the manuscript, experiments were either not repeated, or the number of biological replicates was not reported. In most cases, it appears that experiments were done only once (with the exception of the drug treatments). Numbers of biological replicates and sample sizes should be explicitly stated and the data from different replicates reported for Figures 1D-G, 2B-D, 3C, 3E-F, 4B, 4D-H, 5C-D, and 6A-E.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the manuscript suffered from a general lack of experimental replicates and small sample sizes, as addressed in the overview above. Taking into account these essential criticisms, we have repeated each experiment 2-3 times, increased overall sample sizes, and explicitly marked distinct biological and technical replicates on graphs, where possible. We have also included a table detailing biological and technical replicates for each relevant figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors do not sufficiently describe their methods for imaging and quantifying cells (Figures 1E, 1G, 2C-D, 3F, 4E-H, 5D, 6B). The size of the area covered to collect these data is unclear. High-magnification images are shown: are these the areas that were imaged? If so, their results could be biased by choosing small regions of interest. Ideally, the authors should quantify more than one region per animal. Also, they do not describe the depth of the z-stacks collected or how these stacks were normalized/standardized across conditions. All their conclusions hinge on the quantification of progenitor populations in response to different amputation paradigms or chemical treatments, so the standards for imaging and quantification must be clearly reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the previous version of the manuscript lacked clarity with regard to imaging and quantification. We have now addressed these important criticisms by clearly describing them in the figure legends and the Image acquisition, quantification and statistical analysis section of the methods (beginning on line 759). We now explicitly state the following standardized parameters for a given experiment: 1) the region analyzed within the animal, 2) the x-y area measured, 3) thickness (z-sections) for a given experiment, and 4) the z-section where quantification began.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Inappropriate statistical tests were used throughout. The use of multiple t-tests amplifies the chance of a Type I error and is especially problematic when up to 7 comparisons were made! The authors should use one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison corrections for all experiments with more than two groups.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, all figures in which multiple comparisons are made now use one-way ANOVA to determine statistical significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figures 1D-E show that upon pharynx amputation but not head amputation, FoxA+ piwi+ pharynx progenitors increase. These data suffer from the quantification issues highlighted above: how the data were quantified is not sufficiently described, only 3 data points were taken (one per animal), the experiment appears to have been performed only one time, and the wrong statistical test was used. Rather than reporting the number of FoxA+ piwi-1+ cells counted, the authors should quantify the total number of doubly positive cells as a percentage of piwi-1+ cells, as was previously published (Adler et al. 2014). The authors also fail to specify whether the change observed between &quot;3 dpa phx&quot; and &quot;3 dpa head&quot; is significant, which is a material point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the concerns with biological replicates, sample sizes and statistical analysis as described in our responses to points 1 and 3. We have also attempted to indicate when relevant differences are not statistically significant, as is the case for the comparison in question above.</p><p>As for representing our data as the absolute number of cells rather than as a proportion, the reviewer is correct in noting that this strategy is a departure from our previous paper, where <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells were represented as a relative percentage (Adler et al., 2014). However, similar quantification of ovo<sup>+</sup> eye progenitors is represented as absolute numbers rather than percentages (Lapan et al. and LoCascio et al.). Without clear quantification standards in the literature, we initially evaluated both strategies, but found the results to be very similar. We have included two figures of side-by-side comparisons of these two quantification strategies for key panels from our manuscript (Author response images 1 and 2). Given the complex dynamics of the stem cell population, we feel that representing the data as relative percentages oversimplifies our analysis. Because our progenitor analysis initially compares multiple injury scenarios, we are confident that the changes we see in progenitors occur independently of broad injury responses. Further, representing the data as means of absolute numbers of cells in a standardized area/thickness allows us to indicate individual animals and biological replicates on graphs, providing a more transparent view of the data to readers. Based on these criteria, we have maintained our strategy of representing the data as absolute values, along with extensive additions to the manuscript clarifying where and how the data were obtained.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Pharynx loss selectively increases pharynx progenitors in proportion to stem cells.</title><p>(A) Proportion of cells double positive for the indicated progenitor marker and <italic>piwi-1<sup>+</sup></italic> relative to all <italic>piwi-1<sup>+</sup></italic> stem cells in the area outlined by dashed boxes in cartoons.

Figure 2D also suffers from the inadequate quantification practices described above.

The authors use &quot;stem cell&quot;, &quot;progenitor&quot;, &quot;stem cell progenitor&quot;, and &quot;progenitor stem cells&quot; in a mixed and confusing way throughout the paper. For example, in lines 174-175 the authors state that &quot;proliferation of FoxA+ stem cells precedes the increase in pharynx progenitors.&quot; This refers to FoxA+ H3P+ cells vs. FoxA+ piwi-1+ cells, but the only difference is that the former are stem cells in the act of mitosis. Is a distinction being made? Elsewhere in the paper, FoxA+ piwi+ cells are referred to as stem cells. The terminology used needs more clarity and consistency.</p><p>Along these lines, what is a FoxA+ PSC (Line 168)? Are the authors suggesting that FoxA is a pluripotency marker? Or are the authors saying that tgs<sup>-1</sup> has a more expansive expression pattern and is co-expressed with progenitor markers? If double FISH was performed with the progenitor markers reported (ovo, myoD, gata-4/5/6, six-1/2, and pax6), would they all overlap with tgs<sup>-1</sup>? These experiments need to be performed to make any claims about FoxA expression in the context of pluripotency.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our language, particularly with regard to terminology surrounding stem cells, progenitors, and organ progenitors lacked consistency.

In addition, we removed the <italic>tgs-1</italic> data and any claims about pluripotent stem cells, which we agree were preliminary and inconclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 3C, how does pharynx regeneration occur over such a long period of time after nocodazole treatment in the 1-2 day window? Does target-blind regeneration occur once this window is missed? The authors should repeat analysis of FoxA+ progenitors at later time points in this condition, and/or show rates of BrdU incorporation into the pharynx with and without nocodazole treatment in this window.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be valuable to know how animals eventually regenerate after perturbation of pharynx progenitors and whether non-targeted mechanisms take over to slowly regenerate this organ. However, we have struggled to devise an experiment to clearly define these parameters. Nocodazole treatment during the 1-2 day window likely results in culling of pharynx progenitors by apoptosis. Because progenitors are not undergoing mitosis at equivalently high rates in intact animals, nocodazole treatment would not perturb them similarly, making comparisons difficult. Therefore, administration of BrdU during this window could potentially label completely distinct stem cell populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The use of the inhibitor PD in Figure 4 is problematic. No data are shown to verify that phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in these experiments. A citation of previous use is not sufficient. The effect of PD on WT uncut animals with regards to FoxA+ cells is not shown and is a necessary control. To address questions of drug specificity, the authors should corroborate their findings with a second inhibitor of ERK signaling like U0126, which has already been shown to work in planarians (Owlarn et al. 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all the concerns raised above. 1) All MEK inhibitor experiments have been repeated with UO126, with comparable results (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-F, Figure 5—figure supplement 3B-E, Figure 6). 2) A western blot verifies that MEK inhibitor treatment for as little as 24 hours prevents ERK phosphorylation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). 3) We now include data showing that exposure to either inhibitor blocks regeneration in tail fragments, indicating that the pharynx regeneration defect is not due to inefficient inhibition (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). 4) We now include quantification of <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> in intact animals after treatment with PD and UO (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The conclusion that ERK signaling functions in regulating differentiation but not proliferation is premature (line 249-264). Figures 4E-H should be quantified as percentages of piwi-1+ and H3P+ cells, especially since there is decreased proliferation overall with PD treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current version of the manuscript we have made every effort to dissect the role of ERK signaling in stem cell division versus differentiation. We have now extensively tested the timeline for ERK requirement in pharynx regeneration. Based on either PD or UO exposure (Figure 5C-H, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and 3), our data now clearly shows that ERK activity is not required prior to the stem cell division that occurs 1-2 days after pharynx amputation. Further, even though it is true that PD and UO exposure do reduce overall stem cell division, these drug treatments do not impact division of pharynx progenitors (Figure 5H and Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,3E). Because analysis of <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> H3P<sup>+</sup> cells and total H3P<sup>+</sup> cells are done in the same animals, one can extrapolate that the proportional data would look similar. In fact, a decrease in overall H3P would inflate the relative numbers of <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> H3P<sup>+</sup> cells. We have added text to clarify this in the Results section (line 426-429).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The use of head fragments to compare eye regeneration vs. pharynx regeneration is inappropriate. Previous studies have already shown that the absence of eyes is not required to induce ovo+ progenitor amplification (LoCascio et al. 2017). Thus, this is not a surprising result (line 343-345) and the authors are mis-citing previous observations (in the earlier work, head fragments were never described). The region where ovo+ cells was quantified in Figure 6A is not justified or explained. The yellow box is placed in a medial region where ovo+ cells do not normally reside. The authors should image within the laterally positioned ovo+ streams that have been previously described (Lapan and Reddien 2012; LoCascio et al. 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this experiment did not add much to the overall findings, nor did we adequately explain our rationale for including it. It has been removed from this version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Rather than using head fragments, the authors should repeat the flank resection experiments shown previously (LoCascio et al. 2017). This previous study showed that increased BrdU incorporation into the pharynx occurred following flank resection even though the pharynx was present. That result may have been 1) an artifact of increased BrdU staining due to stimulation of proliferation upon injury, 2) caused by unintentional damage to cells associated with the pharynx, or 3) a response to the loss of FoxA+ progenitor populations that surround the pharynx rather than the loss of the differentiated organ. The authors have the opportunity to revisit this published observation by quantifying the FoxA+ progenitor response during flank resection +/- pharynx. Without these data, this story is incomplete and therefore the conclusion of a targeted regeneration response is not yet convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to include this important experiment. We now include quantification of <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells after flank resection (Figure 2D), which proves that injuries outside of the pharynx do not trigger an increase in pharynx progenitors. Additionally, we administered EdU at different times (0hr or 24hr) after head or pharynx amputation (Figure 1E,F). We found that cells generated immediately (0hr) after amputation are incorporated broadly, reinforcing the (LoCascio et al. 2017) result that flank resection increases BrdU labeling into the uninjured pharynx. Importantly, by administering EdU 1 day after amputation, we found that cells generated at this time were channeled specifically into regenerating organs, providing evidence supporting a targeted mechanism for regeneration that selectively produces progenitors of missing tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The negative results that proliferation and ERK signaling are dispensable for eye regeneration in Figure 6 are weak and unconvincing. The regenerated eyes appear smaller; this should be quantified (number of PRNs per eye). If the small pharynges that form in Figures 3D and 4C are considered a deleterious phenotype, why is the same standard not applied to the eye? Also, existing eye progenitors could have been sufficient for eye regeneration in these drug treatments. Furthermore, eyes did not regenerate after nocodazole treatment 50% of the time. Is it not more likely that the observations reported are dosage and timing artifacts? How has proliferation been affected? These observations do not live up to the claims made.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed potential issues with dosage and timing by standardizing the exposure times for nocodazole experiments for 2 days, increasing animal numbers, and improving the quantification. Proliferation and ERK activity are only required for eye regeneration in the context of larger amputation, but not after eye resection alone (Figure 6). Regarding the pharynx, laminin is expressed strongly in the pharynx and mouth, and weakly in the body where the pharynx attaches. Even though there is residual laminin staining 7 days after amputation with PD, UO, or nocodazole exposure (Figure 4D, 5D, Figure 5—figure supplement 1D), this is not at all a ‘pharynx’. The normal architecture, which is apparent in the DMSO controls and in the supplemental figures associated with Figures 4 and 5, is completely lost after these treatments. We have clarified this in the writing (line 290-296). Conversely, eye regeneration in drug-treated animals is undoubtedly more comparable to controls (Figure 6B).</p><p>Eye regeneration is mediated by homeostatic turnover, but whether existing eye progenitors are sufficient to regenerate these small structures after drug treatments remains unclear. We have added text in this section to address this possibility (line 450-453).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The authors claim that ovo+ cells are not proliferative (H3P+) even in cases where there is eye progenitor amplification (head amputation), but the data are not shown (line 321). They should be. Indeed, previous publications have never shown that ovo+ cells proliferate. This might mean that there are proliferating eye progenitors that precede expression of ovo. The authors should discuss this alternative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included images for <italic>ovo</italic><sup>+</sup> H3P<sup>+</sup> cells in intact animals and after head amputation with or without nocodazole treatment to enrich for cells in mitosis (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). We were only able to detect dividing <italic>ovo</italic><sup>+</sup> cells after nocodazole treatment, but did not observe any increase after head amputation as compared to intact nocodazole treated controls. As suggested, we added discussion of the possible explanations to this section (line 265-267).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The authors claim that eye regeneration does not require proliferation or ERK signaling but pharynx regeneration does. This conclusion hinges on the gross observation that eyes can regenerate in the presence of nocodazole and PD (see point 12 above). These data are coarse and the interpretations are unconvincing. Instead, their model can be directly tested using BrdU pulse-chase experiments. According to the authors' model, one would predict that following pharynx amputation, the rate of incorporation of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells into the regenerating pharynx should be higher than in uninjured controls. Conversely, the rate of BrdU incorporation into the regenerating eye should remain unchanged between injured (i.e. eye-resected) and control animals (LoCascio et al. 2017). Once the authors have established the prediction above, they have the opportunity to show the effects of nocodazole, PD, and U0126 on BrdU incorporation in the regenerating eye vs pharynx following eye resection and pharynx amputation in the same animal. This way, the authors can directly test the requirement for proliferation and/or ERK signaling in both tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important experiment, and we have now addressed the different contributions of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells into either the regenerating pharynx or the brain (Figure 1E,F). However, we have reserved the pharmacological perturbations for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Bohr, Shiroor, and Adler investigate how stem cells respond to the loss of specific tissues in planarians. The planarian stem cell population (neoblasts) are distributed throughout the planarian body and include pluripotent stem cells and a wide range of lineage-committed progenitor cells. How this heterogenous pool of cells behave post-injury or amputation is incompletely understood. The discovery of markers to label stem cell progeny have opened the door to investigate stem cells respond to tissue loss. However, the anatomy of planarians makes it difficult to surgically remove or damage specific organs. The PI of this study developed an assay to remove the pharynx by &quot;chemical amputation&quot; to study the mechanisms underlying regeneration of this organ without drastically perturbing or injuring other tissues. Using this approach, this paper investigates how a well-defined population of FoxA+ progenitors respond to pharynx removal at early time-points during the regeneration. Their data suggest that stem cells are able to detect loss of the pharynx and respond by generating significantly more cells fated to become pharynx, whereas amputation of non-pharyngeal tissues does not have an obvious effect on pharynx progenitor specification dynamics. In addition, using pharmacological treatments, the authors show that cell proliferation and ERK signaling are required for the expansion of pharynx progenitors and cell differentiation. In contrast, other cell types in the planarian eye do not appear to require proliferation or ERK signaling, suggesting that stem cell responses &quot;target blind&quot; as suggested in a previous study, but are rather tuned to specific missing tissues.</p><p>This work has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field by advancing our understanding of how the planarian heterogenous stem cell population responds to the loss of a specific organ. However, the report is preliminary as presented. It appears that the authors performed many experiments a single time. In addition, description of the methods is insufficient. Consequently, before this work can be considered for publication, the authors need to chiefly demonstrate the reproducibility of the data and robustness of the observations.</p><p>1. The authors need to replicate experiments to increase the sample size for most experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern, as detailed in the overview above. All experiments have been repeated, increasing the sample sizes across the board. We have also included a table detailing biological and technical replicates for each relevant figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Details for imaging and quantification should be explicitly stated in the methods, and the reported cell count numbers should be normalized as appropriate for each set of experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern, as detailed in the overview above. Briefly, imaging and quantification methods are now described in detail within the figure legends and methods section entitled Image acquisition, quantification and statistical analysis (beginning on line 759).

Although the authors mention &quot;lineage-tracing&quot; experiments, they do not perform DNA analog pulse-chase experiments to analyze a temporal progression and spatial localization of stem cells to FoxA+ progenitors after pharynx removal. The authors rely on PH3-staining in conjunction with FoxA, and supplementary experiments using the pluripotent stem cell marker tgs<sup>-1</sup> (which was only examined at 1 dpa). Could the authors clarify what they think FoxA+ stem cells represent? Are these self-renewing pluripotent stem cells or lineage-committed progenitors? Can the authors get some insight by scanning their images of PH3+ cells expressing FoxA visibly undergoing metaphase? Are daughter cells uniformly FoxA+ as reflected in the model? At least in one of the cells shown in the nocodazole treated controls it appears that both daughter cells express FoxA (Figure 3). I suggest showing some higher magnification images to support the interpretations/conclusions. Others have posited (e.g., Rink, Chapter 2 of Planarian Regeneration: Methods and Protocols), that not every dividing cell may be a long-term self-renewing stem cell and whether a transient amplifying cells exist or contribute to regeneration in planarians is unknown. Adler and Sánchez Alvarado (2015) discuss the role of transient states and how the transcriptional profiles change in response to regeneration. It wasn't clear to me how the authors think about these cells based on the limited number of experiments and analysis, and there are a few places where the terminology is inconsistent, especially in reference to proliferating ovo+ progenitors (P. 14). The authors need to be clear, and it might be helpful to illustrate their model in one of the early figures or to include it in the final model, which omits tgs<sup>-1</sup> due to the limited number of experiments performed with this marker gene (Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to clarify our language surrounding stem cells, pluripotent stem cells, and progenitors. To address the important point regarding the temporal progression of pharynx progenitors, we now include DNA analog (EdU) pulse-chase experiments to analyze the output of stem cells generated either immediately after amputation, or 1 day later when we see a specific increase in pharynx progenitors. This experiment (Figure 1E,F) shows that stem cells produced 1 day after amputation are selectively incorporated into the regenerating pharynx. As addressed in the overview above, point 4, we have made our terminology throughout the manuscript more consistent.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer regarding the complexity of the stem cell population, which includes both long-term self-renewing cells and progenitors.

Although we do not have data to definitively indicate the potency of <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors, we now include images of anaphase cells that suggest that <italic>FoxA</italic> can segregate into daughter cells both symmetrically and asymmetrically (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).

The pharynx is complex and there is no data to assess what the contribution of other progenitor populations might be. I don't think or think it is unlikely that FoxA+ progenitors are solely responsible for reconstructing the pharynx. The authors should examine how other progenitor populations behave during the process of pharynx regeneration by extending the timeline of progenitor cell analysis. This would reveal if there is fluctuation in progenitor dynamics as animals regenerate the pharynx or re-scale proportions after pharynx regeneration. For example, can the authors test if they are able to detect a contribution of neural progenitors to regeneration of the pharyngeal nervous system? And if so, when during the regeneration process does it take place in the context of their study?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that we still lack definitive proof of whether <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors are the sole source of pharyngeal tissue or only generate a subset of critical cells. The pharynx is indeed a complex organ and we would love to know whether <italic>FoxA</italic> is a master regulator of them all. To address this point, we have knocked down every progenitor included in this paper and every proposed pharynx progenitor from the literature (<italic>dd554</italic>, <italic>meis</italic>, <italic>twist</italic>) and none of them seem to play any role in pharynx regeneration (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and data not shown). The lack of a detectable phenotype from these markers has made us reluctant to draw conclusions from their dynamics during pharynx regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Bohr et al. examine how the pluripotent stem cell system of planarians responds to organ-specific damage. If and how the differentiation of specific cell types is dynamically regulated is a conceptually fascinating problem in planarians and in general stem cell research. The authors address this problem by comparing the stem cell response between a single-organ amputation (the pharynx) versus broad tissue loss (decapitation). Their findings indicate that only the removal of the pharynx triggers the increased differentiation of pharyngeal cell types, while the loss of non-pharyngeal tissues upregulates the differentiation of progenitors of multiple organs, but not the pharynx. Further, the authors implicate temporally restricted ERK signaling as a regulatory component in the differentiation of pharyngeal cell types. These observations are also important because they contrast with the previously proposed &quot;target blind&quot; model (LoCascio et al., 2017) that posits the differentiation of different cell types at constant relative proportions, with the rate of stem cell divisions as global production rate regulator. In contrast, the observations by Bohr et al. provide further evidence for more flexibility and specificity within the planarian stem cell system (&quot;target consciousness&quot;) in the sense of lineage-specific adjustments in the production rates of specific cell types.</p><p>That said, the manuscript generally suffers from an overly narrow focus. Important questions remain regarding the specificity of the stem cell response to pharynx amputation and multiple experiments lack important controls (see below). Moreover, the authors have overlooked that a &quot;target conscious&quot; progenitor response has already been demonstrated by the selective proliferation of protonephridial marker expressing neoblasts in response to protonephridial damage by RNAi (Vu et al., 2015). As a result, the current manuscript would require substantial additional experimentation to consolidate its findings sufficiently for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recognition of our work and their thoughtful criticisms. In the revised version we have added new controls, included the important reference of Vu et al., 2015, and extensively discussed the conflicting models for regeneration (referred to in our manuscript as ‘targeted’ vs ‘non-targeted’). Addressing these criticisms has resulted in a substantially more clear manuscript that adds to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Specificity of the stem cell response</p><p>The central premise of the paper is the selective amplification of pharyngeal progenitors in response to pharynx amputation. This the authors conclude on basis of i) an increase in the absolute number of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells in a specific area, while ii) de-capitation has no effect on the absolute number of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells in the same area. This approach is an insufficient demonstration of specificity, as the known phenomenon of wound-induced stem cell activation might also change the absolute number of specific neoblast subclasses and might do so in an injury-dependent manner.</p><p>To account for this important caveat, the authors need to i) quantify RELATIVE proportions of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells out of total piwi cells (or of total H3P+ cells) and ii) they need to include other organ progenitors in the initial analysis. The latter is also critical because the pharynx is a complex organ comprising descendants of multiple lineages (e.g., muscle, neurons, epidermis) and it is not clear whether the foxA+/piwi-1+ cells indeed serve as a singular origin of all constituting lineages (as assumed by the authors), or if they only provide a subset of pharyngeal cells with a rate-limiting role in pharynx assembly (e.g., pharyngeal muscle). In face of such uncertainty, iii) the quantification of new cell incorporation into the pharynx versus other tissues via BrdU labeling would be necessary to address this caveat and to provide a global perspective on the specificity of the response independent of incompletely characterized marker genes.</p><p>In addition, the following experimental design problems need to be addressed or better documented, including:</p><p>• The authors provide insufficient methodological detail on progenitor quantifications, even though the entire manuscript rests on this assay. What are their criteria for scoring a piwi-1+ cell as double-positive for the often weak and noisy lineage labels? If done &quot;by eye&quot;, was double-blind scoring used? Were all cells in a given Z-stack counted or only specific planes? If the latter, by which criteria were image planes selected for quantification? How were the specific specimens out of an experimental cohort selected for imaging/quantification? Though not necessarily a unique shortcoming of this particular study, these points simply need to be adequately addressed in order to rigorously support quantitative differences between experimental conditions (e.g., specificity).</p><p>• The authors appear not to distinguish at all between technical replicates (e.g., multiple specimens within an experimental cohort) versus biological replicates (independent experimental cohorts). This is significant, because i), the use of the standard error of the mean (SEM) that the authors employ throughout is not really an appropriate measure for a single biological replicate with 3 animals – the standard deviation (SD) would seem a more appropriate measure in this context (SD). ii), the number of worms quantified for each experiment is generally low (n=3 animals in Figure 1, 3, 5, 6; n=5 animals in the rest of the figures) given the observed variability in the data (e.g., ~25-30 foxA+/piwi-1+ cells 3d after pharynx amputation in Figure 1E versus 50 cells in figure 1H). Similarly, for kinetic experiments as in Figure 1H or 2C, it is simply crucial to ensure that the error bars include the variation in response dynamics between multiple replicates due to the drift in the baseline fraction of H3P+ cells or varying staining efficiencies (e.g., different batches of animals on different days), rather than the technical variation in a single experimental cohort only. Please address these concerns by adding more specimens and a thorough description of the experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting these important caveats with our interpretation of our data. In point 2 of the introduction to this response, and in Author response figures 1 and 2, we have included a side-by-side comparison of absolute vs relative quantification and show that for key figures in our manuscript, the two strategies yield very similar results. In addition, because we are comparing different wounding paradigms that induce general wound responses, our experiments are internally controlled for wound-induced proliferation.</p><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that we still lack definitive proof of whether <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitors are the sole source of pharyngeal tissue or only generate a subset of critical cells (also addressed in reviewer 2’s major concern 4 above). To address this point, we have knocked down every progenitor used in this paper and every proposed pharynx progenitor from the literature (<italic>dd554</italic>, <italic>meis</italic>, <italic>twist</italic>). None of them cause defects in pharynx regeneration (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and data not shown). In the current version of the manuscript, we also include pulse-chase labeling with EdU to demonstrate that stem cells are indeed selectively incorporated into the regenerating pharynx, depending on when they proliferate relative to tissue removal (Figure 1E,F). However, we acknowledge the caveat that FoxA may only control the production of a subset of cells. Ongoing work not included here is aimed at addressing this caveat.</p><p>We have also corrected all of the flaws the reviewer has pointed out related to replicates and statistical analysis in this version as outlined in the introduction to this response, point 1. Briefly, these include: 1) clarifying and standardizing methods for imaging and quantification, 2) distinguishing biological vs technical replicates in all experiments, 3) replaced error bars representing SEM with error bars representing standard deviation, and 4) increased number of animals in every experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Timeline of pharynx regeneration</p><p>The pharynx regeneration timeline and associated events that the authors present are insufficiently supported by experimental data. The conclusion in line 215 &quot;that proliferation in a critical window of 1 to 2 days after pharynx amputation produces a population of progenitors that are likely essential for pharynx regeneration&quot; rests i) on the diagnosis of a &quot;proliferative peak of FoxA+ stem cells that occurs after pharynx amputation (Figure 2C)&quot; (line 202). However, rather than a &quot;proliferative peak&quot;, Figure 2C shows a broad &quot;proliferative plateau&quot; of FoxA+ stem cells between 6h and 3 days after amputation. Similarly, the foxA+/H3P+ quantification after pharynx amputation in Figure 4G also displays a lack of a peak of foxA+/H3P+ from 1d to 2d after amputation. Ii), the associated nocodazole experiments suffer from the fact that the authors did not quantify the impact of the drug on the abundance of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells during treatment intervals from 0-1d and 2-3d after pharynx amputation. Therefore, the authors cannot rule out that nocodazole treatment might have similar effects on the abundance of foxA+/piwi-1+ cells throughout the 1-3 d post-amputation time interval, with the more severe organ-level phenotype of the 1-2d treatment window being caused by some other effect of the drug (e.g., on the differentiation of another rate-limiting cell type for pharynx regeneration or, conceivably, inhibition of priming neuronal activity ). Similar concern apply regarding the statement in line 242, &quot;… a window 1-2 days after amputation in which activation of ERK signaling is important for pharynx regeneration.&quot; Here, i) the quantification of the end-stage phenotype of drug treatment during the 1-2d time interval (regain of feeding ability) is missing. ii) Similarly, the examination of the consequences of PD treatment on foxA+ expression in piwi-1+ cells in panel 4D-H employs drug soaking for 3 days, yet the corresponding end-stage phenotype of 3-day drug treatment is not shown. iii) the implications of ERK in pharynx regeneration are tentative. Even though the PD compound is initially correctly introduced as &quot;MEK inhibitor&quot;, the authors subsequently switch to the factually wrong &quot;ERK inhibitor&quot; designation (e.g., line 358). Further, additional experimental evidence for the assumed Erk inhibition as the cause of the observed phenotypes would be desirable to rigorously support the conclusion.</p><p>These caveats need to be addressed if a cell biological timeline is to remain part of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful criticisms. While we agree that the <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup> H3P<sup>+</sup> peak may more closely resemble a shield volcano than a Matterhorn, regardless of terminology, there is an obvious and significant elevation in proliferation that occurs within two days of pharynx amputation. This conclusion has been strengthened by reviewers’ suggestions to boost sample size and alter statistical analysis methods. We now include additional characterization of <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> pharynx progenitors after nocodazole treatment 0-1 and 2-3 days after pharynx amputation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E), reinforcing our claims that proliferation occurring 1-2 days after amputation is critical for pharynx progenitor production. Additionally, this 1-2 day window is concurrent with the timing of selective incorporation of EdU<sup>+</sup> into the regenerating pharynx, supporting our conclusion that this 1-2 day proliferative window is essential for pharynx progenitor production and subsequent regeneration.</p><p>Regarding ERK experiments, we have addressed every point raised by the reviewer by expanding our MEK inhibitor experiments to more thoroughly test when ERK is required during pharynx regeneration. This includes standardizing the length of MEK inhibitor treatments and performing many additional controls to show that multiple MEK inhibitors both prevent phosphorylation of ERK and lead to the same outcomes in regeneration. To bolster evidence supporting our timeline, we have done the following:</p><p>We now include data for the end-stage phenotype following both 1-2 day and 0-3 day PD exposure (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C), which both show a delay in regeneration. We also exposed animals to PD or the alternative MEK inhibitor U0126 for 24 hour intervals from 0-1, 1-2 or 2-3 days after pharynx amputation, and analyzed pharynx progenitor abundance. These experiments show that ERK inhibition between 1-2 days after amputation specifically impacts the increase of pharynx progenitors (Figure 5F, Figure 5—figure supplement 3B). Together, these experiments have strengthened our argument that ERK is required for pharynx progenitor production and pharynx regeneration.</p><p>We have modified our language to refer to the drug inhibitors as MEK inhibitors, but continue to refer to ERK inhibition, as application of MEK inhibitors does inhibit ERK activity (Owlarn et al. 2017) and phosphorylation, as shown in our western blot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/02238/figures#fig1s1">Figure 5—figure supplement</ext-link> 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Integration with the existing literature</p><p>The authors need to better integrate their findings with the literature. First, they need to cite the findings of Vu et al., which explicitly demonstrated a specific increase in the fractional abundance of piwi-1+/protonephridial marker+ cells in response to RNAi-mediated damage to protonephridia(Vu et al., 2015). As such, this study already demonstrates the main point of Bohr et al., namely that the planarian stem cell system is capable of &quot;target conscious&quot; progenitor provision. In the very least, the authors should credit these results as additional evidence for their model. A further finding that they should discuss is the demonstration by LoCascio et al. (LoCascio et al., 2017) that flank region cut-outs cause a significant increase in pharynx cell incorporation over baseline, despite the absence of injury to the pharynx. How do the authors reconcile the discrepancy between these data and their own? In general, the discussion would benefit greatly from a more explicit comparison between the &quot;target blind&quot; model versus their data, as well as a broader perspective on the regulation of stem cell homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and apologize for this oversight of our colleagues’ work. In the revised version, we have more thoroughly described and contextualized our findings with the existing literature. We added sections in the introduction, discussion, and figures that specifically address the contrast between existing models for regeneration (referred to in our manuscript as targeted vs non-targeted).</p><p>We have also included experiments analyzing <italic>FoxA</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>piwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells after flank resection (Figure 2D), but do not observe any increase. We have reconciled this finding with the existing literature by performing EdU labeling after different amputations, somewhat similar to those performed in (LoCascio et al. 2017), but at different times. These experiments reveal that a targeted mechanism channels cells towards missing tissues one day after amputation (Figure 1E,F), but that a non-targeted mechanism also contributes to regeneration, potentially if small amounts of tissues have been damaged (like eye resections). The first section of the discussion extensively describes these two models and how they may be utilized in planarian regeneration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
