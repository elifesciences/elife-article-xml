Wt1-null mouse embryos develop CDH but the mechanisms regulated by WT1 are unknown. We have generated a murine model with conditional deletion of WT1 in the lateral plate mesoderm, using the G2 enhancer of the <italic>Gata4</italic> gene as a driver. 80% of G2-<italic>Gata4</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Wt1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> embryos developed typical Bochdalek-type CDH. We show that the posthepatic mesenchymal plate coelomic epithelium gives rise to a mesenchyme that populates the pleuroperitoneal folds isolating the pleural cavities before the migration of the somitic myoblasts. This process fails when Wt1 is deleted from this area. Mutant embryos show Raldh2 downregulation in the lateral mesoderm, but not in the intermediate mesoderm. The mutant phenotype was partially rescued by retinoic acid treatment of the pregnant females. Replacement of intermediate by lateral mesoderm recapitulates the evolutionary origin of the diaphragm in mammals. CDH might thus be viewed as an evolutionary atavism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16009.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16009.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>congenital diaphragmatic hernia</kwd><kwd>Wilms' tumor suppressor gene</kwd><kwd>Gata4</kwd><kwd>epithelial-mesenchymal transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-52299-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmona</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name><name><surname>Cañete</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name><name><surname>Ariza</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Muñoz-Chápuli</surname><given-names>Ramon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISCIII-RD12/0019-0022 (ISCIII-TERCEL)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmona</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name><name><surname>Cañete</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name><name><surname>Cano</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name><name><surname>Ariza</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Rojas</surname><given-names>Anabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Muñoz-Chápuli</surname><given-names>Ramon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002878</institution-id><institution>Consejería de Economía, Innovación, Ciencia y Empleo, Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P11-CTS-07564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmona</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name><name><surname>Cañete</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name><name><surname>Cano</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name><name><surname>Ariza</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Muñoz-Chápuli</surname><given-names>Ramon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI14-00804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rojas</surname><given-names>Anabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of the transcription factor Wt1 is required in a lateral mesoderm domain to develop the mesenchymal population required for the closure of the pleural cavities and the formation of the diaphragm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe birth defect, characterized by incomplete formation or muscularization of the diaphragm and, as a consequence, herniation of the stomach, intestines, liver or spleen into the pulmonary cavities, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia. CDH occurs approximately in 1 out of 3000 births, accounting for about 8% of all severe congenital anomalies. 80–90% of all the cases are posterolateral hernias, also known as Bochdalek-type CDH, characterized by a defect in the postero (dorsal in mice) lateral area of the diaphragm. In most cases (&gt;85%), this defect is located at the left side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pober et al., 2010</xref>). The classical hypothesis is that Bochdalek CDH is due to a failure of the fusion of pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs) with the septum transversum (ST). PPFs are lateral rims of tissue connecting caudally with the nephric ridges and anteriorly with the ST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mayer et al., 2011</xref>). Some authors describe that this fusion rather occurs with the posthepatic mesenchymal plate (PHMP), an accumulation of mesenchymal cells derived from the ST and located in the posterodorsal margin of the liver lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iritani et al., 1984</xref>). Although all these tissues form an anatomical continuum, we will refer to the posterior, dorsolateral areas of the liver as PHMP, and PPFs to the tissue folds located in the dorsal part of the coelomic cavity, marking the limit between the peritoneal and the pleural cavities.</p><p>The clinical aspects of CDH are well studied but its etiology is still poorly known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klaassens et al., 2006</xref>). Animal models are therefore very valuable in order to investigate the cellular and molecular processes leading to CDH in humans. Recently, it has been described in mice that deletion of GATA4 in the PPFs mesenchyme using a <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> driver leads to the development of amuscular, weak areas in the diaphragm and CDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>). This paper assumes that Prrx1 is expressed in the mesenchyme of the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs) but not in the ST, and in fact, it suggests that the ST contributes minimally to the definitive diaphragm. However, this report does not distinguish between PPFs and PHMP and the phenotype does not display diaphragmatic discontinuities, neither does it show a prevalence on the left side, which are common features in human CDH.</p><p>The retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway has also been involved in diaphragmatic development. A classical animal model for CDH consists in the treatment of pregnant rats with nitrofen, a substance that inhibits the synthesis of RA. It has been shown that nitrofen treatment leads to reduced size of the PPFs/PHMP, especially in the left side, decreasing cell proliferation in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clugston and Green, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clugston et al., 2010</xref>) and also decreasing expression of WT1 and GATA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dingeman et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>). RA treatment in this model partially rescues the pulmonary hypoplasia defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montedonico et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugimoto et al., 2008</xref>). The phenotype of this animal model is thus, quite similar to the human one.</p><p>To date, only a few examples of CDH in human have been associated to mutations in WT1 locus, such as the Denys-Drash, Meacham and WAGR syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Suri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonius et al., 2008</xref>). WT1 is expressed in the coelomic epithelium of the septum transversum of mouse embryos by the stage E9.0. Loss of function of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene <italic>Wt1</italic> in mice leads to defective diaphragms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kreidberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clugston et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanism by which WT1 contributes to diaphragm development is still unknown.</p><p>To study the role of WT1 in CDH we performed loss-of-function experiments by conditionally inactivating the <italic>Wt1</italic> gene in the ST/PHMP/PPFs mesenchyme. The use of WT1 conditional knockout overcomes the early embryonic death caused by systemic deficiency of WT1. We used a driver based on the G2 enhancer of the <italic>Gata4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rojas et al., 2005</xref>). This enhancer drives expression of <italic>Gata4</italic> in the lateral plate mesoderm from the stage E7.5, and by the stage E9.5 is active in the septum transversum and proepicardium, ceasing its activity by E12.5 The activity of this enhancer is completely absent in the intermediate mesoderm. Our findings indicate that WT1 is involved in the generation of the mesenchyme of the ST/PHMP/PPFs continuum through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and they provide a novel perspective on the genesis of the Bochdalek hernia and the evolutionary origin of the diaphragm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The septum transversum, posthepatic mesenchymal plate and pleuroperitoneal folds contain heterogeneous mesenchymal populations</title><p>In normal E10.5 embryos, the posterior and dorsal margin of the liver shows an accumulation of mesenchymal tissue, which extends from the dorsal mesenterium of the liver to the lateral tips of the lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The lateral tips of the PHMP appear continuous with the PPFs at the cephalic level while they are separated more caudally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The continuous part of the PHMP/PPFs ensemble apparently forms itself by the anterior growth of the peritoneal recess, which separates the liver sides from the body wall. Thus, the mesenchymal population of the ST originates the PHMP and also the most cephalic portion of the PPFs. The lateral closure of the pleural cavities occurs between E11.5 and E12.5 by posterior growth of the crescent-like continuum formed by the PHMP and the PPFs, a process which is parallel to the fast growth of the liver lobes during these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>As seen in the <italic>Wt1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> labeled cells, the PPFs continue posteriorly as the nephric ridges, the progenitor tissue of the mesonephros (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). A loose mesenchymal tissue appears in the PPF between the more compact arrangement of the cells in the PHMP and in the renal ridges, but the commissural area of the PPF is always constituted by compact mesenchyme similar to that from the PHMP (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

However, the nephric ridges and the mesonephros derived from them show no YFP+ cells in this model, indicating that the progenitors of these tissues derived from a different cell lineage. Thus, G2-<italic>Gata4</italic> lineage tracing allows to establishing a well-defined limit between two lateral mesodermal territories that we will call herein the G2<sup>+</sup> and the G2<sup>-</sup> domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3B,C</xref>). Interestingly, the gonad and the adrenal stroma were YFP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and this can be related with the early expression of GATA4 in the coelomic epithelium, which will cover the genital but not the renal ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Incidentally, the GATA4 positive cells from the central part of the ST do not express YFP in G2-<italic>Gata4<sup>Cre</sup>;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic>embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), an observation consistent with the lack of reporter activity in the G2- <italic>Gata4<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We estimated, by image analysis, the volume taken up by the YFP+ cells in the right and left PHMP of four G2-<italic>Gata4<sup>Cre</sup>; R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> embryos. The R/L ratio of these volumes was 1,21 and 1,45 in two E11.5 embryos, and 1,53 and 1,61 in two E12,5 embryos (mean = 1,45; S.E.M = 0,086). The t-test for one sample compared with an expected value = 1 (symmetrical distribution) gave a result of 5,21 (p-value=0,0069 for three d.o.f).

Defect in the PHMP in G2-<italic>Gata4<sup>Cre</sup>;Wt1<sup>fl</sup></italic><sup>/fl</sup> mutant embryos could be observed as early as E10.5, since less mesenchymal cells are present between the coelomic epithelium and the hepatoblasts when compared with control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). At later stages, the closure of the pleural cavity by growth of the ST/PPFs crescent is delayed with respect to the controls, and the mesenchymal cells of the PHMP are located more medially, not in the lateral tips of the liver lobes. This is more evident at the left side (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, these cells cannot migrate towards the PPFs precluding caudal growth of the lateral commissures of the pleuroperitoneal septa and closure of the pleural cavities.</p><p>Five E12.5 mutant embryos studied already showed strong reduction of the PHMP size as compared with control littermates, but the diaphragmatic defect of the WT1 conditional knockout embryos became clearly apparent by E13.5, when the pleural cavities are almost completely isolated in wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Of 23 mutant embryos analyzed by the stages E13.5 or older, only four of them showed normal development of the diaphragm, while the rest of embryos showed different degrees of diaphragmatic defects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Later, the liver partially detaches from this ST/PPF membrane, which becomes muscularized by migration of myoblasts from the somite. Thus, in the classical scenario CDH can arise either by a defect in the ST/PPF fusion process or by a failure of myoblasts migration. However, very few descriptions take into account that PPFs and ST are not anatomically independent structures. Along the dorsal body cavity of the mammalian embryo a pair of long crests are located at both sides of the dorsal mesentery. In the posterior part, these crests form the nephric ridges. In the anterior end of the peritoneal cavity they form the PPFs, which descend to a more lateral level and directly merge with the ST (where the liver is expanding) through the so called PHMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iritani, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>). This continuity between PHMP, PPFs and nephric ridges is beautifully shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mayer et al. (2011)</xref> through scanning electron microscopy. The boundary between PPFs and PHMP is diffuse although the trajectory of the phrenic nerve has been proposed as a limit between these territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babiuk, 2003</xref>). However, our study of the distribution of the YFP+ cells reveals a novel and well-defined boundary between the lateral plate (G2<sup>+</sup>) and the intermediate (G2<sup>−</sup>) mesodermal domains. The lateral mesoderm domain would be characterized by the expression of <italic>Gata4</italic> driven by the enhancer G2 while the intermediate mesoderm domain would lack <italic>Gata4</italic> expression. The limit between G2<sup>+</sup> and G2<sup>−</sup> domains is established as early as E10.5 in the coelomic epithelium lateral to the mesentery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), between the genital and the nephric ridges. A second boundary appears between the PHMP and the central area of the posterior ST, which shows strong GATA4 expression not driven by the G2 enhancer. This heterogeneity between ST mesenchymal populations is relevant since the central mesenchyme of the ST will not be involved in diaphragm development, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merrell et al. (2015)</xref> and discussed below.</p><p>We think that another important factor in order to understand the development of the CDH is the asymmetrical distribution of the mesenchyme in the PHMP/PPFs continuum. Asymmetry has already been described in the gut mesenchymal compartment, where cells are more densely packed on the left than on the right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurpios et al., 2008</xref>). However, differences in the amount of mesenchymal cells in the PHMP or ST had not been reported, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mayer et al. (2011)</xref> pointed to a larger surface contact between PPFs and PHMP at the right side. We have shown that the right part of the PHMP shows more mesenchymal cells than the left part by the time in which the pleuroperitoneal septa develop, and we believe that this fact is relevant for the left predominance (&gt;85%) of the Bochdalek CDH.</p><p>Our results suggest that CDH could be caused by a defective population of the PHMP/PPF continuum by mesenchymal cells. A process of migration of liver mesenchymal cells into the PPFs relevant for the closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal had been suggested in human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>). Since this closure should be dependent on the amount of cells, the smaller amount of mesenchyme observed in the left side would make it more difficult to complete the process. Thus, we think that left predominance of Bochdalek hernia can be connected with primary mechanisms of left-right visceral asymmetry, and particularly with an asymmetrical generation of mesenchyme.</p><p>As we have shown, WT1 is required in the G2<sup>+</sup> domain (PHMP and anterior part of the PPFs) for the formation of the pleuroperitoneal septa. The immediate consequence of its deletion in this territory is a lesser number of mesenchymal cells in the PHMP. Furthermore, WT1-null embryos completely lack of PHMP. WT1 is critically involved for EMT of the epicardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinez-Estrada et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, a hypothetical function of WT1 in the PHMP/PPF could be to promote EMT and generation of mesenchyme. The upregulation of E-cadherin concomitant with the lack of mesenchymal cells in the PHMP of the mutant embryos supports this suggestion. Furthermore, WT1 plays the same role in the liver mesothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ijpenberg et al., 2007</xref>), and a recent report on the conditional deletion of β-catenin in the WT1 lineage leading to CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paris et al., 2015</xref>) stresses again the relationship between WT1 and EMT. Significantly, the loss of function of β-catenin phenocopies the loss of function of WT1 when its deletion is induced between E10.5 and E11.5, the time window in which we suggest that WT1 is promoting EMT in the coelomic epithelium of the PHMP.</p><p>The coelomic mesothelial origin of human diaphragmatic malformations, and their relationship with WT1 function were proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Suri et al. (2007)</xref> in a study on patients with Meacham syndrome, a rare multiple malformation affecting to genitalia, heart and diaphragm. Two out of eight patients with this syndrome had heterozygous mutations in the zinc finger domains of WT1. Thus, our G2-<italic>Gata4<sup>Cre</sup>;Wt1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, displaying congenital cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cano et al., 2016</xref>) and diaphragmatic anomalies, can be a valuable animal model for this kind of human pathology.</p><p>The presence of lateral plate mesoderm into the PPFs coincides with the backward movement of the intermediate mesoderm from the thoracic levels. Significantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Volpe et al. (2008)</xref> report increase of <italic>Hoxb4</italic> expression in the nitrofen model of CDH. This is relevant since <italic>Hoxb4</italic> is a key gene to determine the nephric fate of the intermediate mesoderm. In fact, ectopic expression of <italic>Hoxb4</italic> in anterior non-kidney mesoderm, either by retinoic acid (RA) administration or plasmid-mediated overexpression, resulted in ectopic kidney gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Preger-Ben Noon et al., 2009</xref>). This is paradoxical, since nitrofen is reducing RA signaling, and <italic>HoxB4</italic> is induced by this morphogen. Our explanation for this paradox is that nitrofen would preclude migration of PHMP mesenchyme towards the PPFs, leaving the intermediate mesoderm (which normally expresses HoxB4) in its primitive anterior position.</p><p>WT1 has a dual function concerning the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). The first process is promoted by WT1 in heart and liver (G2+ domain), but MET is induced by WT1 in the kidneys (G2- domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Essafi et al., 2011</xref>) that lack a significant coelomic contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariza et al., 2016</xref>). We think that there is a connection between these observations. GATA4 expression seems to be independent of WT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ijpenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado et al., 2014</xref>). The involvement of GATA4 in CDH is probably related with the differentiation of the PHMP/PPFs mesenchyme and the migration of myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>) during the late stages of diaphragm formation. Instead, WT1 would be involved in an earlier developmental stage, promoting the local generation of the PHMP/PPFs mesenchyme. This explains differences between the <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Gata4 <sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> model of Merrell et al. (bilateral, with membranous sac and defects of muscularization) and our WT1 model, much more similar to the human Bochdalek hernia (left-sided and with discontinuity of the pleuroperitoneal septum). Incidentally, we think that the claim made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merrell et al. (2015)</xref> about the lack of contribution of the ST to the diaphragm should apply only to the central area of the ST where GATA4 expression is not driven by the G2 enhancer, as shown by us.</p><p>In summary, two types of CDH would originate in different moments of development. CDH due to defective generation of the PHMP mesenchyme appears in models of RA deficiency and also in models with loss of function of WT1. In later stages CDH can develop by defective muscularization of the pleuroperitoneal septa. This type of CDH occurs in models of GATA4 conditional deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merrell et al., 2015</xref>) and also in c-Met deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babiuk and Greer, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The dietary supplement of RA to pregnant females that rescues pulmonary hypoplasia in the nitrofen model of CDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montedonico et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugimoto et al., 2008</xref>) was also partially effective in our model of conditional deletion of WT1. The proportion of E15.5 normal mutant embryos increased from 21% to 62.5% after this treatment. In E13.5 embryos, RA treatment significantly reduced the size of the left pleural cavity opening. RALDH2 immunoreactivity decreases or disappears in the PHMP of mutant embryos, and this expression is probably activated by WT1 as it occurs in the epicardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guadix et al., 2006</xref>), where RA signaling is essential for epicardial EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">von Gise et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The continuity between septum transversum, PPFs and nephric ridges suggests an evolutionary scenario about the origin of the diaphragm in mammals. The diaphragm probably derives from the cephalic end of the nephric ridges, which run throughout the peritoneal cavity in fish, amphibians and reptiles. We suggest that the thoracic nephric ridges were invaded in the ancestors of mammals by lateral plate mesodermal mesenchyme, giving rise to the pleuroperitoneal septa. In fact, the idea that PPFs derive from nephric ridges is not new. It was already proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrich (1930)</xref> based on purely anatomical observations. We suggest that the mesenchyme involved in this process arises from the PHMP coelomic epithelium and this process is dependent on WT1 and RA. Thus, WT1 has an evolutionary significance as a key factor involved in the origin of the diaphragm. The involvement of WT1 in the morphogenesis of the pleuropericardial septa had been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norden et al. (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2012)</xref>.</p><p>In summary, Bochdalek's hernia could be regarded as an atavistic condition related with the failure in the ontogenetic/evolutionary process which replaced the thoracic intermediate mesoderm by lateral plate mesoderm expressing GATA4 under control of the G2 enhancer. WT1 was probably crucial in the process of generating the cellular substrate which made this replacement possible. A right/left asymmetry in this process is probably behind the left prevalence of this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines and embryo extraction</title><p>The animals used in our research program were handled in compliance with the institutional and European Union guidelines for animal care and welfare.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thought-provoking study that deals with a topic of much clinical and fundamental interest. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect, affecting 1 in 3000 children. The most prevalent form, known as Bochalek-type CDH is characterised by a defect in the postero(dorsal) lateral area of the diaphragm which is asymmetric, the majority of cases affecting the left side.</p><p>There has been much speculation about the developmental origins of CDH, a problem that had been addressed in several recent papers using mouse models. Carmona and colleagues have investigated the role of the Wilms tumor transcription factor in septum transversum mesenchyme and identified a role in diaphragm development, with implications for both ontogeny and evolution of the diaphragm. They now provide the first animal model that appears to mimic the most common form of CDH. The authors trace the origins of the CDH to a deficiency of the posthepatic mesenchyme plate (PHMP) that arises from the coelomic epithelium. Importantly the authors show for the first time that the right part of the PHMP has more mesenchyme cells than the left at the time of septa development and this may explain the asymmetry. It has been shown previously by the authors that WT1 transcriptionally activates Raldh2 in the developing liver mesothelial derived cells. Raldh2 is essential for synthesis of retinoic acid (RA). In another study it was shown that maternally introduced RA can partially rescue CDH in a chemically induced model. Interestingly this chemical model also mimicked Bochdalek-type CDH, showing left side predominance. Carmona et al. show here that Raldh2 levels are much reduced in the mutant PHMP mesenchyme.</p><p>Overall, this is a scholarly descriptive study that had many interesting features. While the complex embryology of diaphragm development is carefully documented using a range of molecular and genetic markers, a number of major points need to be addressed to justify the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) It would help to provide some marker analysis to inform on cell state (e.g. markers for proliferation/apoptosis, EMT states etc.). In particular, detailed analysis of EMT markers seems necessary to support the authors' arguments.</p><p>2) When do the embryos die and what other defects are observed? This is referred to very loosely.</p><p>3) The RA rescue is potentially important but very poorly described at the moment. First, rigorous statistical analysis has to be applied. Second, if not all animals are rescued could it be that some have partial rescue that indicates a qualitative difference between RA exposed and non RA exposed embryos? Has detailed anatomical analysis been carried out on all the embryos? It would help to provide some way of representing these data, perhaps a table with a few pictures of embryos.</p><p>4) Carmona et al. show here that Raldh2 levels are much reduced in the mutant PHMP mesenchyme. Supplementation of the pregnant females' diets with RA at 8.5 and 9.5 dpc seemed to result in rescue of the phenotype as 65% of animals with the mutant genotype have complete septation of the pleural cavity by E15.5. This would be a very important observation, but needs to be better documented.</p><p>5) Experimental evidence is required in support of cell migration from the coelomic epithelium to the PHMP or the PHMP to PFF. In the absence of direct evidence from DiI labelling, for example, comparison of Gata4 G2 Cre and conditional YFP expression may be helpful.</p><p>6) Is it possible to quantify the asymmetry in PHMP mesenchyme? Can the authors provide genetic evidence that this is connected to embryonic left right asymmetry?</p><p>7) How do the authors explain the variability in the conditional mutant phenotype? Do they consider that this is due to variable Cre expression or another cause? For example, variability in RA synthesis? Might removing one allele of Raldh2 influence the phenotype?</p><p>8) Please provide information as to the relative timing of the onset of Gata4 and WT1 expression in septum transversum mesenchyme.</p><p>9) Can the authors provide any data on WT1 expression in different species to support the evolutionary arguments in the eleventh paragraph of the Discussion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16009.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It would help to provide some marker analysis to inform on cell state (e.g. markers for proliferation/apoptosis, EMT states etc.). In particular, detailed analysis of EMT markers seems necessary to support the authors' arguments.</italic> </p><p>We had performed a preliminary study using proliferation markers (PCNA and BrdU). We did not find clear differences, although a systematic study was not attempted. No signs of apoptosis such as pyknotic or fragmented nuclei were observed. The claim of a detailed analysis of EMT markers is very reasonable. Thus, we performed an analysis of E-cadherin expression in the left PHMP of four mutant and four control E11.5 embryos. E-cadherin is a good surrogate marker of EMT, since different factors (Snail, Twist, Zeb) can trigger EMT, but E-cadherin is always a target of them. The results are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and we think they clearly supports a downregulation of the EMT in the mutants.</p><p><italic>2) When do the embryos die and what other defects are observed? This is referred to very loosely.</italic> </p><p>We have included a new table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) detailing all the genotypes and phenotypes. It is possible that some mortality occurs around E15.5, but the number of late embryos obtained is too little to confirm this. Other defects affecting cardiac development are described in Cano et al., 2016. Note that the number of mutant embryos studied has increased after the new experiments from 16 to 23, and the prevalence of diaphragmatic defects from 75% to 82,6%.</p><p><italic>3) The RA rescue is potentially important but very poorly described at the moment. First, rigorous statistical analysis has to be applied. Second, if not all animals are rescued could it be that some have partial rescue that indicates a qualitative difference between RA exposed and non RA exposed embryos? Has detailed anatomical analysis been carried out on all the embryos? It would help to provide some way of representing these data, perhaps a table with a few pictures of embryos.</italic> </p><p><italic>4) Carmona et al. show here that Raldh2 levels are much reduced in the mutant PHMP mesenchyme. Supplementation of the pregnant females' diets with RA at 8.5 and 9.5 dpc seemed to result in rescue of the phenotype as 65% of animals with the mutant genotype have complete septation of the pleural cavity by E15.5. This would be a very important observation, but needs to be better documented.</italic> </p><p>Yes, both criticisms are right. Thus, we have performed new experiments in order to study the development of the pleuroperitoneal septa at the stage E13.5, comparing embryos from females fed with the RA-supplemented diet and embryos from females fed with the same diet, without RA. The results are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We have shown a significant difference in the size of the left pleuroperitoneal discontinuity found in RA-treated and non RA-treated mutant embryos. This difference can be related with the lower prevalence of CDH in older embryos treated with RA. On the other hand, we have shown that the 5/8 proportion of normal diaphragm among the E15.5 embryos treated with RA in our first experiment is significantly different from the 4/23 proportion of normal diaphragms among all the non- treated mutant embryos (Z test=2,09, two tailed p-value= 0.037). All these data were obtained from anatomical analysis performed on serial sections of the embryos, not through direct observation of the phenotypes.</p><p><italic>5) Experimental evidence is required in support of cell migration from the coelomic epithelium to the PHMP or the PHMP to PFF. In the absence of direct evidence from DiI labelling, for example, comparison of Gata4 G2 Cre and conditional YFP expression may be helpful.</italic> </p><p>Yes, direct labelling is really difficult to perform. However, we think that 1) the progression of cells from the G2+ domain towards the PPF is clearly supported by our description of the YFP+ cells that become more abundant in the PPF as the pleural cavities become closed and 2) this migration of cells had been described in human embryos by Hayashi et al. (2011). Since proliferation seems not to be a main role in the growth of the pleuroperitoneal septa, migration is the most probable explanation of this growth. Anyway, we have moderated the statements about the migration of cells, for example in the new version of the abstract.</p><p><italic>6) Is it possible to quantify the asymmetry in PHMP mesenchyme? Can the authors provide genetic evidence that this is connected to embryonic left right asymmetry?</italic> </p><p>Yes, we did a quantification of the asymmetry by estimating the volume occupied by the YFP+ cells in the PHMP and calculating the R/L volume ratio. The right PHMP was 45% larger than the left one. The t-test for one sample compared with the expected value of 1 (symmetrical distribution) gave a result of 5,21 (p-value=0,0069 for three d.o.f.). Incidentally, we moved this paragraph from the mutant phenotype description to the first section of the results, where we describe the G2<sub>Cre</sub>;R26R<sub>YFP</sub> embryos.</p><p>We think that there is a close relationship between the PHMP asymmetry and the main mechanisms regulating L/R embryonic asymmetry. We have recently collaborated in a manuscript about this issue that has just been submitted to Nature. It could be quoted in this context if accepted, but we cannot forward information in our manuscript at this moment.</p><p><italic>7) How do the authors explain the variability in the conditional mutant phenotype? Do they consider that this is due to variable Cre expression or another cause? For example, variability in RA synthesis? Might removing one allele of Raldh2 influence the phenotype?</italic> </p><p>This is relatively frequent when using the Cre;LoxP technology. Sometimes the levels of Cre recombinase are not enough to produce full recombination. Alternatively, it is possible that the genesis of the CDH depends on a critical amount of cells in the PHMP, and small variations in this number of cells can lead to different outcomes. We also think that the levels of RA are critical, and this would explain the partial rescue of the phenotype just increasing the exposure of the embryos to this morphogen. So, yes, it is possible that Raldh2 hemizygous mice would be even more sensible to the conditional deletion of Wt1.</p><p><italic>8) Please provide information as to the relative timing of the onset of Gata4 and WT1 expression in septum transversum mesenchyme.</italic> </p><p>Done. We have indicated in the text that Wt1 starts its expression in the ST/proepicardium by E9.0 and the enhancer G2 is active in this area about the same stage.</p><p><italic>9) Can the authors provide any data on WT1 expression in different species to support the evolutionary arguments in the eleventh paragraph of the Discussion?</italic> </p><p>Not really. This is because our proposal of a colonization of nephric ridges by cells coming from the G2+ domain can only be applied to mammals, and we only have data on Wt1 expression and the activity of the G2 enhancer in mouse embryos. A way to support the evolutionary model would be to check if Gata4 expression in driven by a specific mesodermal enhancer in chick embryos, and what would be the anatomical domain where this enhancer is active.</p></body></sub-article></article>
