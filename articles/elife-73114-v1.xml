forms a homeostatic pH regulating system. Despite their importance, their intricate spatial organization is poorly understood. The function of another subtype of CSF-c neurons expressing dopamine is also investigated. Imaging methods with a high spatial resolution (5–10 nm) are used to resolve the synaptic and ciliary compartments of each individual cell in the spinal cord of the lamprey to elucidate their signalling pathways and to dissect the cellular organization. Here, light-sheet and expansion microscopy resolved the persistent ventral and lateral organization of dopamine- and somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neuronal subtypes. The density of somatostatin-containing dense-core vesicles, resolved by stimulated emission depletion microscopy, was shown to be markedly reduced upon each exposure to either alkaline or acidic pH and being part of a homeostatic response inhibiting movements. Their cilia symmetry was unravelled by stimulated emission depletion microscopy in expanded tissues as sensory with 9 + 0 microtubule duplets. The dopaminergic CSF-c neurons on the other hand have a motile cilium with the characteristic 9 + 2 duplets and are insensitive to pH changes. This novel experimental workflow elucidates the functional role of CSF-c neuron subtypes in situ paving the way for further spatial and functional cell-type classification.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>STED</kwd><kwd>light-sheet</kwd><kwd>cilia structure</kwd><kwd>Spinal cord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Lamprey</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FFL15-0031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Testa</surname><given-names>Ilaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-01995</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grillner</surname><given-names>Sten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Göran Gustafssons Stiftelse</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Testa</surname><given-names>Ilaria</given-names></name><name><surname>Jalalvand</surname><given-names>Elham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expansion microscopy combined with light-sheet and STED microscopy elucidated the spatial organization and subcellular composition of two distinct GABAergic CSF-c neuronal subtypes in the lamprey spinal cord.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate spinal cord contains neurons with many different functions. In the middle, there is the central canal containing cerebrospinal fluid. The wall of the central canal is lined with ciliated cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-c) cells in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agduhr, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vigh et al., 2004</xref>). In the lamprey, many CSF-c neurons are GABAergic sometimes with co-transmitters as somatostatin, neurotensin or dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christenson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dale et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jalalvand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rodicio et al., 2008</xref>). CSF-c neurons located at the lateral aspect of the central canal wall coexpress somatostatin and GABA and send axonal processes to mechanosensitive edge cells on the lateral margin of the spinal cord. GABA/somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons have recently been demonstrated to act as pH and mechanosensors and be part of a pH homeostatic system. At any deviation from neutral pH their activity is increased, which in turn leads to a depression of motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>), which should counteract the processes that have led to the pH deviation. The accurate regulation of pH in the nervous system is of critical importance, and the fact that the GABA/somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons respond readily to pH changes gives them a particular homeostatic role. The effect of lowering the pH is blocked by APETx2, a specific acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diochot et al., 2004</xref>), as is their mechanosensitivity. The mechanism by which the GABA/somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons cause a reduction of locomotion has been suggested to be through release of somatostatin, since the effect on motor activity is blocked by somatostatin antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>). CSF-c cells in a more ventral location contain dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schotland et al., 1996</xref>) and their function is yet unknown.</p><p>In the present study, these two classes of CSF-c neurons, and their respective role for the operation of the pH homeostatic system and for the fluid transport in the central canal of the spinal cord is investigated. By applying a novel multi-scale imaging approach, using a high-throughput imaging method with sufficient resolution to resolve individual cells and organelles, we have been able to unravel the mode of operation of these two subtypes of CSF-c neurons. Light-sheet microscopy is the method of choice for rapid and minimally invasive acquisitions of large portions of tissues, but with a compromised spatial resolution in favour of recording speed and minimal photo-bleaching. To overcome this problem, we combine light-sheet with expansion microscopy (ExLSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Düring et al., 2019</xref>), a technique that physically expands tissue samples by a procedure including sample-embedding in a polyacrylamide gel and ends with ~four- to fivefold larger transparent samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>). The physical expansion of the sample allows imaging of large volumes of spinal cord tissue with single-cell resolution and access to fine spatial information. This imaging approach allows quantification of the relative abundance and spatial patterns of CSF-c neuronal subtypes with specific focus on somatostatin- and dopamine-expressing cells along the central canal.</p><p>To further understand the physiological role of dopamine- and somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons, we take advantage of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to profile their neurotransmitter spatial distribution inside CSF-c neurons. STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willig et al., 2006</xref>) reaches a spatial resolution of ~40 nm, which allows us to resolve single synaptic vesicles even when the organelles are densely packed. This approach can identify neurotransmitter-specific release of dense-core synaptic vesicles during basal activity and upon pH stimulation in both somatostatin- and dopamine-expressing CSF-c neurons.</p><p>To gain structural information at ~5–10 nm level, an additional spatial resolution increase is needed, which we demonstrate with the application of STED imaging on expanded spinal cord tissues (ExSTED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). ExSTED imaging features an effective lateral spatial resolution of &lt;10 nm, and allowed us to obtain cell-type-specific structural insight, previously accessible only with electron microscopy, on the cilia subtypes in ciliated somatostatin- and dopamine-expressing CSF-c. The cilia symmetry differs between primary (sensory) cilia (9 + 0 microtubule duplets) and motile cilia (9 + 2 microtubule duplets) and could be investigated in the context of specific cell types thanks to the spatial and specificity abilities of ExSTED. We could show that dopamine CSF-c neurons have motile cilia that may contribute to the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas somatostatin CSF-c neurons instead have predominantly sensory cilia conveying pH and mechanosensitivity.</p><p>Overall, this study uses recently developed high-resolution imaging techniques adapted to profiling the CSF-c neurons in the spinal cord. This provides cell-type information down to the molecular level. The experimental design developed in this study can be applied also to other types of tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distribution of somatostatin- and dopamine-expressing CSF-c neurons along the spinal cord</title><p>To investigate the spatial distribution of CSF-c neurons around the central canal at the single-cell level with high speed and sufficient spatial resolution, we combined expansion and light-sheet microscopy on fluorescently labelled CSF-c neurons.

The cell bodies of both dopamine and somatostatin CSF-c neurons are clearly visible, as well as their characteristic protrusion into the central canal.

We quantified the distribution of CSF-c neuronal subtypes at four different levels of the spinal cord, resulting in a higher amount of somatostatin CSF-c neurons compared to the dopaminergic CSF-c neurons in all four areas of the spinal cord.

Their electrophysiological properties and response to changes of extracellular pH were investigated with whole-cell patch recording in current-clamp mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). All recorded dopaminergic CSF-c neurons fired spontaneous action potentials, depolarizing synaptic potentials, and hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To verify that responses were not evoked synaptically, the GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission was blocked by bath-application of gabazine (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist) and kynurenic acid (glutamate receptor antagonist). During bath-applied extracellular solutions of acidic pH (6.5) or alkaline pH (8.5) no changes in spike frequency were observed, nor a net depolarization of the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E1</xref>).

To investigate if the mechanosensitivity in dopaminergic CSF-c neuron was mediated by the ASIC3 as in somatostatin CSF-c neurons, APETx2, a specific blocker of ASIC3, was applied. In the presence of APETx2 we still observed a mechanosensitive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Since both types of CSF-c neurons are ciliated, we investigated whether the functional difference is reflected in the structural organization of the cilia.</p><p>Cilia express acetylated α-tubulin and can be classified either as primary cilia, mainly present in sensory cells and neurons and with a 9 + 0 symmetry of nine outer microtubule doublets, or motile cilia, with a 9 + 2 symmetry showing an extra pair of microtubule singlets in the centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaertig and Wloga, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Satir, 2005</xref>). Primary and motile cilia both have an average diameter of 200–240 nm, close to the achievable spatial resolution of a confocal microscope equipped with a high numerical aperture objective. Therefore, a higher spatial resolution is crucial to assess their organization and subcompartmentalization.</p><p>One aim for exploring the cilia symmetry of ciliated CSF-c neurons was to uncover potential signalling compartments related to pH and mechanosensitivity of the CSF-c neurons. Cilia in the central canal was immunolabelled for acetylated α-tubulin, a protein characteristic of cilia, and imaged with confocal and STED microscopy to measure their diameters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, E, F</xref>). STED imaging visualizes the cilium as a hollow structure with an outer diameter of about 240 nm thanks to the increased spatial resolution, but the resolution is still not enough to detect the microtubule doublets. One strategy to increase the observable level of detail is to expand the tissue. In the expanded spinal cord tissue, pre-immunostained for acetylated α-tubulin, the resolution of the dense cilia in the central canal increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, 3D XYZ image) as compared to confocal imaging of the non-expanded sample. Confocal imaging of the expanded sample shows spatial details comparable to STED images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) of the non-expanded one, therefore still not having the resolution (5–10 nm) needed to dissect the internal cilia structure and identify microtubule doublets.

ExLSM allowed us to visualize and quantify CSF-c neurons in a large volume of the spinal cord with a fourfold increase in resolution, necessary to distinguish and count each individual cell. There were approximately twice as many somatostatin CSF-c neurons as dopaminergic CSF-c neurons along the whole length of the spinal cord. One area, at the level of the rostral part of the dorsal fin had, however, a somewhat larger number of somatostatin CSF-c neurons than elsewhere. This is the same spinal cord area in which a dramatic decrease occurs of the serotonin/dopamine neurons that are located just ventral to the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schotland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>).

The size distribution is in line with previous electron microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schotland et al., 1996</xref>). The STED data reveal the presence of DCVs in several CSF-c cellular subcompartments, including the bulb protrusion into the central canal, soma, and axonal branches. We could show a marked reduction of somatostatin DCVs number density in the soma of CSF-c neurons when exposed to acidic or alkaline pH, while there was no effect on the dopamine DCVs number density. This lack of change in the number density of DCVs in dopaminergic CSF-c neurons agrees with the present electrophysiological results showing that these cells are not activated by changes of the extracellular pH.</p><p>We have shown previously that somatostatin/GABA-expressing CSF-c neurons are responding to acidic and alkaline extracellular solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>) being part of a homeostatic system for reducing motor activity when the spinal cord/brain is exposed to changes of pH as due to metabolic or respiratory stress or intense muscle activity. We now show with STED imaging that the pH response resulted from somatostatin DCVs release, whereas GABA was unaffected.</p><p>At the ultrastructural level, GABAergic CSF-c neurons have been shown to have ciliated endings in the lamprey and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orts-Del’Immagine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schotland et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vigh et al., 2004</xref>). Since somatostatin/GABA and dopaminergic/GABA CSF-c neurons have similar responses to mechanical stimuli, while only the former responds to pH changes, the question arose if these two types of CSF-c neurons have different forms of cilia. To visualize cilia microtubule symmetry in CSF-c neurons a resolution of 5–10 nm is needed, which was provided by the combination of expansion and STED microscopy (ExSTED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). ExSTED microscopy allowed us to obtain cell-type-specific structural insights on the cilium types in ciliated somatostatin- and dopamine-expressing CSF-c neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Using ExSTED microscopy we found primary cilia with 9 + 0 symmetry in somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons, also found in specialized sensory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirschen and Xiong, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Singla and Reiter, 2006</xref>) and motile cilia with 9 + 2 symmetry in dopaminergic CSF-c neurons that may serve to generate fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faubel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). The high expression of sensory cilia (9 + 0) found in pH/mechanosensitive somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons provide additional evidence to recognize them as sensory neurons. The mechanosensitivity of the dopamine- and somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons is mediated by different cellular mechanisms, the latter is blocked by APETx2, a selective ASIC3 blocker as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>). The mechanosensitivity of the dopamine CSF-c neurons is, however, unaffected by APETx2. This blocker is specific to the ASIC3 but does not block ASIC1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diochot et al., 2004</xref>), the latter having been cloned in lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coric et al., 2005</xref>) and found insensitive to pH. The data support the previous interpretation that ASIC3 mediates both the acid-sensing and the mechanosensitivity, in somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jalalvand et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jalalvand et al., 2016b</xref>). PKD2L1 channel is expressed in the dopaminergic CSF-c neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and this channel is known to serve as a mechanosensitive receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>) and may therefore serve in this function also for the dopaminergic CSF-c neurons. In the zebrafish, the mechanosensitive GABA CSF-c neurons sense the lateral bending movements occurring during locomotion through PKD2L1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>). We have also observed expression of ASIC3 and PKD2L1 channels, as well as sensory cilia in CSF-c neurons of the mouse, which suggests that this may be representative of all vertebrates. The motile cilia (9 + 2) found only in the mechanosensitive (non-pH) dopaminergic CSF-c neurons may suggest that they may act as a CSF flow generator.</p><p>In conclusion, by applying ExM combined with light-sheet and STED microscopy with nanoscale precision, the spatial organization, abundance, and subcellular composition of two distinct GABAergic CSF-c neuronal subtypes in the lamprey spinal cord were elucidated. One type is sensitive to pH and displaying mechanosensitivity (somatostatin) while the other (dopamine) only responds to mechanical stimuli. They use different cellular mechanisms for the transduction of mechanical stimuli to their cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The experimental procedures were approved by the local ethical committee (Stockholms Djurförsöksetiska Nämnd; Dnr 5806-2019) and were in accordance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, 1996 revision). During the investigation, every effort was made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used during the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse</title><p>Experiments were performed on a total of 4, C57BL/6 wild type mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). All experiments were performed in accordance with animal welfare guidelines set forth by Karolinska Institutet and were approved by Swedish Board of agriculture for Animal welfare (ethical permit number: 2645-2021).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry: lamprey</title><p>The animals (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were deeply anesthetized through immersion in carbonate-buffered tap water containing MS-222 (100 mg/l; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Following decapitation, a portion of the spinal cord, rostral to the dorsal fin, was fixed by 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 12–24 hr at 4°C, and subsequently cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in phosphate buffer (PB) for 3–12 hr. For GABA and dopamine immunodetection, 1% glutaraldehyde (vol/vol) was added to the fixative solution. Transverse sections (20 µm thick) were cut on a cryostat (Microm HM 560, Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany), collected on gelatine-coated slides, and kept at −20°C until processing. Sections were incubated/co-incubated with different primary antibodies listed here: a mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (dilution 1:500, Sigma-Aldrich), a rat monoclonal anti-somatostatin antibody (1:100, Millipore), a rabbit polyclonal anti-somatostatin-14 IgG antibody (1:1000, Peninsula laboratories), a mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (1:200, Millipore), a rabbit polyclonal anti-TH antibody (1:500, Millipore), a mouse monoclonal anti-dopamine antibody (1:400, Millipore), and a mouse monoclonal anti-GABA antibody (1:2000, Swant).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mouse</title><p>The animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4. The spinal cord was removed and postfixed for 2 hr, after which it was transferred to a 12% sucrose solution in 0.01 M PBS overnight. Transverse sections (20 µm thick) were cut on a cryostat and mounted on gelatine-coated slides and kept at −20°C until processing. Sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-polycystin-L antibody (1:500, Millipore), a rabbit polyclonal ASIC3 antibody (1:400, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or a rabbit polyclonal anti-ARL13B antibody (1:500, Proteintech).</p><p>The lamprey and mouse spinal cord sections were after incubation with primary antibodies thoroughly rinsed in PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs), STAR 635P-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:500, Abberior) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and STAR 635P-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Abberior) or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific), for 3 hr at room temperature. The sections were Nissl stained by adding NeuroTrace 530/615 red or 640/660 deep-red fluorescent Nissl stain (1:1000, Invitrogen) to the secondary antibody solution. Phalloidin conjugated with STAR 635P (1:200, Abberior) was added to the secondary antibodies to stain actin filaments. The primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB. All sections were mounted in custom-made Mowiol mounting media, supplemented with DABCO (Thomas Scientific, C966M75), and covered with coverslips (No. 1.5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Expansion microscopy</title><p>After fixation, transverse sections of the lamprey spinal cord (40–50 µm thick) were cut on a cryostat and collected and immersed in PBS. The sections were stained with antibodies according to the protocols described above. The samples were treated at room temperature for 1 hr with anchoring solution, 1 mM MA-NHS in PBS (0.018 g MA-NHS in 100 µl DMSO and stored at −20°C) which enables proteins to be anchored to the hydrogel. The slices then were incubated for 1 hr in a monomer solution on ice, which was followed by adding the gelling solution to the gelling chambers. The gelling solution consisted of monomer solution (1 M NaCl, 8.6% sodium acrylate, 2.5% acrylamide, and 0.15% <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>′-methylene bisacrylamide in PBS), 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (0.2%), Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) (accelerator solution, 0.2%), and Ammonium persulfate (APS) (initiator solution, 0.2%). The slices were incubated in a 37°C incubator for 2 hr for gelation. The gels were removed from the gelling chamber and the coverslips were transferred to digesting buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 Triton X-100) with proteinase K (1:100, 8 units/ml, New England Biolabs) for 30–40 min in room temperature. The gels were removed from the digestion buffer and immersed in deionized (DI) water (three to five times for 30 min) for further expansion. After final expansion, the gels were mounted to a 35 mm glass bottom petri dish coated with poly-<sc>L</sc>-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). To remove the extra gel on a coverslip and increase the resolution, we cut the gel through the central canal and rotated it 90° away from the coverslip. The expansion factor was ~4.5–5 and has been calculated by overlapping the pre- and post-expanded gel slice in the air–water boundary and by cross checking the cilia diameter in expanded and not samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>STED microscopy</title><p>Most STED images have been recorded on a custom-built setup, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvelid and Testa, 2019</xref>) equipped with a glycerol objective (HCX PL APO 93×/1.30 NA GLYC STED White motCORR, 15506417, Leica Microsystems). The images were recorded by exciting Alexa Fluor 594 and STAR 635P with 561 nm (PDL561, Abberior Instruments) and 640 nm (LDH-D-C-640, PicoQuant) laser lines, respectively. A STED beam at 775 nm (KATANA 08 HP, OneFive) has been used to deplete both laser lines, shaped by a spatial light modulator (LCOS-SLM X10468-02, Hamamatsu Photonics) into a donut. Two-colour STED images were recorded line-by-line sequentially. A third confocal channel, for structures labelled with Alexa Fluor 488, has been excited with a 510-nm laser line (LDH-D-C-510, PicoQuant). Detection was performed using the following bandpass filters: ET615/30 m (Chroma), ET705/100 m (Chroma), and FF01-550/49 (Semrock). The pixel sizes of the images were 27.2–32.3 nm in XY, and 300 nm in Z. The pixel dwell time used was 10–50 µs, added over one to two lines. Laser powers used were in the following ranges: 561 nm: 1–40 µW, 640 nm: 2–20 µW, and 775 nm: 65–180 mW. Additional STED images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–J</xref>) have been recorded on a commercial Leica TCS SP8 3X STED.

The detection windows used were 510–560, 600–645, and 670–750 nm. The pixel size of the images was 25–30 nm, and the pixel dwell time used was 10–40 µs, added over two to four lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Light-sheet microscopy</title><p>The expanded slices from four different parts of the lamprey spinal cord were separately glued to a metal rod and placed in the chamber of a Zeiss Light-sheet Z1 microscope containing DI water.

The transverse sections of the cilia images were deconvoluted with a calculated effective STED PSF, Lorentzian with FWHM of 50 nm, using the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution implemented in Imspector. The deconvolution was stopped after five iterations. The line profiles of cilia and DCVs were fitted with a Gaussian, and the FWHM was measured. The OriginLab software (OriginLab) was used for making the graphs. Animation and spot object creation tools of Imaris 9.1 (Bitplane) were used to make 3D movies and segmentation of the 3D data.</p><p>Analysis of the correlation of GABA signal and somatostatin DCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3v</xref>) was performed by manually selecting areas inside (soma/axon-DCVs) and outside (soma/axon-volume) somatostatin DCVs (detected in the somatostatin channel) as well as in the extracellular space (Background). The mean of the GABA signal inside each area was recorded. A total of five cells were used for the soma and three cells for the axons. The number of areas selected in each category in each cell ranged from 3 to 63, with a mean of 37. Plotted are the paired graphs for each cell, with each data point representing the cellular mean of the mean GABA signals per area. The Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test is performed between the groups of means of the cells per category.</p><p>The quantification of the somatostatin and dopamine DCVs in the cell area (2D) was performed using Fiji Analyze particles plugin. Vesicles with an area smaller than 0.190 µm<sup>2</sup> (corresponding to vesicle diameter less than 250 nm) were considered and their number density was calculated.</p><p>The quantification of the somatostatin and dopamine DCVs in cell volume was performed using the 3D imageJ suite plugins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>). The 3D stacks were slightly adjusted for noise applying a two-pixel 3D median filter. The background was detected by applying a 15-pixel 3D median filter and then subtracted from the stacks. The stacks were then segmented by first detecting the seeds points using the maximum local filter and then applying the 3D spot segmentation. Vesicles with a volume smaller than 0.008 µm<sup>3</sup> were considered for the final quantification and their number density was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Live slices</title><p>The spinal cord of lamprey (<italic>n</italic> = 5) was dissected out and embedded in 4% agar dissolved in ice-cooled oxygenated 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered physiological solution containing (in mM): 138 NaCl, 2.1 KCl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 glucose, 2 HEPES, and with pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The agar block containing the spinal cord was glued to a metal plate and transverse slices of the spinal cord (100–150 or 300 µm) were cut on a vibrating microtome. The preparation was continuously perfused with HEPES solution at 4–6°C. Then the spinal cord slice was exposed to HEPES solution with various pH values (7.4, 6.5, and 8.5) for 8–10 min. The slices were then fixed immediately with 4% PFA (somatostatin) or 4% PFA and 1% glutaraldehyde (dopamine and GABA) in 0.01 M PBS overnight at 4°C. Following a thorough rinse in 0.01 M PBS, the slices (100–150 µm) were incubated with a rat monoclonal anti-somatostatin, a mouse monoclonal anti-GABA, or a mouse monoclonal anti-dopamine antibody overnight at 4°C. The slices were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Patch-clamp recordings</title><p>The spinal cord slices (300 µm) of lamprey (<italic>n</italic> = 5) after slicing were transferred in a cooled recording chamber and allowed to recover at 5°C for 1 hr before recording. Patch electrode was prepared from borosilicate glass microcapillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH) using a two-stage puller (PP830, Narishige, Japan). Patch electrodes (8–12 MΩ) were filled with an intracellular solution of the following composition (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 phosphocreatine sodium salt. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH and osmolarity to 270 mOs ml<sup>−1</sup> with water. Cells ventral to the central canal were recorded in whole-cell in current-clamp mode using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp., CA, USA). Bridge balance and pipette capacitance compensation were adjusted and signals were digitized and recorded using Clampex software and analysed in Clampfit (pCLAMP 10, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The neurons were visualized with DIC/infrared optics (Olympus BX51WI, Tokyo, Japan). Resting membrane potentials were determined in current-clamp mode during whole-cell recording. The following drugs were added to the extracellular solution and applied by bath perfusion: the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (20 mM, Tocris, Ellisville, MO, USA) and the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (2 mM, Tocris, Ellisville, MO, USA). Neurons were intracellularly labelled by injection of 0.5% Neurobiotin (Vector Laboratories) during whole-cell recordings. After recording the spinal cord slices were fixed with 4% formalin. To investigate whether the intracellularly Neurobiotin-labelled CSF-c cells express TH, the slices were incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody and then rinsed thoroughly in 0.01 M PBS and incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) for 3 hr at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Lamprey (<italic>n</italic> = 2) were deeply anesthetized as described above and the rostral spinal cord was removed, fixed in 4% formalin in 0.1 M PB overnight at 4°C, and then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in 0.1 M PB. Then, 10–20 µm thick cryostat sections were made and stored at −80°C until processed. Single-stranded digoxigenin-labelled sense and antisense PKD2L1 riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription of the previously cloned PKD2L1 cDNA using the Digoxigenin RNA Labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, sections were incubated for 1 hr in prehybridization mix (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1% Denhardt’s, 50 g/ml, salmon sperm DNA, 250 g/ml yeast RNA) at 60°C. Sections incubated with the heat-denatured digoxigenin-labelled riboprobe were hybridized overnight at 60°C. Following the hybridization, the sections were rinsed twice in 1× SSC, washed twice in 1× SSC (30 min each) at 60°C and twice in 0.2× SSC at room temperature. After blocking in 0.5% blocking reagent (PerkinElmer), the sections were incubated overnight in anti-DIG antibody coupled to HRP (1:2000, Roche Diagnostics) at 4°C. The probe was then visualized by TSA Cy3 Plus Evaluation Kit (PerkinElmer). The specificity of the hybridization procedure was verified by incubating sections with the sense riboprobe (data not shown). The sections were rinsed thoroughly in 0.01 M PBS and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (1:200, Millipore) overnight at 4°C, rinsed in PBS, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) and 640/660 deep-red fluorescent Nissl stain (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr and mounted with Mowiol.

On the microscopy section, the authors make a statement that DSVs within somatostatin-positive sensory cells are present in the axons at baseline and become more numerous upon pH variations. To illustrate their point, the authors need to show:</p><p>a) Images illustrating that DSVs were found in the axonal extension (page 5, &quot;data not shown&quot;) at baseline, and;</p><p>b) Evidence determining whether DSVs are released or transported from the soma to the axon (Figure 3d-f) upon changes of pH. A quantification of the total number of DSV per cell could be insightful to resolve these 2 interpretations.</p><p>This point is important for interpretation of the mechanisms at play upon variations of pH.</p><p>2. The interpretation of physiological results based on established knowledge of ASICs in lamprey cannot be easily explained, and the authors need to provide further data to support their claims or rephrase their conclusions:</p><p>a) the authors need to show that somatostatin-positive cells respond to pH in their conditions as it is key for their interpretation, and their previous article on all spinal CSF-contacting neurons did not mention that only half the ciliated neurons contacting the CSF responded to pH (Jalalvand et al. Current Biology 2016).</p><p>b) Similarly, the authors here examine the mechanosensory response of dopaminergic CSF-contacting neurons without quantifying the response of somatostatin-positive neurons to the same stimulus. Both responses to variations of pH and mechanical stimulation need to be performed in both cell types.</p><p>c) Another group have shown that lamprey only express one type of ASIC channel, ASIC1 (<italic>not</italic> the channel ASIC3 ): see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047259/). Therefore, how can the authors explain the effect of the drug used against ASIC3 in this context ?</p><p>In order to solve this issue, the authors could show expression of ASIC channels, and test the effect of a drug against ASIC1 on the response of somatostatin-expressing cells.</p><p>d) Finally, the only ASIC channel expressed in lamprey, ASIC1, when cloned and tested, has been reported to be proton insensitive (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1464184/)--how then to explain then the activation of a subset of ciliated neurons exposed to protons?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;ExSTED microscopy reveals contrasting functions of dopamine and somatostatin CSF-c neurons along the lamprey central canal&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>We would like to publish this story in <italic>eLife</italic> but ask you to please make textual changes in response to this reviewer's comments.</p><p>Specific comments from one reviewer:</p><p>The authors satisfactorily answered some of the issues raised on the quantification of images and provided high resolution images for their outstanding data acquired at high resolution. These data are very convincing and beautiful. Congratulations, this will be very precious and inspirational for further studies in the spinal field !</p><p>The issue remaining are related to the interpretation of the physiological results. The authors should either show expression of ASIC3 in CSF-cNs by ISH or tone down their conclusions relative to the ASIC3 receptor in response to pH.</p><p>Similarly the authors should be more careful for stating the role PKD2L1 in pH sensing or mechanoreception as they lack genetic methods to investigate its function in lamprey.</p><p>A) On the role of ASIC3 in pH sensing :</p><p>As stated in my first review, ASIC3 can only be found in the genome of mammals. Only ASIC1 has been identified in the lamprey genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047259) and the lamprey ASIC1a is proton insensitive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1464184/).</p><p>The authors did not respond to my request of testing the role of ASIC1a in their experiments using pharmacology.</p><p>One can therefore wonder whether 2uM APETx2 used by the authors (about 100X the EC50 of ASIC3 homomers, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17113616/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17113616/</ext-link>) could be acting on other targets (see suggested actions on Na or K channels mentioned here, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17113616/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17113616/</ext-link>). Please discussion clearly in the text.</p><p>B) On the role of PKD2L1 in mechanoreception:</p><p>The authors summarize that PKD2L1 is responsible for mechanoreception only in dopaminergic CSF-cNs.</p><p>However:</p><p>1. PKD2L1 is expressed in all CSF-cNs, ventral (dopaminergic) and dorsal (somatostatinergic) as shown by the authors here and found in zebrafish (Djenoune 2014) and mouse (Huang 2006; Petracca 2018). In fact, in their 2016b publication, the authors had proposed that SST+ CSF-cNs were responding to basic pH via PKD2L1, suggesting a role for this channel in these cells.</p><p>Why therefore in this study, only mentioning the role of PKD2L1 for mechanoreception in the dopaminergic CSF-cNs despite the expression being there in both dorsal and ventral cell types?</p><p>2. Due to the lack of specific antagonists, the authors do not have the tools in lamprey to measure its contribution to mechanoreception. They can only suggest that PKD2L1 contribute to mechanoreception in both ventral and dorsal CSF-cN types.</p><p>3. Please correct an error in citation and references used:</p><p>The authors use Bohm et al. 2016 to state that CSF-cNs rely on PKD2L1 to be mechanosensory in zebrafish.</p><p>To be correct, we showed in vivo in Bohm 2016 that both ventral and dorsal CSF-cNs respond to concave (not convex) mechanical deformations of the spinal cord via PKD2L1 (response are abolished in the KO).</p><p>However, mechanoreception cannot be rigorously demonstrated in vivo. It is therefore only in Sternberg 2018 that we could show in vitro using a piezo device to mechanically stimulate their membrane that all CSF-cNs isolated in primary cultures are mechanosensory cells and that their response always rely on PKD2L1.</p><p>Note that in zebrafish, we now understand that CSF-cNs in vitro do not respond to CSF flow (Prendergast et al. under review) and in vivo, their response to concave mechanical bending of the spinal cord needs their interaction with the Reissner fiber (Orts Dell Immagine 2020), which does not alter itself the flow (Cantaut-Belarif 2018).</p><p>The authors should at minima cite Sternberg et al. 2018 for showing the role of PKD2L1 in mechanoreception, but to be fair, also propose with more nuances in the discussion how these cells in lamprey can combine ASIC and PKD channels to sense pH and mechanical inputs, citing Bohm 2016, Sternberg 2018 and Orts Del Immagine 2020.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73114.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, this value refers to how good the response is, which is only one metric to define spatial resolution. When considering biological structures, we agree that the size of the labels indeed matters and influences the resulting ability of resolving and visualizing fine structures. In this work, to be able to tell apart the duplets, we needed at least a resolution of 10-15 nm, which was achieved with ExSTED but not with only STED.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors say &quot;Somatostatin-expressing CSF-c neurons are found throughout the whole volume and located laterally relative to the central canal, while the dopaminergic CSF-c neurons are located ventrally&quot; could the author point that out in figure 1 as I have a hard time visualizing it.</p></disp-quote><p>We added in Figure 1 the annotation for dorsal and ventral to guide the viewer to the geometry of the central canal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1f = Cell number per volume?

Could the authors calculate the expansion factor by measuring cilia diameter in STED and expanded confocal samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a direct check in the sample structure is more sensitive to local change in expansion as well as isotropicity compared to the overall gel especially for the study that precise amount of expansion factor is important. However, to measure the diameter of the same cilia before and after expansion is almost impossible regarding the numerous and packed cilia in the spinal cord samples. In addition to calculating the expansion factor by measuring the size of the sample/gel before and after expansion, we measured the diameter of several cilia (before and after expansion) and calculated the expansion factor by using the means of the diameter from STED and ExSTED. We also made a graph for comparison of cilia diameters (divided by the expansion factor in the expanded one) in the different techniques (the graph added in the Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. On the microscopy section, the authors make a statement that DSVs within somatostatin-positive sensory cells are present in the axons at baseline and become more numerous upon pH variations. To illustrate their point, the authors need to show :</p><p>a) Images illustrating that DSVs were found in the axonal extension (page 5, &quot;data not shown&quot;) at baseline, and;</p></disp-quote><p>Not visible in Figure 2 but in Figure 3 D-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Evidence determining whether DSVs are released or transported from the soma to the axon (Figure 3d-f) upon changes of pH. A quantification of the total number of DSV per cell could be insightful to resolve these 2 interpretations.</p><p>This point is important for interpretation of the mechanisms at play upon variations of pH.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the number density of vesicles per soma area (µm<sup>-2</sup>) (2DSTED) for somatostatin and dopamine DCVs (explained above). We have additionally applied volumetric imaging and quantified the number density of somatostatin and dopamine DCVs within soma volumes (µm<sup>-3</sup>) added in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The interpretation of physiological results based on established knowledge of ASICs in lamprey cannot be easily explained, and the authors need to provide further data to support their claims or rephrase their conclusions:</p><p>a) the authors need to show that somatostatin-positive cells respond to pH in their conditions as it is key for their interpretation, and their previous article on all spinal CSF-contacting neurons did not mention that only half the ciliated neurons contacting the CSF responded to pH (Jalalvand et al. Current Biology 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>The study of Jalalvand et al. 2016 dealt with one specific subtype of CSF-contacting cells that express somatostatin and are located at the lateral aspect of the central canal and has axonal projections to the lateral margin of the spinal cord (see also new Figure 8). It was known from previous studies that another subtype of CSF-contacting neurons in lamprey expressed dopamine (Schotland et al., 1996), in which the cells have a more ventral location. The latter with a previously unknown function has now been included in the present study and a function unravelled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Similarly, the authors here examine the mechanosensory response of dopaminergic CSF-contacting neurons without quantifying the response of somatostatin-positive neurons to the same stimulus. Both responses to variations of pH and mechanical stimulation need to be performed in both cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously reported on the sensitivity of the somatostatin-CSF-contacting neurons (Jalalvand et al. 2016, Nature Communications) specifically showing that they respond to both fluid movements and pH changes, and that both responses are blocked by APETx2, a specific ASIC3 antagonist. Since these responses have been quantified in considerable detail earlier, we feel that there would be no reason to repeat these results in the context of these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Another group have shown that lamprey only express one type of ASIC channel, ASIC1 (not the channel ASIC3 ): see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047259/). Therefore, how can the authors explain the effect of the drug used against ASIC3 in this context ?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that in the article of Coric et al. 2005, they had identified one clone of cDNA that corresponded to ASIC1 and when expressed in oocytes, no pH sensitivity was found. They do not comment regarding the possible presence of ASIC3. The review of Grunder and Chen (2010) has a focus on ASIC1a and base their comment on lamprey on Coric et al. 2005. Our evidence for the presence of ASIC 3 in lamprey is that both the mechanical and pH response are blocked by APETx2 (Jalalvand et al., 2016). ASIC3 is present in both the peripheral and central nervous system in mammals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to solve this issue, the authors could show expression of ASIC channels, and test the effect of a drug against ASIC1 on the response of somatostatin-expressing cells.</p><p>d) Finally, the only ASIC channel expressed in lamprey, ASIC1, when cloned and tested, has been reported to be proton insensitive (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1464184/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1464184/</ext-link>) – how then to explain then the activation of a subset of ciliated neurons exposed to protons?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct (Coric et al. 2005) that the ASIC1 clone extracted from lamprey was not pH sensitive when expressed in frog oocytes, but our data show that the mechanical/pH response in the lamprey somatostatin expressing CSF cells in lamprey is mediated by ASIC3, and there is no evidence to suggest that ASIC3 should not be present in lamprey. The dopamine-containing cells are not pH-sensitive.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Specific comments from one reviewer:</p><p>The authors satisfactorily answered some of the issues raised on the quantification of images and provided high resolution images for their outstanding data acquired at high resolution. These data are very convincing and beautiful. Congratulations, this will be very precious and inspirational for further studies in the spinal field !</p><p>The issue remaining are related to the interpretation of the physiological results. The authors should either show expression of ASIC3 in CSF-cNs by ISH or tone down their conclusions relative to the ASIC3 receptor in response to pH.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded our text on page 8 and 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly the authors should be more careful for stating the role PKD2L1 in pH sensing or mechanoreception as they lack genetic methods to investigate its function in lamprey.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the mechanosensitivity is mediated by an APETx2 sensitive mechanism in somatostatin CSF-c neurons but through another mechanism in the dopamine CSF-c neurons it is natural to point out the possibility of PKDL1, which is responsive in the zebrafish.</p><p>The text on page 8 now reads:</p><p>“As PKD2L1 has been confirmed as a mechanosensitive ion channel in zebrafish (Bohm et al., 2016, Sternberg et al., 2018, Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2020), the results suggest that the mechano-sensitivity of the dopaminergic CSF-c neurons may be mediated by PKD2L1 channels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) On the role of ASIC3 in pH sensing :</p><p>As stated in my first review, ASIC3 can only be found in the genome of mammals. Only ASIC1 has been identified in the lamprey genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047259) and the lamprey ASIC1a is proton insensitive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1464184/).</p><p>The authors did not respond to my request of testing the role of ASIC1a in their experiments using pharmacology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested ASIC1a blockers, since this channel in lamprey is known to not respond to pH (Coric et al. 2005), and ASIC1a is not blocked by APETx2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One can therefore wonder whether 2uM APETx2 used by the authors (about 100X the EC50 of ASIC3 homomers, https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov/17113616/) could be acting on other targets (see suggested actions on Na or K channels mentioned here, https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov/17113616/). Please discuss clearly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We work within the specific dose range as described by Diochot et al. 2004, and the same range as has been used in mammalian dorsal root ganglion cells. We also note that APETx2 blocks (the ASIC3 blocker) the mechanosensitive response in somatostatin cell, whereas it has no effect on the mechanosensitivity of dopamine CSF-c cells. This strongly suggests that the effect of APETx2 is not a general unspecific effect on lamprey neurons.</p><p>We have added (the following text in the Discussion on ine page 13):</p><p>“The mechano-sensitivity of the dopamine and somatostatin expressing CSF-c neurons are mediated by different cellular mechanisms, the latter is blocked by APETx2, a selective ASIC3 blocker as shown in previous studies (E. Jalalvand, B. Robertson, H. Tostivint, et al., 2016; E. Jalalvand, B. Robertson, P. Wallen, et al., 2016). et al. et al. […] The data supports the previous interpretation that ASIC3 mediates both the acid-sensing and the mechanosensitivity in these CSF-c neurons.”</p><p>We also responded previously to this issue in our response:</p><p>In the article of Coric et al. 2005 they had identified one clone of cDNA that corresponded to ASIC1 and when expressed in oocytes, no pH sensitivity was found under these conditions. They do not comment regarding the possible presence of ASIC3. The review of Grunder and Chen (2010) has a focus on ASIC1a and base their comment in lamprey on Coric et al. 2005. Our evidence for the presence of ASIC3 in lamprey is that both the mechanical and pH response are blocked by APETx2, a selective antagonist of ASIC3, (Jalalvand et al. 2016, Nature. Com), strongly suggesting the presence of ASIC3 in the lamprey. ASIC3 is present in both the peripheral and central nervous system in mammals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) On the role of PKD2L1 in mechanoreception:</p><p>The authors summarize that PKD2L1 is responsible for mechanoreception only in dopaminergic CSF-cNs.</p><p>However:</p><p>1. PKD2L1 is expressed in all CSF-cNs, ventral (dopaminergic) and dorsal (somatostatinergic) as shown by the authors here and found in zebrafish (Djenoune 2014) and mouse (Huang 2006; Petracca 2018). In fact, in their 2016b publication, the authors had proposed that SST+ CSF-cNs were responding to basic pH via PKD2L1, suggesting a role for this channel in these cells.</p><p>Why therefore in this study, only mentioning the role of PKD2L1 for mechanoreception in the dopaminergic CSF-cNs despite the expression being there in both dorsal and ventral cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>Our <italic>results</italic> clearly show that there are different cellular mechanisms for the mechanotransduction, one blocked by APETx2 in somatostatin CSF-c cells and not in dopamine CSF-c neurons. Since PKD2L1 is present in the dopamine cells and known to be mediate mechanosensitivity in zebrafish CSF-c cells it is natural to point to this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Due to the lack of specific antagonists, the authors do not have the tools in lamprey to measure its contribution to mechanoreception. They can only suggest that PKD2L1 contribute to mechanoreception in both ventral and dorsal CSF-cN types.</p></disp-quote><p>The mechanosensitive mechanisms in the two types of CSF-c cells, the laterally projecting and ventral CSF-c neurons, in lamprey must be different, given the difference in APETx2 effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please correct an error in citation and references used:</p><p>The authors use Bohm et al. 2016 to state that CSF-cNs rely on PKD2L1 to be mechanosensory in zebrafish.</p><p>To be correct, we showed in vivo in Bohm 2016 that both ventral and dorsal CSF-cNs respond to concave (not convex) mechanical deformations of the spinal cord via PKD2L1 (response are abolished in the KO).</p><p>However, mechanoreception cannot be rigorously demonstrated in vivo. It is therefore only in Sternberg 2018 that we could show in vitro using a piezo device to mechanically stimulate their membrane that all CSF-cNs isolated in primary cultures are mechanosensory cells and that their response always rely on PKD2L1.</p><p>Note that in zebrafish, we now understand that CSF-cNs in vitro do not respond to CSF flow (Prendergast et al. under review) and in vivo, their response to concave mechanical bending of the spinal cord needs their interaction with the Reissner fiber (Orts Dell Immagine 2020), which does not alter itself the flow (Cantaut-Belarif 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>Interesting with the results with Reissner´s fiber – a possibility that has been considered often but without substantial evidence previously, but not citable as yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should at minima cite Sternberg et al. 2018 for showing the role of PKD2L1 in mechanoreception, but to be fair, also propose with more nuances in the discussion how these cells in lamprey can combine ASIC and PKD channels to sense pH and mechanical inputs, citing Bohm 2016, Sternberg 2018 and Orts Del Immagine 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
