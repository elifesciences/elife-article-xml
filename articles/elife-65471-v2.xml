replication occurs when the pairs of Mcm2-7 replicative helicases that license each replication origin are activated. Helicase activation requires the recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS to Mcm2-7, forming Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs). Using single-molecule biochemical assays to monitor CMG formation, we found that Cdc45 and GINS are recruited to loaded Mcm2-7 in two stages. Initially, Cdc45, GINS, and likely additional proteins are recruited to unstructured Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails in a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)-dependent manner, forming Cdc45-tail-GINS intermediates (CtGs). DDK phosphorylation of multiple phosphorylation sites on the Mcm2-7 tails modulates the number of CtGs formed per Mcm2-7. In a second, inefficient event, a subset of CtGs transfer their Cdc45 and GINS components to form CMGs. Importantly, higher CtG multiplicity increases the frequency of CMG formation. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms sensitizing helicase activation to DDK levels with implications for control of replication origin efficiency and timing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>single-molecule studies</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>protein-complex assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM52339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM81648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelles</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Jesus Kim</surname><given-names>Lorraine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multi-step process of helicase activation sensitizes replication initiation to the extent of replicative helicase phosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic DNA replication coordinates the assembly of multi-protein replisomes at origins of replication to ensure complete genome duplication. Replisome assembly begins during G1 phase when two copies of the Mcm2-7 helicase are loaded around origin DNA as a head-to-head double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</xref>). In S phase, the association of helicase-activating factors selects a subset of these helicase double hexamers to initiate DNA unwinding and form the core of a bidirectional pair of replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). Correct temporal control of helicase activation both ensures that the genome is replicated exactly once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Remus and Diffley, 2009</xref>) and reserves a subset of origins to complete replication even if replisomes derived from adjacent origins stall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Helicase activation is the committed step of replication initiation and is controlled during the cell cycle by two kinases: S-CDK and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labib, 2010</xref>). DDK phosphorylates the long unstructured N-terminal tails of Mcm4 and Mcm6 driving the recruitment of Sld3/7 and Cdc45 to Mcm2-7 double hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanemaki and Labib, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Randell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>). S-CDK phosphorylates Sld2 and Sld3/7, leading them to bind to two distinct pairs of BRCT repeats in Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>). These S-CDK-dependent interactions recruit GINS to Sld3/7 associated with loaded Mcm2-7 complexes. Although both Cdc45 and GINS recruitment involve Sld3/7, whether these proteins are recruited by the same or different Sld3/7 molecules is unknown. Cdc45 and GINS are direct activators of the Mcm2-7 complex, and association of these factors with the core structured region of Mcm2-7 is required to form a pair of Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS complexes (CMGs), the active eukaryotic replicative helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pacek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goswami et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, Mcm10 activates CMG complexes to unwind origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Deursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lõoke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). The result of this process is the formation of two oppositely directed, active CMG complexes that generate the ssDNA necessary to recruit the rest of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although clear in broad strokes, multiple elements of CMG formation and helicase activation remain poorly understood. For example, current studies suggest that there are many Sld3-binding sites on the N-terminal tails of Mcm4 and Mcm6, although a specific binding motif has not been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether one or multiple sites are used during a given helicase-activation event is unknown. It is also unclear whether Cdc45 recruitment to the two Mcm2-7 complexes in the double hexamer is concerted. The possibility of coordinated Cdc45 recruitment is raised by evidence suggesting that Sld3 and Sld7 form a heterotetramer that could facilitate simultaneous recruitment of two Cdc45s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itou et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, the levels of DDK and a subset of helicase-activation proteins are known to modulate the timing and efficiency of helicase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). However, the attributes of helicase activation that sensitizes this process to the levels of these proteins are not understood. To answer these questions and investigate the kinetics of the events leading to helicase activation, we developed a single-molecule (SM) method to directly observe this process in real time at a defined origin of replication in vitro.</p><p>SM biochemical techniques are well equipped to address questions of kinetics and stoichiometry during multi-protein complex assembly events like formation of the eukaryotic replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stratmann and van Oijen, 2014</xref>). Previous SM studies have complemented both structural and biochemical studies on helicase loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ticau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Champasa et al., 2019</xref>). Like most complex multi-protein assembly processes, ensemble helicase-activation reactions occur asynchronously due to the large number of protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions required. In addition, these bulk assays are typically performed as end-point assays with limited kinetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>), preventing detection of transient events. In contrast, SM biochemical studies allow post-hoc synchronization of asynchronous events permitting detailed kinetic analysis. In addition, by allowing real-time visualization, SM approaches can detect short-lived protein–protein or protein–DNA interactions and determine precise relative stoichiometries.</p><p>Here, we describe SM biochemical assays for CMG formation and helicase activation that recapitulate previously demonstrated dependence on Sld3/7 and DDK. Initial recruitment of Cdc45 to the Mcm2-7 double hexamer occurs in a stepwise fashion. We observe multiple Cdc45 and GINS proteins binding to individual Mcm2-7 double hexamers. Importantly, DDK levels modulate the number of these binding events and the frequency of final CMG formation. Consistent with these initial binding events being intermediates formed on the DDK-phosphorylated Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails, reducing the number of phosphorylation sites on the Mcm4 and Mcm6 N-terminal tail decreases the number of these intermediates and the efficiency of CMG formation. Importantly, the same phospho-site mutations in the Mcm4 or Mcm6 N-terminal tails reduce replication initiation frequency in vivo. Our findings support a model in which helicase activation is controlled by a combination of DDK-dependent regulation of the multiplicity of initial complexes between Cdc45, GINS, and the Mcm2-7 tails (the CtG complex) and the inefficient conversion of these CtGs to CMG complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An SM assay for CMG formation and DNA unwinding</title><p>We used colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>) to observe the process of eukaryotic CMG formation. This SM approach monitors the colocalization of fluorescently labeled proteins with individual surface-tethered fluorescently labeled DNA molecules to measure protein–DNA binding events. Fluorescent labeling of Mcm2-7, Cdc45, and GINS was accomplished using a SNAP-tag (Mcm2-7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gendreizig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>) or sortase-mediated coupling of fluorescent peptides (GINS, Cdc45, and Mcm2-7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Popp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>, see Materials and methods). These fluorescent tags did not interfere with protein function, as assessed by ensemble CMG-formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To prevent loaded Mcm2-7 complexes from sliding off the template prior to CMG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Remus and Diffley, 2009</xref>), we used a 1.2-kb circular DNA containing a single origin of replication. Comparison of the circular template with a 1.3-kb linear template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ticau et al., 2015</xref>) showed that the circular template exhibited a twofold higher occupancy by Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> at the end of a 20-min SM helicase-loading assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To perform the CMG-formation reaction in an SM format, we executed a series of sequential incubations and monitored protein fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consistent with efficient CMG formation, more than half (0.53 ± 0.04) of the DNAs with loaded Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> complexes were bound to Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> when observed immediately after the HSW2 high-salt wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These binding events were eliminated in the absence of Sld3/7, consistent with Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> recruitment to Mcm2-7 relying on Sld3/7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, when Cdc6 was eliminated from the first step of the reaction to prevent helicase loading, subsequent CMG formation was dramatically reduced (fraction of DNAs bound by Cdc45 was 0.12 ± 0.01 with Cdc6 vs. 0.006 ± 0.006 without, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, CMG formation was dependent on prior helicase loading. In the absence of DDK, high-salt-resistant bound Cdc45 was reduced but not eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We hypothesized that these ‘DDK-independent’ binding events were due to residual DDK phosphorylation present on Mcm2-7 complexes purified from G1-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this idea, phosphatase treatment of Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> prior to helicase loading eliminated CMG formation in the absence of DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed that phosphatase-treated Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> remained functional by sequential treatments with phosphatase and DDK. This sequence of treatments rescued CMG formation both in the SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) settings, demonstrating that the observed CMG formation was fully DDK-dependent.</p><p>To assess the functionality of the CMGs assembled in the SM setting, we asked whether they were able to unwind DNA. To this end, we generated a linear 1.1-kb origin-containing DNA template with a fluorescent dye and a non-fluorescent quencher (BHQ-2) attached to opposing DNA strands at the surface-distal end of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kose et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). DNA unwinding will promote separation of the fluorescent dye-attached strand from the quencher-attached strand, leading to increased dye emission. We simultaneously monitored labeled Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> and unquenching of the DNA-associated fluorophore in the presence of the proteins required for CMG formation and two additional proteins (Mcm10 and replication protein A [RPA]) required for extensive DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with previous in vitro assays that showed only a subset of loaded Mcm2-7 are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>), we observed increased fluorescence for a fraction of DNAs with bound Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> (0.24 ± 0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, elimination of helicase-activating factors (S-CDK, Cdc45, GINS, Dpb11, Pol ε, Sld3/7, RPA, and Mcm10) from the reaction prevented all unquenching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these studies demonstrate that our SM assays for CMG formation and helicase activation exhibit the outcomes and protein dependencies expected based on previous in vivo and ensemble in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanemaki and Labib, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cdc45 binding events to loaded Mcm2-7 are sequential</title><p>We next investigated the protein requirements for recruitment of Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> to the Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>-DNA complex.

We modeled these histogram data as the sum of equally spaced Gaussian peaks representing molecules with zero, one, two, or more bound Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup>. The model assumed independent binding of Cdc45 to multiple identical sites on Mcm2-7 (see Materials and methods). Based on this modeling, we determined the fraction of time a specific number of Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> proteins were bound to DNAs with loaded Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, Ci</xref>). This analysis showed that one Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> was bound to a DNA with an Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> double hexamer 0.222 ± 0.002 of the time and two Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> were bound only 0.079 ± 0.001 of the time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). We also used this analysis to determine the average number of Cdc45 proteins bound to Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>. Taking into consideration our finding that 0.73 ± 0.07 of the Cdc45 protein was labeled (see Materials and methods), we found that, on average, less than one Cdc45 molecule (labeled plus unlabeled) was associated with a loaded Mcm2-7 double hexamer (0.60 ± 0.06, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ci</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that the stepwise increases in Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> fluorescence intensity (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) represented transitions between states with two and four Cdc45 molecules instead of states with one and two molecules. If this were the case, however, we would expect to see a large subset of the bound Cdc45 to show half the fluorescent intensity relative to other events on the same DNA molecule. The reason for this expectation is that only a 0.73 ± 0.07 fraction of the Cdc45 protein is fluorescently labeled. Given this percentage of protein labeling, if the changes in fluorescence intensity were consistently due to simultaneous binding of two Cdc45 molecules, we would expect one of those molecules to be unlabeled 2<italic>P</italic> (1–<italic>P</italic>) = 0.40 of the time, where <italic>P</italic> is the fraction labeled. Given the multiplicity of Cdc45 binding events observed on most DNAs, such a situation would result in two levels of increases in fluorescent intensity in any given trace. Instead, we observed Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> fluorescence-intensity changes that were consistently similar across a given trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). There are some events that might represent dimers of Cdc45 binding (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom, ~900 s), but these are rare and likely to be caused by two individual Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> molecules binding in rapid succession. Thus, we conclude that the multiple Cdc45s binding to Mcm2-7-bound DNA are recruited as monomers in a sequential fashion.</p><p>We then assessed how Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> binding events changed with the addition of the Sld2, Dpb11, Pol ε, GINS, and S-CDK (SDPGC) proteins, all of which are required for CMG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We added these proteins to an otherwise unchanged reaction using 1.3 nM DDK. Fluorescent analysis showed that the addition of the SDPGC proteins lowered the fraction of time that DNA molecules bound by Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> were not associated with Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> (− SDPGC 0.682 ± 0.001; + SDPGC, 0.560 ± 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, rows 1 and 2). Consistent with this change, the average number of Cdc45 proteins (labeled plus unlabeled) on a Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>-bound DNA increased in these conditions (− SDPGC 0.60 ± 0.06; + SDPGC, 0.85 ± 0.08, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ci, ii</xref>).

In contrast to SM experiments lacking the SDPGC proteins that showed no high-salt-resistant Cdc45 binding (0/70), the presence of the SDPGC proteins results in a fraction of loaded Mcm2-7 complexes forming the high-salt-resistant Cdc45 complexes characteristic of CMG formation (0.15 ± 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

At the higher DDK concentration used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (fivefold increase from 1.3 nM to 6.5 nM), the fraction of Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>-bound DNAs that became bound by high-salt-resistant Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> increased from 0.15 ± 0.05 to 0.53 ± 0.04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Because the relative increase in CMG formation was more dramatic between 1.3 nM and 6.5 nM (suggesting we were approaching saturation at 32.5 nM), we focused our subsequent studies on these two DDK concentrations.</p><p>Increased DDK levels led to each Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>-bound DNA interacting with more Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> proteins during the CMG formation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panels). Fluorescence-intensity analysis revealed that elevating DDK levels to 6.5 nM increased the average number of Cdc45 molecules (labeled plus unlabeled) bound to Mcm2-7 by more than twofold (1.0 ± 0.1 vs. 2.5 ± 0.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, compare panels i and ii). This analysis also revealed sometimes four or more Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> molecules bound to an individual Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> double hexamer at 6.5 nM DDK. Importantly, all of the Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> binding events remain Sld3/7-dependent, suggesting that the Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> binding detected requires indirect binding with the Mcm2-7 tails via Sld3/7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ciii</xref>). The fraction of DNAs with Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup> bound at least once by Cdc45 is similar between the 1.3 nM (40 out of 48 molecules, 0.83 ± 0.05) and 6.5 nM (71/87, 0.82 ± 0.06) DDK conditions, indicating that increasing DDK is primarily impacting the number of Cdc45 molecules bound per double hexamer rather than the fraction of double hexamers that are capable of interacting with Cdc45. Finally, we note that although these data give a sense of the multiplicity of Cdc45 proteins bound to Mcm2-7 at a specific time, these binding events are dynamic. Thus, the number of Cdc45 binding events to an Mcm2-7 double hexamer over the course of the reaction is higher.</p><p>The multiplicity of the bound Cdc45 suggests that binding occurs on the Mcm4 and Mcm6 tails rather than the core of the Mcm2-7 complex. The core of each Mcm2-7 molecule is thought to have only one site that directly binds Cdc45 (the site of Cdc45 association in the CMG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goswami et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, there are many Sld3-binding sites on both the Mcm4 and Mcm6 N-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>), each of which could recruit Cdc45. Thus, the appearance of more than two bound Cdc45 molecules indicates that at least a subset (and perhaps most, see below) of the Cdc45 binding events observed under high DDK conditions reflect Cdc45 binding (via Sld3) to the phosphorylated N-terminal tails.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Only a subset of the multiple Mcm2-7-bound Cdc45 proteins form CMGs</title><p>To determine the number of Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> proteins retained after the second high-salt wash (HSW2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we increased the laser intensity and monitored protein fluorescence until all the protein-bound dyes were photobleached. Because photobleaching is stochastic, each photobleaching event indicates the presence of one fluorescently labeled protein. Although our intensity model suggests that a given Mcm2-7 is capable of simultaneously binding four or more Cdc45 molecules during the CMG formation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cii</xref>), we never (0 of 202 examined) observed that more than two Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> proteins remained bound to a Mcm2-7-bound DNA after the HSW2 high-salt wash (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). In principle, it was possible that we undercounted photobleaching events that were not temporally resolved; however, comparison of the rate of photobleaching under these conditions to the time resolution of the experiment indicated that this would be rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The maximum of two high-salt-resistant Cdc45s is consistent with the interpretation that high-salt resistance indicates that the Cdc45s are incorporated into CMGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, although increased DDK leads to more Cdc45 proteins binding simultaneously to each Mcm2-7-bound DNA, at most two are incorporated into the final CMG complexes.</p><p>We frequently observed only one high-salt-stable Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> associated with Mcm2-7-bound DNA, leading us to ask whether CMG formation occurred independently or was coordinated for the two Mcm2-7 complexes present in a loaded double hexamer. If CMG formation was coordinated for the two Mcm2-7 complexes, we would expect most of the high-salt-resistant Cdc45 to occur in pairs. Using the measured fraction labeled of Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> (p=0.73 ± 0.07), we calculated that if CMG formation was coordinated, 0.57 ± 0.09 (<italic>P</italic><sup>2</sup>/{<italic>P</italic><sup>2</sup> + 2<italic>P</italic>(1-<italic>P</italic>)}) of the bound high-salt-resistant Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> should include two labeled Cdc45s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

When the same measurement is performed with 1.3 nM DDK, this fraction drops to 1/7 (0.14 ± 0.13), consistent with lower numbers of bound Cdc45 leading to more frequent formation of a single CMG within the Mcm2-7 double hexamer.

DDK is known to exhibit stable binding to Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd Wahab and Remus, 2020</xref>), and an extreme model predicts that when DDK binds to Mcm2-7 this interaction leads to complete Mcm4- and Mcm6-tail phosphorylation. If this was the case, then DDK concentration would only modulate the fraction of Mcm2-7 complexes being completely phosphorylated, not the number of phosphates per Mcm2-7 tail. To investigate these possibilities, we exposed loaded Mcm2-7 complexes to increasing concentrations of DDK and monitored the extent of phosphorylation of Mcm6 using Phos-tag gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Changes in the mobility of Mcm6 indicated a distribution of numbers of phosphates, arguing against the latter model in which only complete tail phosphorylation occurs. Instead, as DDK concentration increases we see evidence for both increasing numbers of phosphates on the Mcm6 protein and a higher fraction of the molecules being modified. A similar experiment with the Mcm4 tail alone also showed elevated numbers of phosphorylation events when DDK concentration was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These findings are consistent with DDK concentration regulating the number of Cdc45 binding through modulation of the number of Mcm4- and Mcm6-tail phosphorylation events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cdc45-dependent binding of multiple GINS to Mcm2-7</title><p>To investigate the incorporation of GINS into CMGs, we performed an SM assay for CMG formation in which GINS was fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Several observations indicated that labeled GINS was being incorporated into CMGs. First, we observed Mcm2-7-bound DNAs interacting with high-salt-resistant GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As we saw with Cdc45, the fraction of Mcm2-7-DNAs that bound to GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> increased when the concentration of DDK was raised from 1.3 to 6.5 nM (0.19 ± 0.04 vs. 0.72 ± 0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, we never observed more than two high-salt-stable GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> after HSW2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and it is unlikely that we missed additional binding events due to simultaneous photobleaching of two GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, elimination of proteins implicated in CMG formation interfered with high-salt-resistant GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> binding. Current models of CMG formation indicate that GINS recruitment requires S-CDK-phosphorylation-mediated interactions between Sld3, Dpb11, and Sld2. Consistent with this model, we observed a complete loss of high-salt-resistant GINS associations in the absence of Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, elimination of Cdc45 (0.09 ± 0.03) or Sld3/7 (0.07 ± 0.02) from the assay resulted in an eightfold to tenfold reduction in high-salt-resistant GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> bound to Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549</sup>-bound DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Because GINS is thought to be recruited to Mcm2-7 by indirect interactions (via Dpb11 and Sld2) with S-CDK-phosphorylated Sld3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>), it was possible that we would observe the same DDK-phosphorylation-controlled multiplicity of GINS complexes binding to loaded Mcm2-7 that we observed for Cdc45. Alternatively, GINS recruitment could require interactions with the structured regions of Mcm2-7 involved in CMG formation. In that case, we would not observe more than two GINS bound. Consistent with the first model, increasing DDK levels led to the detection of elevated numbers of GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> binding to Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549</sup>-bound DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At 1.3 nM DDK, fluorescence-intensity analysis revealed primarily two or fewer GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> molecules binding to a loaded Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549</sup> double hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, Ci</xref>). Taking into account the fraction labeled of GINS (0.71 ± 0.07), this analysis indicated an average of 1.8 ± 0.2 total GINS molecules (labeled plus unlabeled) bound per Mcm2-7-bound DNA. In contrast, at 6.5 nM DDK, five or more GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> complexes could bind to an Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549</sup>-DNA complex with an average of 4.3 ± 0.4 GINS (labeled plus unlabeled) per Mcm2-7-bound DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cii</xref>). This average number of bound GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> is inconsistent with a model where all GINS interactions take place at the two GINS binding sites involved in CMG formation present in a double hexamer. As with Cdc45, the fraction of DNAs with Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549</sup> that bound GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> at least once was similar for 1.3 nM (76/84, 0.90 ± 0.04) and 6.5 nM (54/57, 0.95 ± 0.03). Because almost all complexes bound GINS under both conditions, the impact of DDK on CMG formation is due to increased numbers of GINS bound per Mcm2-7 double hexamer.</p><p>The ability of the SM CMG formation assay to detect association of GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> with Mcm2-7-bound DNA in real time allowed us to test the role of different proteins in initial recruitment of GINS. As expected, if these interactions occur only on Mcm2-7-bound DNA, we observed a dramatic reduction in GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> binding events for DNAs that were not associated with a labeled Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with models indicating a protein interaction network between Sld3, Dpb11, Sld2 recruits GINS to Mcm2-7, we found that elimination of Dpb11 dramatically reduces the frequency and multiplicity of GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> binding to Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also asked if Cdc45 functioned during initial GINS association. It was possible that distinct Mcm2-7-bound Sld3 molecules recruit GINS and Cdc45, and they only come together later in CMG formation. Alternatively, GINS recruitment could require Sld3/7 to be bound to Cdc45. To distinguish between these models, we assessed GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> binding events during CMG formation in the absence of Cdc45 or Sld3/7. Elimination of either protein resulted in similar reductions in the numbers of Mcm2-7-bound GINS during CMG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare panels iii and iv). Elimination of either Cdc45 (1.1 ± 0.1) or Sld3/7 (0.7 ± 0.07) resulted in a fourfold reduction in the average number of GINS (labeled plus unlabeled) per Mcm2-7-bound DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ciii, iv</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the initial binding of GINS requires both Sld3/7 and Cdc45 and that the recruitment of GINS and Cdc45 occurs via the same Sld3/7 molecules. Importantly, we also see a consistent correlation between the multiplicity of GINS<sup>SORT649</sup> binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and the frequency that these events are converted into CMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Reducing DDK-dependent phosphorylation sites decreases CMG formation</title><p>Together, our data support a model in which complexes including both Cdc45 and GINS (and likely other proteins, see Discussion) form at multiple sites on the DDK-phosphorylated Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails. We refer to these complexes as Cdc45-tail-GINS (CtG) complexes. Our data also suggests that elevating the multiplicity of CtGs formation increases the probability of CMG formation. Based on these observations, we propose that the conversion of CtGs into CMG complexes is inefficient with multiple CtGs releasing prior to successful CMG formation.</p><p>To test the model that the multiple associations of Cdc45 involve interactions with DDK-phosphorylated Mcm4 and Mcm6, we purified and fluorescently labeled Mcm2-7 complexes with fewer DDK phosphorylation sites on either the Mcm6 (Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549-6AD/E+ASP/Q</sup>) or Mcm4 (Mcm2-7<sup>2SORT549-4AD/E+ASP/Q</sup>) N-terminal tails.

Interestingly, the impact of the Mcm6 tail deletion (0.04 ± 0.02) was substantially larger than that of the Mcm6 phosphorylation mutant. This observation suggests that either the deletion eliminates additional phosphorylation sites that impact CMG formation or that there are other functions beyond CtG formation performed by the Mcm6 N-terminal tail during helicase activation (see Discussion). Together, these data are consistent with the multiple DDK phosphorylation sites on the Mcm4 and Mcm6 N-terminal tails being an important element in the response of the helicase activation to DDK levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Loss of the Mcm6 N-terminal tail reduces Cdc45 binding events and Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reduction of Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)-dependent phosphorylation sites on either Mcm6 or Mcm4 and deletion of the Mcm6 N-terminal tail reduced high-salt-stable Cdc45 binding to Mcm2-7-bound DNAs, indicative of CMG formation.

We found that DDK levels modulate the number of these intermediates formed per loaded Mcm2-7 complex and that only a subset of CtGs transition to a CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

These modifications indirectly (via Sld3/7) recruit Cdc45 and GINS, forming the Cdc45-tail-GINS (CtG) intermediate. The CtG intermediate can then follow one of two paths: (i) dissociation or (ii) deposition onto the structured core of the Mcm2-7 helicase to form the CMG. We hypothesize that the rate of this conversion is the same for any CtG, but it is infrequent. Thus, having more CtGs (e.g., at higher DDK levels) increases the probability of CMG formation, which we assume is irreversible.

Binding of Sld3 to the DDK-dependent phosphorylation sites is required for the recruitment of Cdc45 to the Mcm2-7 double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>). It was not clear, however, whether Sld3/7 recruited Cdc45 and GINS independently or as part of a single complex, how these interactions led to subsequent CMG formation, or how the many potential binding sites for Sld3/7 on Mcm4 and Mcm6 tails contributed.</p><p>Here, we present evidence that the initial recruitment of GINS and Cdc45 involves formation of a multi-protein complex with the Mcm2-7 N-terminal tails. First, there are only two non-tail binding sites on each Mcm2-7 double hexamer for Cdc45 or GINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goswami et al., 2018</xref>), and yet we see more than two of these proteins bound during CMG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, binding of Cdc45 and GINS is strongly dependent on both DDK and Sld3/7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because the Mcm4 and Mcm6 N-terminal tails are the targets of DDK and Sld3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Randell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>), this dependence is consistent with initial binding of Cdc45 and GINS at these sites. Third, the dwell time distributions of Cdc45 associations at high or low DDK levels are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), arguing that the increased multiplicity of Cdc45 binding is not due to a distinct mechanism of Cdc45 binding at high DDK levels. Fourth, eliminating DDK-phosphorylation sites on either the Mcm4 or Mcm6 N-terminal tail greatly reduces CtG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, the strong dependence of GINS recruitment on the presence of Cdc45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and the increased frequency of Cdc45 binding events in the presence of GINS and its associated factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is consistent with a simple mechanism in which these proteins are recruited sequentially to the tails to form a single complex rather than binding to the tails at independent positions.</p><p>Our evidence also supports the CtG being an intermediate on the way to CMG formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, elimination of factors that promote CtG formation (e.g., DDK and Sld3/7) also inhibits CMG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, elimination of a subset of CtG binding sites by eliminating Mcm4 or Mcm6 DDK-phosphorylation or deleting the Mcm6 N-terminal tail results in a strong reduction in CMG formation that correlates with the effects on CtG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, throughout our studies we observe a consistent correlation between the multiplicity of CtG formation on a Mcm2-7 double hexamer and the efficiency of subsequent CMG formation.</p><p>We note that the impact of deleting the Mcm6 N-terminus on both CtG and CMG formation is larger than that observed for a mutation that merely eliminates DDK phosphorylation sites on Mcm6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that there are additional non-DDK-dependent phosphorylation sites in Mcm6 that are contributing to CtG and CMG formation, and their elimination by the deletion further reduces the formation of these complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This model is consistent with the previous observation that not all Sld3 phosphopeptide-binding sites are canonical DDK-phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that such sites explain how cells survive without DDK in the context of certain Mcm2-7 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sclafani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>). It is also possible that forming CtGs on both the Mcm4 and Mcm6 N-terminal tails, rather than only on the Mcm4 tail, is advantageous for CMG formation. A second possibility is that there is an additional function of the Mcm6 tail that contributes to CMG formation. For example, the Mcm6 N-terminal tail could facilitate the CtG to CMG transition. We note, however, that such functions cannot be essential since the Mcm6 N-terminal deletion is not lethal in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Champasa et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What are the components of the CtG?</title><p>Although our findings indicate that the CtG minimally includes Cdc45 and GINS bound to Mcm6 and Mcm4 N-terminal tails, this complex is likely to contain other proteins involved in CMG formation. The robust Sld3/7 dependence of Cdc45 and GINS binding to Mcm2-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that the CtG includes this protein. A network of interactions between Sld3, Dpb11, Sld2, and GINS is required to form the CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>). Given Sld3’s known binding to phosphorylated N-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>), the simplest model is that these interacting proteins are required to form CtGs, and subsequently CMGs. Consistent with this model, we observe nearly a complete loss of CtG formation in the absence of Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, it is possible that Pol ε is simultaneously recruited with GINS to the CtG as part of a preformed pre-LC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muramatsu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The full set of roles performed by Sld3, Dpb11, Sld2, and Pol ε in CtG and CMG formation remains to be determined. These proteins could be involved only in CtG assembly or their release could facilitate the transition of Cdc45 and GINS binding with the Mcm2-7 tails to form the final interactions characteristic of the CMG. We note that in our experiments eliminating Sld3/7, Cdc45, or Dpb11, we see stronger effects of Dpb11 elimination than the other two proteins on GINS associations before and after a high-salt wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). One interesting explanation for this distinction is that Dpb11 (and perhaps Sld2 and Pol ε) allows GINS to interact with loaded Mcm2-7 at a low level independently of Cdc45 and Sld3/7. Given that Sld3/7 is the only protein involved in CMG formation known to interact with the Mcm4 and Mcm6 phosphorylated tails, this GINS interaction is more likely to be with the Mcm2-7 site involved in CMG formation. Consistent with this idea, we never observed more than two GINS binding events in the absence of Dpb11. Such a function would suggest a role for Dpb11 in establishing interactions with the core of the Mcm2-7 complex during the CtG to CMG transition. Finally, the requirement of Cdc45 to recruit GINS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ciii</xref>) strongly suggests that the CtG involves direct interactions between these proteins, suggesting the interesting possibility that key interactions between these proteins involved in the CMG are already present in the CtG.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DDK effects are mediated by inefficient CtG to CMG conversion</title><p>Our studies indicate that the conversion from CtG to CMG is inefficient. With low DDK levels, we often observed two Cdc45 proteins that associated with Mcm2-7 double hexamers over long periods of time (&gt;100 s; 33 long-lived binding events/48 double hexamers). However, only 7 of these 33 converted to CMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that most of the CtGs either dissociate or fail to become part of the CMG before the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, top). We hypothesize that this inefficient conversion is true at all DDK concentrations. When DDK concentration was raised, we observed increased multiplicity of CtG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, increased DDK is not associated with a significant change in dwell times of individual Cdc45 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or the fraction of Mcm2-7 double hexamers bound by Cdc45 or GINS. Based on these findings, we propose that, due to the inefficient conversion of CtGs to CMGs, the increased multiplicity of CtGs on a given double hexamer at higher DDK levels leads to increased opportunities for CtG conversion to CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom) and, therefore, increased rates of origin activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for the control of cellular origin activation</title><p>Our model is consistent with studies addressing the control of origin initiation efficiency and replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). These studies showed that increasing the expression of a subset of limiting helicase-activation proteins, including the Dbf4 regulatory subunit of DDK, increased origin initiation efficiency and advanced the time of replication initiation for late initiating origins. Our findings suggest that these changes would increase the number of CtGs formed per double hexamer and consequently the efficiency of CMG formation. We propose that the combination of multiple potential phosphorylation sites on the Mcm4 and Mcm6 tails, and the inefficient conversion of the CtGs formed on the tails to the CMG, tunes the helicase-activation process to respond to levels of DDK and other helicase-activation factors. Consistent with this model, reducing the number of phosphorylation sites on Mcm4 and Mcm6 or deleting the Mcm6 tail reduced CtG and CMG formation at the same DDK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, we see that the same mutations independently reduce origin initiation efficiency in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that reducing the ability to form CtGs recalibrates the response of origins of replication to DDK levels. In the future, it will be of interest to investigate how the levels of DDK and other helicase-activating factors can impact replication origin efficiency in vivo when the Mcm4 and Mcm6 tails are altered.</p><p>Our proposed mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is analogous to the regulation of Sic1 proteolysis by CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nash et al., 2001</xref>). Multiple CDK phosphorylation sites on Sic1 are each weakly recognized by the Cdc4 F-box protein, leading to ubiquitinylation and degradation of Sic1. Although weakly bound, the accumulation of multiple phosphorylation sites on Sic1 promotes a switch-like response to CDK levels. We propose that the similar mechanisms are operating during helicase activation, with the Mcm4 and Mcm6 tails providing the multiple phosphorylation-dependent binding sites and the inefficient conversion of the CtG to the CMG performing the role analogous to the suboptimal Cdc4 interaction.</p><p>Processes beyond those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> are likely to play important roles in origin activation. For example, our experiments did not include phosphatases that could counteract the action of DDK and CDK. Such phosphatases might be recruited by Rif1, a protein that interacts with protein phosphatase 1 and has been implicated in the regulation of replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hafner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiraga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of phosphatases could regulate Mcm2-7 N-terminal tail phosphorylation levels, further sensitizing origin activation to changes in DDK level. In addition, phosphatases may be essential to remove Mcm2-7-tail phosphorylation after helicase activation to ensure that the tails of active helicases do not continue to compete for limiting helicase-activation factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">yCKR006</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>MATa ade2-1 can1-100 pep4Δ</italic>(unmarked) <italic>bar1Δ</italic>(unmarked) <italic>HIS3</italic>::pSKM004 (<italic>GAL1,10-MCM2</italic>,<italic>Flag-MCM3</italic>), <italic>URA3</italic>::pALS1 (<italic>GAL1,10-CDT1</italic>, <italic>GAL4</italic>), <italic>LYS2</italic>::pST022 (GAL1,10-MCM4-SNAP, MCM5), <italic>TRP1</italic>::pCKR006 (<italic>GAL1,10-MCM6-N-termΔ, MCM7</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP-6ΔN</sup> expression strain.

After 1 hr, cell growth and replication were terminated by adding sodium azide (0.1% final concentration) to the samples. For DNA extraction, cells were washed once with MilliQ water (supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide), followed by degradation of cell walls by zymolyase 20T (Sunrise Science Products) (100 μg/mL final concentration) in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 M Sorbitol, 0.1% 2-mecaptoethanol, and 0.1% sodium azide 1 hr at 30°C.

Following RNA degradation, Proteinase K (Amresco) was added to the lysate at 50 μg/mL final concentration and incubated for an additional hour at 65°C. Finally, samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and residual phenol was removed by an additional chloroform extraction.

Only uniquely mapping reads were used for analysis. To normalize the data, count per kilobase million (cpm) value was calculated for each base as (read count for base/all reads) × 10<sup>3</sup> (kilobase) × 10<sup>6</sup> (million). This value was next scaled by dividing it with the lower 10% quantile (non-replicating areas of the genome) for each barcode to obtain the scaled cpm (s-cpm) value. The s-cpm value was smoothed using one-dimensional Gaussian filter with a sigma value of 1000 and plotted for every bp on chromosome X. To plot the averaged s-cpm values for all annotated replication origins, replication origin positions were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/">https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link> using InterMine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2012</xref>).

The number of GINS and Cdc45 is determined by DDK phosphorylation of the MCM's and the probability to create an active helicase (CMG) is increased with multiple numbers of the bound ancillary factors. Furthermore the key issues raised by the reviewers have been adequately dealt with in this revision. The single molecule studies and biochemistry are beautifully executed providing the evidence for such intermediates. We agree that the addition of in vivo studies demonstrates that modulating the multiplicity of DDK phosphorylation (and proposed, CtG formation) has an impact on origin usage in cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DDK regulates replication initiation by controlling the multiplicity of Cdc45-GINS binding to Mcm2-7&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael R Botchan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dirk Remus (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>All of the reviewers concurred that the manuscript provides important new data and hope that the comments below will help in improving the paper before publication.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>De Jesus-Kim and colleagues use co-localization single-molecule spectroscopy to study the formation of the CMG replicative holo-helicase at replication origins using purified proteins. They identify a new intermediate (CtG, Cdc45-tail-GINS). This intermediate is en route to CMG formation and includes Cdc45 and GINS, which are recruited by the N-terminal tails of Mcm4 and Mcm6, in a process that depends on phosphorylation by DDK. It is established that multiple phospho-sites exist both in N-Mcm4 and N-Mcm6. The authors find that the degree of phosphorylation controls the number of Cdc45 and GINS molecules that can be recruited onto a loaded MCM at any one time. Furthermore, the authors find that the transition from CtG to CMG is inefficient, however, CtGs that contain a higher number of Cdc45 and GINS particles convert to CMG more frequently. This is an elegant, technically sound study that informs the mechanism of eukaryotic origin activation and will be of interest to a broad readership.</p><p>The three reviewers all have suggestions for your consideration in the revisions. However, we feel that the following are the issues that must be addressed either by further text revisions or experiments:</p><p>1) The Abstract is difficult to understand and perhaps misleading, especially for those outside the field. The actual protein composition of the CtGs is not known from the data and the authors are of course clear about this in the manuscript. The Abstract should clarify this.</p><p>2) Understood that the deletion of the Mcm 4 &quot;tail&quot; is lethal but is that also true in their system? Would that deletion with a wt Mcm6 lead to a more dramatic loss in the measures used?</p><p>3) Figure 1B. Can the authors explain why the number of molecules observed in DDK/Sld3/lambda PP is &gt;13 fold lower than n in DDK/Sld3?</p><p>4) Figure 2. In panel A the intensities fluctuation is high, suggesting that up to four Cdc45 molecules bind at a time. Conversely, when SDPGC is present variation is greatly reduced and only up to 1 or 2 molecules of Cdc45 bind. Do SDPGC prevent non-specific interactions? This could be discussed.</p><p>5) Do the authors only analyse loaded MCM molecules that are double-hexameric? See the representative photobleaching curve in Figure 2A. Can the authors explain whether or not only particles that contain 2 fluorescently labelled MCM complexes are included in the analysis?</p><p>6) Have the authors attempted to omit Mcm10 from the CMG formation assay? And could they observe any change in dye emission?</p><p>7) In the subsection “Only a subset of the multiple Mcm2-7-bound Cdc45 proteins form CMGs”, the authors conclude that the two CMGs can assemble independently at each MCM DH. The statistical data for this conclusion are not convincing. Can the authors exclude that the 41% observed vs. 57% expected MCM DHs with two salt-resistant labeled Cdc45 molecules is not due to an error in the estimation of the Cdc45 labeling efficiency? Also, in the case of 1.3 nM DDK only 7 molecules were analyzed, which seems too low a number to support any statistically significant conclusion. As the question of coordination between CMG assembly at the MCM DH is mechanistically very important, the authors may want to consider to tone down the conclusion that CMGs can assembly independently or provide additional data in support of their conclusion.</p><p>8) The authors demonstrate that GINS binding to MCMs is dependent on Sld3/7 and Cdc45. Is GINS binding dependent on Sld2, Dpb11, Pol-epsilon, and CDK as well? Does elimination of any one of these factors differentially affect GINS recruitment and CMG formation? This could point to the mechanism of CtG to CMG transformation. The authors are well-positioned to address this question and may have done so already.</p><p>9) Figure 4—figure supplement 2B: How was this experiment performed.

Instead, we have provided a new set of experiments that we believe are a better test of our model that reducing the multiplicity of CtG formation reduces CMG formation. We have produced labeled Mcm2-‑7 complexes with mutations eliminating DDK phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal tails of either Mcm4 or Mcm6. We have tested these mutant proteins in the single-molecule assay for Cdc45 association and CMG formation (modified Figure 6). Importantly, for both mutants we observe a corresponding reduction in both CMG formation and the multiplicity of Cdc45 association.</p><p>Although the Mcm4 and Mcm6 phosphorylation mutations we tested are known to impact cell viability from previous studies (Randell et al., 2010), they had not been tested for their impact on replication origin function. To address this possibility, we measured initiation efficiency in vivo from early initiating origins of replication using strains containing these Mcm2-7 variants (new Figure 7). Importantly, we find that these mutations reduce origin replication efficiency in a manner that reflects their impact on CMG formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1B. Can the authors explain why the number of molecules observed in DDK/Sld3/lambda PP is &gt;13 fold lower than n in DDK/Sld3?</p></disp-quote><p>Two aspects of the experiments contribute to this difference. First, the experiments that did not involve lambda PP report the results of several experiments that were combined, increasing n values. The experiments with DDK are the results of a single experimental repetition (we now indicate the number of contributing experiments in the legend for Figure 1B). Second, the manipulations required to dephosphorylate and phosphorylate the Mcm2-7 complexes led to less efficient Mcm2-7 loading in the lambda phosphatase experiments. Although we initially thought that dephosphorylation of Mcm2-7 might reduce its ability to be loaded onto origin DNA, subsequent experiments using ensemble assays showed no difference in loading of dephosphorylated Mcm2-7 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Importantly, although the n values are lower in these experiments, the differences that we emphasize are clearly statistically significant.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Lambda phosphatase (λPP) does not affect Mcm2-7 loading.</title><p>Ensemble Mcm2-7 loading assays were conducted in the presence and absence of λPP.

Conversely, when SDPGC is present variation is greatly reduced and only up to 1 or 2 molecules of Cdc45 bind. Do SDPGC prevent non-specific interactions? This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2C shows that when the complete sets of experimental records are analyzed, essentially all Mcm2-7-bound DNAs have either zero, one, or two dye-labeled Cdc45 molecules bound at any given point in time. This is the case whether or not the SDPGC proteins are present; including those proteins caused only a minor increase in the fraction of ones and two and a corresponding minor decrease in the faction of zeros. The two Cdc45 fluorescence records chosen as examples (in Figure 2A and B) are both good illustrations of these features of the complete set of DNA records.</p><p>The reviewer correctly perceives that the Cdc45 intensity in Figure 2A reaches higher values than those in 2B, but the difference in peak intensity is not caused by a difference in the <italic>number</italic> of dye-labeled Cdc45 molecules bound -- that number is zero, one, or two at nearly all time points in both records. Instead, inspection of the records reveals that the difference is in the <italic>sizes</italic> of the stepwise increases/decreases in fluorescence intensity corresponding to binding/dissociation of a single dye molecule (examples of these steps are marked by arrows in the figures.) This unitary step size is ~20,000 in Figure 2A but only ~10,000 in Figure 2B. In these experiments, such random variation in step size from one DNA to the next is often observed, even between different DNA molecules in the same experimental sample (for example, compare the first and third plots in Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and on average the step size is not appreciably larger in the –SDPGC sample than in the + SDPGC sample (~13,000 vs. ~11,000; see the <italic>s</italic> parameter in rows 1 and 2 of Supplementary file 1A). Thus, the difference noted by the reviewer is a property of the two example records chosen but not of the dataset as a whole, the properties of which are displayed in Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Do the authors only analyse loaded MCM molecules that are double-hexameric? See the representative photobleaching curve in Figure 2A. Can the authors explain whether or not only particles that contain 2 fluorescently labelled MCM complexes are included in the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>All of the experiments include a high-salt wash after the DDK phosphorylation step to ensure that only loaded Mcm2-7 molecules are involved in the helicase activation reaction (the presence of CDK during the activation step also ensures that no new loading is occurring at this stage). This results in the majority of the Mcm2-7 complexes that are present during the helicase activation portion of the reaction being double hexamers (Ticau et al., 2015). We note that the traces in 2A and 2B (for Mcm2-7) show evidence for two fluorescent molecules (one that photobleaches during the observations and the second that does not) and these records were chosen because this pattern of photobleaching of Mcm2-7 was the most common. Because of incomplete labeling of Mcm2-7 (we measured labeling of Mcm2-7 to be 74 ± 5% for Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>), we expect to see a subset of loaded Mcm2-7 complexes to have only one of the two Mcm2-7 double hexamers to be labeled. For that reason, we chose to analyze all the molecules that contain a detectable Mcm2-7. In rare cases neither Mcm2-7 will be labeled and this situation likely explains GINS associations that occur in the absence of a labeled Mcm2‑7 (e.g. Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Because it was possible that loaded single Mcm2-7 molecules contribute to our findings, we have analyzed a set of molecules from the high DDK Cdc45 loading that we can definitively say are double-hexamers based on fluorescent intensity records and compared them to the analysis shown in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This represents 51% of the total DNA molecules with associated Mcm2-7. We find that we observe the same distribution of Cdc45 binding under these conditions consistent with the inclusion of all the Mcm2-7 associated molecules in our analysis throughout the paper.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cdc45 binding distribution is unchanged when using an Mcm2-7 double-hexamer (DH) selection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cdc45<sup>SORT649</sup> fluorescence<bold>-</bold>intensity histograms for all detectable Mcm2-7<sup>4SNAP549</sup>.

And could they observe any change in dye emission?</p></disp-quote><p>The only experiments in the paper that include Mcm10 are the helicase activity experiments shown in Figure 1C and D. As indicated by the illustrations of the order of protein addition provided with each new reaction we present, all of the CMG formation assays were performed in the absence of Mcm10 and RPA to focus on the CMG formation rather than the actively unwinding CMG. Although it will be interesting to develop assays to monitor the changes to Mcm2-7, GINS, or Cdc45 in the future, such experiments are beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the subsection “Only a subset of the multiple Mcm2-7-bound Cdc45 proteins form CMGs”, the authors conclude that the two CMGs can assemble independently at each MCM DH.

As the question of coordination between CMG assembly at the MCM DH is mechanistically very important, the authors may want to consider to tone down the conclusion that CMGs can assembly independently or provide additional data in support of their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important mechanistic point. The Cdc45 fraction labeled is measured in a single-molecule experiment (see Materials and methods) in which we believe the dominant source of uncertainty to be the counting statistics, rather than any systematic error in the measurement. The statistical error in the measurement of the labeling efficiency is included in the standard errors reported for the fraction of labeled complexes (0.57 ± 0.09) predicted if all complexes have two salt-stable Cdc45 molecules. This differs significantly from the observed fraction of labeled complexes (0.41 ± 0.05) in the 6.5 nM DDK experiment. In the 1.3 nM DDK experiment the uncertainty due to the small number of observations is quantified by the large relative standard error in the measurement (0.14 ± 0.13). Despite this, it is unambiguous that this number is significantly different from the 0.57 ± 0.09 predicted for the coordinated mechanism.</p><p>While we agree that these data are not definitive evidence for an uncoordinated model, we do think they are strong enough to merit description and discussion. We believe our current wording reflects the lack of definitive evidence: “These findings <italic>suggest</italic> that CMG formation on the two Mcm2-7 complexes in each double hexamer <italic>can</italic> occur independently.” If the reviewers feel strongly, we could consider an alternate wording such as: “These data are consistent with a model in which CMG formation on the two Mcm2-7 complexes in each double hexamer can occur independently.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors demonstrate that GINS binding to MCMs is dependent on Sld3/7 and Cdc45. Is GINS binding dependent on Sld2, Dpb11, Pol-epsilon, and CDK as well? Does elimination of any one of these factors differentially affect GINS recruitment and CMG formation? This could point to the mechanism of CtG to CMG transformation. The authors are well-positioned to address this question and may have done so already.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional experiment along these lines. We have assessed the impact of eliminating Dpb11 (Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 2) on GINS binding events. Consistent with a role of Dpb11 in GINS initial Mcm2-7 recruitment, we observe nearly a complete loss of GINS binding in the absence of this protein. Interestingly, we observe a much stronger effect of Dpb11 elimination on GINS binding events than we observe for elimination of Cdc45 or Sld3/7. We have added a brief discussion as to why this might be the case (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4—figure supplement 2B: How was this experiment performed. The text states that protein was stained with Krypton protein stain. Where are the other MCM subunits then? Or was this experiment performed with isolated Mcm4 tail? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity regarding this experiment. Although the experiment looking at Mcm6 was done with the complete Mcm2-7 complex, the experiment with Mcm4 was performed with the tail of Mcm4 expressed in the absence of the rest of the Mcm2-7 complex. We have clarified this distinction in the text, in the legend of Figure 4—figure supplement 2, and in the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
