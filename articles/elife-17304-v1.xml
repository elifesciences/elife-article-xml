Amongst a multitude of remodeling events, reduced expression of the ion channel subunit KChIP2 is consistently observed in numerous cardiac pathologies. However, it remains unknown if KChIP2 loss is merely a symptom or involved in disease development. Using rat and human derived cardiomyocytes, we identify a previously unobserved transcriptional capacity for cardiac KChIP2 critical in maintaining electrical stability. Through interaction with genetic elements, KChIP2 transcriptionally repressed the miRNAs miR-34b and miR-34c, which subsequently targeted key depolarizing (<italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>) and repolarizing (<italic>I</italic><sub>to</sub>) currents altered in cardiac disease. Genetically maintaining KChIP2 expression or inhibiting miR-34 under pathologic conditions restored channel function and moreover, prevented the incidence of reentrant arrhythmias. This identifies the KChIP2/miR-34 axis as a central regulator in developing electrical dysfunction and reveals miR-34 as a therapeutic target for treating arrhythmogenesis in heart disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17304.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17304.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17304.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart pumps blood throughout the body to provide oxygen and nourishment. To do so, proteins in the heart create electrical signals that tell the heart muscles to contract in a coordinated manner. Heart disease can cause cells to lose control of the production or activity of these proteins, creating disorganized electrical signals called arrhythmias that interfere with the heart’s ability to pump. Sometimes these arrhythmias lead to sudden death.</p><p>Researchers do not know exactly what triggers these changes in the heart’s normal electrical rhythms. This has made it difficult to develop strategies to prevent these disruptions or to fix them when they occur.</p><p>By studying rat and human heart cells, Nassal et al. now show that a protein called KChIP2 stops working properly during heart disease. Most importantly, because of the decreased level of KChIP2 in heart disease, KChIP2 loses the ability to restrict the production of two microRNA molecules – a role that KChIP2 was not previously known to perform. This loss of activity sets off a cascade of signals that worsens the balance of electrical activity in the heart cells, creating arrhythmias.</p><p>Treatments that restored proper levels of the fully working KChIP2 protein to the heart cells or that blocked the signals set off by a lack of KChIP2 returned the electrical activity of the cells back to normal. This also stopped the development of arrhythmias. Further studies are now needed to investigate whether these treatments have the same effects in living mammals. If effective, this could ultimately lead to new treatments for heart diseases and arrhythmias.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17304.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17304.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>KChIP2</kwd><kwd>Nav1.5</kwd><kwd>Kv4.3</kwd><kwd>INa</kwd><kwd>Ito</kwd><kwd>heart failure (HF)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL096962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deschênes</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL105338-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nassal</surname><given-names>Drew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13PRE17060106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nassal</surname><given-names>Drew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL132520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deschênes</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ion channel accessory subunit KChIP2 has a transcriptional role that provides regulation over miRNA targets, driving the adverse remodeling of key ion channels during cardiac stress and leading to the development of arrhythmia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiac excitability is controlled by a combination of depolarizing and repolarizing currents, whose dysregulation during heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) play a significant role in clinically relevant arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomaselli and Marbán, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang and Hill, 2010</xref>).

However, large variability and breadth of electrical changes present challenges in determining which mechanisms are critical in driving arrhythmias and disease progression. Intriguingly, loss of the Potassium Channel Interacting Protein 2 (KChIP2) has proven to be a consistent event following cardiac stress, sparking interest into understanding its contribution in disease remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Näbauer and Kääb, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is well described that KChIP2 associates with and modulates the Kv4 family of potassium channels, which together define the fast transient outward potassium current (<italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic>), maintaining early cardiac repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niwa and Nerbonne, 2010</xref>). However, emerging evidence suggests KChIP2 may not be limited to this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thomsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deschênes et al., 2008</xref>). Investigations following KChIP2 knock-down show reduced transcript expression for the cardiac sodium channel gene, <italic>SCN5A</italic>, and its accessory subunit <italic>SCN1B</italic>, in addition to Kv4.3 protein, prompting the loss of both <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deschênes et al., 2008</xref>). Considerably, these changes reflect conditions observed in the diseased heart, but more importantly implicate potential transcriptional significance for KChIP2 at the center of that remodeling. Indeed, other members of the KChIP family not expressed in the myocardium behave as transcriptional repressors, while also maintaining the ability to interact with Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Savignac et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomez-Villafuertes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ronkainen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we sought to identify the existence of cardiac KChIP2 transcriptional activity and its significance in electrical remodeling and arrhythmia susceptibility. Here, we find KChIP2 transcriptionally represses a set of miRNAs known as miR-34b and-34c. Through KChIP2 loss, miR-34b/c are elevated, subsequently targeting other ion channel genes defining <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> densities. Either restoring KChIP2 expression or blocking miR-34b/c activity during cardiac stress reverses this remodeling and completely negates the occurrence of re-entrant arrhythmias. Together, this work unveils a novel, transcriptional mechanism for KChIP2, and defines it as a central mediator of cardiac electrical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor of miRNAs</title><p>This study was approached with the knowledge that acute KChIP2 loss affected the <italic>SCN5A</italic> (Nav1.5), <italic>SCN1B</italic> (Navβ1), and <italic>KCND3</italic> (Kv4.3) genes in a manner suggesting miRNA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deschênes et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore performed a miRNA microarray following KChIP2 silencing in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), resulting in the induction of a number of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We evaluated the miRNAs that achieved at least a two fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) using TargetScan 7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>) to identify potential targeting to the mRNAs <italic>SCN5A</italic>, <italic>SCN1B</italic>, and <italic>KCND3</italic>. Ultimately, we identified miR-34b and −34c as the only miRNAs predicted to target not just one of these ion channel genes, but notably target all three collectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, we also observed 14 miRNAs decreased greater than two fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, a loss in miRNA expression is not consistent with the role of KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor, and also would not lead to a decrease in ion channel mRNA expression. Real-time qPCR was used to confirm the array results, showing elevation in the mature transcripts for miR-34b and −34c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, we also performed overexpression of three different cardiac KChIP2 isoforms which reduced the expression of miRs-34b/c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these changes are consistent with the novel idea that KChIP2 behaves as a transcriptional repressor.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17304.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>miR-34 regulation linked to changes in KChIP2 expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Results of miRNA microarray showing the log<sub>2</sub> of the fold changes in miR expression following 72 hr of KChIP2 siRNA treatment.

Indeed, fractionation of adult rat cardiomyocytes into nuclear fractions reveals endogenous KChIP2 nuclear expression in the absence of contaminating cytosolic (lactate dehydrogenase) and membrane associated proteins (Serca2a) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is reinforced in the localization patterns of adult cardiomyocytes, showing marked endogenous KChIP2 colocalization in the nucleus in the absence of the cytosolic marker lactate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KChIP2 interaction with the miR-34b/c promoter</title><p>To assess whether the transcriptional changes seen in miR-34b/c were the consequence of KChIP2 activity on the promoter, a luciferase assay was conducted containing the cloned minimal miR-34b/c promoter in the presence of KChIP2. Notably, both miR-34b and −34c are transcribed in tandem under the regulation of a shared, intergenic promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toyota et al., 2008</xref>). To identify potential DNA binding locations for KChIP2, we borrowed from what is known about the putative nucleotide binding sequence for the transcriptional repressor DREAM (KChIP3). This member of the KChIP family shares a high degree of homology with KChIP2, but more importantly has known transcriptional activity occurring through interaction with a nucleotide sequence known as the DRE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>). MatInspector software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartharius et al., 2005</xref>) was used to evaluate the miR-34b/c promoter for occurrences of this motif, revealing a potential site beginning 254 bp upstream of the miR-34b stem-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A region of the promoter 500 bp to 191 bp upstream of the miR-34b stem-loop was cloned into the pGL4.10 luciferase vector and co-transfected with several KChIP2 isoforms into cos-7 cells. When compared to a GFP transfected control without KChIP2, we observed significant repression in the presence of KChIP2.3, 2.4, and 2.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), showing that KChIP2 can directly act on the miR-34b/c promoter to impart repressive action. To determine if physical KChIP2 interaction with the promoter mediates the repressive state, native adult rat cardiomyocytes were used to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by qPCR with a primer set flanking the identified DRE site. KChIP2 pull-down resulted in significant enrichment of the DRE containing PCR fragment when compared to an IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17304.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>KChIP2 represses miR-34b/c expression by direct interaction with a putative DRE motif in promoter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A region from −500 to −191 of the miR-34b/c promoter was cloned into the promoterless luciferase construct, pGL4.10.

This attenuated the repressive action of KChIP2, implying that KChIP2 is capable of recognizing the same putative DNA binding motifs as DREAM and uses it to induce repressive action. Additionally, it is known that transcriptional derepression of DREAM is regulated through Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to EF-hand motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, to further characterize KChIP2 activity, the reporter assay was conducted following incubation with 10 mM caffeine to induce global elevations in Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This led to significant activation of the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), reinforcing the transcriptionally repressive nature of KChIP2 and its conserved mechanisms with DREAM.

Assessment of the resulting transcripts showed reduced mRNA for <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>SCN1B</italic> following miR-34 expression, compared to a non-targeting control miR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This construct was co-expressed with the miR-34b/c precursors in HEK293 cells, resulting in reduced activity in all three constructs when compared to a control miR-precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Subsequently, mutations were made within the seed region where miR-34 targeting is predicted to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which significantly attenuated the repressive action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

This can be attributed to a number of reasons. The current evaluation was conducted in rodent myocytes, where <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> is comprised of the shared alpha subunits Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, which comprise a fast component of <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> referred to as <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic>. Additionally, there are the contributions of Kv1.4, another potassium channel subunit, which encodes a slow component, referred to as <italic>I<sub>to,s</sub></italic>. These descriptions are attributed to the respective rates of recovery from inactivation for each of these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niwa and Nerbonne, 2010</xref>). Notably, our patch protocol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> took into account the contributions of all three subunits, or <italic>I<sub>to,total</sub></italic>. Therefore, despite reductions in Kv4.3 protein expression the change in current resists as it is not the predominant channel contributing to <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>. Importantly, Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 do not contain a miR-34 seed region. In fact, in response to miR-34b/c expression, mRNA levels for Kv4.2 actually experienced a trended elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) which could also contribute to the lack of reduction in <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>. We therefore modified our patch protocol to probe just <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic> and remove the contribution of Kv1.4, which now revealed a significant reduction in the <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic> density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To further identify if the presence of Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and Kv1.4 in rats could explain the resisted change in <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>, cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iCells) were used, since in the human background, Kv4.3 is the dominant contributor to <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niwa and Nerbonne, 2010</xref>). Expression of miR-34b/c precursors now produced a significant loss in <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), while also maintaining reductions in <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Importantly, this not only satisfies why <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> loss was resistant in the NRVMs, but identifies conservation of miR-34 activity across species, implicating the importance of miR-34s in human cardiac ion channel regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>KChIP2 regulates miR-34b/c expression during cardiac stress</title><p>To begin to understand the pathogenic importance of this pathway, NRVMs were cultured in 100 μM phenylephrine (PE) for 48 hr to mimic neuro-hormonal overload in a stressed myocardium. PE stimulation resulted in a dramatic decline of <italic>KCNIP2</italic> (KChIP2), while also yielding significant elevation in miR-34b/c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). These conditions resulted in reductions in expression for <italic>SCN5A</italic>, <italic>SCN1B</italic>, and <italic>KCND3</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Critically, maintaining KChIP2 levels through use of adenovirus encoding KChIP2 (Ad.KChIP2) normalized the expression of miRs-34b/c while reversing the loss in <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>SCN1B</italic>; however, <italic>KCND3</italic> levels remained suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Functional evaluation on both <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic> shows significant loss in density following PE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), reflecting the changes we see in transcript expression and mimicking ion channel remodeling observed in HF. However, Ad.KChIP2 treatment restored the current density for both currents, despite <italic>KCND3</italic> transcript expression being unaffected by KChIP2 expression. These observations strongly implicate a role for KChIP2 in maintaining proper electrical expression during pathological remodeling in the stressed heart. Moreover, we were able to observe significant reduction of KChIP2 and elevation of miR-34b/c within failing human heart tissue compared to non-failing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Reinforcing this conservation was the identification of a predicted DRE motif proximal to the transcriptional start site, in the human miR-34b/c promoter as evaluated by MatInspector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At the same time, significant loss of <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>KCND3</italic> transcripts in failing tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) also show conservation of miR-34b/c targeting within their 3’-UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SCN1B</italic> does not preserve its target site in humans, however, we also observed no significant reduction in transcript expression from failing heart tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Evaluation of genes that experienced at least a two fold change revealed an increase in expression for 293 genes and a decrease in expression for 407 genes in response to KChIP2 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, of the genes experiencing increased expression, 192 of them (65.5%) were predicted to contain a DRE motif within promoter elements, implicating the potential of KChIP2 transcriptional activity directly mediating these changes. Additionally, of the genes responding with reduced expression, 71 of them (17.4%) were predicted to contain a miR-34b/c target site within their 3’-UTR. Importantly, we see significant reduction to <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>SCN1B</italic>, consistent with previous data and the mechanisms investigated here. Considerably, whether these changes are the direct consequence of KChIP2 transcriptional repression, or more indirect KChIP2 dependent mechanisms, including prolonged APD from loss in <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> density contributing to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, the results are still relevant to cardiac remodeling, particularly given the associated loss of KChIP2 in cardiac disease states. Notably, a diverse range of gene pathways were implicated in response to KChIP2 loss, including cardiovascular signaling, regulation to G-protein coupled receptor pathways, relaxation and contraction, TGFβ signaling, apoptotic, and NFκB dependent signaling mechanisms, all of which have a relevance in disease remodeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, these data are supportive of our conclusion that KChIP2 is a key regulator of cardiac pathology. While our study focused on the transcriptional pathway by which KChIP2 could exert a concerted regulation of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>, further investigations pursuing some of the targets highlighted from this gene expression array will likely reveal a broader role for KChIP2 as a transcriptional regulator of cardiac physiology much like is seen for KChIP3 (DREAM) in the brain.</p><p>Indeed, the role of KChIP2 as a multimodal regulator of cardiac ion channels has been an emerging topic. Recent work has identified KChIP2 regulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 through direct interaction with an inhibitory N-terminal domain on the channel, effectively reducing <italic>I<sub>Ca,L</sub></italic> in the absence of KChIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thomsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foeger et al., 2013</xref>). Our previous work has also suggested that KChIP2 is part of a larger macromolecular complex that includes subunits for both Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and Kv4 channels that lead to functional increases in both currents when coexpressed with KChIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeschenesDeschênes et al., 2008</xref>). In the same study we also identified transcriptional changes in <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>SCN1B</italic> following acute knockdown of KChIP2 in NRVM, which provided the motivational basis for the work presented here. Taken together, these observations suggest a highly promiscuous nature for KChIP2.</p><p>Notably, another member of the KChIP family, KChIP3, has also been discovered to interact with multiple membrane proteins, including regulation of Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mellström et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buxbaum et al., 1998</xref>), while also displaying Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>). Even the role of KChIP3 as a transcriptional repressor is multimodal, including direct binding to DRE motifs, in addition to interacting with and suppressing the activity of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), an established transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ledo et al., 2002</xref>). Both of these processes are Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated, due to three functional high affinity EF-hand motifs residing in the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>). Occupancy of these sites upon increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> lead to conformational changes that cause DNA binding release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>) or dissociation from CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ledo et al., 2002</xref>), causing de-repression of downstream gene targets. Given that the entirety of the KChIP gene family displays strong conservation around these EF-hand residues, suggests conservation of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated responses. Indeed, we observed that caffeine stimulation produced increased activity of the miR-34b/c promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in the presence of KChIP2. Additionally, when we deleted the DRE element in the miR-34b/c promoter, we observed an incomplete removal of suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, as KChIP3 represses gene expression through alternative CREB dependent regulation, the partially retained repressive activity may be attributed to this secondary function. Further analysis of the promoter by MatInpsector revealed several potential sites of predicted CREB binding that may have allowed for partially maintained KChIP2 suppression, even in the absence of the DRE site. Given that KChIP2 and KChIP3 share a high degree of homology only reinforces the observation of multiple activities for KChIP2 as well.</p><p>The physiologic implications of KChIP2 targeting miR-34b/c expression is one of tremendous significance for many cardiac pathologic states. Rapid depletion of KChIP2 protein is a widespread event that underlies remodeling in many cardiac diseases, including chronic HF, MI, and atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nattel et al., 2007</xref>). Considerably, these diseases also present with reductions in <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>. The relationship between KChIP2 and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> has been heavily studied, frequently identifying that KChIP2 loss induces the destabilization of Kv4.2/4.3 channels and mediates the decline in current density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foeger et al., 2013</xref>). However, the work presented here offers the unique alternative that translation block through miRNA interaction mediates the decline in Kv4.3. Given that Kv4.2 does not contain a miR-34 target region in its 3’-UTR, but still experiences degradation following KChIP2 loss, it is likely that both mechanisms contribute to the resulting loss in <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic>. However, it is also observed that reduced KChIP2 expression stimulated by phenylephrine + propranolol in in vitro cultures of NRVM experienced increased Kv4.2 protein while KChIP2 and Kv4.3 levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Panama et al., 2011</xref>), supporting the opportunity for miRNA dependent translational block targeting Kv4.3, rather than just destabilization of all Kv4 channels.</p><p>In the same settings of cardiac disease where KChIP2 is down, there are also observations of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valdivia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zicha et al., 2004</xref>). Our data of miR-34 targeting Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 provides a means for describing this loss in activity. Notably, others have shown a loss in the full length transcript for Nav1.5 mRNA and a corresponding increase in a truncated isoform without the miR-34b/c target region present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shang et al., 2007</xref>), reinforcing the observations for miR-34b/c mediating the decline of <italic>SCN5A</italic>. Overall, the consequential loss of both <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>, and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>, suggests KChIP2 loss during cardiac stress may be a nodal event in a cascade of gene regulation defining electrical remodeling in the stressed myocardium. Indeed, earlier work was done that sought to determine the significance of KChIP2 in the development of hypertrophic remodeling. In a rat TAC banding model, it was observed that maintaining KChIP2 expression attenuated hypertrophy and pathogenic remodeling that otherwise lead to a worsening myocardium during pressure overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). This reverse in remodeling was attributed to changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling brought on by restoration of an abbreviated APD. Yet, we were able to observe that inhibition of miR-34b/c could also attenuate adverse remodeling without influencing APD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) implicating multiple pathways of KChIP2 intervention. Indeed, the miR-34 family has recently been implicated in the development and progression of hypertrophy and heart failure, in rodent models of both MI and pressure overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardo et al., 2012</xref>). Critically, these studies, combined with our own data, show that blockade of the miR-34 family can attenuate pathologic remodeling, expanding the significance of KChIP2 and miR-34 in cardiac pathogenesis.</p><p>There are still some challenges in understanding the role of KChIP2 in the progression of hypertrophy and heart failure. Investigations conducted in KChIP2 null mice have shown that when submitted to TAC banding, there is no worsened phenotype when compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Speerschneider et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, arrhythmia susceptibility was lowered in the KChIP2 null mice during heart failure, believed to be the result of reduced dispersion of repolarization. At the same time, there were no observed changes to <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>. While our current understanding is unable to account for this disparity, it may be that compensatory regulation exists in these mice as a consequence of constitutive KChIP2 absence during development, fundamentally changing its regulatory significance. Evidence for this is observed when restoring KChIP2 expression in myocytes isolated from KChIP2 null mice, which resulted in no rescue of Kv4.2 protein expression or recovery of <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foeger et al., 2013</xref>). However, restoration of KChIP2 following acute loss from pathologic consequences in a rat model was able to rescue <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2010</xref>), consistent with what we see in our own maintenance of KChIP2 following prolonged PE exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The significance of this begins to suggest deviations in KChIP2 regulatory impact depending on acute versus constitutive loss.</p><p>Ultimately, our endpoint was to determine whether electrical dysregulation brought on by KChIP2 loss was able to influence arrhythmia susceptibility through the activity of miR-34b/c. Despite only rescuing <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and not <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> in the NRVMs, as evidenced by the shortened ERP with sustained APD prolongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>), we found this was sufficient to rescue arrhythmia induction following PE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have revealed the relationship between changes in Na<sup>+</sup> channel density and arrhythmia induction. As <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> becomes compromised, it begins to resolve an expanding interval of premature stimuli declared the vulnerability period. Within this interval, reentry is more likely to occur as a result of non-uniform conduction block surrounding the point of excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Starmer et al., 2003</xref>). Both theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Starmer et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1993</xref>) and experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nesterenko et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Starmer et al., 1992</xref>) studies show that when Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability is reduced, the vulnerable period increases. Therefore, by restoring Na<sup>+</sup> channel through miR-34b/c inhibition, we are effectively minimizing the vulnerable period and making unidirectional conduction block less likely to occur.</p><p>Care must still be taken before translating these mechanisms to the clinical setting. Our investigated pathway was developed using cultured rodent myocytes, differing from human electrophysiology in its APD and the impact of underlying currents. We must also understand the electrical impact of miR-34 inhibition in vivo. However, we know from this investigation that miR-34b/c are elevated in native human HF tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and that functionally, the inhibition of miR-34b/c in human derived cardiomyocytes following stress can achieve restoration of both <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), reinforcing species dependent conservation. At the same time, conduction block due to compromised cellular excitability has long been understood to be important for clinically relevant arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shah et al., 2005</xref>). These observations together suggest strong therapeutic potential for targeting miR-34 in the treatment of electrical instabilities. Currently, the use of locked nucleic acids and related technologies have been used to successfully target miRNA activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olson, 2014</xref>). While miR-34b/c is also expressed outside the heart, it is unclear what long-term consequences its inhibition will have as a therapeutic. However, these outcomes will have to be weighed against the potential therapeutic advantage it will have in alleviating cardiac events.</p><p>Overall, this newly identified KChIP2/miR-34 pathway reflects electrical remodeling observed within multiple cardiac pathologies. Moreover, the events brought on by KChIP2 loss are critical in initiating electrical instabilities and arrhythmias implicated in sudden cardiac death. The identification of KChIP2 transcriptional capacity significantly reshapes its role in cardiac biology as a core mediator of cardiac electrical activity and reveals KChIP2 and miR-34 as therapeutic targets for managing arrhythmogenesis in heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation and cell culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and human derived cardiomyocytes (iCells)</title><p>Rat neonatal ventricular myocytes were isolated 1–2 days after birth as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dennis et al., 2011</xref>).

Briefly, freshly isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were fixed in a 1% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 14 min and quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. Cells were treated with a 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA 1x PBS solution for 8 min at 37°C to partially digest the cells aiding in removal of cytoplasmic extract and purification of nuclear extract during cell lysis steps. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 10% FBS, and the cell pellet was rinsed 3x in ice cold PBS. Chromatin was extracted by the treatment with several lysis buffers. Lysis buffer 1 (50 mM Hepes-KOH, Ph7.5; 140 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% Glyerol; 0.5% Igepal; 0.25% Triton-X) was added to the cells for 10 min with rocking, followed by 15–20 dounces with a glass teflon douncer on ice. This cell lysate fraction was discarded and the remaining cell pellet was resuspended in Lysis buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,0, 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA) for 5 min with rocking. This was again followed by 15–20 dounces with a glass teflon douncer on ice. Lastly, remaining cell pellet was resuspended in Lysis buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA; 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate; 0.5% <italic>N</italic>-lauroylsarcosine).

RNA studies for gene expression changes were conducted in 6-well plates with 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells plated per well for the collection of RNA. For patch-clamp recordings, NRVMs were on coverslips coated with laminin (Sigma, L2020) inside of 35 mm dish at a density of 100,000 cells/well. For optical mapping 1.5 × 10<sup>∧</sup>6 NRVMs were plated on aclar coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) coated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences, 356008) in a 35 mm dish. Following the initial 24–36 hr of plating, media was switched to 1:1 DMEM:F12 (without serum or BrdU) and supplemented with 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium-X (Invitrogen), 1% PS, and 142 μM Na<sup>+</sup> Ascorbate for an additional 24–36 hr. After this time, treatment media was applied, consisting of the same DMEM:F12 media with supplements and 100 μM phenylephrine. At the same time, control cells without phenylephrine were transduced with adeno.GFP, while phenylephrine treated cells received either the adeno.GFP or adeno.KChIP2.6 to restore KChIP2 expression during phenylephrine treatment. Alternatively, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAi Max using manufacturer’s protocol to deliver a control or combination of miR-34b and −34c antimir. In the case of transfected cells, the transfection was performed prior to the initiation of phenylephrine treatment. Phenylephrine treatment was sustained for 48 hr (fresh media was swapped after 24 hr, maintaining phenylephrine treatment, but no more virus was applied). Phenylephrine studies were also performed on iCells. iCell Cardiomyocyte Maintenance Medium was supplemented with 142 μM Na<sup>+</sup> Ascorbate. iCells were only treated with the antimirs and submitted to patch-clamp recordings with the same treatment conditions applied to the NRVM.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor.

They describe a transcriptional repression role for the proteins KChIP2 – previously known to interact at the membrane with and regulate the Kv4.3 potassium channel in a Ca-dependent manner, and identifies genes for mir34b and c as targets of this transcriptional repression. These miRs regulate channel subunits transcripts responsible for <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to</sub> (SCN5</italic>A, <italic>SCN1B</italic> and <italic>KCND3</italic> itself) through degradation and translational repression mechanisms. Thus, this work proposes a new arm of a regulatory network in the heart controlled by the multifunctional proteins KChIP2, which is known to be significantly repressed in heart disease. The idea that KChIP2 can be a transcriptional regulator is derivative of similar findings on a highly related channel-regulator KChIP3/DREAM active in neuronal cells, which has been characterized in detail. Nonetheless, KChIP2 expression is specific to the heart, giving this study specific context, and the elucidation of the down stream miR pathway is novel. The data appear for the most part robust and modulation of miR23bc and channel subunits appears to be confirmed in human failing heart samples, although here controls are missing. The second part of the paper addresses the functional implications of this pathway in an in vitro model of cardiac disease (PE treated NRVMs). They provide a surrogate that appear to support the model of critical involvement of the above pathway in dampening of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> currents in disease. Overexpression of miR34b and c precursors dampens currents (<italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> only in human cells as there is compensatory expression of Kv4.2 in mouse CMs), while over expression of KChIP2 restores currents dampened after PE treatment of NRVC.

While for the purposes of our investigation we were interested in the miRNAs experiencing upregulation from the loss of transcriptional repression provided by KChIP2, there are clearly miRNAs that are also down- regulated and should be portrayed equally. For the miRNAs where a down-regulation is observed, it is unlikely that these miRNAs would be direct targets of KChIP2 transcriptional activity, as they would not be consistent with its mode of transcriptional repression. They are most likely indirect targets from a modified state within the cardiomyocytes, such as altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling because of changes to the cardiac action potential through the loss in KChIP2. None- the-less, it is valuable to identify what targets are being influenced and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> has been modified to show those changes.</p><p><italic>A list of all significantly regulated miRNAs more than two-fold up/down would also be appreciated by the community.</italic></p><p>These tables have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to the manuscript to provide this data.</p><p><italic>In addition analysis of miRNA is fine; however it is unlikely that a transcription factor specifically regulates only these miRNAs.

Importantly though, the primary focus of this manuscript was the identification of the KChIP2/miR-34b/c axis of regulation and its implications in electrical remodeling of the heart. Given the degree of verification and confirmation in identifying KChIP2 transcriptional targets, particularly considering its multimodal function, a full gene analysis following KChIP2 loss presents with the challenging task of understanding which are direct targets of transcriptional activity and which are secondary responses. However, gene changes following KChIP2 loss either by direct or indirect means are still substantial in understanding molecular changes that might be precipitated by KChIP2 loss during heart failure remodeling. Therefore, to begin populating a list of genes that are altered in response to acute KChIP2 loss, a whole-transcriptome microarray was performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with an shRNA to acutely suppress KChIP2 expression. A list of significantly up- and down-regulated mRNAs has been provided as a table in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D. Importantly, we saw the conservation of decreases in both <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>SCN1B</italic>. At the same time, we see that other highly predicted miR-34b/c targets such as Sema4b are also reduced. In total, 293 genes experienced at least a 2 fold increase in expression and 407 genes a 2 fold decrease. Notably, of the genes experiencing increased expression, 192 of them (65.5%) were predicted to contain a DRE motif within promoter elements, implicating the potential of KChIP2 transcriptional activity directly mediating these changes. This is consistent with the role of KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor and highlights its potential involvement in transcriptionally influencing a large portion of these gene changes.</p><p>Together, this provides a shortened list of genes which might be influenced by KChIP2 transcriptional activity, as well as genes which may be targeted by the pathologic KChIP2 loss occurring in the numerous conditions of heart disease. Indeed, numerous gene pathways relevant to cardiac disease remodeling were implicated by the changes in these gene targets, suggesting that KChIP2 loss could be a precipitating event in disease progression. Pursuing these targets more extensively will be the scope of further studies. Importantly though, the gene array results further support and reinforce our findings that KChIP2 acts as a transcription factor and we thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><p><italic>2) Cell fractionation indicates presence of some KChIP2 in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cell fractionation experiments using overexpressed proteins can be misleading. Membrane bound/membrane associated proteins should be used as a control here to exclude the possibility of contamination of the nuclear fraction. In addition the experiment would be far more convincing if native protein would be detected in this assay – is this possible?

Previous manuscripts have shown through immunohistochemistry the presence of KChIP2 staining in the nucleus of native cardiomyocytes, and so our primary incentive originally was to identify if different KChIP2 isoforms aligned with a distinguishable pattern of nuclear expression. However, heterologous over-expression of a protein in non-native cells could absolutely change the normal behavior and trafficking of proteins. In order to address these concerns, cell fractionation experiments were replaced with tissue from native rat hearts as suggested by the reviewers. We now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> the presence of KChIP2 in fractions representing cytoplasmic, membrane, and nuclear lysates. Moreover, we used Serca2a immunoblotting as a representative protein for potentially contaminating membrane fractions.</p><p>Importantly, Serca2a was absent from the nuclear fraction, in addition to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) representing the cytosolic fraction, showing that KChIP2 nuclear expression is not the consequence of contaminating fractions.</p><p>Further, immunohistochemistry experiments were updated to include staining in native adult rat cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). LDH was again used as a cytosolic marker to ensure the absence of cytosolic leak into nuclear regions. The use of z-stacks shows clearly the omission of LDH from the nucleus, as marked by DAPI, while also revealing enrichment of KChIP2 in the nuclear regions relative to cytosolic levels. Together these results suggest KChIP2 maintains nuclear expression in a native state, consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor.</p><p><italic>3) Data for human cells are not complete. The authors should include more comprehensive data for the human system: (i) is the DRE and its position in the promoter of miR-34 conserved in humans? (ii) are the miR-34b/c binding sites conserved in the UTRs of human orthologues of SCN5B/SCN1B/KCND3?</italic></p><p>Given the inclusion of human derived cardiomyocytes in our current set of figures, we appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion that we include comparisons of the genetic elements responsible for the functional data that we show. When comparing the conservation of the DRE site between rat and human, we do see that the DRE site is maintained upstream of miR-34b in the human promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Specifically, in the rat, the DRE motif resides 254 bp upstream of the</p><p>miR-34b stem-loop, while in human it is 242 bp upstream, suggesting that loss of KChIP2 in human heart failure tissue is also responsible for the elevation in miR-34b/c that is observed.</p><p>As for the conservation of the miR-34b/c target sites, comparisons between rat and human show the conservation of the seed region for <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>KCND3</italic>, but no conservation for <italic>SCN1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The loss of the seed region in the human background is reflected in the human heart failure data for gene expression, showing a minimal and non-significant loss in <italic>SCN1B</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Never-the-less, our functional data in human derived cardiomyocytes show restoration of <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> following miR-34b/c block through targeting of <italic>SCN5A</italic>.</p><p><italic>(iii) In samples of failing human heart reduction of KChIP2 and elevation of miR-34b/c was observed, but surprisingly, no data on human Sodium or Potassium channels were included into the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition it remains unclear whether the observed changes are due to changes in transcription or due to changes in cellular composition in the failing heart. Carefully considered additional controls should be included to exclude such artifacts, for example other channel genes not targeted by miR34.</italic></p><p>In order to reinforce the relationship between miR-34b/c regulation of ion channel remodeling in human, we added data on gene transcript changes in normal and failing human heart tissue. We see significant loss in expression of <italic>SCN5A</italic> and <italic>KCND3</italic> in failing heart samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> has been updated to show these changes. The loss of these transcripts and the increase in miR-34b/c parallels the remodeling we see in the rat with KChIP2 loss directly or through phenylephrine stimulation, reflecting the relevance of this pathway in human disease.</p><p>This significance is reflected in our figures showing blockade of miR-34b/c in human derived cardiomyocytes leads to rescue of both <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>. Additionally, we added recordings of the rapid delayed rectifier current, <italic>I<sub>Kr</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In cardiac disease remodeling, this current frequently experiences a loss in expression, leading to compromised repolarization and APD prolongation. We show that in response to PE stimulation in the human derived cardiomyocytes, this current experienced, as expected, significant reductions. However, with the treatment of miR-34b/c antimirs, <italic>I<sub>Kr</sub></italic> was not rescued, reinforcing the specificity of miR-34b/c regulation, as opposed to altering the overall molecular state of the cell. Moreover, this specificity is also illustrated by the varying scenarios of <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> rescue between NRVM and human derived cells. Rat <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> is encoded by the three channel genes Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3, whereas miR-34b/c is predicted to target only Kv4.3. Therefore, the rescue of only Kv4.3 following miR- 34b/c block, did not lead to a significant rescue of <italic>I<sub>to,total</sub></italic>, but did resolve a partial rescue of <italic>I<sub>to,f</sub></italic>. However, in iCells®, Kv4.3 is predominant, and we were able to observe a full rescue of the current even when assessing <italic>I<sub>to,total</sub></italic>. Addition of these new results confirms the specificity of the transcriptional regulation.</p><p><italic>4) Antimirs were applied to NRVM in culture and excitability in monolayers was measured. It would be interesting to see the result of PE stimulation and subsequent antimir-treatment in vivo. See Bernardo 2012 PNAS. Such experiments could also be used to demonstrate modulation of the KChIP2-miR-34b/c-ion channel axis in vivo.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that being able to observe these mechanisms in an in vivo state of regulation would be interesting. After beginning these experiments, however, we have realized that this is an extensive endeavor and a significant amount of time is required to have the powered experiments necessary for evaluation of in vivo model and as well as proper statistical analysis. Most challenging is that simply getting animals into a state of heart failure that develops the appropriate phenotypic changes and pathological electrical remodeling necessary to evaluate our mechanisms and therapeutic interventions requires nearly 5 months time. We also must identify therapeutic ranges and proper dosing of miR-34 blockade for evaluating our time courses and outcomes, which means that having a consistent treatment protocol further delays the onset of the 5 month protocol. Additionally, due to the breadth of the work required and the information that will be obtained, we believe that these additional extensive studies will be easily a stand-alone manuscript. As a result we regrettably will not be able to provide in vivo analysis within the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>However, we believe the impact of the mechanisms investigated within the current manuscript are not diminished by the absence of in vivo data. We set out to understand if KChIP2 could act as a transcriptional repressor and how acute KChIP2 loss could lead to the changes in gene expression of <italic>SCN5A, SCN1B</italic>, and <italic>KCND3</italic>, particularly given that KChIP2 loss and the currents encoded by these ion channel subunits are diminished in multiple states of cardiac pathology. To that end, the current data has provided a clear and robust relationship of this axis of regulation, which at the same time has identified a novel transcriptional action of KChIP2 extremely relevant for mediating disease signaling and the development of established arrhythmic substrates. Moreover, we continue to see the observed relationship between these genes in human heart failure tissue, suggesting that they are relevant changes in an in vivo state of diseased myocardium.</p><p><italic>5) The paper would benefit from more extensive study of KChIP2 DNA-binding. ChIP PCR in transfected cells is prone to artifacts; ChIP-seq would look much more convincing and again native protein would be preferred in case of ChIP experiments.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers concern over the identification of KChIP2 DNA binding through the use of cardiomyocytes over-expressing KChIP2. Initially, we had settled on this approach due to expected limitations in the experimental design which could not be easily addressed. Most ChIP studies are critically dependent on the availability of an appropriate ChIP-grade antibody for maximizing the efficiency of pulldown. However, as we are characterizing novel KChIP2 DNA binding, there is no available antibody designed for this purpose. At the same time, NRVM were chosen over adult myocytes due to the easier disruption and isolation of nuclear content, without cytosolic contamination, assisting in a more efficient sonication of chromatin material, as well as being able to shed non-DNA bound KChIP2 residing in the cytosol. However, NRVM express native KChIP2 at a dramatically lower amount, therefore, we had chosen to over-express the protein. Regardless, artificial expression of KChIP2 does have the potential to create artifacts, and so to satisfy that concern we optimized our ChIP-PCR workflow to handle native adult rat cardiomyocytes. The results of those efforts revealed a significant enrichment of the miR-34b/c promoter following KChIP2 pull-down compared to IgG control in native adult rat myocytes without needing to overexpress KChIP2 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), reinforcing that this transcriptional interaction is indeed a native event.</p><p>We agree that the most effective strategy at identifying genome wide contributions to KChIP2 transcriptional activity would be to perform ChIP-seq. We had invested significant time and resources into performing ChIP-seq studies prior to the submission of this manuscript to understand the full scope of KChIP2 binding. However, we consistently ran into difficulties at the point of library generation. Consultations with ChIP-seq experts suggested that without a proper ChIP grade antibody or alternatively a tagged fusion protein, we would not achieve sufficient chromatin enrichment for successful library generation. While a tagged fusion was a possible alternative, we would still run into the issue of having to over-express the construct, while at the same time run the risk of modifying the native behavior of the cell by addition of the tag. Lastly, a transgenic animal with the fusion could be made to maintain endogenous gene levels, however, that would be beyond the scope of this manuscript at this time. Due to each of these issues, we therefore chose to proceed with ChIP-PCR in native adult rat myocytes, where discrete DNA regions can be evaluated for enrichment with lower starting quantities of DNA.</p><p>Additionally, the primary motivation behind this current study was whether KChIP2 transcriptional activity was involved in the regulation of <italic>SCN5A, SCN1B</italic>, and <italic>KCND3</italic>. To that end, with the addition of evaluating native KChIP2 protein, we have successfully shown this event does occur. Moreover, this pathway has shown its importance in electrical remodeling relevant to the development of arrhythmogenesis, highlighting not just the novel role for KChIP2, but one with a significant contribution to disease remodeling.</p><p><italic>6) Most disappointing is that the functional outcome from altering miR-34 is very minor. In particular, the changes in I<sub>to</sub> in NRVM are statistically not significant, as noted likely because Kv4.2 is the dominant channel in rat CMs. However, the issues is: despite restoring I<sub>Na</sub> by miR-34 antimir in NRVMs, conduction velocity (CV) was not restored. Thus it is not clear how reentrant arrhythmia can be prevented under miR-34 anitimir treatment.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments regarding the overall significance of miR-34 antimir treatment and its influence in arrhythmia susceptibility. As noted, because of the use of rat cardiomyocytes and the targeting of only Kv4.3, we were only able to minimally restore <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic>, leading to no changes in APD for disease remodeled cardiomyocytes (PE treated cells). While we were able to target <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic>, our expectation was also that we would be able to restore conduction velocity. However, the fact that we did not suggests additional remodeling to the cardiomyocytes that is not influenced by miR-34b/c, which may include cellular coupling. Notably, from our gene array, Cx43 mRNA expression was reduced by 67% following KChIP2 silencing, though it is not a target of miR-34b/c. However, the observation of a trend toward increased conduction velocity, as well as the significant rescue of the relative refractory interval following miR-34b/c blockade, represents preservation of sodium channel availability, which very dramatically had an effect on arrhythmia inducibility.</p><p>While APD and conduction velocity are major substrates in arrhythmogenesis, we believe that conduction velocity is not the primary mechanism responsible for eliciting the reentrant events observed. In this instance of arrhythmia susceptibility, the development of the reentrant loop occurred at the point of excitation as a result of unidirectional conduction block of the premature stimulus due to heterogenous excitability. As sodium channel excitability becomes compromised, there becomes an expanding window of vulnerability where a premature stimulus at the right time will capture and propagate in one direction, but will still be in a state of refractoriness in another, establishing the substrates necessary for reentry to occur. Both mathematical and experimental data are in support of this mechanism (1-4). With enough sodium channel in reserve, this vulnerability window is minimal and the site will either experience complete block or capture. By restoring <italic>I<sub>Na</sub></italic> we are therefore reducing the probability of reentry as a direct consequence of the premature stimulus.</p><p>This mechanism of conduction block leading to reentry is mechanistically distinct from one created as a result of conduction slowing, but still extremely relevant to the overall arrhythmic risk. Physiologically, an ectopic beat from an event such as a delayed after depolarization could lead to a premature stimulus that if occurring within this vulnerable window would establish the same events leading to the formation of reentry. Therefore, we believe that the observations made after miR-34b/c blockade are, in fact, major contributors to arrhythmic risk as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, and consistent with the mechanisms identified throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) Although the authors claim that miR-34 mostly affects Kv4.3 and not KV4.2, the same group reported earlier that KChIP2 altered both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, which implies that there could be an additional pathway by which KChIP2 can influence cardiac repolarization. Although I agree that the present study provides strong evidence supporting KChIP2 as a transcriptional repressor through modulating miR-34, the discussion may need to state limitations of this study and potential alternative regulation of I<sub>to</sub> factors other than miR-34.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct in this observation. There are multiple modes of regulation by which KChIP2 can target the family of Kv4 channels and we appreciate the opportunity to clarify these mechanisms. Numerous publications have investigated the physical interaction KChIP2 has with both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, leading to the enhanced trafficking and increased stabilization of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">5</xref>). With KChIP2 loss, the consequence has been reduced expression of both Kv4 channels. Therefore, while we highlight a transcriptional capacity of KChIP2 to target miR-34b/c and indirectly target Kv4.3, KChIP2 is also destabilizing both Kv4.3 in addition to Kv4.2 through its physical interaction. These distinctions are highlighted well in the experiments where we treat the NRVM with phenylephrine and either restore KChIP2 with adenovirus or instead treat with miR-34b/c antimirs. We see that with miR-34b/c block, we are unable to effectively restore <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> in rodent cells, but are successful in doing so in human derived cells where Kv4.3 is more dominant. However, when we restore KChIP2 in the NRVM, we are able to restore <italic>I<sub>to</sub></italic> because KChIP2 can directly stabilize Kv4.2 expression as well. Potential limitations of these distinctions will be especially important when considering the species of animal being investigated and whether or not KChIP2 expression or miR-34b/c activity is being targeted.</p><p>However, the observation that KChIP2 can influence the same target through multiple pathways only potentiates its importance in disease remodeling. This material is also included in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
