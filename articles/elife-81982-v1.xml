Nevertheless, it is not well understood how such synchrony is achieved and maintained in a complex network of time-delayed neural interactions. Myelin plasticity, accomplished by oligodendrocytes (OLs), has been suggested as an efficient mechanism for controlling timing in brain communications through adaptive changes of axonal conduction velocity and consequently conduction time delays, or latencies; however, local rules and feedback mechanisms that OLs use to achieve synchronization are not known. We propose a mathematical model of oligodendrocyte-mediated myelin plasticity (OMP) in which OLs play an active role in providing such feedback. This is achieved without using arrival times at the synapse or modulatory signaling from astrocytes; instead, it relies on the presence of global and transient OL responses to local action potentials in the axons they myelinate. While inspired by OL morphology, we provide the theoretical underpinnings that motivated the model and explore its performance for a wide range of its parameters. Our results indicate that when the characteristic time of OL’s transient intracellular responses to neural spikes is between 10 and 40 ms and the firing rates in individual axons are relatively low (⪅ 10 Hz), the OMP model efficiently synchronizes correlated and time-locked signals while latencies in axons carrying independent signals are unaffected. This suggests a novel form of selective synchronization in the CNS in which oligodendrocytes play an active role by modulating the conduction delays of correlated spike trains as they traverse to their targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural Research Program of NIMH/NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAMH002797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plenz</surname><given-names>Dietmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural Research Program of NICHD/NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAHD000713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fields</surname><given-names>R Douglas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural Research Program of NICHD/NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHD008972-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basser</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All results shown in our figures are produced via computer simulations of our model.
