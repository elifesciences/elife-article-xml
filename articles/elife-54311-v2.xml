substitutions, exhibit pleiotropic effects during virus replication. However, the underlying mechanism for the class II phenotype is not known. Here we demonstrate that all tested class II IN substitutions compromised IN-RNA binding in virions by one of the three distinct mechanisms: (i) markedly reducing IN levels thus precluding the formation of IN complexes with viral RNA; (ii) adversely affecting functional IN multimerization and consequently impairing IN binding to viral RNA; and (iii) directly compromising IN-RNA interactions without substantially affecting IN levels or functional IN multimerization. Inhibition of IN-RNA interactions resulted in the mislocalization of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes outside the capsid lattice, which led to premature degradation of the viral genome and IN in target cells. Collectively, our studies uncover causal mechanisms for the class II phenotype and highlight an essential role of IN-RNA interactions for accurate virion maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>Integrase</kwd><kwd>maturation</kwd><kwd>Integrase-RNA interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutluay</surname><given-names>Sebla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM122458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutluay</surname><given-names>Sebla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI143389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI062520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvaratskhelia</surname><given-names>Mamuka</given-names></name><name><surname>Kutluay</surname><given-names>Sebla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI150472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvaratskhelia</surname><given-names>Mamuka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI070042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engelman</surname><given-names>Alan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HIV-1 integrase-RNA interactions account for the key role of integrase in particle maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infectious HIV-1 virions are formed in a multistep process coordinated by interactions between the HIV-1 Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins, and the viral RNA (vRNA) genome. At the plasma membrane of an infected cell, Gag and Gag-Pol molecules assemble around a vRNA dimer and bud from the cell as a spherical immature virion, in which the Gag proteins are radially arranged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pornillos and Ganser-Pornillos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bieniasz and Telesnitsky, 2018</xref>). As the immature virion buds, the viral protease enzyme is activated and cleaves Gag and Gag-Pol into their constituent domains, triggering virion maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pornillos and Ganser-Pornillos, 2019</xref>). During maturation, the cleaved nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Gag condenses with the RNA genome and <italic>pol</italic>-encoded viral enzymes (reverse transcriptase [RT] and integrase [IN]) inside the conical capsid lattice, composed of the cleaved capsid (CA) protein, which together forms the core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pornillos and Ganser-Pornillos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bieniasz and Telesnitsky, 2018</xref>).</p><p>After infection of a target cell, RT in the confines of the reverse transcription complex (RTC) synthesizes linear double-stranded DNA from vRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engelman, 2010</xref>). The vDNA is subsequently imported into the nucleus, where the IN enzyme catalyzes its insertion into the host cell chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engelman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lesbats et al., 2016</xref>). Integration is mediated by the intasome nucleoprotein complex that consists of a multimer of IN engaging both ends of linear vDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engelman and Cherepanov, 2017</xref>). While the number of IN protomers required for intasome function varies across Retroviridae, single-particle cryogenic electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structures of HIV-1 and Maedi-visna virus indicate that lentivirus integration proceeds via respective higher-order dodecamer and hexadecamer IN arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballandras-Colas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Passos et al., 2017</xref>), though a lower-order intasome composed of an HIV-1 IN tetramer was also resolvable by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Passos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A number of IN substitutions which specifically arrest HIV-1 replication at the integration step have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelman, 1999</xref>).

A hallmark morphological defect of these viruses is the formation of aberrant viral particles with viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes mislocalized outside the conical CA lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenkins et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nakamura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Quillent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly similar morphological defects are observed in virions produced from cells treated with allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs, also known as LEDGINs, NCINIs, INLAIs, or MINIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balakrishnan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Rouzic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desimmie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Slaughter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnard et al., 2018</xref>). ALLINIs induce aberrant IN multimerization in virions by engaging the V-shaped pocket at the IN dimer interface, which also provides a principal binding site for the host integration targeting cofactor lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Rouzic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koneru et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kessl et al., 2012</xref>). The recent discovery that HIV-1 IN binds to the vRNA genome in virions and that inhibiting IN-RNA interactions leads to the formation of eccentric particles provided initial clues about the role of IN during virion morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>HIV-1 IN consists of three independently folded protein domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), catalytic core domain (CCD), and C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engelman and Cherepanov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engelman and Cherepanov, 2014</xref>), and vRNA binding is mediated by a constellation of basic residues within the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>). However, class II IN substitutions are located throughout the entire length of the IN protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engelman, 2011</xref>), which raises the question as to how these substitutions impair virus maturation. The structural basis for IN binding to RNA is not yet known; however, in vitro evidence indicates that IN binds RNA as lower-order multimers, and conversely RNA binding may prevent the formation of higher-order IN multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, aberrant IN multimerization underlies the inhibition of IN-RNA interactions by ALLINIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>) and subsequent defects in virion maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balakrishnan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desimmie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Slaughter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnard et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it seems plausible that class II IN substitutions may exert their effect on virus replication by adversely affecting functional IN multimerization. However, a systematic evaluation of the effects of IN substitutions on IN multimerization, IN-RNA binding, and virion morphology is lacking. As such, it remains an open question as to how functional IN multimerization and/or IN-RNA interactions influence correct virion morphogenesis.</p><p>Eccentric virions generated via class II IN substitutions or ALLINI treatment are defective for reverse transcription in target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leavitt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nakamura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busschots et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engelman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Limón et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lloyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Masuda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rahman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rivière et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tsurutani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiskerchen and Muesing, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Houwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mohammed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shehu-Xhilaga et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balakrishnan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desimmie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tekeste et al., 2015</xref>) despite containing equivalent levels of RT and vRNA genome as wild type (WT) particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">van Bel et al., 2014</xref>).

We and others have recently shown that premature loss of the viral genome and IN, as well as spatial separation of RT from vRNPs, may underlie the reverse transcription defect observed in eccentric viruses generated in the presence of ALLINIs or the class II IN R269A/K273A substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koneru et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madison et al., 2017</xref>). These findings support a model in which the capsid lattice or IN binding to vRNA itself is necessary to protect viral components from the host environment upon entering a target cell. Whether the premature loss of the viral genome and IN is a universal outcome of other class II IN substitutions is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the molecular basis of how class II IN substitutions exert their effects on HIV-1 replication. In particular, by detailed characterization of how class II substitutions impact IN multimerization, IN-RNA interactions, and virion morphology, we aimed to dissect whether loss of IN binding to vRNA or aberrant IN multimerization underlies the pleiotropic defects observed in viruses bearing class II IN mutations. Remarkably, we found that class II substitutions either prevented IN binding to the vRNA genome or precluded the formation of IN-vRNA complexes through reducing or eliminating IN from virions. We show that IN tetramers have a strikingly higher affinity toward vRNA than IN monomers or dimers, and many class II IN substitutions inhibited IN binding to RNA indirectly through modulating functional IN tetramerization. By contrast, R262A/R263A and R269A/K273A substitutions within the CTD and the K34A change within the NTD did not perturb IN tetramer formation, and thus likely directly interfered with IN binding to RNA. Irrespective of how IN-RNA binding was inhibited, all class II IN mutant viruses formed eccentric particles with vRNPs mislocalized outside the CA lattice. Subsequently, this led to premature loss of the vRNA genome as well as IN, and spatial separation of RT and CA from the vRNPs in target cells. Taken together, our findings uncover causal mechanisms for the class II phenotype and highlight the essential role of IN-RNA interactions for the formation of correctly matured virions and vRNP stability in HIV-1-infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the replication defects of class II IN mutant viruses</title><p>Substitutions in IN that exhibited a class II phenotype i.e. assembly, maturation or reverse transcription defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engelman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansari-Lari et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bukovsky and Göttlinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenkins et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalpana et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leavitt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liao and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nakamura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Quillent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Taddeo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busschots et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engelman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Limón et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lloyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Masuda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rahman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rivière et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tsurutani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiskerchen and Muesing, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Houwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mohammed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shehu-Xhilaga et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Englund et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Petit et al., 1999</xref>) or affected IN multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lutzke and Plasterk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eijkelenboom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kessl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2012</xref>) were selected from past literature.

First, virion-associated IN was at least 5-fold less than WT with several mutants, including H12N, N18I, K103E, W108R, F185K, L242A, and V260E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Near-complete lack of processing intermediates with the K14A and N18I substitutions, despite the presence of fully processed RT and IN in virions (detected using a separate polyclonal antibody), is likely due to the inaccessibility of epitopes recognized by the monoclonal anti-IN antibody in the processing intermediates. Second, the R228A substitution abolished full-length IN in virions without impacting cell- or virion-associated Gag-Pol levels or processing intermediates; however, a faster migrating species generated by aberrant IN processing and/or IN degradation was visible. A similar but more modest defect was observed for the K34A mutant, which was incorporated into virions at a modestly reduced level alongside a smaller protein species. Third, the remainder of the IN substitutions did not appear to affect IN or Gag-Pol levels in cells or virions.</p><p>With the exception of E96A, nearly all of the IN substitutions reduced virus titers at least 100-fold compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which corresponded with reduced levels of reverse-transcription in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lu et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2005b</xref>), class II mutant IN molecules had variable levels of catalytic activity as assessed by the ability of Vpr-IN proteins to transcomplement a catalytically inactive IN (D116N, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Engelman and Craigie, 1992</xref>) in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fletcher et al., 1997</xref>). All Vpr-IN fusion proteins, except for the H12N mutant which likely decreased the stability of the Vpr-IN fusion protein, were expressed at similar levels in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that K14A, E96A, Y99A, K103A, V165A, R187A, K188E R199A, K236E, and R269A/R273A IN mutants trans-complemented a catalytically inactive IN at levels similar to the WT, whereas W108R, R228A, and V260E mutants were unable to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). The inability of W108R, R228A, and V260E mutants to transcomplement implies that they are impaired for integration, a result in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lutzke and Plasterk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2012</xref>).

These results suggest that the majority of the class II mutant INs retain structural integrity and at least partial catalytic activity in the presence of a complementing IN protein. Cumulatively, these data show that some class II substitutions in IN can affect the stability and/or processing of virion-associated proteins, but they all universally lead to the formation of non-infectious virions that are blocked at reverse transcription in target cells, a hallmark of class II IN substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Engelman, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Class II IN mutants abolish IN binding to RNA</title><p>Using complementary in vitro and CLIP-based approaches, we have previously shown that viral genomic RNAs (vRNA) constitute the primary RNA species bound by IN in virions and that IN interacts with the viral genome through multiple basic residues (i.e. K264, K266, R269, K273) in its CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>).

In line with the crosslinking studies in virions, WT, K34A, and R262A/R263A INs formed tetramers, while the levels of dimers varied for different mutants. For example, while IN R262A/R263A presented similar levels of tetramers and dimers, IN K34A was primarily tetrameric with a minor dimeric species, as evident by the broad right shoulder of the tetrameric SEC peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, the majority of other IN mutants almost exclusively formed dimers and monomers with little evidence for tetramer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Virion morphology of a subset of IN mutants that inhibited vRNA interactions by three different mechanisms; that is, those that decreased IN levels in virions (N18I and W108R), those that may have directly inhibited IN binding to RNA (K34A, R262A/R263A), and those that primarily altered IN multimerization (E87A, E96A, F185K, R187A, L241A, L242A), was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, the majority of WT particles contained an electron-dense condensate representing vRNPs inside the CA lattice, whereas an ΔRT-IN deletion mutant virus produced similar levels of immature particles and eccentric particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Remarkably, irrespective of how IN-RNA interactions were inhibited, 70–80% of nearly all class II IN mutant particles exhibited an eccentric morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Of note, the E96A mutant tended to produce less eccentric and more mature particles than the other IN mutants. Because IN E96A retained partial binding to vRNA in virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and partial infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we conclude that this infection-deferred mutant harbors a partial class II phenotype.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of class II IN mutant virion morphologies viruses by TEM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative TEM images of WT, K14A, N18I, K34A, E87A, E96A, W108R, F185K, R187A, L241A, L242A, R262A/R263A, and ∆RT-IN HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> virions.

The premise for this is based on our previous finding that disruption of IN binding to vRNA through the IN R269A/K273A substitution leads to separation of a fraction of IN from dense vRNPs and CA containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madison et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we predicted that inhibition of IN-RNA interactions through the above class II substitutions could lead to a similar outcome. To this end, WT or class II IN mutant virions stripped of the viral lipid envelope by brief detergent treatment were separated on sucrose gradients, and resulting fractions were analyzed for CA, IN, and matrix (MA) content by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Welker et al., 2000</xref>).

In contrast to our hypothesis, the majority of IN mutants sedimented similarly to WT IN and settled in the denser gradient fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Exceptions were the K34A and R262A/R263A IN mutants, a fraction of which migrated to soluble fractions similar to the R269A/K273A mutant, suggesting their localization outside of the capsid lattice. None of the IN substitutions affected the migration pattern of CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which distributed was bimodally between the soluble and dense fractions, nor the distribution of MA (data not shown), which was found in mainly the soluble fractions. These results suggested that, with the exception of the K34A, R262A/R263A, and R269A/K273A, IN mutant proteins may remain associated with the CA lattice despite inhibition of IN-vRNA interactions. Alternatively, class II IN mutants may localize outside of the CA lattice but form aggregates resulting in a similar migration pattern in dense fractions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Biochemical analysis of class II IN mutant virus particles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of sedimentation profiles of IN in WT or IN mutant virions.

In WT-infected cells, vRNA was visible immediately after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

However, a significant proportion of vRNA was still readily detectable.

In line with the above findings, vRNA levels decreased at a faster rate with the class II IN mutants as compared to WT viruses, with half as much cell-associated vRNA remaining at 2 and 6 hr post-infection for the class II IN mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Treating cells with ammonium chloride to prevent fusion of the VSV-G pseudotyped viruses rescued vRNA loss, and vRNA from WT and mutant viruses were retained at equal levels, indicating that the loss of vRNA is dependent on entry into the target cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These findings agree with the previous experiments and demonstrate that class II IN substitutions lead to the premature loss of the vRNA genome also in human T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings highlight the critical role of IN-vRNA interactions in virion morphogenesis and provide the mechanistic basis for how diverse class II IN substitutions lead to similar morphological and reverse transcription defects. We propose that class II IN substitutions lead to the formation of eccentric particles through three distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): (i) depletion of IN from virions thus precluding the formation of IN-vRNA complexes; (ii) impairment of functional IN multimerization and as a result, indirect disruption of IN-vRNA binding; and (iii) direct disruption of IN-vRNA binding without substantially affecting IN levels or its inherent multimerization properties. Irrespective of how IN binding to vRNA is inhibited, all substitutions led to the formation of eccentric viruses that were subsequently blocked at reverse transcription in target cells. We provide evidence that premature degradation of the exposed vRNPs and separation of RT from the vRNPs underlies the reverse transcription defect of class II IN mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, our findings cement the view that IN binding to RNA accounts for the role of IN in accurate particle maturation and provide the mechanistic basis of why these viruses are blocked at reverse transcription in target cells.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model depicting how class II IN mutants exert their effects on HIV-1 replication.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54311-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In regard to the first case (i) above, it was previously shown that IN deletion leads to the formation of eccentric particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jurado et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that missense mutation that decreased IN levels in virions phenocopy IN deletion viruses. While it is also possible that these substitutions additionally affected IN binding to vRNA or multimerization, we could not reliably address these possibilities due to the extremely low levels of these proteins in virions.</p><p>Our results with different oligomeric states of WT IN show that the tetramers rather than dimers or monomers can effectively bind and bridge cognate RNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Consistent with these observations, a number of substitutions (V165A, K186E, K188E, and K236E) that compromised IN tetramerization also exhibited reduced binding affinity to RNA and failed to bridge between separate RNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). More pronounced effects observed with bridging versus binding assays, suggest greater importance of IN tetramerization for forming functionally critical IN-RNA condensates. It is possible that IN dimers can weakly bind RNA, but they are unable to accommodate and bridge multiple RNA oligonucleotides. By contrast, IN tetramers can both bind with higher affinity and provide a larger binding interface to recruit additional RNA molecules. In turn, the ability of IN tetramers to bridge between different segments of viral RNA could be essential for the formation of stable IN-RNA condensates in virions. Consistent with this notion, all class II substitutions that compromised IN tetramerization also failed to form stable IN-RNA complex in virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The structural basis for IN binding to RNA is not yet known and it is possible that IN tetramers in the complex with viral RNA differ substantially from those bound to viral DNA within the intasome complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Nonetheless, our findings indicate the importance of IN tetramers for the formation of productive IN-RNA complexes.</p><p>Based on MS-based footprinting experiments in vitro, we previously found that positively charged residues within the CTD of IN (i.e. K264, K266, K273) directly contact RNA, as was also validated by CLIP experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessl et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings here suggest that IN-vRNA contacts may extend to nearby basic residues within the CTD, such as R262 and R263, and perhaps more surprisingly, K34 within the IN NTD, as alterations of these residues did not prevent IN tetramerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>) but completely abolished IN-vRNA binding in virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and reduced RNA-binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). This raises the possibility of a second RNA-binding site in the IN NTD. Structural analysis of IN in complex with RNA will be essential to definitively determine how IN binds RNA as well as the precise multimeric species required for binding and bridging/condensation.</p><p>The mechanism by which IN-vRNA interactions mediate the encapsidation of vRNPs inside the CA lattice remains unknown. One possibility is that the temporal coordination of proteolytic cleavage events during maturation is influenced by IN-vRNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Könnyű et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pettit et al., 2005</xref>). In this scenario, the assembly of the CA lattice may become out of sync with the compaction of vRNA by NC. Another possibility is that IN-vRNA complexes nucleate the assembly of the CA lattice, perhaps by directly binding to CA. Notably, the biochemical assays performed herein show that class II IN substitutions do not appear to affect the assembly and stability of the CA lattice in vitro and in target cells. Although this finding is in disagreement with the previously observed morphological aberrations of the CA lattice present in eccentric particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fontana et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the biochemical experiments used herein lack the level of sensitivity required to quantitatively assess these aberrations or that the cryo-ET procedure impacts the structure of the CA lattice in particular in eccentric virions due to the absence of a packaged vRNP complex. A further possibility is that while the CA lattice in class II IN mutant virions may appear morphologically aberrant, they may still uncoat similar to WT virions in target cells. Further studies deciphering the crosstalk between IN-RNA interactions and CA assembly will be critical to our understanding of the role of IN in accurate virion maturation.</p><p>While the mislocalization of the vRNA genome in eccentric particles can be accurately assessed by TEM analysis, precisely where IN is located in eccentric particles remains an open question. Earlier studies based on the biochemical separation of core components from detergent-treated IN R269A/K273A virions indicated that IN may also mislocalize outside the CA lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madison et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, only two class II IN mutants (K34A and R262A/R263A) revealed this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). It is intriguing that the bimodal distribution of IN in this experimental setting was only seen with IN mutants that directly inhibited IN binding to vRNA. A possible explanation for these observations is that improperly multimerized IN is retained within the CA lattice or in association with it. Alternatively, class II IN mutants that may localize outside of the CA lattice form dense aggregates and as a result migrate similar to WT IN. The fact that select class II IN mutants migrate similar to WT IN upon CA destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) but are rapidly lost in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), strongly suggests the latter possibility.</p><p>Why is the unprotected vRNA and IN prematurely lost in target cells? It seems evident that the protection afforded by the CA lattice matters the most for vRNP stability, though we cannot rule out that IN binding to vRNA may in and of itself stabilize both the genome and IN. Alternatively, the AU-rich nucleotide content of HIV-1 may destabilize its RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Maldarelli et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schwartz et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schwartz et al., 1992b</xref>), similar to several cellular mRNAs that encode for cytokines and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu and Brewer, 2012</xref>). Finally, RNA nicking and deadenylation in virions by virion-associated enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gorelick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sakuragi et al., 2001</xref>) may predispose retroviral genomes to degradation when they are prematurely exposed to the cytosolic milieu. While cytosolic IN undergoes proteasomal degradation when expressed alone in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mulder and Muesing, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Llano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devroe et al., 2003</xref>), we have found previously that proteasome inhibition does not rescue vRNA or IN in target cells infected with a class II IN mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madison et al., 2017</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine whether a specific cellular mechanism or an inherent instability of vRNPs is responsible for the loss of vRNA in infected cells.</p><p>Although the basic aspects of virion maturation are conserved, particle morphologies are vastly different across retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). It is currently unknown whether IN molecules of other retroviruses regulate viral maturation through binding to vRNAs. Interestingly, mutations within the C-terminus of murine leukemia virus (MLV) IN can similarly cause defects in reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Steinrigl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lai et al., 2001</xref>), raising the possibility of a conserved role for IN in particle maturation and reverse transcription across retroviruses.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified IN-vRNA binding as the underlying factor for the role of IN in virion morphogenesis and show that virion morphogenesis is necessary to prevent the premature loss of vRNA and IN early in the HIV-1 lifecycle. Despite relatively high barriers, drugs that inhibit the catalytic activity of IN do select for resistance, and additional drug classes that inhibit IN activity through novel mechanisms of action would be a valuable addition to currently available treatments. The finding that IN-vRNA interaction can be inhibited in multiple ways – by directly altering residues in the IN CTD or by altering IN multimerization in virions – can help guide the design of future anti-retroviral compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (human <break/>immunodeficiency virus type 1)</td><td valign="top">Integrase (IN)</td><td valign="top">NCBI (NC_001802.1)</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 155348</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DH10B</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">EC0113</td><td valign="top">Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">C600003</td><td valign="top">Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-11268</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TZM-bl</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagent Program</td><td valign="top">8129</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pgsA-745</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-2242</td><td valign="top">Xylosyltransferase I deficient</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MT-4</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagent Program</td><td valign="top">120</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIV-1 integrase-4 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouyac-Bertoia et al., 2001</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">WB (1:4000), IP (5 μL/100 μL of Dyna beads)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIV-1 integrase-1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagent Program</td><td valign="top">183-H12-5C</td><td valign="top">WB (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIV-1 reverse transcriptase antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagent Program</td><td valign="top">6195</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIV-1 Vpr antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagent Program</td><td valign="top">11836</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIV-1 MA antibody (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagent Program</td><td valign="top">4811</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit</td><td valign="top">Agilent Technologies</td><td valign="top">Cat# 200519</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">Cat# 69506</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">RNAScope F luorescent Multiplex Detection Reagents</td><td valign="top">Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td valign="top">Ref# 320851</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Nevirapine</td><td valign="top">NIH AIDS Reagents</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The pNLGP plasmid consisting of the HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> -derived Gag-Pol sequence inserted into the pCR/V1 plasmid backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zennou et al., 2004</xref>) and the CCGW vector genome plasmid carrying a GFP reporter under the control of the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cowan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hatziioannou et al., 2003</xref>) were previously described.

A SYBR-Green-based Q-PCR assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pizzato et al., 2009</xref>) was used to determine RT activity in the collected sucrose fractions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Visualization of vRNA in infected cells</title><p>Viral RNA was visualized in infected cells according to the published multiplex immunofluorescent cell-based detection of DNA, RNA, and Protein (MICDDRP) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Puray-Chavez et al., 2017</xref>). VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> virus stocks were prepared as described above and concentrated 40X using a lentivirus precipitation solution (ALSTEM). PgsA-745 cells were plated on 1.5 mm collagen-treated coverslips (GG-12–1.5-Collagen, Neuvitro) placed in 24-well plates 1 d before infection. Synchronized infections were performed by incubating pre-chilled virus inoculum on the cells for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were infected with WT virus at an MOI of 0.5, or with an equivalent number (normalized by RNA copy number) of IN mutant viral particles. After removal of the virus, inoculum cells were washed with PBS and either immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, or incubated at 37°C for 2 hr before fixing. To prevent loss of vRNA due to reverse-transcription, cells were infected and incubated in the presence of 25 μM nevirapine. Following fixation, cells were dehydrated with ethanol and stored at −20°C. Before probing for vRNA, cells were rehydrated, incubated in 0.1% Tween in PBS for 10 min, and mounted on slides. Probing was performed using RNAScope probes and reagents (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Briefly, coverslips were treated with protease solution for 15 min in a humidified HybEZ oven (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) at 40°C. The coverslips were then washed with PBS and pre-designed anti-sense probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Puray-Chavez et al., 2017</xref>) specific for HIV-1 vRNA were applied and allowed to hybridize with the samples in a humidified HybEZ oven at 40°C for 2 hr. The probes were visualized by hybridizing with preamplifiers, amplifiers, and finally, a fluorescent label. First, pre-amplifier 1 (Amp 1-FL) was hybridized to its cognate probe for 30 min in a humidified HybEZ oven at 40°C. Samples were then subsequently incubated with Amp 2-FL, Amp 3-FL, and Amp 4A-FL for 15 min, 30 min, and 15 min, respectively. Between adding amplifiers, the coverslips were washed with a proprietary wash buffer. Nuclei were stained with DAPI diluted in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Finally, coverslips were washed in PBST followed by PBS and then mounted on slides using Prolong Gold Antifade.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Microscopy and image quantification</title><p>Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan confocal microscope equipped with a × 63/1.4 oil-immersion objective using the Airyscan super-resolution mode. Ten images were taken for each sample using the × 63 objective. Numbers of nuclei and vRNA punctae in images were counted using Volocity software (Quorum Technologies). The number of vRNA punctae per 100 nuclei were recorded at 0 hr post-infection (hpi) and 2 hpi for each virus, and the number at 2 hpi compared to the number at 0 hpi.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Analysis of the fate of vRNA genome in MT4 cells</title><p>MT-4 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 NL4-3 WT or an equivalent number of mutant viruses (normalized by RT activity) synchronously at 4°C. After removal of virus inoculum and extensive washes with PBS, cells were incubated at 37°C for 6 hr in the presence of 25 μM nevirapine. Immediately after synchronization (0 hr) and at 2 and 6 hr post-infection samples were taken from the infected cultures and RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent. The amount of vRNA was measured by Q-RT-PCR.</p><p>For each experiment, IN signal was normalized to CA signal for each virus, and the resulting value compared to that of WT (set at 100%). Reported values are the average value (as a percent of WT) and standard deviation (SD) between four independent experiments. Mutants with less than 20% IN signal of WT are highlighted in gray.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Michael Malim for providing the anti-IN monoclonal antibody and members of the Tolia lab for assisting in PyMol analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Freed (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Elliott and colleagues investigate the properties of &quot;class II&quot; HIV-1 integrase (IN) mutants. These class II HIV-1 integrase mutants do not compromise the catalytic activity of the enzyme but severely impair viral replication. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, but aberrant virion morphology is a hallmark of this class of mutant.</p><p>The authors suggest that these mutants interfere with binding between IN and the viral RNA by one of three mechanisms: (1) reducing IN levels in virions, (2) inhibiting IN multimerization, and/or (3) directly disrupting IN-RNA interactions. The results point to an essential role for integrase/RNA interactions during maturation of virions.</p><p>This study provides significant new insights into the properties of class II IN mutants, which have for long been of interest and display properties that are mirrored by allosteric IN inhibitors. The experimental data is solid and clearly presented.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors analyze a diverse collection of previously obscure class II IN mutants and provide evidence that many of them are defective for the formation of tetramers and that it is the tetrameric form that binds viral RNA. Their data seem to clarify the location of defective IN, which they show is associated with HIV-1 cores (biochemical fractionation, Figure 6), while the RNA genome is outside (according to EM, Figure 5). It was refreshing to see all these mutants, including δ-IN and H12N, analyzed using several complementary approaches side-by-side. However, a few issues outlined below need to be carefully addressed.</p><p>1) The conclusion that RNA binding is exclusive to the tetrameric form of IN is very important in this work, and it does make sense. Please add more evidence that the HIV needs IN tetramer to bind RNA. In the current manuscript, this conclusion is based on a single experiment (Figure 4C): WT IN was separated into tetramer, dimer and a monomer by SEC, and the three fractions are tested for the ability to bind RNA. Are these forms really not supposed to interconvert? For example, what if dimers do bind RNA, but they fall apart during chromatography and/or downstream processing? Would it not be better to test RNA binding with class II mutants that fail to form tetramers (Figure 4B: K188E, K236E)? In addition, there are HIV-1 IN mutants that do not form tetramers as recombinant proteins (K186E or Y15A, for example); would these not bind RNA? It would be essential to expand Figure 4D including mutations of residues that are not expected to interact with vRNA directly. Because IN mutants stick with cores whilst vRNA is not (Figure 6 and Figure 5), they may be physically separated within virions. The CLIP data (Figure 3B) is consistent with this and could be a consequence of the physical separation. This is another reason to test RNA binding by these mutants directly.</p><p>The crosslinking results in Figure 4A do not seem very convincing: there are high-MW IN species visible for all mutants. Perhaps some of them are hetero-multimer crosslinks (i.e. with other proteins in the virion?). SEC data, such as in panel B, are much clearer; I would suggest including more mutants in this analysis.</p><p>Moreover, it is not clear how reproducible the cross-linking patterns are (and the WT in the third panel looks very different from the WTs in the first and second panels). The cross-linking results, to the extent that they can be interpreted, appear to be very different from the SEC profiles shown in Figure 4B. The authors conclude (subsection “IN multimerization plays a key role in RNA binding”) that the majority of class II IN mutants are predominantly monomeric in virions, yet the majority of the protein is found in high-MW aggregates. This issue needs to be addressed.</p><p>2) The key issue of whether the IN mutants are excluded or not from viral cores needs to be clarified. The sedimentation of the majority of IN mutants in the dense, CA-containing fractions in Figure 6A would seem to suggest that these mutant IN proteins are located within the viral capsid. However, in the cell-based uncoating assay, the IN mutants are degraded (Figure 7C) while a high percentage of capsids remain intact at the 2 hour time point (Figure 7B). These data suggest that the mutant IN proteins are excluded from the protective environment of the capsid and are thus rapidly degraded. Indeed, in the model figure (Figure 8), these mutants are depicted as being outside the cores. One possible solution to this conundrum is that the IN mutants are prone to aggregation under the conditions used in Figure 6 and thus co-sediment with CA without actually being inside the capsid.

Their data seem to clarify the location of defective IN, which they show is associated with HIV-1 cores (biochemical fractionation, Figure 6), while the RNA genome is outside (according to EM, Figure 5). It was refreshing to see all these mutants, including δ-IN and H12N, analyzed using several complementary approaches side-by-side. However, a few issues outlined below need to be carefully addressed.</p><p>1) The conclusion that RNA binding is exclusive to the tetrameric form of IN is very important in this work, and it does make sense. Please add more evidence that the HIV needs IN tetramer to bind RNA. In the current manuscript, this conclusion is based on a single experiment (Figure 4C): WT IN was separated into tetramer, dimer and a monomer by SEC, and the three fractions are tested for the ability to bind RNA. Are these forms really not supposed to interconvert? For example, what if dimers do bind RNA, but they fall apart during chromatography and/or downstream processing? Would it not be better to test RNA binding with class II mutants that fail to form tetramers (Figure 4B: K188E, K236E)? In addition, there are HIV-1 IN mutants that do not form tetramers as recombinant proteins (K186E or Y15A, for example); would these not bind RNA? It would be essential to expand Figure 4D including mutations of residues that are not expected to interact with vRNA directly. Because IN mutants stick with cores whilst vRNA is not (Figure 6 and Figure 5), they may be physically separated within virions. The CLIP data (Figure 3B) is consistent with this and could be a consequence of the physical separation. This is another reason to test RNA binding by these mutants directly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. As suggested, we have determined the RNA binding properties of additional mutants that do not form tetramers in vitro (K186E, K188E and K236E) alongside with K34A, R262A/R263A and the canonical class II IN mutant V165A using an RNA binding and RNA-bridging assay (Kessl et al., 2016) as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 of the current manuscript. The latter approach relies on IN-mediated bridging of fluorescently labeled target RNA oligonucleotides (i.e. TAR) and as such is a good proxy for assessing the multimerization-dependent RNA binding ability of IN. First, we show that all other class II IN mutants have reduced affinities towards RNAs. Second, we show that WT IN tetramers but not dimers are able to bridge between separate target RNAs. Third, we show that all of the class II IN mutants tested exhibit substantially lower levels of RNA bridging activity. Taken together, these results strongly argue that IN multimerization is critical for the RNA binding/bridging ability of IN. Responses to the other suggestions/criticisms, which were also raised by other reviewers, are detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The crosslinking results in Figure 4A do not seem very convincing: there are high-MW IN species visible for all mutants. Perhaps some of them are hetero-multimer crosslinks (i.e. with other proteins in the virion?). SEC data, such as in panel B, are much clearer; I would suggest including more mutants in this analysis.Moreover, it is not clear how reproducible the cross-linking patterns are (and the WT in the third panel looks very different from the WTs in the first and second panels). The cross-linking results, to the extent that they can be interpreted, appear to be very different from the SEC profiles shown in Figure 4B. The authors conclude (subsection “IN multimerization plays a key role in RNA binding”) that the majority of class II IN mutants are predominantly monomeric in virions, yet the majority of the protein is found in high-MW aggregates. This issue needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises important points and we addressed these concerns as follows. First, we have now included SEC profiles of other IN mutants (V165A, R199A, Q214L/Q216L and K258A), which show that many formed dimers but had defects in tetramerization in vitro (Figure 4B). Second, we have generated a table (Supplementary file 2), which summarizes published work on the multimerization properties of the class II IN mutants studied herein. Third, we have now included quantitation of IN multimers from three independent biological replicates for in virion crosslinking experiments in Figure 4A, which convincingly illustrate the multimerization defects of the IN mutants. Fourth, we have changed the text to clarify the experimental results.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in these experiments, a large fraction of the signal is found in high MW aggregates. While the multimerization experiments in virions are more physiologically relevant, they are also inherently more complex. For example, we cannot distinguish whether these high molecular weight species represent aberrant IN multimerization products, aggregates or crosslinking between IN and other viral proteins. Another possibility is that these high molecular weight species may not resolve well in this system on the 6% Tris-acetate gels, which unfortunately is a limitation of this approach. Notwithstanding, we believe that the quantitation of data from multiple experiments as provided now reveals consistent patterns in the multimerization properties of the class II mutants in virions.</p><p>Finally, we do not think that in vitro SEC profiles can be directly compared to the results obtained from in virion crosslinking experiments for several reasons. First, as chemical crosslinking is not 100% efficient and because the crosslinked proteins are separated under denaturing/reducing conditions, the in virion crosslinking assay may not report on the actual form and amount of IN multimers in virions. Second, as indicated above, crosslinking experiments done in virions are inherently more complex due to the presence of other viral proteins/RNAs that may be within close proximity of IN. Third, while the in vitro SEC experiments provide key information on the intrinsic properties of IN, they may not correlate 100% with the actual multimeric form of IN within the more complex setting of the virion. Thus, while each approach has limitations, we believe that they are complementary and highlight the importance of IN multimerization in RNA binding as a whole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The key issue of whether the IN mutants are excluded or not from viral cores needs to be clarified. The sedimentation of the majority of IN mutants in the dense, CA-containing fractions in Figure 6A would seem to suggest that these mutant IN proteins are located within the viral capsid. However, in the cell-based uncoating assay, the IN mutants are degraded (Figure 7C) while a high percentage of capsids remain intact at the 2 hour time point (Figure 7B). These data suggest that the mutant IN proteins are excluded from the protective environment of the capsid and are thus rapidly degraded. Indeed, in the model figure (Figure 8), these mutants are depicted as being outside the cores. One possible solution to this conundrum is that the IN mutants are prone to aggregation under the conditions used in Figure 6 and thus co-sediment with CA without actually being inside the capsid. In any case, as currently presented, the data appear to be in contradiction and leave this important question unresolved.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important and interesting point that we also have thought of. We completely agree with the reviewer on the conclusions derived from the data and have clarified this point further in the text. Demonstrating precisely where within the virions class II IN mutants are located extends beyond the scope of this paper and future studies are warranted to study this process in detail. For example, we tried to directly assess where IN is located in virions by immunogold EM; however, these experiments suffered from low resolution and contrast due to the differences in this particular protocol compared to the standard EM procedures conducted in this study. This was compounded by the epitope inaccessibility for the antibodies used (we tried a total of 4 separate monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies) under the fixation conditions required for immunogold-EM experiments.</p><p>As an alternative, we took a biochemical approach to assess whether we can separate class II IN mutants from the CA lattice. To this end, we took advantage of previously defined capsid destabilizing mutation K203A. We reasoned that if the class II IN mutants are not bound to RNA and kept inside the CA lattice, CA destabilization would alter their migration pattern in biochemical fractionation experiments as done in Figure 7 of this manuscript. To our surprise, we found that CA destabilization did not alter the migration patterns of class II IN mutants. To completely rule out the possibility that class II IN mutants are still bound to RNA (which would explain their migration in dense fractions), we conducted similar experiments in viruses lacking NC, and thus are devoid of RNA, or in the presence of RNase throughout the fractionation protocol. Migration pattern of IN remained unaffected under these conditions either, making it difficult to assess whether class II IN mutants are located inside the CA lattice or are aggregated. These data are now included in the Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Based on these results, and as suggested by the reviewer, we favor the model that class II IN mutants are mislocalized outside of the CA lattice but likely form aggregates as they are prematurely degraded in target cells. This point is now clearly made in the text leading to this figure and in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data presented in Figure 8 suggest that the class II IN mutations do not affect the assembly or stability of the CA lattice either in vitro or in target cells (but see Fontana et al., 2015). Yet, in the Figure 8 model, the capsid is shown as discontinuous or &quot;broken&quot; in the context of the IN mutants, a feature that would presumably significantly compromise capsid stability. The model thus appears to be inconsistent with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point. We modified the model such that the CA lattice is complete as the data provided here do indeed suggest that CA assembly and stability are unaffected. The possible reasons for the discrepancy between our work and Fontana et al., 2015 are discussed in the text. The current text reads:</p><p>“Although this finding is in disagreement with the previously observed morphological aberrations of the CA lattice present in eccentric particles [26], it is possible that the biochemical experiments used herein lack the level of sensitivity required to quantitatively assess these aberrations or that the cryo-ET procedure impacts the structure of the CA lattice in particular in eccentric virions due to the absence of a packaged vRNP complex. A further possibility is that while the CA lattice in class II IN mutant virions may appear morphologically aberrant, they may still uncoat similar to WT virions in target cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The difference between tetramers, dimers and monomers in Figure 4C is surprising. The species would be expected to re-equilibrate after SEC. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point. While it is possible that the collected monomers and multimeric IN species can interconvert, we minimize this by subjecting the collected fractions from SEC immediately to the α screen assay. Thus, even if a fraction of dimers is converting to tetramers, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall outcome of these experiments. The fact that we are observing a profound difference in the RNA binding properties of tetramers vs. dimers and monomers (for WT) indicates that the samples do not re-equilibrate at appreciable levels during the course of these experiments. Otherwise, we would observe similar levels of binding to viral RNAs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
