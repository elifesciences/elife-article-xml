mechanism to establish a growing lesion is unknown. Here, we have combined ultra-sensitive bioluminescence imaging with intravital two-photon microscopy involving genetically encoded biosensors to examine this question. NK cells eliminated disseminated tumor cells from the lung within 24 hr of arrival, but not thereafter. Intravital dynamic imaging revealed that 50% of NK-tumor cell encounters lead to tumor cell death in the first 4 hr after tumor cell arrival, but after 24 hr of arrival, nearly 100% of the interactions result in the survival of the tumor cell. During this 24-hr period, the probability of ERK activation in NK cells upon encountering the tumor cells was decreased from 68% to 8%, which correlated with the loss of the activating ligand CD155/PVR/Necl5 from the tumor cell surface. Thus, by quantitatively visualizing, the NK-tumor cell interaction at the early stage of metastasis, we have revealed the crucial parameters of NK cell immune surveillance in the lung.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>tumor immunology</kwd><kwd>lung metastasis</kwd><kwd>circulating tumor cell</kwd><kwd>intravital imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K15317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichise</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H00993</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19gm5010003h0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004906</institution-id><institution>Fugaku Trust for Medicinal Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>Michiyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live imaging of the duel of an NK cell versus a metastatic cancer cell on pulmonary epithelial cells reveals a novel survival tactics adopted by cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that play critical roles in protecting against the development of tumor metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiossone et al., 2018</xref>). In human patients, a higher number of circulating or tumor-infiltrating NK cells is correlated with better patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LÃ³pez-Soto et al., 2017</xref>). In immunocompetent mice, selective depletion of NK cells markedly increases the metastatic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diefenbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smyth et al., 1999</xref>). Most of these previous studies relied on the number of macro-metastatic tumors as a single functional endpoint, preventing insight into the step(s) of the metastatic cascade at which NK cells play the most critical role. Metastasis involves the migration of a tumor cell or tumor cell cluster from the primary cancer site through the blood, lodging of the migrating cells in a micro-vessel, and the transmigration of the cell(s) into the tissue parenchyma, where they may either remain dormant or grow into a larger tumor mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta and MassaguÃ©, 2006</xref>). Given this sequence of events, it is unknown where NK cell attack on the malignant cells giving rise to a metastatic lesion takes place. Using a newly developed method of intravascular staining of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>), it was shown that more than 90% of NK cells in the mouse lung are in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Secklehner et al., 2019</xref>). In agreement with this finding, the major NK cell subset in the lung is similar to that in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marquardt et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, it has also been proposed that NK cells in the normal lung are incompetent or hypofunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marquardt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robinson et al., 1984</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear how pulmonary NK cells are able to prevent tumor cells from colonization in the lung.</p><p>Inhibition of platelets and coagulation factors has long been associated with the suppression of lung metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gasic et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pearlstein et al., 1984</xref>). At least a part of the pro-metastatic effect of the coagulation cascade is attributed to inhibition of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nieswandt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Palumbo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sadallah et al., 2016</xref>). But other mechanisms such as enhanced adhesion of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nierodzik et al., 1992</xref>), formation of a favorable intravascular metastatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lucotti et al., 2019</xref>), or TGF-Î²1-mediated immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Metelli et al., 2020</xref>) have also been proposed. Therefore, a method to untangle the metastatic cascade in vivo is needed to quantitatively assess the effect of anticoagulants on each step and the possible relationship of this anti-metastatic action to the function of NK cells.</p><p>Intravital two-photon (2P) microscopy enables visualization of the interaction of immune cells with other immune cells or their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cyster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Germain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liew and Kubes, 2015</xref>). For example, the dynamic behaviors of NK cells have been demonstrated in the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">BajÃ©noff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beuneu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mingozzi et al., 2016</xref>) and the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deguine et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the development of genetically encoded biosensors for signaling molecules has paved the way to monitoring of cellular activation status in not only normal but also pathological tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Terai et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have combined bioluminescence whole-body imaging and intravital 2P microscopy to explore the behavior and functional competence of NK cells in an experimental lung metastasis model. Using an ultra-sensitive bioluminescence system, we followed the fate of intravenously injected tumor cells from 5 min to 10 days. The number of viable disseminated tumor cells in the lung decrease rapidly and reach a nadir within 12<bold>â</bold>24 hr in an NK cell-dependent manner. Intravital 2P microscopy demonstrates that a static tumor cell in a pulmonary capillary is contacted by a crawling NK cell approximately every 2 hr. Importantly, the probability of NK cell activation and subsequent elimination of the lodged tumor cell decreases rapidly after 24 hr of arrival in the lung capillary bed. We show that this evasion of NK cell surveillance is inversely correlated with thrombin-dependent shedding of CD155/PVR/Necl5 (hereafter simply Necl5), a ligand for the NK cell-activating receptor DNAM-1. This loss of surface activating ligand limits the signaling needed to invoke NK cytotoxicity, thus protecting the tumor cell and enabling the formation of a growing metastatic lesion. Anticoagulants promote tumor killing by NK cells by limiting this loss of activating ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NK cells eliminate disseminated tumor cells within 12â24 hr after the entry into the lung</title><p>Development of an extremely bright bioluminescence imaging system, AkaBLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwano et al., 2018</xref>), enabled us to visualize the acute phase of lung metastasis and to explore the role of NK cells in the elimination of disseminated tumor cells. B16F10 melanoma cells were transduced with Akaluc luciferase, and the resulting cells, called B16-Akaluc cells hereafter, were injected intravenously into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice that had previously been injected with either an anti-asialo GM1 (Î±AGM1 hereafter) antibody or an isotype control antibody. The pretreatment with Î±AGM1 removed more than 97% of NK cells from the spleen and the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Immediately after the intravenous injection of tumor cells, we administered AkaLumine luciferin intraperitoneally (i.p.) and started bioluminescence imaging under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>). A bioluminescence signal in the control mice was observed almost exclusively in the lung and decreased rapidly in the first 20 min, then gradually thereafter. In the Î±AGM1-treated mice, the bioluminescence signal dropped rapidly as observed in the control mice; however, the decrease was substantially reduced after 20 min as compared to control animals. Thus, in the initial phase (&lt;180 min), there are at least two mechanisms that eliminate melanoma cells from the lung. The rapid elimination of melanoma cells (&lt;20 min) may reflect flushing away by the blood flow or shear-stress-mediated cell death. The slow component of the elimination (&gt;20 min) observed in the control mice is caused primarily by NK cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NK cells eliminate a subset of metastatic tumor cells from the lung within 24 hr of arrival.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) B6 mice were pretreated with either control antibody or Î±AGM1.

NK, natural killer.</p></caption></media></fig-group><p>To explore the NK cell-mediated elimination of tumor cells after the early rapid phase decline (1 hr to 8 days), we administered luciferin immediately before each round of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The bioluminescence signals were normalized to that at 1 hr after B16-Akaluc injection in each mouse. In the control mice, the bioluminescence signal of melanoma cells reached a nadir 24 hr after tumor cell injection and increased thereafter, indicating proliferation of melanoma cells. On the other hand, in the Î±AGM1-treated mice, the bioluminescence signal decreased very little after 4 hr and started increasing after 12 hr. Importantly, after 24 hr, we did not observe any significant difference in the relative increase of the bioluminescence signal between the control and Î±AGM1-treated mice. In both mice, the doubling time of melanoma cells is approximately 1 day, implying that NK cells eliminate disseminated melanoma cells primarily in the acute phase (&lt;24 hr) of lung metastasis. In tumor burden mice, the lung microenvironment is often reprogrammed in favor of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altorki et al., 2019</xref>). To test this possibility, B16F10 melanoma cells were inoculated into the footpad 2 weeks prior to the intravenous injection of the B16-Akaluc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In this model, B16F10 melanoma cells continue to grow at the footpad until the day of B16-Akaluc cell injection. Î±AGM1 treatment hampered the rapid decrease of the bioluminescence signal, suggesting that NK cell-mediated elimination of metastatic melanoma cells operates in the melanoma-burdened mice as well.</p><p>We extended this approach to other syngeneic mouse tumor cell lines: Braf<sup>V600E</sup> melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhomen et al., 2009</xref>), MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rosenberg et al., 1986</xref>), and BALB/c mice-derived 4T1 breast cancer cells (hereinafter called 4T1-Akaluk). The rapid decrease of bioluminescence signals was markedly alleviated by Î±AGM1, supporting the critical role of NK cells in the acute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>). It has been reported that the Î±AGM1 reacts with basophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nishikado et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we repeated the experiment using an Î±CD200R3 basophil-depleting antibody (Ba103). The basophil depletion did not affect the elimination of melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Similarly, the roles of circulating monocytes and neutrophils were examined with clodronate liposome and Î±Ly-6G neutrophil antibody, respectively. Neither treatment mitigated the melanoma elimination within 24 hr of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3CâF</xref>). Although the effect of these reagents to eliminate monocytes and neutrophils was not complete, these data suggest the involvement of monocytes and neutrophils in the rejection of melanoma cells in the acute phase.</p><p>The effect of T cell immunity on tumor elimination was examined by using <italic>Foxn1<sup>nu/nu</sup></italic> mice (hereinafter called nude mice). 4T1-Akaluc cells were injected into nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). 4T1-Akaluc cells were eliminated in mice as efficiently as in wild-type (WT) mice in an NK cell-dependent manner, indicating that under these conditions, T cell immunity does not contribute to tumor cell reduction in the acute phase of rejection (&lt;24 hr). To further explore the NK cell-mediated tumor cell elimination in a spontaneous metastasis model, 4T1-Akaluc cells were inoculated into the footpad of WT and nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâG</xref>). The Î±AGM1 treatment did not affect the growth of the primary tumor, but suppressed lung metastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). These results indicate the critical role of NK cells in the elimination of disseminated tumor cells. The experiment with nude mice also excluded the involvement of NKT and Î³Î´ T cells, with which Î±AGM1 reacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trambley et al., 1999</xref>). Of note, ILC1 cells also react with Î±AGM1. But, ILC1 is known to promote lung metastasis of B16F10 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the effect of Î±AGM1 is primarily caused by the depletion of NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NK cell dynamic behavior in pulmonary capillaries</title><p>To better understand how NK cells mediate rapid elimination of metastatic tumor cells, we examined their topographic distribution and dynamics in the lung. We first assessed the localization of NK cells by intravascular staining with Î±CD45 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>), followed by flow cytometry with Î±CD45, Î±CD3, and Î±NCR1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasteiger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Secklehner et al., 2019</xref>), more than 95% of pulmonary NK cells (CD45<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>â</sup>, and NCR1<sup>+</sup>) were found in the vasculature, compared to 20% of bone marrow NK cells. To study the dynamics of NK cell-mediated immune surveillance in the lung, we developed a reporter line, NK-tdTomato mice, whose NK cells, or more specifically, NCR1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2011</xref>), express the fluorescent protein tdTomato. Next, we employed in vivo pulmonary imaging by 2P microscopy to observe NK cells in situ for up to 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In agreement with the flow cytometric data, most NK cells were found within the capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). NK cells flowing in the capillaries stalled on endothelial cells, crawled a short distance, and jumped back into the flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). A histogram of the crawling time exhibited exponential decay with a median of 2.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). NK cells are known to express at least two integrin-family proteins, LFA-1 (LFA-1Î±/CD18 and Î±LÎ²2) and Mac-1 (Mac-1/CD18 and Î±MÎ²2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Intravenous injection of the blocking antibody against LFA-1Î± (Î±LFA-1Î±) resulted in a reduction of NK cells on the pulmonary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To extend this observation, we counted the number of NK cells on the endothelial cells in the presence or absence of Î±LFA-1Î±. As expected, Î±LFA-1Î±, but not Î±Mac-1, markedly reduced the number of NK cells on the pulmonary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that the adhesion of NK cells to the pulmonary endothelial cells is mediated at least partially by LFA-1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NK cells patrol pulmonary capillaries in a stall-crawl-jump manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the intravital imaging system for the lung.

In this experiment, we used B16-SCAT3 cells, which expressed the FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based caspase-3 biosensor SCAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takemoto et al., 2003</xref>). The ratio of NK cells versus tumor cells in the field of view (FOV) was set approximately 1:1. We compared the mean square displacement (MSD) of NK cells in the presence versus absence of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Curves fitted with the measured data represent Î±&lt;1 regardless of the presence of tumor cells, Î±=0.56 in the presence and Î±=0.53 in the absence, indicating that the migration mode of NK cells can be classified as sub-diffusive. This is probably because the migration of NK cells is limited to the pulmonary vascular structure. MSD analysis also shows that the displacement from the original position is smaller in the presence than in the absence of tumor cells. This observation is consistent with our present finding that the mean instantaneous speed of the crawling NK cells was significantly decelerated in the presence of tumor cells, from 7.8 to 4.8 Î¼m/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In accordance with this observation, the median duration time of crawling was markedly increased in the presence of tumor cells, from 5 to 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Notably, these data exclude regions in which the tumor cells would physically block NK movement in the capillary, suggesting that the dissemination of tumor cells causes global activation of pulmonary endothelial cells, and thereby causes slower crawling of NK cells. Taking advantage of these quantitative imaging data, we summarized parameters regarding the dynamics of pulmonary NK cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The parameters on flowing NK cells were deduced from the NK cell count in blood and the flow rate in pulmonary capillaries. In short, a tumor cell lodged in a pulmonary capillary will be contacted by the flowing and crawling NK cells roughly every 10 min and every 2 hr, respectively.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NK cells patrol capillaries deliberately in the presence of melanoma.</title><p>NK-tdTomato mice were injected with 1.5Ã10<sup>6</sup> B16-SCAT3 cells and observed under a 2P microscope for 2 hr from 6 hr after injection.

The speed of platelets in the lung capillaries (Plt_speed) was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sano et al., 2016</xref>). The speed of platelets in the pulmonary capillaries was roughly one-third of the speed of platelets in the arteriole of mouse bladder, 3.1 mm/s (0.186 m/min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sano et al., 2016</xref>). The capillary radius, diameter of NK cells, and number of NK cells in a field of view were determined on at least three images. Plt_speed and Cp_r were used to calculate the capillary flow rate (Cp_fr). To determine the total number of NK cells in the blood, 50 ÂµL of blood was collected from the right ventricle of 8- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice, lysed in ACK buffer (155 mM/L NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 10 mM/L KHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 0.1 mM/L EDTA), and analyzed by flow cytometry. The CD3<sup>â</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells were counted as NK cells. This number of NK cells is two- to threefold larger than that reported previously by using C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banh et al., 2012</xref>). The mean crawling speed on the endothelial cells is described in the text related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The probability of an NK cell hitting a tumor cell was determined by a MATLAB script (Main_191017.m). The probability of an NK cell killing a tumor cell was 0.5, based on the probability of induction of calcium influx in the target B16 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p></fn><fn><p>Total number of lung NK cells: The total number of NK cells residing in the lung (NK_lung) was estimated from the mean NK cell density (NK_density) and total lung volume (Lv). The diameter of an NK cell (NK_d) was used as the thickness of the image plane. The number of total NK cells, 2.4 million, is markedly larger than the previous values, which ranged from 0.2 to 1 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">GrÃ©goire et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). In previous studies, the whole lungs were lysed to count the blood cell number. It is possible that the recovery rate might have been low due to insufficient tissue lysis. As described in the main text, we observed comparable numbers of tumor cells and NK cells in each FOV, when 1.5Ã10<sup>6</sup> B16-SCAT cells were injected into NK-tdTomato mice, supporting the fidelity of the number of total NK cells determined in this study.</p></fn><fn><p>Dynamics of NK cells: Most of the pulmonary NK cells are within the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and the number of pulmonary NK cells overwhelms that of NK cells in the blood. Thus, the total number of lung NK cells can be used as the total number of NK cells in the lung vasculature. NK cell influx into the lung (NK_in) is obtained from cardiac output (CO) and NK cell count in the blood (NK_bl). If all NK cells stay in the lung with equal probability, the apparent transit time in the lung, or NK cell half-life in the lung, is calculated as 1.6 min from NK_in and NK_lung. This value is markedly smaller than the tracking duration period observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, indicating that the major population of NK cells in the blood go through the lung without adhesion to the endothelial cells. By using the capillary flow rate (Cp_fr) and NK cell count (NK_bl), the NK cell flow rate per capillary (NK_fr) is determined as 0.11 cells/min. Meanwhile, from the total length of capillaries (Cp_l) and the number of NK cells (NK_lung), NK cell density on the capillary (NK_dcp) is determined as 2.1 cells/mm. From NK_dcp and the crawling speed of NK cells, the probability of a tumor cell being hit by crawling NK cells (NK_hit_cr) becomes 0.010 cells/min. This value is approximately one-tenth of the flow rate of NK cells (NK_fr).</p></fn><fn><p>Dynamics of disseminated melanoma cells: The BLI signals from 1 to 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were fitted with MATLAB using the following equation: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.45</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> .</p></fn><fn><p>With this fitting, the decay rate decreases with time. Because we characterized the NK cell interaction with tumor cells between 4 and 8 hr after tumor cell injection, we determined the half-life of B16F-Akaluc cells from 4 hr (Ml_hl_BLI) and obtained 146 min. Meanwhile, from the probability of an NK cell hitting a tumor cell (NK_hit_obs) and the probability of an NK cell killing a tumor cell (NK_kill), the half-life of tumor cells (Ml_hl_2P_obs) becomes 173 min. If we adopt the probability of a tumor cell hit based on the crawling speed of NK cells, the expected half-life of tumor cells (Ml_hl_2P_crsp) becomes 137 min. Considering the precision of parameters obtained from in vivo imaging data, we believe that the half-life of melanoma cells estimated from the 2P microscopy reasonably matched the half-life of melanoma cells determined by BLI.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Necl5 and Nectin2 on tumor cells stimulate NK cell signaling leading to tumor cell killing</title><p>During serial killing of tumor cells by NK cells, perforin/GrzB initially plays a major role, followed by Fas-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prager et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we used two biosensors to detect NK cell-mediated killing in vivo: SCAT-3 for caspase activation by any pathway and GCaMP-6s for specific detection of the perforin/GrzB-mediated membrane damage. For the typical B16-SCAT3 cells, caspase-3 was activated 16 min after an NK cell came into contact with the tumor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>). The caspase-3 activation was observed in 18% of contact events within a median of 26 min after the contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). To examine the possible cause of this limited extent of measurable cell death after contact with an NK cell, we studied Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in tumor cells, which is known to herald apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keefe et al., 2005</xref>), by using two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and R-GECO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). In preliminary in vitro experiments, the B16F10 cells expressing R-GECO1 (B16-R-GECO) were co-cultured with NK cells that had been activated by IL-2 in vitro. Typically, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was observed within a few min after contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). A surge of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was observed only in cells that were doomed to die (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4âvideo 2</xref>); 98% of cells that exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx died by apoptosis with blebbing (Figure S5D). With these in vitro data in hand, we used the surge of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as the surrogate marker for apoptosis of metastatic melanoma cells in vivo. In a typical example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4âvideo 3</xref>), when an NK cell contacted a B16F10 cell expressing GCaMP6s (B16-GCaMP), Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was induced within 3 min. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was observed with a median lag of 6 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) in 47% of contact events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These data suggest that the reason why NK cells failed to induce caspase-3 activation in four-fifths of the tumor cells may be due to the limitation of observation period after the delivery of the lethal hit. In addition, the half-life of B16F10 cells based on the probability of an NK cell killing and crawling speed is 137 min whereas the one calculated based on the bioluminescence intensity (BLI) is 146 min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx well correlates with BLI. It is reported that DNAM-1 on NK cells contributes to the elimination of B16F10 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilfillan et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, to connect these data on tumor cell death with NK cell activation, we used B16F10 cells deficient in expression of CD155/PVR/Necl5 and CD112/Nectin2 and (Necl5 and Nectin2, hereafter), the ligands for the activating receptor DNAM-1 on NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2010</xref>).

Crawling NK cells accounted for 77% of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx events in the melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). To reveal the impact of the crawling NK cells, Î±LFA-1Î± was used to inhibit NK cell attachment to the pulmonary capillaries. This markedly attenuated the melanoma elimination not only within 24 hr, but also after 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). Our finding suggests that LFA-1 is required for the crawling of NK cells on the endothelial cells, and, thereby, for the immune surveillance against metastatic tumor cells. B16F10 cells do not express the LFA-1 ligands, ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), arguing against the possibility that Î±LFA-1Î± directly impairs the association of NK cells with B16F10 cells, a conclusion also consistent with a previous study that demonstrated that LFA-1 deficiency in NK cells did not abrogate the in vitro killing capacity against B16F10 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tumor-mediated stimulation of NK cells declines after several hours of pulmonary residence</title><p>To track tumor cell induction of NK cell activation, a key step in the killing process, we took advantage of evidence that engagement of LFA-1 or DNAM-1 with their ligands results in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). We isolated NK cells from transgenic mice expressing a FRET-based ERK biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>), and co-cultured them with B16F10 cells in vitro. Quantification of ERK activity in each NK cell during contact with the tumor cells demonstrated a positive correlation between ERK activation in NK cells and apoptosis in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Apoptosis was induced in 47% of tumor cells that were in contact with the ERK-activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). On the other hand, apoptosis was never observed in the tumor cells in contact with the NK cells that failed to exhibit ERK activation. In agreement with this observation, an inhibitor for MAPK/ERK kinase PD0325901, called MEKi hereafter, suppressed NK cell-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). When NK cells were sorted into DNAM-1<sup>+</sup> and DNAM-1<sup>â</sup>, ERK was activated more potently in DNAM-1<sup>+</sup> NK cells than in DNAM-1<sup>â</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). In line with this observation, ERK was not activated in NK cells when B16F10 cells deficient from DNAM-1 ligands were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

For this, we developed reporter mice whose NK cells express the FRET biosensor for ERK, hereinafter called NK-ERK mice. Intravenous injection of B16-GCaMP cells into NK-ERK mice allowed for simultaneous observation of ERK activity in NK cells and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in melanoma cells. In a representative example, ERK was activated 2.5 min after an NK cellâs contact with a melanoma cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, magenta), followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the melanoma cells at 5.5 min and cell death at 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lower panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, green). ERK activation, defined by a more than 30% increase in the FRET/CFP ratio, was observed within 3 min in 60 NK cells during 88 contact events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was observed at a median of 4 min in 43 of the 60 tumor cells that came into contact with the NK cell having ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We did not observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in 28 tumor cells that were touched by the NK cells that failed to show evidence of ERK activation. This result supports the notion that ERK activation in NK cells contributes to the induction of apoptosis in the target tumor cells. Importantly, 24 hr after injection, the probability of ERK activation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was markedly decreased, indicating NK cells lose the capacity to activate in response to capillary-lodged tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).</p><p>These results imply that NK cells in the lung are exhausted in 24 hr. Our quantitative data shows that 2.4 million NK cells in the lung outnumber 0.5 million melanoma cells injected into circulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, if NK cell exhaustion could happen, it is not caused by the killing of tumor cells, but by an indirect mechanism such as cytokine-induced suppression or endothelial cell-mediated inactivation. To understand the basis for this loss of NK cell activity by 24 hr after tumor arrival in the lung, B16F10 melanoma cells without Akaluc were injected 24 hr before the injection of B16-Akaluc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We did not observe any effect of the pre-injected B16F10 cells on the time course of clearance of the B16-Akaluc cells, indicating that NK cells do not lose tumoricidal activity, but that over time, the tumor cells acquire the capacity to evade NK cell surveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Thrombin-mediated shedding of Necl5 correlates evasion of NK cell surveillance</title><p>DNAM-1-mediated signaling contributes to tumoricidal activity of NK cells, leading us to reason that cell surface expression of the DNAM-1 ligands Necl5 and Nectin2 may diminish over this time period. Because the expression of Nectin2 was significantly less than that of Necl5 in B16F10 melanoma cells, we focused on Necl5. As anticipated, cell surface expression of Necl5 was markedly decreased in tumor cells isolated from the lungs 24 hr after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To explore the basis for this change, we expressed a recombinant Necl5 fused extracellularly to the mScarlet fluorescent protein and intracellularly to the mNeonGreen fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The ratio of extracellular mScarlet versus intracellular mNeonGreen was markedly reduced in 24 hr, indicating loss of extracellular domain, possibly by cleavage or shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). A clue to the mechanism of this Necl5 loss came from evidence that inhibition of serine proteases in the coagulation cascade has anti-tumor effects in rodent models and human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francisco and Palumbo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nierodzik and Karpatkin, 2006</xref>). Warfarin, an anti-vitamin K drug, potently accelerated the acute elimination of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Similarly, specific inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin, edoxaban, and dabigatran etexilate, respectively, also promoted the elimination of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Notably, dabigatran etexilate did not have significant effect in Î±AGM1-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), indicating that the anti-metastatic effect is mediated by NK cells. In agreement with these functional results, thrombin cleaved off the extracellular domain of Necl5 from tumor cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), and dabigatran etexilate suppressed the cleavage of mScarlet-tagged Necl5 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). Since dabigatran etexilate-treated mice often suffered from bleeding, we used edoxaban to address the long-term effect. The mice treated with edoxaban eliminated tumor cells almost completely, supporting the idea that the suppression of Necl5 cleavage promotes the elimination of disseminated tumor cells by NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Several mechanisms have been proposed for coagulation cascade-mediated NK cell inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francisco and Palumbo, 2019</xref>), including that platelet-tumor aggregates physically protect tumor cells from NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cluxton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nierodzik and Karpatkin, 2006</xref>). However, we rarely observed microthrombi around the disseminated tumor cells, even when a microthrombus was easily induced by laser ablation in the vicinity of the tumor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1</xref>). Considering the role of platelets as the platform for coagulation factors, platelets may play a pro-metastatic role by promoting thrombin activation and thereby Necl5 shedding from the metastatic tumor cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Shedding of Necl5 correlates evasion of NK cell surveillance.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) B16-Akaluc cells were injected into the tail vein and the expression level of Necl5 on survived tumor cells was analyzed at 24 hr after dissemination.

Here, we adopted the AkaBLI system, by which even a single Akaluc-expressing tumor cell could be detected in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwano et al., 2018</xref>), and followed the fate of intravenously injected tumor cells from 5 min to 10 days after the injection of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grundy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hinuma et al., 1987</xref>), the number of tumor cells decreased rapidly in an NK cell-dependent manner. However, we noticed that as early as 24 hr after injection, tumor cells started to increase and formed macrometastatic nodules, irrespective of the presence or absence of NK cells. Our results demonstrate that the principal role of NK cells in the prevention of lung metastasis is to destroy tumor cells shortly after their arrival and lodging in the pulmonary vasculature, but not thereafter. Using intravital imaging, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Headley et al., 2016</xref> found that tumor microparticles are rapidly ingested by myeloid cells to evoke an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Headley et al., 2016</xref>). However, depletion of myeloid lineage cells did not affect the development of metastasis in the models we employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), excluding a role of the myeloid cells in the clearance of disseminated tumor cells in the immediate-early phase. Patrolling behavior similar to that of NK cells has also been observed for intravascular monocytes in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auffray et al., 2007</xref>). Like NK cells, the crawling monocytes require LFA-1 for their crawling. However, again, depletion of monocytes did not prevent the rapid clearance of disseminated tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the rapid elimination of the disseminated tumor cells within 24 hr is dependent primarily on NK cells in our models.</p><p>The crawling NK cells induce pre-apoptotic calcium influx in approximately 50% of the tumor cells that they contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6K</xref>), indicating that pulmonary NK cells can eliminate the disseminated tumor cells as efficiently as do chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cazaux et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings are superficially inconsistent with reports that lung NK cells exhibit highly differentiated and hypofunctional phenotypes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marquardt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robinson et al., 1984</xref>). This discrepancy probably arises from the fact that most of the tumor cells were killed by NK cells crawling on the pulmonary endothelial cells, but not by those flowing in the blood. NK cells adhere to the endothelial cells in an LFA-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Binding of LFA-1 to its ligand ICAM-1 induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and polarization of NK cells, which is a prerequisite for subsequent redistribution of cytotoxic granules toward the bound targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mace et al., 2009</xref>). It is likely that LFA-1 engagement of ICAM on pulmonary endothelial cells contributes to the pre-activation status of NK cells. In this regard, the slow migration speed of NK cells in the presence of tumor cells may indicate the increased fraction of active NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In the B16F10 melanoma metastasis model, DNAM-1 expression in NK cells contributes to the rejection of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilfillan et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), we have shown that, upon target cell engagement, ERK is rapidly activated in DNAM-1<sup>+</sup> NK cells, but not DNAM-1<sup>â</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Simultaneous in vivo visualization of ERK activity in NK cells and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in tumor cells revealed highly efficient tumor cell killing by NK cells showing evidence of effective signaling based on ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Only about 60% of lung NK cells express DNAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tahara-Hanaoka et al., 2005</xref>). However, most of the tumor cells were killed by the NK cells crawling on the pulmonary endothelial cells, but not by those flowing in the blood. Because DNAM-1 serves as an adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shibuya et al., 1996</xref>), the crawling NK cells may be biased to DNAM-1<sup>+</sup> NK cells, consistent with the potent cytotoxic activity of the crawling cells.</p><p>The discrepancy of the effect of <italic>Necl5</italic> and <italic>Nectin2</italic> knockout between in vitro and in vivo reflects the complexity of the mechanism of activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilfillan et al., 2008</xref> observed that the number of lung metastasis was significantly increased in DNAM-1-deficient mice, but markedly less than mice injected with Î±AGM1, indicating that DNAM-1-Necl5 interaction is not the only mechanism of B16F10 rejection by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilfillan et al., 2008</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2010</xref> reported that lung metastasis of B16F10 cells was impaired in DNAM-1 deficient mice treated with cytokines; however, neither DNAM-1 deficiency nor anti-DNAM-1 did not exhibit significant effects on the lung metastasis in the absence of cytokine administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). Because we stimulated NK cells with IL2 only in vitro, our observation agrees with this report. Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2018</xref> reported that <italic>Necl5</italic>-deficient B16F10 cells form lung metastasis less efficiently than WT cells because Necl5 is critical for tumor cell migration and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the effect of reduced sensitivity to NK cells may be masked by the other effects of <italic>Necl5</italic> and <italic>Nectin2</italic> deficiency. Moreover, there are three receptors, DNAM-1, TIGIT, and CD96, that bind to Necl5 with different affinity, 119, 3.15, and 37.6 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinet and Smyth, 2015</xref>). Since the two inhibitory receptors, TIGIT and CD96, exhibit higher affinity than the activating receptor DNAM-1, thrombin-mediated reduction of Necl5 may strengthen the inhibitory signal. Finally, the discrepancy could also be explained by the previous reports that TIGIT<sup>+</sup> NK cells can eliminate <italic>Necl5<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> cells in vivo by missing-self recognition due to the education via Necl5 on the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2017</xref>) and that the effect of education on degranulation does not last in cell culture with IL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pugh et al., 2019</xref>). The elimination mechanism of <italic>Necl5</italic> and <italic>Nectin2</italic> knockout cells is suggested to be NK cell-dependent but Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-independent manners because we did not detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in <italic>Necl5</italic> and <italic>Nectin2</italic> knockout cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6K</xref>).</p><p>Shedding of ligands for the activating receptors of NK cells has been documented for NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). The NKG2D ligands, MICA, MICB, and ULBP2 are cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), leading to evasion of NK surveillance. It is also reported that platelets can promote the MMP-mediated shedding of the NKG2D ligands in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maurer et al., 2018</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, involvement of thrombin or factor Xa in the shedding of the ligands for activating receptors such as Necl5 has not been reported. Interestingly, Necl5 contributes to cell adhesion as does DNAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takai et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, Necl5 on tumor cells is a double-edge sword, which facilitates adhesion to the lung capillary but also invokes NK cell attack. To evade the NK cell surveillance, after anchoring to the capillaries, tumor cells are able to take advantage of the capacity of thrombin to strip Necl5 from the cell surface within 24 hr after adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). This new understanding of how NK cell surveillance of tumor cells is regulated in the micro-circulation provides a rationale for the development of new ways to inhibit the growth of clinically significant lung metastases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmids encoding R-GECO1, SCAT3, GCaMP6s, mScarlet were obtained from Takeharu Nagai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), Masayuki Miura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takemoto et al., 2003</xref>), and Addgene (plasmid # 40753 for GCaMP6s; #85044 for mScarlet; Cambridge, MA), respectively.

In parallel, they performed asialoGM1+ and NK1.1+ cells depletion by injection of depleting anti-aGM1 and antiNK1.1 antibodies in order to see the involvement of these populations on the elimination of the disseminated tumor cells. They conclude that a rapid decrease of the tumor cells is mediated by NK cells. Consisting with this first data, the authors observe also the same early NK cells mediated impact on two other syngeneic mouse tumor cell lines : the BRAFV600E melanoma and the colon adenocarcinoma MC-38.</p><p>In a second part, the authors dissected NK cell dynamic behaviors in the pulmonary capillaries by taking advantage of the NKp46iCRExrosa26dtTomato mice where NKp46+ cells are fluorescents and performed 2P intravital imaging to follow the in situ the NKp46+ cells behavior. They could nicely observe that NK cells arrive from the capillaries and patrol on the lung epithelial cells in a stall-crawl-jump manner. Moreover, they also show that the attachment to the pulmonary capillaries is mediated by LFA-1. In the presence of B16F10 tumor model, they observe that NK cells stay longer in the capillaries and increase their duration time of crawling indicating that NK cells stay in contact longer with tumor cells.</p><p>The authors then explored the NK-mediated tumor killing in the lung by measuring tumor cell apoptosis using B16F10-SCAT3 cells (which leads to visualize caspase 3 activation) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in tumor cells expressing two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, GCaMP6s and R-GECO. They could observe casp3 activation but also Ca+ influx on tumor cells within few minutes after encountering NK cells. They also observe that evasion of NK cell surveillance is mediated by Nectin-5 and Nectin-2 expressed on tumor cells.</p><p>Then, they focus on NK cell activation by looking at ERK activation. To do so, they have isolated NK cells from Tg mice expressing a FRET-based ERK biosensor and performed in vitro killing assay against B16-R-GECO tumor cells but also in vivo experiments. For the in vivo experiments, they have developed reporter mice whose NK cells express the FRET biosensor for ERK. They observe that ERK-dependent NK cell activation contributes to the elimination of disseminated tumor cells within the first few hours but not after 24 hours. Indeed, theu observe that B16F10-Akaluc tumor cells are equally eliminated when injected 24 hrs after a first injection of B16F10 or PBS in mice. The authors concluded that tumor cell acquire the capacity to evade NK cell surveillance after 24 hrs rather than a hypothesis toward NK cells loose tumoricidal activity over time.</p><p>Finally, the authors have explored their last result on the potential tumor cell evasion of the NK cell surveillance. They show that this NK cell evasion is mediated by the shedding of cell surface NeCl<sup>-</sup>5. They next show that clivage of extracellular domain of NeCl<sup>-</sup>5 was mediated by thrombin in vitro and that anti-coagulation factors such as Warfarin, Edoxaban or Dabigatran Etexilate promote tumor elimination as observed by the bioluminescence experiments. This loss prevents the NK cell signaling needed for effective killing of tumor targets.</p><p>However, most of the results remain correlations and have not been formally demonstrated or miss controls.</p><p>B16F10 is a well-known and characterized NK cell target in a in vivo model so the first part is not really knew except the in situ behavior of NK cells within the lung capillaries. The new mechanism of thrombin-mediated shedding of NeCl<sup>-</sup>5 causing evasion from NK Cell surveillance is really concentrated on the last figure (Figure N{degree sign}6) and some supplemental experiments are mandatory and needed to really confirm this affirmation.</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate the reviewerâs effort to evaluate our work. The reviewer criticizes that the mechanism is well known except âthe in situ behavior of NK cells within the lung capillaries.â Indeed, this is what we wish to show in our work. Nobody has ever seen how NK cells kill metastatic tumor cells in the lung. There is a big gap between in vitro tissue culture experiments and in vivo macroscopic counting of metastatic nodules. Most researchers do not even know when and where in the lung NK cells kill metastatic tumor cells. Live imaging is a powerful approach to address such questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>There are several points to address to improve the significance of these data.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1. A global point : 3 mice/group is to small to analyse and interprete data because of the heterogeneity of the mice. Mean +/- SEM have to represented instead of SD.</p></disp-quote><p>For the sake of animal welfare, researchers are asked to use minimal number of mice. Moreover, only one mouse can be observed in each imaging session, which takes several hours. In most experiments we performed two independent experiments with three mice each. We believe the number is appropriate for this type of experiment. In case of small number of samples, we think SD is better than SEM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors used the well-known polyclonal anti-asialoGM1 Ab to deplete NK cells. AsialoGM1 is also expressed by ILC1, T, NKT and gd+T cells but also basophils (Trambley J et al., Asialo GM1(+) CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in costimulation blockade-resistant allograft rejection. JCI, 1999). The authors checked the involvement only for the basophils. They have to check the depletion of each of these populations specifically in the lung to assume that the depletion impact only the NK cells or they must change their conclusion on the entire manuscript and say that not only NK cells is responsible and involved in the control of the disseminated tumor cells but maybe also ILC1, NKT and or gd+T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We obtained similar observations by using BALB/c <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice, which lack T cells (Figure 1D-1G). Therefore, we can exclude the contribution of NKT and Î³Î´T cells, which are absent in BALB/c <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice, in the acute phase (&lt; 24 hrs) examined in this study. ILC1 is known to promote lung metastasis of B16F10 cells {Gao, 2017 #284}, neglecting its role in the protection of metastasis in the acute phase.

Importantly, after 24 hrs, we did not observe any significant difference in the relative increase of the bioluminescence signal between the control and Î±AGM1-treated mice.

Figure S3A-B : The authors say that basophils express aGM1 so they performed basophils involvement on the elimination of B16F10 tumor cells with depleting aCD200R3 mab. They also checked the involvement of neutrophils and monocytes. They observed that basophils, neutrophils and monocytes are not involved on the B16F10 elimination. But what is the hypothesis to assess the role of neutrophils and monocytes ? Moreover, they did not explore Basophil roles in the other models including MC-38, BRAFV600E and 4T1 tumor cells</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>We depleted neutrophils and monocytes because antibody-mediated removal of leukocytes could have non-specifically increased the survival of tumor cells.

Indeed, the authors have used the NKp46iCre mice model for other questions.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer stated, the contribution of NK cells in the rejection of metastatic tumors is very well known. Therefore, we would like to refrain from repeating the experiments by using other genetically modified mouse lines, which will take at least one year.

There is any experiment performed to affirm this point so the authors cannot maintain this conclusion. First, the authors only analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at a specific time point. So this result only show that Nectin-5 and/or Nectin-2 expressed by B16F10 is involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following NK cell contact but there is any data on DNAM-1 contribution. So, the role on the NK cells and specifically DNAM-1+ NK cells have not been addressed here. To answer to that question, the author have to perform in vivo model of engrafted WT vs NeCl<sup>-</sup>5/2 ko B16F10 in a WT vs DNAM1 deficient NK cells mouse model to ascertain the contribution of NeCl<sup>-</sup>5/2-DNAM-1 on NK cells.

Moreover, all experiments are correlations and do not implicate in the same experiment Necl-5, DNAM-1+ NK cells and trombin or anti-coagulation factors. So, as in the comment #9, to adress this point, the authors should inject WT vs Necl-5 deficient B16F10-Akaluc into WT vs NK cell depleted mice and monitor the bioluminescence of the tumor cells within 24 hrs following injection of anti-coagulation factors as in the Figure 6H.

Another important experiment along this line would be the use the CD155/CD112 deficient tumor cells (Which the authors use in figure 4) in the experiments shown in figure 1.

We have modified the conclusion as follows:</p><p>(Lines 285) âAlthough interpretation is limited by the action of the soluble inhibitor on cells other than NK cells, these additional data are consistent with our imaging data and the idea that activated NK cell contributes to the elimination of disseminated tumor cells and that ERK activation can be used a marker for activated NK cells.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In general, the issue of NK cell exhaustion should be addressed in more detail. The experiments do not address serial killing activity of NK cells and more data is needed to show that it is not an exhaustion of NK cells but the cleavage of CD155 from the tumor cells that prevents further killing.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that NK cell exhaustion would not happen in a population level in this metastasis model by the following reason. There are 2.4 million NK cells in the lung and 1.0 million NK cells are replaced every minute (Supplementary Table). Therefore, NK cells outnumber 0.5 million melanoma cells injected into circulation. Moreover, each tumor cell in the lung is hit by an NK cell every two hours. Even if we assume that melanoma cells can inactivate NK cells every time, exhaustion of lung NK cells would not happen in 12 hours. Therefore, if NK cell exhaustion could happen, it should be mediated by indirect mechanism such as cytokine-induced suppression or endothelial cell-mediated inactivation etc. We have included these statements in the result section.</p><p>(Lines 304) âThese results imply that NK cells in the lung are exhausted in 24 hrs. Our quantitative data shows that 2.4 million NK cells in the lung outnumber 0.5 million melanoma cells injected into circulation (Supplementary Table). Therefore, if NK cell exhaustion could happen, it is not caused by the killing of tumor cells, but by an indirect mechanism such as cytokine-induced suppression or endothelial cell-mediated inactivation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Figure 1C: The relevance of this experiment needs to be better explained.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the result section as follows:</p><p>(Lines 139) âIn tumor burden mice, the lung microenvironment is often reprogrammed in favor of metastasis (Altorki, Markowitz et al., 2019).

Figure 4: The use of the caspase-3 and the calcium sensors may detect different cytotoxic mechanisms used by the NK cells. While caspase-3 can be activated by death receptor and perforin/granzyme B mediated killing, the calcium sensor may report mostly on perforin mediated membrane damage. These killing mechanisms have different kinetics and are differentially used during serial killing by NK cells. This should be addressed (at least in the discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this invaluable comment. We have included this point as follows:</p><p>(Lines 220) âDuring serial killing of tumor cells by NK cells, perforin/GrzB initially plays a major role, followed by Fas-mediated killing (Prager et al., 2019). Therefore, we used two biosensors to detect NK cell-mediated killing in vivo: SCAT-3 for Fas-mediated caspase activation and GCaMP-6s for the perforin/GrzB-mediated membrane damage.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Investigating the in vivo cytotoxicity of NK cells against tumor cells by using live imaging technologies is highly relevant for the understanding of the dynamic relationship between tumor and killer cells.

Th authors use a variety of technique able to dissect how NK patrol lung vasculature, that they interact with cancer cells as they interact with the endothelial cells and they activate a ERK dependent activation leading to calcium influx in cancer cells leading to their death. The data support the notion that this NK control occur over an early time frame, 4h after cancer cells arrival and is mediated by Necl expression on cancer cells. After this time point cancer cells show a thrombin dependent loss of Necl expression on their surface and therefore become resistant to NK control.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>The data presented are supporting the conclusions. This work utilizes a variety of elegant strategy combining reporter strategy with in vivo imaging to assess the phenomenon of interaction, ERK activation, Calcium Inflax and Apoptosis activation directly in the lung.</p><p>In term of experiments, I found the work thorough and complete.</p><p>The data a presented well overall and the statistics seems adequate.

It was recently shown that this antibody is not efficient in depleting neutrophils in this background, but only lead neutrophils to internalise the Ly6G so they cannot be detected by FACS. As shown in Boivin et al. 2020 http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-165969) neutrophils depletion in C57BL/6 mice can be achieved by using antiGr1 antibody. Therefore, if the authors aim to show this additional control, which I also agree is really good to have, I suggest performing the experiment accordingly to the best-known practice.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we have examined intracellular Ly-6G (Figure S3E, lower panels) and found that it was decreased from 1.54% to 0.68%.

As B16 melanoma cells are not in BALB/c background, I assume the legend needs to be corrected as the cells should be 4T1, however I wonder if injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells in the footpad could have let to the substantial growth required for lung metastasis without impairing the animal mobility. Could it be that cells where actually injected in the fat pad of the mice and this is just a misspelling in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>We apology the erratum in the legend. We used 4T1-Akaluc cells in the experiment shown in Figure 1E, because 4T1 cells inoculated into footpad can be spontaneously metastasized to the lung (Kamioka et al., 2017).

While it is known that NK are responsible for the first line of defence against metastatic seeding, most of the studies focuses on how they are suppressed or influenced by other immune cells. The present study provides a very accurate description of their mechanism of action, how they depend in the interaction with the endothelial cells and highlight the novel aspect of thrombin in inducing cancer cells NK resistance. What cause thrombin activation is the next relevant question, by in my opinion this study is complete and important.</p><p>My field of expertise is cancer metastasis and their interaction with the immune system and I personally enjoy very much reading this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for favorable comments and appreciate the effort to evaluate our work.</p><p>Other modifications:</p><p>1.
