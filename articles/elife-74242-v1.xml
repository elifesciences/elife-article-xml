(DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by receptive or expressive language difficulties or both. While theoretical frameworks and empirical studies support the idea that there may be neural correlates of DLD in frontostriatal loops, findings are inconsistent across studies. Here, we use a novel semiquantitative imaging protocol – multi-parameter mapping (MPM) – to investigate microstructural neural differences in children with DLD. The MPM protocol allows us to reproducibly map specific indices of tissue microstructure. In 56 typically developing children and 33 children with DLD, we derived maps of (1) longitudinal relaxation rate R1 (1/T1), (2) transverse relaxation rate R2* (1/T2*), and (3) Magnetization Transfer saturation (MTsat). R1 and MTsat predominantly index myelin, while R2* is sensitive to iron content. Children with DLD showed reductions in MTsat values in the caudate nucleus bilaterally, as well as in the left ventral sensorimotor cortex and Heschl’s gyrus. They also had globally lower R1 values. No group differences were noted in R2* maps. Differences in MTsat and R1 were coincident in the caudate nucleus bilaterally. These findings support our hypothesis of corticostriatal abnormalities in DLD and indicate abnormal levels of myelin in the dorsal striatum in children with DLD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Seven percent of children struggle to learn their native language for no obvious reason.

DLD is an extremely common neurodevelopmental disorder, with recent estimates indicating the prevalence of DLD is 7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Norbury et al., 2016</xref>). DLD has serious economic and social consequences – it is associated with a higher risk for academic underachievement, unemployment, social and behavioural difficulties, and detriment to well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Conti-Ramsden et al., 2018</xref>). Although we know that DLD does not result from gross neural lesions, we still do not have a clear picture of how brain anatomy differs in children with DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mayes et al., 2015</xref>). This is not only practically relevant but would also help us to understand the neural underpinnings of language development. Here, we use a robust new semiquantitative imaging protocol – MPM or multi-parameter mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weiskopf et al., 2021</xref>) – to shed light on microstructural neural differences in a large group of children with DLD.</p><p>There is a dearth of literature examining brain structure in children with DLD, which is surprising given the prevalence and impact of DLD. In the available literature, grey matter changes have been noted in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gauger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jäncke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Plante, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Preis et al., 1998</xref>). These are core regions for language processing, with language activation in these regions observed across the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Price, 2012</xref>) and across languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malik-Moraleda et al., 2021</xref>). Differences have also been noted in areas homologous to these language regions, such as the right perisylvian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Girbau-Massana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jäncke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kurth et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is variability in the direction of differences reported in different studies – for instance, both increases and decreases in grey matter have been noted in the left inferior frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gauger et al., 1997</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mayes et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these cortical changes in the language network, we, and others, have hypothesised that the dorsal striatum is important for language learning, and may be abnormal in DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ullman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Ullman and Pierpont, 2005</xref>). The dorsal striatum is important for habitual and sequential learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Graybiel and Grafton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>), and we hypothesise that it may play an important role in the acquisition of language because of the complexity of sequencing required for language. In accordance, a series of behavioural studies has suggested that sequential learning in the linguistic and non-linguistic domains is affected in children with DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hsu and Bishop, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lum et al., 2014</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">West et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">West et al., 2021</xref>). In studies that probe complex sequential production in the vocal domain, the dorsal striatum is implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rauschecker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Simmonds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Skipper et al., 2020</xref>). The striatum is structurally and functionally connected to regions associated with language production, with the head of the dorsolateral caudate nucleus receiving inputs from inferior frontal cortex, and the putamen receiving inputs from motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jarbo and Verstynen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lima et al., 2016</xref>). The importance of the dorsal striatum for speech and language was first highlighted by work on the KE family, who have a point mutation in the <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene and a behavioural profile similar to DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Watkins et al., 2002a</xref>), as well as childhood apraxia of speech. Morphometric studies revealed that affected members of the KE family had reduced grey matter in regions not typically associated with language processing such as the head of the caudate nucleus, areas within the sensorimotor cortex, the posterior inferior temporal cortex and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, and increased grey matter in the putamen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argyropoulos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Watkins et al., 2002b</xref>). These studies indicate that corticostriatal circuits might have a role in co-ordinating and learning the fine auditory-motor sequencing required for language.</p><p>Studies of children with DLD analysing standard T1-weighted scans have also indicated reductions in the size of the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herbert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jernigan et al., 1991</xref>). Other studies do not wholly support the view that the volume of the caudate nuclei is reduced in DLD but do indicate that there is some abnormality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2013</xref> found reduced absolute volumes in the caudate nucleus and thalamus in individuals with DLD. These relationships did not survive correcting for total intracranial volume, which was significantly reduced in their DLD participants. The authors also observed negative relationships between language proficiency and the relative volume of subcortical structures such as the nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, putamen, and hippocampus. Others have suggested that volumetric differences in the caudate nuclei are modulated by age, with only younger children showing differences in volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Soriano-Mas et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, some more recent studies suggest that children with DLD have greater grey matter in the right cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pigdon et al., 2019</xref>). The interpretation of both cortical and subcortical findings is complicated by the heterogeneity of the DLD populations sampled, and the small sample sizes investigated. However, another factor that may also contribute to this lack of clarity is the nature of the scans acquired.</p><p>Standard structural imaging protocols such as T1-weighted scans reflect a complex mix of tissue properties, or in other words, the contrast between grey and white matter reflects a combination of histological properties such as iron content, myelin, cell density, and water. Importantly, these microstructural properties yield regionally specific contributions to commonly used structural markers such as grey matter volume or cortical thickness, which complicate the interpretation of these markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lorio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lorio et al., 2016</xref>). As standard T1-weighted imaging protocols are dependent on acquisition parameters that can vary across scanners, they are also often difficult to replicate across studies. More recently, semiquantitative MRI methods have been used to map-specific properties of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weiskopf et al., 2021</xref>). Semiquantitative protocols such as MPM can provide specific indices of microstructure, including myelin and macromolecular content of neural tissue, and the resulting maps are highly reproducible across individuals and scanners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leutritz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>). In the MPM quantitative imaging protocol, multiple maps are constructed, which allow us to probe different tissue properties. The generated maps quantify (1) the longitudinal relaxation rate R1 [1/T1], (2) the transverse relaxation rate R2* [1/T2*], and (3) Magnetization Transfer saturation (MTsat). The dominant influence on R1 in cortical tissue is myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lutti et al., 2014</xref>), although R1 is sensitive to both myelin and iron in subcortical grey matter. R2* is sensitive to iron concentration, especially in ferritin-rich regions such as the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Langkammer et al., 2010</xref>). MTsat is sensitive to bound water, and consequently myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schmierer et al., 2004</xref>). This quantitative protocol therefore represents an unparalleled means of acquiring time-efficient, multi-modal, whole-brain data with insight into tissue composition. Such semiquantitative maps have been used to delineate heavily myelinated areas such as somatomotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carey et al., 2017</xref>), visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sereno et al., 2013</xref>), and auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dick et al., 2012</xref>). They have also been used to characterise developmental maturation in adolescence and young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Ziegler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Whitaker et al., 2016</xref>), during ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Callaghan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Draganski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steiger et al., 2016</xref>), and in pathological populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Manara et al., 2019</xref>). A growing number of studies use these maps to understand brain–behaviour relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clark et al., 2020</xref>). Most recently, we have used MPMs and found elevated iron levels in the putamen and speech motor network in people who stutter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cler et al., 2021</xref>). However, this novel semiquantitative protocol has not yet been used to examine microstructure in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. A particular advantage of this protocol is that its sensitivity to cortical myelin can help distinguish two different explanations of developmental change in grey matter. Developmentally, cortical thinning indexed through grey/white matter contrast changes in standard T1-weighted scans could reflect a loss in the number of connections within grey matter, that is ‘synaptic pruning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huttenlocher, 1979</xref>), or a gain in the volume of tissue through increased intra-cortical myelination that appears to ‘whiten’ the grey matter on T1-weighted images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Paus, 2005</xref>). Recent studies using MPM protocols have shown that cortical thinning during development is associated with increased myelination rather than synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Natu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Whitaker et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we used the MPM quantitative imaging protocol to map contrast parameters (R1, R2*, and MTsat) in typically developing (TD) children and those with DLD.

We did not observe any group differences that survived our statistical threshold (p &lt; 0.05), and indeed no group differences were observed at a lower statistical threshold p &lt; 0.2.

We found reduced MTsat and R1 values in the caudate nuclei in children with DLD. We also observed reduced MTsat values in the left inferior frontal gyrus. This offers empirical confirmation of our prediction that cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops involved in learning are affected in DLD.</p><p>Importantly, these results allow us to understand the cellular mechanisms driving this change. MTsat and R1 are considered in vivo markers of macromolecular content, and within the brain, these measures are particularly sensitive to myelin content in grey matter. Although most of the brain’s myelin is found in the white matter where it sheaths the long axons travelling in white matter fibre tracts, it can also be measured in grey matter where it myelinates axons or parts of axons in the cortex and in subcortical structures like the thalamus and basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nieuwenhuys, 2013</xref>). Indeed, myelin is a strong contributor to MR signal in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glasser and Van Essen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sereno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shafee et al., 2015</xref>). Given myelin’s role in enabling fast and reliable communication in the brain, reduced myelin content may explain why children with DLD struggle with speech and language processing. Below, we discuss these findings, contextualising why myelin may be altered in these specific regions in DLD.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Interpretation of MPM scans</title><p>Myelin is known to increase throughout the brain during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Whitaker et al., 2016</xref>), and has been linked to improved behavioural performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kwon et al., 2020</xref>). Previous morphometric studies have typically drawn inferences about myelin from cortical thinning, but shrinkage of grey matter does not allow us to distinguish if T1 change is due to shorter T1 times associated with reduced synaptic density, or an increase in the proportion of myelinated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Paus, 2005</xref>). More recently, MTsat and R1 measures have been used as an in vivo marker for myelin. These have been validated as markers of myelin through postmortem imaging, as well as histological studies of patients with multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weiskopf et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, these maps agree with histological maps showing greater myelin in primary motor and sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sereno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Whitaker et al., 2016</xref>), as can be seen in our maps as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is therefore unsurprising to find some convergence over MTsat and R1. R2* is also considered a measure of myelin, but the T2* contrast is particularly sensitive to iron, especially within the basal ganglia. Despite R2* differences being noted in adults with speech problems in the putamen and cortical speech motor network (developmental stuttering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cler et al., 2021</xref>), and observed links between verbal memory and R2* in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Steiger et al., 2016</xref>), we did not see any evidence for R2* differences anywhere in the brain when comparing our TD and DLD groups.</p><p>Our findings also strongly suggest that there is an advantage to using MPM to probe microstructure relative to standard T1 measures. While previous studies reported differences using morphometric measures, we did not observe evidence for morphometric differences in our sample. As others have argued, MPM is sensitive to microstructural differences that would not be detected by a standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, as VBM is sensitive to differences in regional amounts of grey matter based on T1 weighting rather than quantitative measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lorio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lorio et al., 2016</xref>). Using MPMs allows us to more closely interrogate the histological processes involved in neural changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Group differences in the striatum</title><p>Our findings clearly indicate that there are microstructural abnormalities in the caudate nuclei bilaterally in children with DLD, and more broadly, that reduced myelin in the left caudate nucleus is associated with lower language proficiency. The convergence across MT and R1 differences in the caudate nuclei strongly suggest these are linked to abnormal levels of myelin.</p><p>The dorsal striatum has been implicated in learning through practice, particularly habit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Skipper et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>). A number of groups, including us, have hypothesised that the striatum is a brain region where we might expect to see neural differences in children with DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ullman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Ullman and Pierpont, 2005</xref>). Our hypothesis was driven by the idea that children with DLD showed deficits in sequential procedural tasks, which rely on loops through the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, using a direct neural measure, we see evidence for structural differences in the striatum, particularly in the caudate nuclei. The functional consequences of these structural changes might be to make certain aspects of learning, such as the learning of stimulus-response mappings, more challenging. For instance, a reduction in myelin might make sequential learning less efficient. This could explain why children with DLD face difficulties in complex language tasks, such as nonword repetition, where extracting and producing sequential responses are important. However, any speculation about the functional impact of these changes needs careful empirical investigation in future studies.</p><p>Our findings are generally consistent with previous smaller-scale work linking volumetric differences in the caudate nucleus to language learning difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Watkins et al., 2002b</xref>). They may also offer some resolution to previous work using VBM, where such differences were not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pigdon et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, our own VBM analysis did not reveal any differences in morphometry. However, and perhaps speaking to a slightly different interpretation of our findings, the striatal differences we find are in the body of the caudate nucleus, rather than the head. The head of the caudate nucleus receives input from prefrontal cortex. DTI studies suggest the body of the caudate nucleus gets its input from prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lehéricy et al., 2004</xref>). Functional connectivity studies indicate that the body of the caudate nucleus also receives projections from temporal association cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2012</xref>). Given our findings of differences in the body rather than the head of the caudate nuclei, further studies examining individual differences of microstructure and relevant behavioural tasks (e.g. auditory processing and learning, or processing of rhythm) are warranted.</p><p>Although some previous work suggested that striatal differences were normalised by adolescence in children with DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Soriano-Mas et al., 2009</xref>), our analyses do not show any evidence of group differences being modulated by age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using the MPM protocols may give us a more sensitive marker of change to differences in DLD. In these analyses, it is perhaps surprising that we did not see age-related change in the striatum within the time frame we sampled. Longitudinal work using MTsat has demonstrated that the striatum continues to mature through adolescence, from 14 to 24 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>). However, it may be that the time frame we sampled was too short, or that within-subject longitudinal studies, which are more sensitive to changes over time, are needed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Genetic mechanisms underlying group differences in the striatum</title><p>The genetic mechanisms that might drive these striatal changes are currently unclear. DLD is a highly heritable disorder but identification of genetic pathways has been difficult due to the broad phenotype and changes in diagnostic criteria (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mountford et al., 2022</xref>). In terms of monogenic disorders, the best known case is that of the KE family, the affected members of which had a rare point mutation in the gene <italic>FOXP2</italic> causing verbal dyspraxia as well as the kinds of language learning difficulties seen in DLD. The mutation in <italic>FOXP2</italic> was associated with reduced volumes of the caudate nuclei bilaterally in the KE family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Watkins et al., 2002b</xref>), but it is unknown whether this was related to a quantitative difference in myelin content as seen here in DLD. <italic>FOXP2</italic> is strongly expressed in the medium-spiny neurons of the striatum in humans and other species, and in many other neural and non-neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lai et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>FOXP2</italic> is a transcription factor affecting the function of many downstream target genes, including <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> and <italic>FOXP1,</italic> which in turn have been linked to phenotypic features of DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lozano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Vernes et al., 2008</xref>). Aside from identifying rare monogenic causes of DLD, other approaches have yielded common risk variants that explain variances in phenotypic features of DLD, including phonological skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Newbury et al., 2009</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of DLD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of reading and language traits with an <italic>N</italic> &gt; 30,000 found significant genome-wide association with word reading and distinct genetic variation of word and nonword reading, spelling, and phoneme awareness that correlated with cortical surface area of the left superior temporal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eising et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, in our study, the posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus in the left hemisphere showed significantly reduced MTsat and R1 values in children with DLD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Neural differences beyond the striatum</title><p>We also observed MTsat changes indicative of myelin-related differences in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral sensorimotor cortex, insula, planum temporale, lateral Heschl’s gyrus, and the superior temporal sulcus, all in the left hemisphere. Regions such as the inferior frontal cortex and posterior superior temporal cortex are considered core parts of the speech and language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Malik-Moraleda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rauschecker and Scott, 2009</xref>), and ventral sensorimotor cortex and insula are regions that are clearly implicated in speech motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bouchard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dronkers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wise et al., 1999</xref>). Our findings here of abnormal microstructure in these regions are somewhat consistent with those from previous studies in DLD that report structural differences in perisylvian regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gauger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jäncke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Plante, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Preis et al., 1998</xref>) with two notable differences – one, that these differences did not emerge in a VBM analysis, and two, on average, children with DLD had lower MTsat or R1 values than TD children, indicative of slower maturation or abnormal developmental trajectories. Such differences in these regions therefore may be correlates of either auditory or motor inefficiency or both that have been observed in some children with DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halliday et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McArthur and Bishop, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While the TD &gt; DLD differences observed in the MTsat appeared left lateralised and focal, differences in the R1 map were widespread, observed in both hemispheres quite symmetrically. Interpreting the differences in these findings offers a paradox. On the face of it, left-lateralised myelin reduction in brain regions known to contribute to speech and language processing seems very plausible, as this would be entirely consistent with the behavioural profile of DLD. This would fit with a popular theoretical view, that is that the left hemisphere is uniquely privileged to support language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vargha-Khadem et al., 1985</xref>). However, this does not fit with the developmental literature on children with early brain lesions. Children with perinatal focal brain lesions, even those encompassing the entire left hemisphere, have fairly good language skills, and they typically perform better than children with DLD on language tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asaridou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bates and Dick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Thal et al., 1991</xref>). Right hemisphere homologues of language areas are able to support language reorganisation when early damage is sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bates and Dick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Newport et al., 2017</xref>). This has led to theoretical speculation that abnormalities affect both hemispheres in children with DLD preventing this form of brain plasticity. In this vein, the widespread differences seen in the R1 maps, or the bilateral abnormalities observed in the caudate nuclei, might point to why organisation of language is not maximally efficient. Another possibility is that MTsat mainly indexes myelin differences, whereas R1 could be sensitive to other microstructural features such as iron and neuronal fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Edwards et al., 2018</xref>). This might suggest that the myelin differences observed in R1, that are not observed in MTsat, indicate further sources of neural difference in DLD. Further work is needed to understand what the divergent TD &gt; DLD differences across the R1 and MTsat maps might reflect.</p><p>It is also notable that many of the MTsat and R1 differences we observe are in primary motor and sensory areas, or closely adjacent areas. Myelin content is high in primary sensory (due to dense thalamo-cortical projections) and motor areas (due to the large axons of cortico-spinal projections) and therefore peaks at earlier stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Natu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Whitaker et al., 2016</xref>). As seen from our average parameter maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we see the expected strong myelination in these regions, and we may therefore have stronger signal in these regions of the brain to evaluate group differences. In contrast, a relative lack of differences in association areas may be a true finding or may reflect reduced sensitivity to measure this change because there is less myelin content there. For instance, in our maps, we do not see very strong myelination in some cortical areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus, which might limit the ability to see group differences. In TD teenagers, myelogenesis is highest in association areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Whitaker et al., 2016</xref>). Longitudinal studies are therefore necessary to evaluate whether differences in myelin persist in the same areas in children with DLD, that is, regionally specific changes, or whether differences in myelin would be seen in association areas at later stages of development.</p><p>The broad constellation of challenges faced by children with DLD might also explain some of the group differences in MTsat and R1 values. For example, many children with DLD have co-occurring motor challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sanjeevan and Mainela-Arnold, 2019</xref>), which may be reflected in changes in the motor network. This might also account for differences in regions we did not have clear hypotheses about, for example, in the occipital lobe. Many children in our study faced reading challenges, and left occipital–temporal hypoactivation is associated with dyslexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Paulesu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Richlan, 2012</xref>) and now genetic variation in literacy skills (see above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eising et al., 2021</xref>). One way to disentangle the contributions of these different cognitive traits would be to conduct large-scale studies including those with multiple diagnoses and use a transdiagnostic approach to establish specific relationships between brain and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Siugzdaite et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that we previously hypothesised that the microstructure of grey and white matter in the medial temporal lobe would be relatively normal in children with DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>). However, we observed differences in R1 values in these regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, medial surface of the left hemisphere). This fits with the emerging picture that children with DLD can struggle with aspects of learning thought to depend on the medial temporal lobe, for example declarative memory tasks such as list learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bishop and Hsu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Earle and Ullman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McGregor et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for theories of DLD</title><p>The striatal differences we report are broadly consistent with our views on the dorsal striatum being involved in language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>), as well as with theories such as the procedural deficit hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Ullman and Pierpont, 2005</xref>), and the procedural deficit circuit hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ullman et al., 2020</xref>). This may be linked to difficulties extracting and retaining the sequential regularities for language, or challenges in automatising the use of language rules. Our sample with DLD shows differences in linguistic tasks that draw upon these abilities, such as nonword repetition or oromotor sequencing, even though they were not selected on this basis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Orpella et al., 2021</xref> recently demonstrated that the dorsal and ventral striatum were crucial for developing and acting upon predictions in a statistical learning task. The use of such sensitive functional tasks may be important to demonstrate the functional consequences of these changes. Understanding such learning mechanisms may also help us understand how to design better intervention for children with DLD, for example, this may be a reason to simplify and repeat rules during learning, providing greater opportunities for practice and habituation. We are now testing the role of repetition in enhancing language comprehension in DLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Parker et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our more global differences in myelination would also be consistent with theoretical views postulating that children with DLD show differences in the speed of processing, perhaps due to inefficiencies in information transfer through the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kail, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Miller et al., 2001</xref>). However, more recent theories point to more specific lexical processing differences in DLD. Children with DLD have been shown to have greater difficulty with lexical selection and inhibition of competitors, rather than the initial perceptual or phonological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nation, 2014</xref>). Computational models suggest this could be due to increased levels of lexical decay or lexical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McMurray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apfelbaum et al., 2022</xref>). Abnormalities in myelination could result in differing levels of inhibition for targets and competitors. Techniques like MEG would be better suited to test this hypothesis.</p><p>There has also been significant theoretical debate about whether DLD represents the tail end of a spectrum of language ability or if it represents a group or several subgroups that are biologically distinguishable from those with typical language ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tomblin, 2011</xref>). Broadly speaking, there is now consensus in the field that these children represent the extreme end of a distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bishop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lancaster and Camarata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tomblin and Zhang, 1999</xref>). We examined if our data were consistent with this idea by examining the distribution. When plotted, the average values of striatal myelination for individual participants indicated overlap between the DLD and TD groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). So not all children with DLD had values outside of the range of values for the TD groups, as might be expected if we were observing a distinct subtype. However, our continuous analysis does indicate that those who have the lowest values for striatal myelination have the lowest language factor scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our limited exploration of how these measures are distributed both within the DLD group and across the cohort is consistent with the idea that DLD is a spectrum disorder. Even so, further theoretically driven analyses that relate specific behaviour to these quantitative measures of brain microstructure might provide insight into whether there are distinct subtypes within DLD. Future studies should focus on understanding the full spectrum of DLD using large datasets, establishing if there are distinct brain–behaviour relationships within this broad category.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>The differences we see here are observed at a group level. In other words, as noted above, lower MTsat or R1 values in the caudate nuclei are not observed in every child with DLD. In future studies, we are keen to use structural connectivity analyses, as they will allow us to understand how differences across a network of brain areas may make children susceptible to DLD. It is also unclear whether the neural changes we observe are the cause of DLD, or a consequence of having a language disorder. Longitudinal studies where children are followed over time are the best way to shed light on this issue. A pertinent issue when considering longitudinal studies is the amount of data we were able to retain from children we tested (between approximately 65% and 80% based on whether children were in the TD, HSL, or DLD group, see Methods). We were concerned that systematic biases might affect retention, with children with severe language problems being more likely to be excluded. Consequently, in our sample, we assessed if there were any differences between children whose scans were excluded, relative to those we retained for our analysis. We found that children with DLD whose scans were excluded were younger than those who were selected, but they were not more severely affected in terms of their language learning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). However, it is worth noting our analysis does not account for the children who we recruited but were unable to scan. Dropout and data quality are factors to consider if scanning younger children with this protocol. Finally, the relationship between structure and function is complex. We need to understand how these structural differences might affect specific aspects of function. For instance, we did not observe differences in dorsal striatal activity for a simple language task of verb generation in the same group of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krishnan et al., 2021</xref>). This may signal the task was not sensitive to differences, or alternately, that we need to tap different aspects of language processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Summary and conclusions</title><p>Understanding the neural basis of DLD is particularly challenging given the developmental nature of the disorder, as well as the lack of animal models for understanding language. Novel semiquantitative MPM protocols allow us an unparalleled in vivo method to investigate microstructural neural changes in these children. Our findings using this protocol suggest that the caudate nucleus, as well as regions in the wider speech and language network, show alterations in myelin in children with DLD. These findings strongly point to a role for the striatum in the development of DLD. This role is likely to be in the learning of habits and sequences, but future work is necessary to test this hypothesis given the anatomical localisation in our study. Additionally, myelin patterns can change over development, and myelination can be observed after successful training. In next steps, it is important to assess whether these differences in myelin persist over development in DLD, and if they can be targeted through training using behavioural interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>As part of the Oxford BOLD study, we recruited and tested 175 children between the ages of 10 and 15 years.

Children were excluded if they had another neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or history of neurological disorder. Participants who met inclusionary/exclusionary criteria were categorised as having DLD if they presented with a history of language problems and scored at least 1 SD below the normative mean on two or more standardised tests of language ability. Children were categorised as HSL if they presented with HSL problems but did not meet criteria for DLD. Those who were categorised as TD had no history of speech and language problems. If these children scored 1 SD or more below the mean on more than one standardised test score of language ability, they were excluded from the TD group.

This protocol consisted of the acquisition of three multi-echo gradient acquisitions with proton density (PD), T1, or MT weighting. Each acquisition had a TR of 25 ms, field of view = 256 × 224 × 176 mm<sup>3</sup>, readout bandwidth 488 Hz/pixel, and slab rotation of 30°. Flip angle for MT- and PD-weighted acquisitions was 6°, and 21° for T1-weighted acquisitions. MT weighting was achieved by using a Gaussian radiofrequency (RF) pulse 2 kHz off resonance with 4-ms duration and a nominal flip angle of 220° prior to excitation. To speed up data acquisition, a GRAPPA acceleration factor of 2 was applied, with 40 references lines in each phase encoding direction. Eight echoes were acquired for the T1- and PD-weighted contrasts, and six echoes were acquired for the MT contrast. Each sequence took approximately 5 min to acquire.

In brief, language ability was assessed using five tests, assessing aspects of expressive and receptive grammar, narrative, and vocabulary. Specifically, grammatical comprehension was assessed using the Test for Reception of Grammar – 2 or its electronic counterpart (TROG-E, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop, 2005</xref>). Expressive grammar was evaluated using the Recalling Sentences subtest of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals – 4th Edition (CELF-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Semel et al., 2004</xref>). Children’s narrative production and comprehension were assessed using the Expression, Reception and Recall of Narrative Instrument (ERNNI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bishop, 2004</xref>). Receptive and expressive vocabulary were assessed using the Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test – 4th Edition (ROWPVT-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martin and Brownell, 2011b</xref>) and Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test – 4th Edition (EOWPVT-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martin and Brownell, 2011a</xref>), respectively.

The default toolbox settings were used. This processing results in the MT saturation, R1 and R2* maps, which index different aspects of tissue microstructure. Briefly, R1 (1/T1) maps were estimated from the PD- and T1-weighted images using the process described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>, extended by using correction for RF transmit field inhomogeneities and imperfect spoiling. Regression of the log signal from the signal decay over echoes across all three MPM contrasts was used to calculate a map of R2* (=1/T2*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>).

Data from nine children with DLD and two TD children were excluded on this basis. We also removed scans where interscan movement exceeded 2 mm. Data from a further four children with DLD, five TD children, and one child with HSL were excluded on this basis. We then conducted a visual inspection of the R1, MTsat, and R2* maps, and excluded data from a further five children with DLD, four children with HSL, and nine TD children where image artifacts were observed. We retained data from 56 TD children, 33 children with DLD, and 20 children with HSL.

For assessing statistical differences across groups, we employed threshold-free cluster enhancement, setting p &lt; 0.05 as our threshold. Data from regions of interest were extracted using <italic>fslstats</italic>, and further analyses were carried out using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>).</p><p>For the behavioural data, we constructed factor scores for use in continuous analyses to minimise the number of comparisons in statistical tests. These factors were based on analysis of the whole cohort of children who contributed behavioural data to our study and therefore includes data from children who did not complete the MPM scans and children in whom we excluded MPM data as described above. The measures from the language and memory tests described above were entered into a pre-registered factor analysis to identify the best weighted combination of measures to give a language factor score, and a memory factor score. The approach we adopted to factor analysis was E-CFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown, 2006</xref>), implemented in <italic>lavaan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rosseel, 2012</xref>) in the R programming language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>). E-CFA is a hybrid exploratory–confirmatory approach to factor analysis where a model is specified with an ‘anchor’ measure or two anchor measures. As anchor measures, we used the list learning standard score from the CMS for the memory factor, and expressive vocabulary for the language factor. We planned to compare this two-factor model to a single-factor model accounting for language proficiency alone. However, our two preregistered models were not a good fit to the data. Consequently, as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krishnan et al., 2021</xref>, we accounted for strong correlations between expressive and receptive vocabulary scores, as well as the two narrative production measures in modified models, and found the modified two-factor model to be a better fit to the data than the modified single-factor model. We consequently derived language and memory proficiency scores using this modified two-factor model.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was approved by the Medical Sciences Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (R55835/RE002).

How critical is the use of the CATALISE definition to the results?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. The CATALISE definition of Developmental Language Disorder rightly places less emphasis on the discrepancy between nonverbal and verbal skills. In particular, this opens up the diagnosis of DLD to those with nonverbal IQs between 70-85. Previously, such children would have been excluded from the diagnosis of DLD or SLI because their language scores were in line with (some might say “predicted by”) this level of nonverbal IQ. We assume the reviewer is asking whether the inclusion of children with low nonverbal IQ and low language ability has affected our results. To address this, we reanalysed our data excluding the children with IQs between 70-85 (there were 5 such children, all with DLD). Our analysis revealed the same pattern of group differences (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1) indicating that our results are not driven by the use of the CATALISE definition of DLD and inclusion of individuals with low IQ. We therefore think it is unnecessary to remove those with lower nonverbal IQs from our main analyses. We have added this to the paper, page 12.</p><p><italic>“The CATALISE definition of DLD rightly removes the criterion requiring a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal skills, which in practice means broadening the phenotype to include children with low nonverbal IQ. To determine whether our group differences were in fact driven by the inclusion of children with low nonverbal IQs in addition to low language ability, we assessed differences only in children with nonverbal IQ scores &gt;85. Group differences in MTsat and R1 maps were observed even when removing the five children with DLD who had nonverbal IQs between 70-85 (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1), indicating these differences were not driven by the inclusion of children with low nonverbal IQs.”</italic></p><p>More broadly, the reviewers focused on whether nonverbal IQ could explain our findings. Our key finding was reduced MTsat and R1 values in the caudate nucleus bilaterally. We explored the unique contribution of language proficiency, verbal memory, and nonverbal IQ in these regions by conducting hierarchical regressions. We found that language proficiency was the strongest predictor of MTsat values in the caudate nucleus, again suggesting that these differences were specific to language ability and not indexing nonverbal IQ. We have now added these analyses to the paper, pages 13-14.</p><p><italic>“The DLD and TD groups differed from each other on language proficiency, memory, and nonverbal IQ (see Table 1). We consequently assessed whether variation in language proficiency, memory, or nonverbal IQ best explained the variation in R1 and MTsat values in the regions of the caudate nucleus where we observed TD &gt; DLD group differences. We constructed stepwise regressions to evaluate the contribution of each of these factors, including children from the HSL group to maximise power (the pattern of analysis was the same even if we limited our analyses to children in the TD or DLD groups).</italic></p><p><italic>For MTsat values in the caudate nucleus, we found that a model with language proficiency alone (β=.014, p&lt;.001) was the best fitting model, explaining 14.57% of the variance, F(1,106)=18.08, p&lt;.001. For R1 values in the caudate nucleus, we again found that a model with language proficiency alone (β=.012, p&lt;.001) was the best fitting model, explaining 13.19% of the variance, F(1,106)=16.11, p&lt;.001.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Why was the HSL group excluded from analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The HSL group was not included in any group comparison but these children were included in the continuous analyses. We explain our reasoning below. Also, we now define this group at the start of the Results section to avoid confusion (pages 6-7) and apologise that this was overlooked previously.</p><p>Children in the HSL, or history of speech and language difficulties group, were recruited on the basis of presenting with a history of speech and language difficulties but our testing revealed language abilities in the normal range. They were not necessarily neurotypical – many had received speech-language therapy or additional support for these challenges in the past. The group was highly heterogenous, with children having very different histories and profiles, which included dyslexia (and some with spelling difficulties), dyspraxia, short-term memory problems, or speech difficulties. We could not be certain that these individuals were simply “resolved” DLD cases. For these reasons, we did not include the children in our group analyses. However, our continuous analysis focused on individual variability in language proficiency, this allowed us to include these children in these analyses, thereby increasing our power. We hope the information we have added (pages 6-7) clarifies this decision in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>“As part of the Oxford BOLD study, we collected brain imaging data from 162 children between the ages of 10-15 years, as well as performing a detailed characterisation of their language and cognitive skills. All children in the study had a nonverbal IQ &gt; 70. Children were categorised as DLD if they scored 1SD below the mean on two or more language tests, (N=57), and typically developing (N=77) if they scored +/- 1 SD of the mean on language tests. Behavioural testing in a further 28 revealed that they did not meet our criteria for DLD but presented with a history of speech and language problems (HSL). After quality control, we retained MPM data from 109 of these children, including 56 typically developing children, 33 children with DLD and 20 children with HSL. The children in the HSL group were excluded from comparisons of TD and DLD, but were included in continuous analyses which allow us to examine language variability. The three groups (TD, HSL, and DLD) did not differ in in terms of age (see Table 1).”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The manuscript would benefit from specific analyses based on prespecified volumes of interest including whole striatum and IFG based on their previous hypothesis. The striatal prior is clear but the IFG prior might be justified further.</p></disp-quote><p>There were two ways we could have analysed our data, taking a whole-brain approach or an ROI approach. Since this data has not previously been obtained in children with DLD, we decided to take the whole-brain approach and use statistically robust thresholding to avoid false positives. Having done so, we believe our results are potentially informative for future studies which may use an ROI approach to focus on areas we find to be different between groups. To conduct ROI analyses on our data having done the whole-brain analysis would, we believe, be what is called “double-dipping”. We have therefore chosen not to restructure the paper on this basis. To satisfy the reviewers, we did pull out these ROI values and have posted this table on the OSF (https://osf.io/2ba57/); however, we feel that describing the data in this way does not add to our understanding.</p><p>With respect to justifying our focus on the IFG – The left inferior frontal gyrus is a key area for language processing and accordingly there are known differences in terms of structure and function in this area based on previous smaller scaler studies in developmentally language impaired children. We were particularly interested in the IFG for two reasons, first, as we found both structural and functional differences in our previous study of DLD, and second, as the inferior frontal gyrus is a major source of inputs to the caudate nucleus. We have now clarified this in the introduction.</p><p>Page 3 – <italic>“In the available literature, grey matter changes have been noted in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Badcock et al., 2012; Gauger et al., 1997; Jancke et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2020; Plante, 1991; Preis et al., 1998). These are core regions for language processing, with language activation in these regions observed across the literature (Price, 2012) and across languages (Ayyash et al., 2021).”</italic></p><p>Page 4 – <italic>“The striatum is structurally and functionally connected to regions associated with language production, with the head of the dorsolateral caudate nucleus receiving inputs from inferior frontal cortex, and the putamen receiving inputs from motor, premotor and supplementary motor cortex (Alexander et al., 1986; Jarbo and Verstynen, 2015; Lima et al., 2016).”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There are a lot of areas of signal change like occipital cortex not specified in advance that might be described in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>The whole brain analysis revealed group differences in the quantitative maps in the occipital cortex, which would not be predicted in a study of the neural correlates of DLD. We discuss these differences in the discussion, page 21, highlighting the fact that some of these changes may be linked to other associated differences in the groups (for example, co-occurring dyslexia). It is worth pointing out the these differences would not be revealed if we had chosen only to focus on a priori ROIs rather than use a whole-brain approach (see response above). These unexpected findings in particular require replication and could serve as priors for future studies of DLD.</p><p><italic>“The broad constellation of challenges faced by children with DLD might also explain some of the group differences in MTsat and R1 values. For example, many children with DLD have co-occurring motor challenges (Hill, 2001; Sanjeevan and Mainela-Arnold, 2019), which may be reflected in changes in the motor network. This might also account for differences in regions we did not have clear hypotheses about, for example, in the occipital lobe. Many children in our study faced reading challenges, and left occipital-temporal hypoactivation is associated with dyslexia (Paulesu et al., 2014; Richlan, 2012) and now genetic variation in literacy skills (see above, Eising et al., 2021). One way to disentangle the contributions of these different cognitive traits would be to conduct large-scale studies including those with multiple diagnoses and use a transdiagnostic approach to establish specific relationships between brain and behaviour (Siugzdaite et al., 2020).”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretational</p><p>1. Do the results inform debate about whether DLD at tail end of a distribution or a chunked disorder?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is an interesting point, but are not sure whether our data can fully speak to this. Broadly, we see that both continuous and categorical approaches are good fits to our data. We have elaborated on this point in the discussion.</p><p>Page 22 – <italic>“There has been significant theoretical debate about whether DLD represents the tail end of a spectrum of language ability or if represents a group or several subgroups that are biologically distinguishable from those with poor language ability (Tomblin, 2011). Broadly speaking, there is now consensus in the field that these children represent the extreme end of a distribution (Bishop et al., 2016; Lancaster and Camarata, 2019; Tomblin and Zhang, 1999). We examined if our data was consistent with this idea by examining the distribution of our data. When plotted, the average values of striatal myelination for individual participants indicated overlap between the DLD and TD groups (see Figure 1). So not all children in the DLD had values outside of the range of values for the TD groups, as might be expected if we were observing a distinct sub-type. However, our continuous analysis does indicate that those who have the lowest values for striatal myelination have the lowest language factor scores. (see Figure 4). Our limited exploration of how these measures are distributed both within the DLD group and across the cohort is consistent with the idea that DLD is a spectrum disorder. Even so, further theoretically driven analyses that relate specific behaviour to these quantitative measures of brain microstructure might provide insight into whether there are distinct sub-types within DLD. Future studies should focus on understanding the full spectrum of DLD using large datasets, establishing if there are distinct brain-behaviour relationships within this broad category.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not essential but authors might speculate on how the changes in striatal myelination are related to the phenotype. The Oxford group has done a lot of work on the genetic of DLD: could any of that be related to gray-matter myelination? And they might also speculate on a mechanism at the neural level (note there is now an eLife structure for authors to fly kites more if they wish).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include the following paragraphs in the discussion.</p><p>Page 22 – <italic>“The striatal differences we report are broadly consistent with our views on the dorsal striatum being involved in language learning (Krishnan et al., 2016), as well as with theories such as the procedural deficit hypothesis (Lum et al., 2014; Ullman and Pierpont, 2005), and the procedural deficit circuit hypothesis (Ullman et al., 2020).This may be linked to difficulties extracting and retaining the sequential regularities for language, or challenges in automatising the use of language rules. Our sample with DLD shows differences in linguistic tasks that draw upon these abilities, such as nonword repetition or oromotor sequencing, even though they were not selected on this basis. Orpella and colleagues (2021) recently demonstrated that the dorsal and ventral striatum were crucial for developing and acting upon predictions in a statistical learning task. The use of such sensitive functional tasks may be important to demonstrate the functional consequences of these changes. Understanding such learning mechanisms may also help us understand how to design better intervention for children with DLD, for example, this may be a reason to simplify and repeat rules during learning, providing greater opportunities for practice and habituation. We are now testing the role of repetition in enhancing language comprehension in DLD (Parker et al., 2021).”</italic></p><p>Page 19 – <italic>“The genetic mechanisms that might drive these striatal changes are currently unclear. DLD is a highly heritable disorder but identification of genetic pathways has been difficult due to the broad phenotype and changes in diagnostic criteria (for a recent review see Mountford et al., 2022). In terms of monogenic disorders, the best known case is that of the KE family, the affected members of which had a rare point mutation in the gene FOXP2 causing verbal dyspraxia as well as the kinds of language learning difficulties seen in DLD. The mutation in FOXP2 was associated with reduced volumes of the caudate nuclei bilaterally in the KE family (Watkins et al., 2002), but it is unknown whether this was related to a quantitative difference in myelin content as seen here in DLD. FOXP2 is strongly expressed in the medium-spiny neurons of the striatum in humans and other species, and in many other neural and non-neural tissues (Lai et al., 2003). FOXP2 is a transcription factor affecting the function of many downstream target genes, including CNTNAP2 and FOXP1, which in turn have been linked to phenotypic features of DLD (Vernes et al., 2008; Lozano et al., 2015). Aside from identifying rare monogenic causes of DLD, other approaches have yielded common risk variants that explain variances in phenotypic features of DLD, including phonological skills (Newbury et al., 2009). A recent meta-analysis of DLD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of reading and language traits with an N &gt;30,000 found significant genome-wide association with word reading and distinct genetic variation of word and nonword reading, spelling and phoneme awareness that correlated with cortical surface area of the left superior temporal sulcus (Eising et al., 2021). Interestingly, in our study, the posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus in the left hemisphere showed significantly reduced MTsat and R1 values in children with DLD (see Figures 1, 2 and 3).”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Referee 2 raises the important issue of causality and whether the striatal changes could be a consequence rather than a cause of DLD. The authors might acknowledge limitations of correlational approach and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this point, and indeed, already note this in the limitations section as highlighted below, page 23.</p><p><italic>“It is also unclear whether the neural changes we observe are the cause of DLD, or a consequence of having a language disorder. Longitudinal studies where children are followed over time are the best way to shed light on this issue.”</italic></p><p>In addition to the specific points raised above, we also addressed one of the reviewers points about some relevant literature we had not covered.</p><p>Page 22 – <italic>“Our more global differences in myelination would also be consistent with theoretical views postulating that children with DLD show differences in the speed of processing, perhaps due to inefficiencies in information transfer through the brain (Kail, 1994; Miller et al., 2001). However, more recent theories point to more specific lexical processing differences in DLD. Children with DLD have been shown to have greater difficulty with lexical selection and inhibition of competitors, rather than the initial perceptual or phonological processing (Nation, 2014). Computational models suggest this could be due to increased levels of lexical delay (McMurray et al., 2010). Abnormalities in myelination could result in differing levels of inhibition for targets and competitors. Techniques like MEG would be better suited to test this hypothesis.”</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
