important player in the response to DNA damage. Recently, Histone PARylation Factor (HPF1) was shown to be a critical modulator of the activity of PARP1 by facilitating PARylation of histones and redirecting the target amino acid specificity from acidic to serine residues. Here, we investigate the mechanism and specific consequences of HPF1-mediated PARylation using nucleosomes as both activators and substrates for PARP1. HPF1 provides that catalytic base Glu284 to substantially redirect PARylation by PARP1 such that the histones in nucleosomes become the primary recipients of PAR chains. Surprisingly, HPF1 partitions most of the reaction product to free ADP-ribose (ADPR), resulting in much shorter PAR chains compared to reactions in the absence of HPF1. This HPF1-mediated switch from polymerase to hydrolase has important implications for the PARP1-mediated response to DNA damage and raises interesting new questions about the role of intracellular ADPR and depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PARP1</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA218255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luger</surname><given-names>Karolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luger</surname><given-names>Karolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Genevieve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The polymerase activity of PARP1 is converted to hydrolase activity upon binding of Histone Parylation Factor 1 (HPF1) with nucleosome activators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA damage is a frequent occurrence in cells and must be continuously monitored and repaired in order to maintain genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterson and Côté, 2004</xref>). The abundant nuclear proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1 and PARP2) serve as early detectors of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ray Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>). PARP1, upon binding to damaged DNA, binds NAD<sup>+</sup> and transfers the ADP-ribose (ADPR) portion onto itself and other proteins. PARP1 then elongates this ADPR to form a chain in a process termed poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), which can take place on PARP1 (autoPARylation) or other proteins (transPARylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai, 2015</xref>). These PAR chains are attached to thousands of nuclear proteins with histones being the most abundantly PARylated proteins apart from PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>). More recently it has been shown that histone-linked PARylation depends on Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, HPF1 not only promotes transPARylation of histones but also alters the specificity of the modified residues from aspartate or glutamate to serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>). The PAR chains attached to PARP1 and other proteins lead to the recruitment of DNA repair factors that contain PAR-binding motifs, such as macrodomains, WWE domains, or PAR-binding zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teloni and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>). It is thought that different types of PAR chains (i.e., long vs. short, branched vs. unbranched) may lead to recruitment of different repair factors in a concept termed the PAR code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlberg et al., 2013</xref>). Deletion of PARP1 leads to increased carcinogenesis, and deletion of both PARP1 and its most closely related homolog, PARP2, is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amé et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ménissier de Murcia et al., 2003</xref>). PARP1 (and PARP2) are important targets for cancer therapy with now four clinically approved compounds (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib) in use for treatment of breast and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, these and other inhibitors of PARP are being investigated as cancer treatments in combination with agents that damage DNA (e.g., temozolomide, cis-platinum, checkpoint inhibitors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). All clinically relevant inhibitors of PARP bind in the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket of the catalytic domain of PARP1 and PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thorsell et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>From a mechanistic point of view, PARP1 is a very complicated enzyme that catalyzes four different reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alemasova and Lavrik, 2019</xref>). In the first reaction, NAD<sup>+</sup> serves as a substrate for ADP-ribosylation of an amino acid side chain wherein the nucleophilic side chain attacks C1′′ to release nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A number of aspartates and glutamates in the BRCT domain of PARP1 itself are the primary sites of modification in autoPARylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gagné et al., 2015</xref>). The lack of specificity for a particular site (or protein) has been frustrating and confusing the field for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suskiewicz et al., 2020a</xref>). In the presence of HPF1, the specificity of PARP1 switches to serine side chains, again located primarily in the automodification regions between the end of the BRCT domain and the WGR domain for autoPARylation, and in histone tails for transPARylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonfiglio et al., 2017b</xref>). In the second reaction catalyzed by PARP1, NAD<sup>+</sup> is used to extend the initially attached ADPR, wherein the 2′-OH (the acceptor hydroxyl) of this ADPR is deprotonated by Glu988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Repeating this process, PARP1 builds long PAR chains of up to 200 units on itself with a large range reported for average chain lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawaichi et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sugimura and Miwa, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez-Gonzalez and Jacobson, 1987</xref>), in competition with PARGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pascal and Ellenberger, 2015</xref>). In a third reaction, PARP1 uses NAD<sup>+</sup> to add ADPR to create branch points by generating linkages using the 2′′-OH instead of the 2′-OH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Branching has been shown to occur about once every 5–20 residues for autoPARylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez-Gonzalez and Jacobson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miwa et al., 1979</xref>) and is mechanistically feasible because of the pseudo-symmetry of ADPR that allows for binding of the elongating polymer in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruf et al., 1998</xref>). In the fourth and final reaction, PARP1 hydrolyzes NAD<sup>+</sup> to generate free ADPR. This ‘treadmilling’ reaction becomes more dominant at extended reaction times and low concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bauer et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desmarais et al., 1991</xref>). We address the mechanism by which HPF1 affects initiation, elongation, and treadmilling in this article.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chemical mechanism of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and structures of nucleosomes used here.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical mechanism of PARP1 highlighting in red important groups of NAD<sup>+</sup> as related to initiation (C-1′′), elongation (2′-OH), and branching (2′′-OH).

As we are particularly interested in studying how HPF1 mediates PARylation of histones, proteins that do not exist in free form in the cell, we use nucleosomes as both substrates and activators of PARP1. We have previously shown that nucleosomes bind tightly to PARP1 (1–13 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muthurajan et al., 2014</xref>). Of special relevance to both nucleosomes and HPF1, we have recently shown that HPF1 binds fivefold more tightly to a PARP1–nucleosome complex than to PARP1 bound to a DNA oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>). We show that HPF1 not only changes the specificity of PARP1 from autoPARylation and glutamate modification towards transPARylation and serine modification, it also converts PARP1 into a strong NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase, resulting in much shorter PAR chains and high concentrations of free ADPR. Our results have important implications for the cellular role of HPF1 in PARylation, the PAR code, and the DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nucleosomes are better activators of PARP1 than free DNA</title><p>Since HPF1 is known to mediate PARylation of histones, proteins that are tethered to the genome in the form of chromatin, we set out to test the activity of PARP1 using nucleosome substrates. Understanding how HPF1 modulates the activity of PARP1 towards itself (autoPARylation) and towards histones (transPARylation) in the context of nucleosomes is complicated by the fact that nucleosomes provide both the DNA that activates PARP1 <italic>and</italic> serve as substrates for histone transPARylation. It is possible that different nucleosomes serve these two roles (<italic>activator</italic> vs. <italic>substrate</italic>) to different extents. Thus, we began our studies of the activity of PARP1 with nucleosomes by first investigating the ability of different nucleosomes to serve solely as <italic>activators</italic> of autoPARylation in the absence of HPF1 as under these conditions we do not observe transPARylation of histones (see below). We prepared a variety of nucleosome constructs, from mononucleosomes (Nuc147, Nuc165) to trinucleosomes (NLE-Tri, LE-Tri; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as tested free DNA in comparison (p18mer, p147mer, p165mer, p621mer).

We chose to measure autoPARylation activity by monitoring the incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P-ADPR from <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> onto PARP1 as this method does not rely on NAD<sup>+</sup>-analogs, is highly sensitive, and can be implemented in modest throughput (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We were able to achieve reproducible and linear rates of autoPARylation using a variety of nucleosome and DNA activators (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As noted many years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez-Gonzalez and Jacobson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naegeli et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bauer et al., 1990</xref>), we find that autoPARylation is a robust activity that leads to the addition of &gt;100 ADPRs per PARP1 within 1 min at saturating concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup>. By varying the concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup>, we determined that the K<sub>m</sub> for NAD<sup>+</sup> is not affected by the activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and our K<sub>m</sub> values are in reasonable agreement with previous determinations of K<sub>m</sub> of NAD<sup>+</sup> for PARP1 (30–100 µM) using a variety of different assay methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desmarais et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miranda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langelier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). We noted that Nuc165 consistently yielded a higher turnover number (k<sub>cat</sub>) than p18mer (p&lt;0.0001), and these values are in reasonable agreement with previous determinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desmarais et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miranda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langelier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>) of k<sub>cat</sub> for PARP1 (0.3–5 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This difference in k<sub>cat</sub> was also determined for other nucleosome vs. free DNA comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Note that p165mer and p621mer DNA fragments, used to assemble Nuc165 and LE-Tri nucleosomes, respectively, have k<sub>cat</sub> values that are similar to p18mer, whereas all the nucleosome complexes tested have similar, higher values of k<sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) despite having different lengths of overhanging DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Using Nuc165 and adding HPF1 in the plate-based assay described above, we saw no significant change in the K<sub>m</sub> for NAD<sup>+</sup> or the k<sub>cat</sub> for incorporation of ADPR into protein compared to the absence of HPF1, although the linearity of the assay was significantly reduced compared to assays in the absence of HPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; note the non-zero intercepts with linear fits from 0 to 100 s). The similar overall levels of incorporation of ADPR in the presence and absence of HPF1 are qualitatively consistent with previous in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>) and comparisons of PAR levels by western blots in wild-type vs. HPF1-/- cells seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>). However, in these reactions, PARylation occurs on PARP1, histones, and HPF1, and this plate-based precipitation assay does not allow for discrimination between the different reaction products. Given the high affinity (low nM) of nucleosomes for PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muthurajan et al., 2014</xref>), it was not possible to separate different targets of PARylation without denaturation. We thus used SDS-PAGE to analyze auto- vs. transPARylation. One complication of this method is the migration of <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> at ~30 kDa in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, high concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> as one might use in a typical kinetic study cannot be used since the large signal from unused substrate obliterates the much fainter signal for measuring initial rates of PARylation for both PARP1 and histones. In fact, we note that the Ahel group typically performs their radioactive PARylation experiments at 5–100 µM <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> for 20 min, thus ensuring the complete consumption of the potentially interfering substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartlett et al., 2018</xref>) (see also Figure 5B). Alternatively, these types of PARylation assays have been successfully performed using antibodies to detect modified proteins following separation on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liszczak et al., 2018</xref>), which avoids the problem of detecting NAD<sup>+</sup> but is generally not a good quantitative method. Thus, to better compare the relative activities of PARylation between PARP1 and nucleosomes, we used multiple turnover conditions with 10 µM <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> at short time points (30 s). This method allows for simultaneous detection of PARylation of PARP1, HPF1, and histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These gels confirm that HPF1 reduces autoPARylation and mediates transPARylation of histones and HPF1. It is important to note that we do not detect any PARylation of histones (or H3 peptide) in the absence of HPF1.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) mediates transPARylation onto nucleosomes and serines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative autoradiogram from an assay gel demonstrating the reduction of autoPARylation in the presence of HPF1 with the concomitant appearance of PARylated histones and HPF1.

Validating our approach, controls in the absence of HPF1 monitoring autoPARylation yielded reasonably linear incorporation of ADPR vs. time, similar to what we observed using the plate-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, blue circles). Additionally, this gel-based assay compares well with the plate assay when comparing levels of ADPR added to PARP1 at 30 s in that we see more total incorporation of ADPR in the presence of nucleosomes than free DNA (in the absence of HPF1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, column 2, compare p18mer with all nucleosome constructs). We observe that for autoPARylation, in the absence of HPF1 and at these low concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup>, 3–7 ADPRs are attached per PARP1 within 30 s, consistent with good enzymological practices wherein one should consume low amounts of substrate (&lt;10% of the initial NAD<sup>+</sup>).</p><p>Strikingly, in the presence of HPF1 and nucleosomes, incorporation of ADPR onto PARP1, HPF1, and, most prominently, histones becomes less linear as if a faster ‘burst of activity’ had occurred followed by no further incorporation of ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This non-linearity correlates in part with the reduced linearity seen in the plate-based assay in the presence of HPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) but may also be due in part to slower quenching kinetics by the use of olaparib instead of acid. This non-linearity precluded comparisons of rates of PARylation, and thus we compared the amounts of ADPR incorporation at 30 s. Because of the ‘burst’ of incorporation of ADPR onto histones in the presence of HPF1, this comparison at 30 s serves as a lower limit for the HPF1-mediated switch in specificity. AutoPARylation is consistently decreased by factors of 2–4 by the addition of HPF1, regardless of which nucleosome is used as an activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The presence of HPF1 clearly makes histones in the nucleosome substrates the dominant recipient of PARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Despite the limitations of this assays, we conclude that the switch in specificity from autoPARylation towards transPARylation is minimally two- to fourfold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Neither the HPF1-dependent decrease in autoPARylation nor the large switch in specificity is observed using p18mer DNA and H3 tail peptide as a substrate, presumably because of the weaker interaction of HPF1 with the PARP1–p18mer complex vs. the PARP1–Nuc165 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>). This result emphasizes the importance of studying HPF1 with nucleosomal substrates and activators. Additionally, we see a very small amount (&lt;0.1 equivalents) of incorporation of ADPR onto HPF1 in the presence of nucleosomes but not free DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the HPF1-mediated switch in specificity from autoPARylation to histone PARylation, we also confirmed the concomitant switch in specificity from Glu/Asp modification to Ser modification. PARylation on Glu/Asp residues can be removed by treatment with hydroxylamine (HA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cervantes-Laurean et al., 1997</xref>). Prior to loading reaction mixtures with <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> onto gels for quantitation, samples were either treated with 1 M HA (pH 7.0) or as a control with 1 M HEPES (pH 7.0). Treatment with HA removes &gt;90% of ADPR from PARP1 in the absence of HPF1, as seen in a representative gel and by quantitation from replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the presence of HPF1, PARylation on both PARP1 and H3 tail peptide is retained (&gt;90%) after exposure to HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating the linkages to ADPR are no longer via Asp/Glu and most likely to Ser, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that HPF1 significantly suppresses autoPARylation and thus makes histones in the nucleosome, and not PARP1, the primary target of PARylation. This effect is unique to nucleosome substrates as we do not observe it using activation by p18mer and the histone H3-derived peptide as a substrate. In addition to the switch in protein specificity from PARP1 to histones, HPF1 also mediates the dramatic switch in specificity from Glu/Asp residues to Ser residues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Glu284 is the catalytic residue that mediates transPARylation of histones</title><p>The discovery that PARylation in response to DNA damage in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>) and in vitro (see our results above and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>) occurs primarily on serine residues instead of glutamate or aspartate requires a fundamental rethinking of the reaction mechanism of PARP1. Glutamate and aspartate residues are deprotonated under physiological conditions and thus primed for nucleophilic attack on the C1′ of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, serine as a target for PARylation is protonated, and thus one might expect that deprotonation of serine by a catalytic base would be required to initiate the nucleophilic attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Deprotonation of serine to increase nucleophilicity is a familiar theme in enzymatic catalysis as, for example, in the serine proteases, esterases, and lipases (Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dodson and Wlodawer, 1998</xref>). Although PARP1 has a known catalytic base (Glu988) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marsischky et al., 1995</xref>), this residue alone is not capable of mediating PARylation of serines as we see no histone PARylation without the addition of HPF1. With the discovery that HPF1 is responsible for the specificity switch from glutamate to serine residues, as well as mediating transPARylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>), we conjectured that HPF1 could provide the essential catalytic base. Given that we had no structural information for HPF1 at the time as our efforts began well before the publication of the crystal structure of HPF1 bound to PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>), we set out to find the putative catalytic base by mutagenesis of likely candidate residues that were either histidines, aspartates, or glutamates. Our criterion for success was to identify a residue whose mutation abolished transPARylation activity without being detrimental to the stability of the protein or its binding to a PARP1–Nuc165 complex. Site-directed mutagenesis looking for loss of catalytic function with retention of structure is a classical approach in enzymology that has been used to successfully identify many catalytic residues prior to the determination of three-dimensional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plapp, 1995</xref>). We measured activity using gel-based PARylation assays as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and stability of the protein using thermal denaturation experiments. We previously developed a FRET-based assay for quantitating the binding interaction between HPF1 and PARP1, demonstrating that HPF1 prefers the PARP1–Nuc165 complex vs. a PARP1–p18mer complex by a factor of five (790 nM vs. 3800 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Glu284 of Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) is the catalytic base required for transPARylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical mechanism of PARylation of glutamate (Glu, on left) does not require a catalytic base, whereas PARylation of serine (Ser, on right) requires deprotonation of serine by a catalytic base.

The family tree consists of two major branches, and we noted that the two residues in the C-terminal domain of HPF1 (Tyr238 and Arg239) previously identified as important for interaction with PARP1 by the Ahel group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>) were conserved in both branches. Given that there are 62 histidines, aspartates, and glutamates in HPF1, we assumed that a catalytic base would be highly conserved, and therefore considered only completely conserved residues in the C-terminal domain that had been shown to be critical for the interaction with PARP1. This pruning procedure leaves only Asp283, Glu284, Asp286, Glu292, Asp296, and His303, which were individually mutated to alanine.</p><p>We performed transPARylation assays with the mutant proteins as described above, demonstrating that the D283A and E284A mutants of HPF1 were unable to mediate histone or HPF1 PARylation, in contrast to WT HPF1 or other mutations such as the E292A and His303Q mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). All four HPF1 mutants displayed similar protein stability in denaturation assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that the loss of transPARylation for D283A and E284A was not due to misfolding. However, only three of these mutants retained their binding to the PARP1–Nuc165 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>), with the D283A mutant of HPF1 showing no detectable formation of a complex (K<sub>D</sub> &gt;10,000 nM).

The loss of transPARylation and the retention of binding to the PARP1–Nuc165 complex indicated that Glu284 is the catalytic base required for PARylation of serine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas Asp283 is required for a productive interaction of HPF1 with the PARP1–Nuc165 complex. Our findings are an independent validation of the identification of Glu284 as the catalytic base from recent structural and biochemical analyses by the Ahel group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>). Additionally, the discovery of the E284A mutant allowed us to further dissect how HPF1 modulates the activity of PARP1, namely (1) catalytic, by providing a base for deprotonation of Ser residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and (2) binding, by perturbing the shared active site formed by direct interactions with the PARP1–Nuc165 complex.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>HPF1 mutant analysis.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">HPF1</th><th valign="top">Melting temperature <break/>(°C)</th><th valign="top">Histone PARylation <break/>(pmol ADPR/30 s)</th><th valign="top">K<sub>D</sub> (nM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">WT</td><td valign="top">50.6 ± 0.10 <break/>n = 5</td><td valign="top">10.1 ± 1.3 <break/>n = 4</td><td valign="top">790 ± 147 <break/>n = 12</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D283A</td><td valign="top">50.8 ± 0.11 <break/>n = 5</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">&gt;10,000,000 <break/>n = 5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">E284A</td><td valign="top">50.3 ± 0.86 <break/>n = 5</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">135 ± 58 <break/>n = 4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">E292A</td><td valign="top">49.0 ± 0.08 <break/>n = 5</td><td valign="top">17.5 ± 2.1 <break/>n = 4</td><td valign="top">743 ± 200 <break/>n = 4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">H303Q</td><td valign="top">50.2 ± 0.10 <break/>n = 5</td><td valign="top">21.1 ± 7.6 <break/>n = 4</td><td valign="top">676 ± 427 <break/>n = 3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">Column 1: protein stability was measured by Thermo Fisher Protein Thermal Shift kit.

In contrast, the addition of HPF1 (either wild-type or E284A mutant) led to much shorter PAR chains, consistent with the high amount of free ADPR formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D,</xref> <bold>C</bold>).

Addition of HPF1 increases the overall turnover of NAD<sup>+</sup> to form free nicotinamide by a factor of four in the presence of Nuc165 (47 vs. 12.5 µM in 1 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The effect of HPF1 is not as pronounced when using p18mer instead of Nuc165 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), presumably because of its weaker interaction with the PARP1–p18mer complex compared to the PARP1–Nuc165 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, this HPF1-dependent effect (using Nuc165 or p18mer) is at least partially conserved for the E284A mutant of HPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which binds to the PARP1–Nuc165 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>), but does not promote transPARylation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Very dramatically, the modest HPF1-dependent increase in the formation of nicotinamide is eclipsed by a much larger increase in ADPR formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the absence of HPF1, we observe 10–14% ‘treadmilling’, while in the presence of HPF1, PARP1 spends most of its catalytic power (~90%) consuming NAD<sup>+</sup> to form free ADPR. Surprisingly, the E284A mutant of HPF1, which binds more tightly than wild-type HPF1, has the same effect on the hydrolase activity of PARP1, even though it neither promotes transPARylation nor serine PARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Control experiments demonstrated that neither wild-type HPF1 nor the E284A mutant have detectable levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity on their own. The observed dramatic increase in treadmilling explains the lack of linearity (i.e., the burst in PARylation) seen in the gel-based assays with HPF1 above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). That is, although the initiation reaction on serines occurs efficiently, PARP1 then spends most of its catalytic power performing hydrolysis of NAD<sup>+</sup>, thereby precluding further attachment of ADPR onto protein in the presence of HPF1. These unexpected results suggest that HPF1 converts PARP1 into a strong NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase and presumably represses formation of long PAR chains on histones.</p><p>For PARP1 alone, autoPARylation is rapid and efficient wherein the end of the growing PAR chain is located in a binding pocket adjacent to the primary NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruf et al., 1998</xref>). In the recent structure of HPF1 bound to PARP2, HPF1 partially occupies the binding site typically associated with PAR chain extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>). To test whether the increased hydrolase activity is due to the lack of readily available substrate for PARylation due to HPF1 blockage of this extension site, we performed a titration of the histone H3 tail peptide in the presence of a fixed concentration of p18mer as a DNA activator. Providing high concentrations of the substrate peptide suppressed the treadmilling effect to baseline levels in the presence of HPF1 while subtly increasing the overall activity of PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Control experiments in the absence of HPF1 showed no change in the percentage of hydrolysis or total turnover as a function of H3 tail peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To more directly address the profound effect of HPF1 on the length of PAR chains, we modified our assay conditions by using greater amounts of protein to facilitate quantitation of AMP-PR, the product formed after digestion by phosphodiesterase that represents chain ‘middles’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Monitoring the entire time course of NAD<sup>+</sup> disappearance and ADPR formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we observe faster depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> and much greater formation of ADPR in the presence of HPF1, in agreement with the fixed time point results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>. If we compare the incorporation of AMP-PR (‘middles’) at the end of the reaction when all of the NAD<sup>+</sup> (200 µM initially) has been consumed, we confirm that the PAR chains are much shorter in the presence of HPF1 than in its absence. This holds true for activation by both nucleosomes and p18mer but is more pronounced for nucleosomes, which we again attribute to the higher affinity of HPF1 for the PARP1–Nuc165 complex compared to the PARP1–p18mer complex. Control experiments demonstrated that HPF1 or the E284A mutant alone did not exhibit significant phosphodiesterase activity. Given the results above, we were not surprised to find that the E284A mutant of HPF1 had a similar effect as wild-type HPF1 on PAR chain formation. To be noted, HPF1-mediated PARylation is not limited to addition of a single ADPR (MARylation) as we do observe significant concentrations of AMP-PR that can arise only through true polymerization (minimally trimers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We began our work by demonstrating that nucleosomes are better activators of PARP1 than free DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Because the tested nucleosomes all activate equally well (regardless of overhang length, or mono- vs. tri-nucleosomes), our results extend previous observations about the promiscuity of PARP1 with respect to DNA activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langelier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Silva et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) using a more physiologically relevant activator. Based on the seminal work by Pascal and Black demonstrating that DNA activation of PARP1 is mediated by a series of conformational changes that disorder the HD domain and thereby open up the active site for binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawicki-McKenna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steffen et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesize that nucleosomes are in some way more efficient in this process. Perhaps there are direct interactions between the unfolded (or alternatively folded) HD domain and nucleosomes that stabilize the open conformation and prevent this domain from collapsing back onto the catalytic domain. In fact, just such an interaction is observed by the loop in the HD domain of PARP2 (Leu302 and Arg303) with the linker DNA from the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bilokapic et al., 2020</xref>). Ongoing structural efforts will hopefully show whether this or some other interaction exists for PARP1, leading to the enhanced activation of PARP1 by nucleosomes vs. free DNA.</p><p>Upon adding HPF1 to assays using nucleosomes as both activators and substrates of PARP1, we show that the activity of PARP1 is significantly redirected towards histones and away from PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Our results are consistent with those from the Ahel group obtained with free DNA and histone-derived peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>) as well as from the Muir group using nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liszczak et al., 2018</xref>), but provide quantitative information regarding the extent of this switch. For example, HPF1 causes transPARylation of histones to be preferred over autoPARylation of PARP1 minimally by factors of 2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), a switch that is particularly dramatic as we observe no histone PARylation in the absence of HPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This switch in specificity is notable as autoPARylation is a simple one-body problem wherein PARP1 modifies itself, whereas transPARylation requires the correct interactions between PARP1, HPF1, and the histone tails in the nucleosomes. Also, it should be re-emphasized that, in addition to the switch towards transPARylation, HPF1 mediates the switch in amino acid specificity away from aspartate/glutamate towards serine, even on PARP1 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>In an independent and unbiased approach to better understand the mechanism of how HPF1 effects the switch in amino acid specificity from glutamates and aspartates to serines, we have identified Glu284 as the catalytic base on HPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), as also recently published by the Ahel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>) and Yun groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate that the E284A mutant has the same stability as wild-type HPF1 and binds even more tightly to the PARP1–nucleosome complex than wild-type HPF1. The occurrence of a shared active site formed by PARP1 and HPF1 is a completely unexpected and novel finding in the field of post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suskiewicz et al., 2020a</xref>). The PARP1–HPF1 complex has two catalytic bases. Glu284 on HPF1 mediates the deprotonation and activation of serine residues on acceptor proteins for the initiation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), while Glu988 on PARP1 mediates the deprotonation and activation of the 2′- or 2′′-OH on the acceptor ADPR for PAR chain extension or branching, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Glu988 on PARP1 also facilitates the binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> via an H-bond to the 3′-OH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruf et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with Glu284 on HPF1, not Glu988 on PARP1, performing the de-protonation required for initiation, Ahel’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>) observe HPF1-mediated incorporation of ADPR by the E988K mutant of PARP1, albeit at lower levels than wild-type.</p><p>Our most dramatic and unexpected finding is the extent by which HPF1 converts PARP1 from a polymerase that adds long polymers of ADPR onto itself or histones, into a hydrolase that generates free ADPR. Under our conditions, almost 90% of all the NAD<sup>+</sup> consumed by PARP1 in the presence of nucleosome activators and HPF1 is converted to free ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation holds true both at short time points of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and at the end of the reaction where all the NAD<sup>+</sup> has been consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Also, recall that the presence of both nucleosomes and HPF1 increases the overall turnover of NAD<sup>+</sup> by PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These dual effects lead to rapid depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> and formation of high concentrations of free ADPR. Given that increasing PARylation acceptor sites (i.e., high concentrations of H3 histone tail peptide, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) greatly reduces the percentage of free ADPR formed, we conclude that HPF1 blocks PAR chain formation by occluding the extension site on PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>), and thus PARP1, still bound to activating DNA (i.e., nucleosome), quickly runs out of suitable PARylation sites and therefore uses water as a nucleophile instead. The affinity of PARP1 for nucleosomes is very high (nM), and it is thought that significant PARylation is required for dissociation of DNA from PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langelier et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is unclear what ratio of treadmilling would occur under cellular conditions where rapid exchange of PARP1 to other nucleosomes is most likely not occurring, and new methods will be needed to investigate this quantitatively. The high consumption of NAD<sup>+</sup> by PARP1 suggests that PARP1 not only plays a role in the DNA damage response but also in metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurtado-Bagès et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murata et al., 2019</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup> is electron acceptor in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PARP1 is the major consumer of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the nucleus, and the rapid depletion of the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool (50–80%) by PARP1 in response to DNA damage leads to ATP depletion, has dramatic consequences for mitochondria, and leads to cell death via apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berger, 1985</xref>). The observation of partitioning away from PARylation and towards ADPR formation by HPF1 is a novel finding that suggests a more important role for ADPR than anticipated as a signaling molecule in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The conversion of PARP1 into an NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase is also evident in the much lower incorporation of chain ‘middles’ onto histones or PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that HPF1-mediated PARylation yields much shorter chains than the typical long chains seen during autoPARylation in the absence of HPF1. Our quantitative demonstration of these shorter chains is in agreement with previous observations that smears of PARP1 typically seen after autoPARylation in SDS-PAGE are reduced in the presence of HPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>) and that PAR chains are much reduced in amount and length as detected by enzymatic labeling of terminal ADPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ando et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, it is interesting to compare our findings with a recent demonstration that HPF1-mediated PARylation in cells leads primarily to mono-ADPR on serine residues, in part due to the activity of the glycohydrolase PARG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>), which interestingly also generates ADPR. PARG has also been shown to mediate transPARylation of histones, in part by competing with PARP1 for PAR chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ménard et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomassin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lagueux et al., 1995</xref>). It therefore remains to be elucidated whether the rapid and sustained depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> after DNA damage in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juarez-Salinas et al., 1979</xref>) is due to PARylation and subsequent dePARylation by PARG, PARylation, and futile treadmilling by PARP1 alone, or some combination of these events. As with the increased NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity triggered by HPF1, the formation of shorter PAR chains is partially preserved using the catalytic HPF1 mutant E284A. As concluded for the high hydrolase activity, these shorter PAR chains using either wild-type HPF1 or its E284A mutation are readily understandable given that HPF1 partially occupies the binding site typically associated with PAR chain extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suskiewicz et al., 2020b</xref>). Although our assay did not allow us to measure chain branches with sufficient sensitivity, we would argue that for this same reason HPF1-mediated PARylation has few if any branch points.</p><p>The formation of shorter PAR chains in the presence of HPF1 has important consequences that become particularly relevant when considering intracellular concentrations of these proteins. PARP1 is a very abundant nuclear protein, exceeding the concentration of HPF1 by about twentyfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). Also, PARP1 is one of the very first proteins recruited to DNA damage sites induced by laser microirradiation, whereas HPF1 arrives more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahadevan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is possible that substantial PARylation at some points in time, at some sites, or at some types of damage occurs without HPF1. The consequences for the so-called PAR code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlberg et al., 2013</xref>) are immense. PARP1-alone-mediated autoPARylation leads to long and branched chains, whereas HPF1-mediated PARylation leads to short, most likely unbranched chains. This change in the PARylation pattern may result in the recruitment of different repair proteins to DNA damage sites with HPF1 vs. those without, and thus in turn may direct DNA damage to be repaired by one pathway over another. The differentiation between these two outcomes in a cellular context is difficult but worthy of further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">PARP1</td><td valign="top">UniProt</td><td valign="top">P09874</td><td valign="top">As described in <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rudolph et al., 2018</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">HPF1</td><td valign="top">UniProt</td><td valign="top">Q9NWY4</td><td valign="top">As described in manuscript</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequenced-based reagent</td><td valign="top">p18mer DNA</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">5′-phosphate-GGGTTGCGGCCGCTTGGG-3′; <break/>double-stranded</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rosetta DE3 pLys</td><td valign="top">EMD Millipore</td><td valign="top">70956</td><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">384-well plates</td><td valign="top">Corning</td><td valign="top">3575</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">96-well plates</td><td valign="top">Corning</td><td valign="top">3898</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Whatman GF/C glass paper</td><td valign="top">Whatman</td><td valign="top">28497-619-PK</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Olaparib</td><td valign="top">SelleckChem</td><td valign="top">S1060</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">QuikChange II <break/>Mutagenesis kit</td><td valign="top">Agilent Technologies</td><td valign="top">200523</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Synergi Fusion-RP column</td><td valign="top">Phenomenex</td><td valign="top">00F-4424-EO</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Nuc147, Nuc165, Nuc207, <break/>NLE-Tri, LE-Tri</td><td valign="top">Prepared in-house</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muthurajan et al., 2016</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ADP-ribose</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">A0752</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Nicotinamide</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">N3376</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">NAD<sup>+</sup></td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">N0632</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">H3 peptide</td><td valign="top">Anaspec</td><td valign="top">AS-61701</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top"><sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup></td><td valign="top">PerkinElmer</td><td valign="top">NEG023X</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Snake venom <break/>phosphodiesterase</td><td valign="top">Worthington</td><td valign="top">LS003926</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism 9.0</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism</td><td valign="top">Version 9.0.1 (128)</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>NAD<sup>+</sup>, nicotinamide, and ADPR were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Following addition of <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> (40 µM, 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> cpm/well, PerkinElmer) to yield a final volume of 25 µL, reactions were quenched at varying time points (0.33–5 min) by addition of 50 µL of 30% trichloracetic acid (TCA). Samples (50 µL of total) were then loaded onto a Whatman Mini-Fold Spot-Blot apparatus containing a Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filter. Each well was washed three times with 10% TCA (100 µL). After removal of the filter from the apparatus, the filter was gently incubated in 10% TCA (20–40 mL) for three more washes. After drying, the filter was exposed to a Phosphor screen overnight (GE Healthcare) and imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare). Spot intensities were quantitated using ImageQuant. For converting arbitrary pixel intensities into molar quantities, a known amount of NAD<sup>+</sup>(4–6 pmol) was blotted onto a filter paper and exposed for the same amount of time.

PARP1 is activated by nucleosomes, so no further activator was needed. For assays with the H3 peptide substrate (22.5 µM), 100 nM p18mer DNA was included to trigger activation of PARP1. PARylation reactions were initiated by addition of 20 µL of <sup>32</sup>P-NAD<sup>+</sup> to a final concentration of 10 µM (~5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cpm/reaction). Aliquots were removed at 10–40 s and quenched by addition of olaparib to 4 µM. For analysis, samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer (2×), heated to 95°C for 3 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris, Thermo Fisher using 1× MES buffer). The gel was exposed to a PhosphorScreen, and then imaged and quantitated as for the filter-based assay. Signals for PARP1, HPF1, and cumulative histones were quantitated individually and corrected for background using boxes of equivalent area.

Reactions were initiated with NAD<sup>+</sup> (200 µM) to yield a final volume of 30 µL and were quenched after 1 min with 30 µL of perchloric acid (1 M). After a 15 min incubation on ice, precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 14,000×<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and placed into a fresh tube containing 6 µL of sodium acetate (1 M, pH 4.5). This mixture was re-neutralized by addition of 11 µL of KOH (5 N), and the precipitated salts were removed by brief centrifugation at 1000×<italic>g</italic>. The supernatant was removed, loaded into HPLC vials, and analyzed on a Synergi Fusion-RP column (Phenomenex, 150 × 4.6 mm) using the following conditions: start = 97% buffer (20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.5), 3% acetonitrile; 10 min gradient to 40% acetonitrile, followed by a 3 min gradient back to 3% acetonitrile; and then a 5 min re-equilibration under those conditions prior to the next injection. ADPR, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and nicotinamide eluted at 2.8–2.9, 3.9–4, and 5.0–5.1, respectively. The area under the curve was used to determine absolute concentrations by comparison with injection of known amounts of ADPR, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and nicotinamide using extinction coefficients at 260 nm of 17.4, 13.5, and 2.5 mM<sup>−1 </sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.</p><p>The HPLC-based assay above was modified to facilitate the direct measurement of chain length extension as follows. Concentrations of p18mer or Nuc165 were increased to 1 µM and were pre-incubated with NAD<sup>+</sup> in the presence or absence of HPF1 (wild-type or E284A mutant, 2 µM). Reaction volumes were increased to 450 µL. Following initiation with PARP1 (1 µM), 45 µL aliquots were withdrawn and quenched into 45 µL of perchloric acid (1 M). Precipitation, removal of protein, re-neutralization, and analysis of ADPR, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and nicotinamide were performed as above. The precipitated protein pellet (containing PARP1, HPF1, and histones) was resuspended in 30 µL of Tris-HCl (100 mM, un-pH’d at ~10) containing 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.6 U/sample of snake venom phosphodiesterase. After incubation for 18 hr at RT, the proteins were precipitated, and AMP-PR<sub>2</sub> (branches), AMP-PR (middles), and AMP (ends) were recovered and analyzed by HPLC as above for ADPR, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and nicotinamide with elution times of 2.0–2.1, 2.9–3.0, and 3.8–3.9 min, respectively. Amounts of AMP-PR<sub>2</sub> were too low to quantitate accurately, and amounts of AMP were variable due to NAD<sup>+</sup> contamination of protein precipitates prior to digestion. (The remaining NAD<sup>+</sup> from the reaction is digested to AMP by phosphodiesterase, and attempts to remove this contaminant by acid wash of the protein pellets prior to digestion led to variable results. We thus limited our analysis to AMP-PR, which reflects the PAR chain length.)</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>No competing financial interests have been declared.

The most significant finding is that histone PARylation factor (HPF1) binding to PARP1 causes a shift from primarily PARylation activity to that of hydrolytic activity, which offers new avenues for understanding and controlling PARP1. The findings described in this paper are of broad interest to readers in the fields of DNA damage response, chromatin structure regulation, and to researchers studying PARP1 and issues related to NAD+ metabolism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HPF1 and nucleosomes mediate a dramatic switch in activity of PARP1 from polymerase to hydrolase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maria Spies as a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>While all reviewers have acknowledged the quality of the experimental work reported in this manuscript, they agreed that the current title and the main message of the manuscript are somewhat provocative and are not fully aligned with the experimental evidence. The authors should thoroughly address the points raised by the reviewers by analyzing the data more critically and tempering the message/title, and/or with new experiments. Specifically:</p><p>1) Provide a better explanation of the treadmilling effect. This can be done experimentally, by carrying out the analysis of a mutant at the orthodox carboxylate nucleophile (see Rev. 1 suggestion), providing more serine substrates (see reviewer #2 suggestion), and/or discussing possible alternative mechanisms suggested by reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>2) The results of the gel-based and plate-based assays need to be reconciled. Specifically, no difference in the steady-state kinetic parameters observed in the presence and absence of HPF1 in plate-based assays needs to be reconciled with the different kinetics (burst followed by slow phase) observed in the gel-based assays.</p><p>3) Temper the statement regarding the effects of nucleosome vs. DNA interaction on PARP1 (see specific comments by reviewers 1 and 3).</p><p>4) Address the comments by reviewers 1 and 3 regarding identification of E284 as a catalytic base.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• Using their plate-based assay (which measures total protein ADPr incorporation by PARP1), the authors see no change in Km (for NAD+) or kcat in the presence of HPF1 compared to its absence (Figure 2C) (of note, the HPF1 concentration is missing in the Materials and methods section for this assay). No change in the apparent kcat might be seen as surprising considering the dramatic change in the mechanism, substrate preference, and – as the authors ultimately show – the extent of &quot;non-productive&quot; NAD+ hydrolysis upon HPF1 addition. The raw data in the presence of HPF1 are not shown, but presumably the incorporation is similarly linear to the situation in the absence of HPF1 (Figure 2B), as otherwise it would be commented upon. However, in the gel-based assay, the authors see that HPF1 significantly changes the kinetics of ADPr incorporation for all protein substrates that are present (PARP1, HPF1, and especially histones), resulting in an initial quick burst of modification prior to the first timepoint of 10 sec, followed by slow linear behaviour (Figure 3B). In our view, the burst might correspond to the fast serine ADPribosylation and the linear phase could represent chain extension (very slow because inhibited by HPF1). How are the observations from these two different assays reconciled with each other? Does the rate of ADPr incorporation in the plate-based assay measured in the presence of HPF1 correspond to the burst phase or the linear phase of the gel-based results? If there is a real discrepancy, is it due to technical differences? For example, in case the DNA used contains terminal phosphates, is it conceivable that the filter-based assay measures DNA ADP-ribosylation in addition to protein ADP-ribosylation? Answering this point does not necessarily require new experiments, but more extensive comments on technical aspects of the two assays and how they could be reconciled would be useful.</p><p>• The authors write: &quot;That is, although the initiation reaction on serines occurs efficiently, PARP1 then spends most of its catalytic power performing hydrolysis of NAD+, thereby precluding further attachment of ADPR onto protein in the presence of HPF1&quot;. This wording suggests a causal link whereby the increased treadmilling revealed with the HPLC-based assay limits the length of synthesised protein-linked PAR chains in the presence of HPF1. However, a reverse causal relationship is also possible and perhaps more likely: because HPF1 binding to PARP1 inhibits chain extension, PARP1 – following mono modification of suitable serine residues – quickly runs out of preferred substrates, and this might increase the chance of &quot;futile&quot; NAD+ hydrolysis due to accepting water as a substrate (in contrast, HPF1-free PARP1 can always extend a growing PAR chain and thus never runs out of a non-water substrate). If this interpretation is correct, would providing more serine substrates, e.g. in the form of a large excess of a suitable serine-containing peptide, limit the observed &quot;futile&quot; NAD+ hydrolysis by PARP1:HPF1 or is treadmilling an inherent property of this complex independent of serine substrate availability? Additionally, it would be useful to comment on the relationship between the HPLC-based assay and the gel-based assay: is the treadmilling measured in what in the gel-based assay corresponds to the burst phase or the linear phase? Perhaps, following the above proposed reasoning, during the burst phase – which might correspond to serine modification – treadmilling is lower and only becomes significant later? In Figure 6C, the first timepoint is after 10 sec, which (if the conditions of these two assays are comparable) would correspond to the burst phase being already over. The authors make a reference to the gel-based assay in one sentence (&quot;The observed dramatic increase in treadmilling explains the lack of linearity (i.e. the burst in PARylation) seen in the gel-based assays with HPF1 above&quot;) but they do so in a way that still leaves it fairly unclear what is the cause and what is the effect. If possible, it might be useful to address objections raised here experimentally (e.g. by performing the experiment in the presence of an increased amount of a serine substrate) and/or with a more extensive discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;HPF1 and nucleosomes mediate a dramatic switch in activity of PARP1 from polymerase to Hydrolase&quot; by Rudolph et al. studies the effect of HPF1 on the steps of the catalytic reaction of PARP1. They use various PARP1 activators i.e. free DNA and varied forms of core nucleosomes to quantify reaction rates in the presence and absence of HPF1, using several assays. The main point of the manuscript is the observation that in the presence of HPF1, PARP1 is converted to an NAD+ hydrolase, which releases free ADPr, instead of its normal activity to produce ADPr polymers. The PARP1 hydrolase activity has been described previously, but they now show that HPF1 increases it substantially under the conditions that they tested. The authors also describe their independent identification of HPF1 residue E284 as a residue that is essential for Ser modification, confirming previous structural and biochemical work from Ivan Ahel's group. Although the assays are well performed and controlled and yield important quantitative information that was missing in the field, the main result of the hydrolase activity of PARP1 is hard to reconcile with current knowledge of HPF1 effects in cell-based experiments.</p><p>Here are some specific points that would need to be addressed before publication of the results:</p><p>The authors report that in the presence of HPF1, PARP1 spends most of its catalytic power (about 90%) consuming NAD+ to form free ADPr. However, it has been shown that knocking out HPF1 in cells leads to a dramatic reduction in PAR production in the presence of DNA damage (Palazzo et al., 2018), indicating that HPF1 is necessary for a large portion of the PAR produce by PARP1 during DNA damage. The vast majority of the PAR produced in response to DNA damage is Ser linked (ibid), so requiring HPF1 activity. If HPF1's role is to convert PARP1 into a hydrolase, rather than a PAR polymerase, how can these results be explained? Can the authors address this apparent discrepancy in HPF1 function?</p><p>&quot;We conclude that there is a unique aspect of the PARP1 – nucleosome interaction compared to the PARP1 – free DNA interaction that leads to more robust autoPARylation,…&quot; According to Table 1, the increase in kcat is less than two-fold. I would recommend rephrasing and mentioning a modest increase.</p><p>Discussion, &quot;We began our work by demonstrating that nucleosomes are better activators of PARP1 than free DNA (Figure 2, Table 1).&quot; Same as above.</p><p>&quot;Perhaps there are direct interactions between the unfolded (or alternatively folded) HD-domain and nucleosomes that stabilize the open conformation and prevent this domain from collapsing back onto the catalytic domain.&quot; Is there anything in the cryo-EM structure of PARP2/HPF1/nucleosome that would support the hypothesis that nucleosomes directly contact the HD?</p><p>&quot;located primarily in the BRCT&quot;. The most recent mass spec studies identify the modified residues to be located outside of the BRCT domain, in the linker region between the BRCT and the WGR domain. Perhaps it is better to refer to the automodification region, and not the BRCT.</p><p>Although it is nice that they figured out independently that E284 of HPF1 residue is necessary for the catalysis of Ser modification, I am wondering if it justified to spend this amount of time/space describing the mutagenesis work? The reported work does not in itself identify E284 as the catalytic base. The structure of the HPF1-PARP2 complex and the positioning of E284 in the PARP active site is really the convincing data. The claim that the presented work identifies E284 as the catalytic base is not quite right.</p><p>&quot;Consistent with Glu284 on HPF1, not Glu988 on PARP1, performing the de-protonation required for initiation, we (data not shown) and Ahel's group observe HPF1-mediated incorporation of ADPR by the E988K mutant of PARP1, albeit at significantly slower rates.&quot; This data should be shown, or just reference the Ahel study.</p><p>It will be important to analyze the HPF1 effect on PARP2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65773.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>While all reviewers have acknowledged the quality of the experimental work reported in this manuscript, they agreed that the current title and the main message of the manuscript are somewhat provocative and are not fully aligned with the experimental evidence.

As we should have noted previously, but do now (Results), the linear phase is shorter in the presence of HPF1 (0 – 100 s to achieve an R2 &gt; 0.96) vs. in the absence of HPF1 (0 – 150 s to achieve an R2 &gt; 0.97). Additionally, the fitted lines in the assay in the presence of HPF1 do not go through (0,0) as nicely as those in the absence of HPF1, showing a slight burst. This behavior correlates with the gel-based assay described in Figure 3B.</p><p>2) The quench method used in the gel-based assay (addition of olaparib to 4 µM), is presumably not as “instant” as the acid quench used in the plate-based assay. Thus, the short time points we use may be susceptible to a lag in quenching that may be detrimental to achieving true linear rates. We have added a comment about this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors write: &quot;That is, although the initiation reaction on serines occurs efficiently, PARP1 then spends most of its catalytic power performing hydrolysis of NAD+, thereby precluding further attachment of ADPR onto protein in the presence of HPF1&quot;.

We have performed this experiment using p18mer as an activator, titrating in increasing concentrations of the H3 tail peptide as a substrate for serine-PARylation. As shown in the new Figure 5D, providing more serine PARylation sites does in fact inhibit the treadmilling effect down to baseline levels, thus increasing the overall amount of protein-linked ADPR. Therefore, we agree with the reviewer that the causal link should be expressed as follows: HPF1 blocks chain extension, and thus PARP1, still bound to activating DNA (i.e. nucleosome), quickly runs out of suitable sites for PARylation and therefore uses water as a nucleophile leading to the treadmilling effect. We have added verbiage to both the Results and the Discussion.</p><p>To be noted, we ruled out performing this experiment by titrating in nucleosomes for two reasons. (1) Changing nucleosome concentrations changes both the DNA and the serine-substrate concentrations, complicating any interpretation. (2) Higher concentrations of nucleosome (&gt; 1 µM) leads to protein precipitation in the presence of PARP1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it would be useful to comment on the relationship between the HPLC-based assay and the gel-based assay: is the treadmilling measured in what in the gel-based assay corresponds to the burst phase or the linear phase?

We have attempted to quantitate these effects at really short reaction times (10 sec). However, the very small amounts of both ADPR and nicotinamide formed preclude accurate ratio calculations.</p><p>As noted for the previous point, we have added the experiment with the serine substrate titration (new Figure 5D) and added to the Discussion about these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript &quot;HPF1 and nucleosomes mediate a dramatic switch in activity of PARP1 from polymerase to Hydrolase&quot; by Rudolph et al. studies the effect of HPF1 on the steps of the catalytic reaction of PARP1.

Perhaps it is better to refer to the automodification region, and not the BRCT.</p></disp-quote><p>Good suggestion; changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although it is nice that they figured out independently that E284 of HPF1 residue is necessary for the catalysis of Ser modification, I am wondering if it justified to spend this amount of time/space describing the mutagenesis work? The reported work does not in itself identify E284 as the catalytic base. The structure of the HPF1-PARP2 complex and the positioning of E284 in the PARP active site is really the convincing data. The claim that the presented work identifies E284 as the catalytic base is not quite right.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly disagree. Showing that something is in proximity alone is not the defining feature of a catalytic base. Showing that its removal leads to loss of activity, but not loss of binding, that is the key experiment that demonstrates its direct role in catalysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Consistent with Glu284 on HPF1, not Glu988 on PARP1, performing the de-protonation required for initiation, we (data not shown) and Ahel's group observe HPF1-mediated incorporation of ADPR by the E988K mutant of PARP1, albeit at significantly slower rates.&quot; This data should be shown, or just reference the Ahel study.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to the Ahel study alone as we performed the experiment only once to “spot check” whether we agreed with their results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It will be important to analyze the HPF1 effect on PARP2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have realized this as well and intend to let the next graduate student sort out these potentially interesting new discoveries.</p></body></sub-article></article>
