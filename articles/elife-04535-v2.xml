Although most of the protein components of the endocytic protein machinery have been thoroughly characterized, their organization at the endocytic site is poorly understood. We developed a fluorescence microscopy method to track the average positions of yeast endocytic proteins in relation to each other with a time precision below 1 s and with a spatial precision of ∼10 nm. With these data, integrated with shapes of endocytic membrane intermediates and with superresolution imaging, we could visualize the dynamic architecture of the endocytic machinery. We showed how different coat proteins are distributed within the coat structure and how the assembly dynamics of N-BAR proteins relate to membrane shape changes. Moreover, we found that the region of actin polymerization is located at the base of the endocytic invagination, with the growing ends of filaments pointing toward the plasma membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04535.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04535.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04535.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells take up proteins and other useful material (called cargo) from their external environment through a process known as endocytosis. To start with, the cargo accumulates in a patch on the surface of the cell. On the inner side of the cell's membrane, a protein called clathrin gathers around the patch of cargo. Clathrin molecules and many other proteins bind together to make a lattice-like coat that causes the membrane to curve inwards and form a pocket that contains the cargo. This continues until the cargo is completely surrounded by membrane and eventually forms a bubble-like structure, or ‘vesicle’, that moves into the cell.</p><p>More than 50 other proteins are involved in the endocytosis. These proteins arrive at the site of endocytosis in a particular order, complete their tasks and then move away to be used in further rounds of endocytosis. It is not clear how these proteins are organized to complete these steps because it is technically difficult to track the movements of many proteins at the same time.</p><p>Here, Picco et al. developed a new fluorescence microscopy method that enabled them to track the positions of many of the proteins involved in endocytosis in yeast cells in real time. The experiments revealed when the proteins arrived at the site of endocytosis and how they assembled in relation to the membrane. For example, a group of proteins called N-BAR proteins formed an extended lattice covering the sides of the pocket that forms as the membrane curves inwards.</p><p>To transform the flat membrane into a vesicle, a network of filaments made of a protein called actin needs to form at the site of endocytosis. The new method shows that the actin filaments grow in a small region at the base of the developing vesicle. By combining different types of microscopy data, Picco et al. were able to build a comprehensive model describing when the proteins involved in endocytosis move and assemble.</p><p>The next challenge will be to understand the physics behind the molecular machine composed of these many proteins and the cell membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04535.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04535.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Picco</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KA 3022/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Picco</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaksonen</surname><given-names>Marko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of light and electron microscopy data provide new insights into the dynamic architecture and the function of the endocytic protein machinery in relation to membrane shape changes in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a key membrane trafficking process for the uptake of cargo molecules from the cell surface. It is involved in numerous different biological contexts from the generation of cellular polarization, to virus uptake and the regulation of neural signaling. The formation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles is driven by a complex molecular machinery composed of more than 50 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boettner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weinberg and Drubin, 2012</xref>). These proteins recruit cargo molecules and reshape the plasma membrane to generate the endocytic vesicle. The assembly dynamics of the endocytic protein machinery has been described in detail by live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaidarov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newpher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loerke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>). However, the spatial organization of the endocytic proteins during vesicle budding remains poorly understood. The complexity and the size of the endocytic machinery, below the resolution limit of light microscopy, have made it challenging to reveal how the endocytic proteins are organized during vesicle budding.</p><p>Budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been used extensively as a model organism to study endocytosis. The protein machinery of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is largely conserved between mammals and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conibear, 2010</xref>). In yeast, endocytosis starts with the recruitment of clathrin and several clathrin adaptors and accessory proteins to the plasma membrane to initiate the assembly of the vesicle coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godlee and Kaksonen, 2013</xref>). During this initial early phase, which can last between 40 and 90 s, the coat assembles on a flat plasma membrane and cargo molecules are recruited to the endocytic site<bold>.</bold> Later, additional coat proteins and actin interactors are recruited. The actin interactors include Las17 (homolog of mammalian N-WASP) and type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5, which both activate the actin filament nucleating Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evangelista et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lechler et al., 2000</xref>). In yeast, the invagination of the plasma membrane, and the consequent inward movement of the coat, is concomitant with the appearance of actin at the endocytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). A functional dependence on actin polymerization is possibly due to high turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</xref>). In mammals, actin is similarly critical under conditions of high membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>). Two of the coat-associated proteins, Sla2 (homolog of mammalian Hip1R) and the epsin Ent1, interact directly with lipids, clathrin and actin, and are essential for mediating the forces from the actin cytoskeleton to deform the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baggett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>). The shape of the endocytic invagination is regulated by proteins containing BAR domains, such as the Rvs161/167 heterodimer, which are localized at the neck region of the membrane invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Idrissi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Youn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kishimoto et al., 2011</xref>). After vesicle scission the endocytic machinery quickly disassembles and the free vesicle is trafficked further into the cell.</p><p>The exact molecular mechanisms of endocytosis remain unknown, largely due to lack of knowledge about the functional organization of the protein components of the endocytic machinery. Here, we developed a novel imaging approach to characterize the spatial and temporal relationship between the different protein components of the endocytic machinery during vesicle budding. Furthermore, we integrated this data with time-resolved membrane shapes that were obtained previously by correlated light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). With this approach, we determined several key features of the dynamic architecture of the endocytic machinery during vesicle budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04535.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tracking procedure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The rational behind our approach. The centroid positions of endocytic proteins were correlated with the plasma membrane intermediates derived from CLEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). We could thus position the protein complexes along the plasma membrane invagination to reconstruct the molecular architecture of the endocytic machinery. (<bold>B</bold>) A yeast cell expressing the coat protein Sla2 tagged N-terminally (GFP-Sla2) and a collection of trajectories of GFP-Sla2 centroid in different endocytic events.

The triangle and the square mark the start and the end of each trajectory, respectively. (<bold>C</bold>) The information content of the GFP-Sla2 average trajectory: The average trajectory movement on the focal plane. The trajectory is aligned so that the Y-axis represents the inward movement along the invagination and the X-axis represents the movement along the plasma membrane (left panel). The inward movement of the trajectories over time (right panel). The number of molecules recruited at the endocytic site over time (bottom panel). The 53 individual trajectories that were used to generate this average are plotted (gray) together with the average (blue). The contour lines highlight point densities. (<bold>D</bold>) A yeast cell expressing GFP-Sla2 and the reference protein Abp1-mCherry and a collection of trajectories derived from the simultaneous acquisition of the target and reference proteins. (<bold>E</bold>) A diagram summarizing the steps that led to the spatial and temporal alignment of the average trajectories. Abp1 is used as the spatial and temporal reference. The average trajectory of the target protein (GFP-Sla2 in this example) is aligned to the average trajectory of Abp1-GFP (the reference protein) by aligning each of them to the respective trajectories acquired simultaneously in cells expressing GFP-Sla2 and Abp1-mCherry. More than 50 endocytic events are used to derive the average spatial and temporal transformation that aligns the average trajectories together.

We used a two-step procedure: in the first step, we analyzed different endocytic proteins individually to measure their average dynamic behavior and abundance. In the second step, we aligned the resulting data from these different proteins relative to each other in space and time using simultaneous two color imaging. This two-step procedure allowed us to separately optimize the acquisition rate and the alignment precision for single and double channel imaging respectively.</p><p>We used wide-field epifluorescence microscopy to image GFP-tagged endocytic proteins expressed from their endogenous genomic loci in haploid cells of yeast <italic>S cerevisiae</italic>. We acquired videos at the equatorial plane of the yeast cells, where the average direction of endocytic vesicle budding is planar with the focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). We thus directly visualized the movements of the endocytic proteins along the axis of membrane invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galletta et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>For each GFP-tagged target protein we tracked the centroid position and measured the fluorescence intensity during 50–80 individual endocytic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In yeast, the dynamic behavior of the endocytic proteins during vesicle budding is highly stereotypical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mooren et al., 2012</xref>). We could therefore align the individual centroid trajectories in time and space to calculate average trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For this purpose we developed an algorithm that finds the translation, rotation and temporal shift minimizing the weighted mean square displacement between the time points of all pairs of trajectories, where the weights are the fluorescence intensities at each time point (see ‘Materials and methods’). The centroid gives an estimate of the position of the center of mass of the protein distribution; therefore the average trajectory describes the stereotypic dynamic behavior of the center of mass of the target protein molecules during endocytosis.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04535.009</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Number of trajectories used in this study</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04535.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04535.009</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">Number of single color trajectories to generate the average trajectory</th><th align="center">Number of trajectory pairs used for spatial and temporal alignment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GFP-Sla2</td><td align="center">53</td><td align="center">271</td></tr><tr><td>Sla2-GFP</td><td align="center">55</td><td align="center">158</td></tr><tr><td>Sla1-GFP</td><td align="center">66</td><td align="center">58</td></tr><tr><td>End3-GFP</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">57</td></tr><tr><td>Abp1-GFP</td><td align="center">65</td><td align="center">NA</td></tr><tr><td>GFP-Act1</td><td align="center">83</td><td align="center">92</td></tr><tr><td>Arc18-GFP</td><td align="center">69</td><td align="center">90</td></tr><tr><td>Rvs167-GFP</td><td align="center">58</td><td align="center">340</td></tr><tr><td>Las17-GFP</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">49</td></tr><tr><td>Myo5-GFP</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td align="center">524</td><td align="center">1165</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The number of events that were tracked and used to compute the average trajectories and to align those average trajectories together.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>We estimated the average number of molecules present at the endocytic site by calibrating the fluorescence signal using a kinetochore protein of known abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joglekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>). For each protein, we used the average number of molecules to calibrate its fluorescence intensity profile with the absolute numbers of molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>To control that the GFP-tagging did not impair the functionality of the tagged protein we monitored the lifetime of Abp1 patches, which is very sensitive to defects in the endocytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>). We analyzed the lifetime of Abp1-mCherry patches, when Abp1-mCherry was coexpressed with each of the GFP-tagged proteins (see ‘Materials and methods’). The Abp1-mCherry lifetimes were unaffected by all the GFP-tagged proteins except Las17-GFP, for which Abp1-mCherry lifetime was slightly longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Las17-GFP, however, must be mostly functional because it does not lead to the strong block of endocytosis observed with LAS17 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the second step, we aligned the average trajectories of all proteins in space and time to a common reference. We chose Abp1 as a reference protein because of its abundance at the endocytic site, which leads to a strong fluorescence signal, and its highly regular dynamic behavior, which is directed perpendicular to the cell surface thereby defining the direction of the invagination movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). We imaged strains coexpressing each GFP-tagged protein of interest together with Abp1-mCherry. The two colors were imaged simultaneously. Chromatic aberration was measured using multicolored fluorescent microbeads and corrected for. For each protein pair we recorded 50–350 endocytic events from which we extracted the centroid positions and fluorescence intensities of the two proteins as paired trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). From these paired trajectories we estimated the rotation, translation and time shift that optimally align the average trajectory of the protein of interest to the average trajectory of Abp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). We thus produced a dataset in which all average trajectories are aligned to Abp1.</p><p>The axis of the invagination might not be perfectly aligned with the focal plane and would therefore be imaged as a projection, which leads to an underestimate of the true centroid movement along the invagination axis. Considering the distribution of the angles of Abp1 trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), the spherical geometry of the cells and the depth of field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) we estimated that these projection effects would lead maximally to about 10% underestimation of the true movement along the invagination axis.</p><p>To measure the reproducibility of the alignment procedure we repeated multiple times the acquisition of paired trajectories for GFP-Sla2 and Rvs167-GFP expressed together with Abp1-mCherry. We also used paired trajectories of Abp1 derived from a strain expressing Abp1 tagged C-terminally with both mCherry and GFP (see ‘Materials and methods’). The standard deviations in space and time of the repeated alignments were 2.8 nm and 0.1 s for Abp1, 5.5 nm and 0.3 s for Rvs167 and 12.9 nm and 0.6 s for Sla2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The accuracies of the alignments correlate with the signal intensities of these different proteins.</p><p>To further test the alignment procedure we created virtual ‘ground truth trajectories’ from which we generated sets of virtual trajectories by adding different levels of random noise. We first tested the accuracy of the two color alignment procedure using sets of virtual paired trajectories. With experimentally relevant noise levels the trajectories aligned within 3 nm from the ground truth trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test the effect of misalignment between the color channels we took paired trajectories and shifted them artificially in relation to each other to different extents. Due to random orientations of the trajectories the color shifts average out and the increase in the shift is only manifested as increased uncertainty of track positions. With realistic color shifts (up to 50 nm) the average trajectories are only about 3 nm from the ground truth trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested the full two-step alignment procedure using virtual trajectories. This test demonstrated that the alignment procedure robustly generates representative average trajectories from noisy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>In summary, with the average trajectories we can resolve the position and movement of different endocytic components in relation to each other along the direction of invagination with a temporal precision below 1 s and with a spatial precision of ∼10 nm. In addition, we could complement the tracking data with time-resolved estimates of the numbers of molecules present at the endocytic site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Correlating the tracking data with the changing membrane shape</title><p>The endocytic protein machinery progressively changes the shape of the plasma membrane, ultimately leading to vesicle budding.

These three proteins represent different endocytic substructures: the coat (Sla2), the invagination neck (Rvs167) and the actin cytoskeleton (Abp1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Idrissi et al., 2008</xref>).

We first defined a common frame by setting the initial position of the Sla2 centroid to coincide with the position of the flat plasma membrane. In GFP-Sla2 the GFP molecule is adjacent to Sla2's lipid-binding ANTH domain. The binding of Sla2's ANTH domain to PIP<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane is essential for productive endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). We could therefore assume that before membrane bending starts (first time point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>) the centroid of GFP-Sla2 is likely to be within few nm from the plasma membrane surface, whose position we took as the origin of the position axis. We then calculated the positions of the center of mass of Sla2 molecules on the shapes of the different membrane intermediates taking into account that Sla2 molecules cover a ∼30–40 nm long region at the tip of the invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al., 2012</xref>). We used these positions to shift the membrane intermediates in time so that they coincided with the centroids in the average trajectory of GFP-Sla2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).</p><p>Our alignment agreed well with the time resolved data from CLEM study: the start of Abp1 assembly coincides with initial membrane bending, and the assembly of Rvs167 starts when the invaginations are ∼50 nm long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The CLEM data also indicated that on average the vesicle scission takes place when ∼59% of the Rvs167-GFP patch lifetime has passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). This time point coincides with the peak number of Rvs167-GFP molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We immobilized the Sla2 patches by treating the cells with latrunculin A, which inhibits actin polymerization and prevents membrane invagination at endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>), and acquired still images of both GFP and mCherry signals at equatorial planes of the cells. The GFP-Sla2-mCherry molecules were oriented perpendicularly to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and the distance between the centroids of the GFP and mCherry tags was 33 ± 3.4 nm (mean ± SE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). This compares well with the average distance between GFP-Sla2 and Sla2-GFP average trajectories during the initial motionless phase. These results indicate that Sla2 molecules are oriented within the coat so that the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding N-terminal domain is at the membrane and the actin-binding C-terminal domain projects into the cytoplasm.</p><p>When the membrane invagination starts, the GFP-Sla2 and Sla2-GFP centroids start moving inward and the distance between them becomes shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). A simple explanation for this convergence is that the Sla2 molecules maintain a constant orientation with respect to the membrane. Therefore, during invagination the Sla2 molecules would reorient to accommodate membrane bending and the center of mass positions of their N and C-termini would move closer to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel, time points −7, −6 and −4 s). Alternatively, a conformational change of Sla2 could also contribute to the convergence of the trajectories by bringing the N- and C-termini closer to each other.</p><p>We studied Sla1 and End3 proteins with C-terminal GFP-tags. Sla1 and End3 are multi-domain proteins but the locations of their N- and C-termini in the tertiary structure are less well characterized than in Sla2. The average trajectories of Sla1-GFP and End3-GFP had very similar shapes, but were separated by about ∼10 nm or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>The number of Sla2 molecules remained relatively constant at ∼40 molecules during vesicle budding and started to drop ∼2–3 s before scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Sla1 and End3 molecules peaked at ∼90 and ∼60 molecules respectively and started disassembling already during invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>The overall dynamic behaviors of the Sla1 and End3 centroids appeared similar to that of Sla2. However, the Sla2 centroid started moving ∼2 s before the Sla1 and End3 centroids and moved past the Sla1 centroid during invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel). This suggests that Sla2, Sla1 and End3 are not distributed similarly within the coat. The observed trajectories could result from Sla2 being located on the invagination tip and Sla1 and End3 being located at the rim of the coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). With such distributions, when the membrane starts bending, Sla2 molecules would start moving first, followed slightly later by Sla1 and End3 molecules.</p><p>The average trajectories describe the center of mass position of the tagged protein molecules, but the individual proteins could be distributed in various ways around the center of mass. We used superresolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rust et al., 2006</xref>) to resolve the distribution of individual Sla1 proteins at the endocytic site: We fixed cells expressing Sla1 fused to a C-terminal SNAP tag and imaged structures on the bottom membrane of the cell close to the coverslip surface. With an average localization precision of approximately 10 nm, we could directly observe that Sla1 was localized in ring shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B,E</xref>). We also observed some less defined shapes, which likely correspond to states either during coat assembly or disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D,F,G</xref>). To exclude the possibility that a ring was observed because we were imaging a curved membrane, we treated Sla1-SNAP expressing cells with Latrunculin A, which inhibits actin polymerization and prevents membrane bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>).

These studies have shown that BAR domains can form regular oligomeric structures on membrane tubules of varying diameters, giving us an estimate of the density of dimers on the membrane. With our estimate of the numbers of Rvs167 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), such density yields the possible membrane area covered by the Rvs dimers, assuming that all dimers are membrane bound. We then used the Rvs167 average trajectory to locate the area of the membrane profiles covered by Rvs. These simple assumptions allowed us to generate a dynamic model of the membrane area covered by the Rvs molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref> for a similar approach). To obtain an estimate of Rvs coverage immediately prior to scission we extrapolated the coordinates of the invagination profile at time 0 from the available membrane profiles.</p><p>This reconstruction of Rvs localization revealed the dynamics of Rvs assembly and disassembly in relation to membrane invagination and scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Rvs proteins start assembling at the midpoint of the endocytic invagination and the Rvs covered membrane area increases linearly and reaches its maximum at about the time of scission. Immediately prior to scission there are enough Rvs molecules to cover the whole tubular part of the invagination from the base of the invagination to the coated tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; time point 0). After reaching their peak number, the Rvs molecules disassemble rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and their center of mass moves quickly inward toward the region where the newly formed vesicle is located. Our reconstruction suggests that the rapid movement of the centroid is the result of a rapid disassembly of the Rvs molecules at the neck of the invagination, where scission occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>), while some of the Rvs molecules are kept at the vesicle surface where they stay ∼2 s longer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Assembly of the actin cytoskeleton</title><p>Polymerization of actin filaments at the endocytic site is critical for membrane invagination and vesicle budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). The endocytic actin filaments are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex, which binds to existing filaments and nucleates new filaments in a branched configuration. Thus, actin filaments are organized as a dense, branched network, which surrounds the endocytic site and the newly formed vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulholland et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insight into the assembly of the endocytic actin patches we tracked Act1, the yeast actin protein, and Arc18, a component of the Arp2/3 complex. Arc18 was GFP-tagged C-terminally at its genomic locus. As the GFP fusion of actin is not fully functional we expressed GFP-Act1 in addition to the endogenously expressed untagged Act1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doyle and Botstein, 1996</xref>). In actin patches the GFP-Act1 localization was comparable to general actin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>) and the lifetime of Abp1-mCherry patches was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). GFP-Act1 is thus likely to be a good marker for actin localization and assembly at the endocytic site. We also tracked Las17, the yeast homolog of mammalian N-WASP, and Myo5, a type I myosin, which were both C-terminally GFP-tagged at their genomic loci. Las17 and Myo5 can activate the Arp2/3 complex and are critical for the initiation of actin polymerization and for membrane invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The average trajectories of both Act1 and Arc18 followed closely the trajectory of Abp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). All three average trajectories started at 30–40 nm above the level of the plasma membrane when Sla2 movement began. Their centroids moved for ∼100 nm until the scission time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The tight colocalization of the centroids of Act1, Arc18 and Abp1 suggests that they are homogeneously distributed within the actin network. After scission the centroid trajectories became noisier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Also the amount of Arc18 and Myo5 molecules peaked at ∼2 s before scission. However, the amount of Myo5 molecules started decreasing before scission, while Arc18, similarly to Act1, maintained a plateau level until scission. The amount of Abp1 molecules peaked at the scission time and then rapidly declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We measured by quantitative Western blotting that GFP-Act1 represented 9 ± 1% of the total cellular actin (See ‘Materials and methods’). If we assume that GFP-Act1 is recruited to endocytic sites with the same efficiency as the untagged actin, we can estimate that the peak number of actin molecules at the endocytic site is ∼3000.</p><p>These results document the coupling between the assembly dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and the changes in membrane shape.

In the first model the polymerizing ends of actin filaments are growing against the coat, thereby pushing it inward. In the second model filaments are growing against the plasma membrane at the base of the invagination, and the older filaments are connected to the coat to mediate the pushing force. In the third model actin polymerization is not preferentially oriented. In all models, the centroid of labeled actin would move similarly inward during endocytosis and thus could not be used to discriminate between the models. However, the models can be distinguished if the centroid is tracked after local photobleaching, because the location of the centroid is then determined by the fluorescence of the newly polymerized filaments. Model 1 predicts that after photobleaching the centroid would jump inward, away from the cell surface. Model 2 predicts a jump in the opposite direction, toward the cell surface, while model 3 predicts no jump.

Therefore, Sla2 molecules could span the clathrin lattice, which is about 22 nm from the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vigers et al., 1986</xref>), and interact simultaneously with the membrane, with clathrin, and with actin filaments on the cytoplasmic side of the clathrin lattice.</p><p>Sla1 and End3, together with a third protein Pan1, form a complex, which is implicated in the regulation of actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holtzman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bénédetti et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tang et al., 2000</xref>). Sla1 is localized in a ring of ∼50 nm in diameter, which can fit well around the tip of the endocytic membrane invagination of ∼30 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Idrissi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). As Sla1 and End3 are late-assembling coat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newpher et al., 2005</xref>), they could assemble at the rim of a pre-existing early coat. The disassembly of Sla1 and End3 begins after membrane invagination has started, but several seconds before scission, suggesting that these proteins may be important during early stages of vesicle budding. Interestingly, Sla2 and Pan1, have been suggested to capture short cytosolic actin filaments that could serve as ‘mother filaments’ to recruit the Arp2/3 complex and to initiate the assembly of the actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Pollard, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that the endocytic coat exhibits a highly organized and dynamic molecular architecture during vesicle budding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rvs BAR-domain proteins</title><p>BAR domain proteins can sense membrane curvature and they can actively induce membrane curvature at high concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizuno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mim et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, the heterodimeric BAR domain proteins Rvs161/167 assemble transiently at the endocytic site during the formation of the membrane invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Idrissi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>) to regulate the invagination or scission steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Youn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kishimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). However, the exact mechanism of action of Rvs is unknown. Our results suggest that there are enough Rvs molecules to form a dense BAR domain lattice covering the whole tubular part of the invagination below the coated tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). At this density the Rvs proteins could exert significant bending forces on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sorre et al., 2012</xref>). This Rvs lattice could therefore support the membrane tubule and prevent premature fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, an Rvs lattice could act as a lipid diffusion barrier that could form a lipid phase boundary to promote vesicle scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, our model explains the rapid movement of the Rvs167-GFP centroid upon scission: due to their affinity for curved membranes, the Rvs molecules are likely to first disassemble at the tubular part of the invagination that collapses after scission, while some of the Rvs molecules may remain bound to the membrane that forms the vesicle. Therefore, the center of mass of Rvs molecules would rapidly shift due to localized disassembly without actual movement of the Rvs lattice. The exact timing of the Rvs disassembly, in respect to the scission event, remains an interesting open question. Currently, our data does not have the time resolution to discern whether the initiation of Rvs disassembly precedes scission or follows it. If Rvs disassembly follows scission it could be a passive response to the collapse of the membrane tubule. Alternatively, if Rvs disassembly precedes scission it might destabilize the membrane tubule and thereby regulate the timing of scission. In either case, the extensive Rvs lattice could support the membrane tubule and thereby promote its extension until the scission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Endocytic actin network</title><p>Actin nucleation and polymerization are precisely coordinated with membrane shape changes. Our previous CLEM results suggested that the initiation of membrane bending coincides with actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). Another EM study, however, suggested that the membrane bending begins already ∼15 s prior to actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al., 2012</xref>). The average trajectory of the coat proteins Sla2 shows directed inward movement only after actin polymerization has started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) supporting the idea that the main membrane bending phase starts only after actin polymerization. However, a very shallow initial membrane curvature might be unresolvable by the tracking approach.</p><p>The data about numbers of molecules allow us to estimate some key parameters of the endocytic actin network. If each Arp2/3 complex nucleates an actin filament, new filaments are generated at a rate of ∼30 filaments per second, reaching a maximum number of ∼200 filaments. With the estimated maximum of ∼3000 actin molecules the average filament length would be ∼40 nm. The actin polymer, the Arp2/3 complex, and the Arp2/3 activators, Myo5 and Las17, reach the maximum level of molecules about 2 s before vesicle scission. Actin and the Arp2/3 complex maintain their levels of molecules until scission, whereas Las17 and Myo5 start to disassemble right after reaching their peak levels. These data suggest that the rate of nucleation of new actin filaments decreases before vesicle scission occurs. The initiation of actin filament nucleation has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mooren et al., 2012</xref>), but the mechanisms that terminate nucleation are not well understood. The termination of nucleation could involve feedback from membrane shape or tension.</p><p>Different models have been proposed for the organization of actin filaments at the endocytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mooren et al., 2012</xref>). However, conclusive data about the location of nucleation and polymerization during endocytosis has not been available. We showed here that actin filaments are nucleated and polymerize at the base of the invagination, where the Arp2/3 activators Las17 and Myo5 are also localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Capping proteins, which bind to the growing ends of actin filaments and stop polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mooren et al., 2012</xref>), are likely important for restricting actin polymerization to the base of the invagination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The functional organization of the endocytic machinery</title><p>By combining all our data we built a comprehensive model that reveals the dynamic interplay of the functional modules of the endocytic machinery during the final ∼10 s of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). During this time window the flat plasma membrane is reshaped into an endocytic vesicle. The coat, which is initially assembled on flat membrane, starts internalizing and reorganizing when actin polymerization begins. Actin polymerization is initiated close to the plasma membrane where Las17 is located and the region of polymerization remains at the base of the invagination throughout vesicle budding. When the invagination has formed, actin is likely polymerizing in a circular region surrounding the invagination. Initially, actin polymerization might also be triggered in a circular region at the rim of the coat, where Sla1, a regulator of actin nucleation, is also located. Continued filament nucleation and polymerization at the plasma membrane would push the older filaments into the cell generating a flow of actin filaments. The organization of the endocytic actin network bears striking similarity to the organization of actin at the leading edge of migrating animal cells where actin filaments nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex polymerize and push against the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). This polymerization pushes the leading edge of the cell forward, but also results in a retrograde flow of actin filaments into the cell. The actin binding domains of Sla2 are ideally positioned at the surface of the endocytic coat to capture the actin filaments that are moving away from the plasma membrane. We suggest that the actin scaffold is rigid enough to transmit the forces produced by the polymerization at the plasma membrane so that Sla2 can, together with Ent1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skruzny et al., 2012</xref>), transmit the force from the actin polymerization to the membrane.</p><p>Detailed quantitative analyses of assembly and disassembly of the endocytic machinery, especially the actin cytoskeletal proteins, have been previously performed on fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Pollard, 2013</xref>).

However, there are also some clear differences: in <italic>S. pombe</italic> the Las17 homolog Wsp1 is recruited together with myosin just prior to actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>) whereas in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Las17 localizes &gt;10 s before myosins are recruited and actin polymerization starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Rvs molecules may get recruited by a specific membrane curvature at the invagination, but protein–protein interactions may also have a role in the recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2006</xref>). Just before scission, the membrane invagination is densely covered by Rvs molecules. Scission occurs within the Rvs covered region at ∼1/3 of the invagination length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). However, the exact molecular mechanism of vesicle scission is still not understood. Neither Rvs, nor the yeast homolog of dynamin Vps1, are essential for scission, but they may regulate its timing or location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kishimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the location of actin polymerization and Myo5 corresponds closely to the site of scission, therefore polymerization and motor activities could have a role in scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jonsdottir and Li, 2004</xref>).

The points of the trajectory pairs were randomly generated and were normally distributed around the ground truth trajectories with sigma <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> for the trajectories of the target protein and <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> for the trajectories of the reference protein. All trajectories were generated with the same sampling rate as the real trajectories. The virtual trajectory pairs were then processed with the same pipeline we used for the real data to align the ground truth trajectories together. As the ground truth trajectories were already aligned all transformations are expected to be 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). When we arbitrarily increased the noise used to generate both the reference and the target proteins we observed that the alignment procedure remains faithful up to ∼25 nm of noise. For higher values a small systematic shift occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). We then tested the robustness of the alignment procedure keeping <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> fixed at 19 nm while we varied <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>. A <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> fixed mimics the noise in the real trajectory pairs, as the reference protein was always imaged under the same conditions. The alignment showed negligible errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–L</xref>). Note that in the real trajectory pairs <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> span a range from 10 nm to 24 nm, however the algorithm was stable also for higher errors. We observed a systematic shift, of maximally ∼3 nm, that occurs when the trajectories are getting far from the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3K</xref>). This is expected as any small error in the alignment of the trajectories leads to an underestimate of the separation between the reference and the target protein. This underestimate grows larger the bigger the separation is, resulting in the trajectory of the target protein being shifted little closer to its reference than it should be. A shift of 3 nm is reached when the trajectories are 30 nm away far from the reference protein, which is the maximal distance of a trajectory from its reference in our model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Simulation of the robustness to systematic shifts between the two channels during two color acquisition</title><p>To test for the robustness against systematic shifts between the two channels, we shifted the reference trajectories in the virtual trajectory pairs that we generated on the computer (see ‘Materials and Methods’: Simulation of the accuracy of the two color alignment procedure; <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 16 nm and <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 19 nm), by shifts up to 150 nm along one direction. These shifts simulate different amounts of aberration between the two channels. On average, the alignment is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In fact, the trajectory pairs, as well as the endocytic events that they mimic, are oriented in all possible directions and once their average relative position is calculated, the chromatic aberration contribution is averaged out. However, the incertitude in the average position increases, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). It is important to note that our pixel size correspond to 100 nm, therefore any shift larger than 50–100 nm would have been easily noticeable by eye. To assess how the alignment of the real data would be affected by a systematic color shift we also shifted the real trajectory pairs we used to align Sla2-GFP tp Abp1-GFP. Again, we induced shifts up to 150 nm to the trajectories of Abp1-mCherry to simulate different amounts of aberration between the two channels. The average position of Sla2-GFP does not significantly change but the incertitude in its average position increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Simulation of the accuracy of the trajectory averaging</title><p>To test the accuracy of the trajectory averaging we generated 65 virtual trajectories starting from a trajectory template (ground truth trajectory). The trajectories were generated adding noise that was normally distributed around the points of the ground truth trajectory with a standard deviation <italic>σ</italic>. We sampled values of <italic>σ</italic> covering the range of noise encountered experimentally (between 10 nm and 20 nm). The average trajectories where then aligned in time and in space to a reference trajectory that was generated together with the ground truth trajectory. To compute the alignment we used virtual trajectory pairs generated from the ground truth trajectory and the reference trajectory as described in ‘Materials and Methods: simulation of the accuracy of the two color alignment procedure’, with noises <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = 10 nm and <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = 19 nm respectively. The averaging procedure and the complete alignment procedure are very robust: after the alignment the average trajectories were reproducing very closely the ground truth trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Emission light was filtered using an ET 700/100 bandpass filter (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) and a FF01-446/523/600/677 multi bandpass filter (Semrock, Rochester, NY), and focused by a 400 mm tube lens onto the chip of an EMCCD camera (Ixon Ultra, Andor, United Kingdom) that was air-cooled to −75°C. Images were acquired using MicroManager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A piezo objective positioner (Physikinstrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to move the z-focus. The focus was stabilized by an electronic feedback loop based on an infrared laser that was totally internally reflected at the coverslip and detected by a quadrant photodiode.

Lateral drift, typically smaller than 50 nm/hr, was corrected for in the analysis software.</p><p>Image acquisition was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mund et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the samples were mounted in a custom-made holder and covered with at least 200 µl of imaging buffer consisting of 150 mM Tris–HCl pH7.5, 2% glucose, 60 mM cysteamine, 40 µg/ml catalase and 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase. We used an exposure time of 25 ms and an EM gain of 100. Imaging laser intensity at 640 nm was 2.5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the activation laser intensity was automatically adjusted to ensure a constant number of localizations per frame.

In summary, photon counts were obtained by subtraction of the constant offset from the pixel count and multiplication with the inverse gain. Initially, approximate positions of bright spots were determined by smoothing, nonmaximum suppression and thresholding. Selected peaks were fitted by a pixelized Gaussian function and a homogenous photonic background with a maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson distributed data using a freely available, GPU based fitting routine (Smith et al., 2010) on a Geforce GTX670 (Nvidia, Santa Clara, CA). Lateral drift correction was performed using image correlation as previously described. Localizations with an uncertainty of &gt;15 nm were discarded. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> were rendered using a Gaussian with a width according to the respective localization precision.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision. In summary, all the reviewers agree that you have taken the analysis of endocytosis to a new level. However, presentation in <italic>eLife</italic> requires that the work also advance our understanding of an important biological process. We would be happy to reconsider the work if it includes an advance in our knowledge, in addition to addressing the detailed comments that follow below. Please pay particular attention to the critique on the method description, accuracy and tests. (Because the reviews are lengthy, we include them all to help you.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of components of the Clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery in yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The authors used a centroid-based estimation of localization. Since the number of molecules on the clathrin coated vesicles CCV is in the range of 50-100 and the CCV have a regular shape, the center of mass of molecules can be localized with a few nm accuracy. The authors used mCherry labeled Abp1 as a base line and aligned other components of the endocytic machinery relative to Abp1 in space and time. This approach yielded a comprehensive description of the primary events occurring during CME in yeast.</p><p>The idea of aligning proteins to the center of mass of other proteins and building a comprehensive description of the relative activity of the endocytic machinery in space and time is interesting and promising. Since the method provides the time resolved behavior of the center of mass, the more detailed spatial organization of molecules on CCV was studied by CLEM (correlation of light microscopy with EM) and super-resolution microscopy. Using this approach, the authors describe the order of assembly and movement of the CCV proteins during invagination. The FRAP experiments allowed them to discriminate between different models of actin polymerization.</p><p>The study is potentially interesting but there are two main problems, one is technical and the other conceptual. The accuracy of the results critically depends on the accuracy of the trajectory alignment procedure used. Unfortunately, the description of the alignment procedure is cryptic (see below). In addition, even with an accurate procedure, every computer-based procedure will in all likelihood contain some implementation bugs. Therefore, its accuracy has to be tested in well controlled experiments.</p><p>One additional problem is that the precise question addressed by this study is unclear. I do not wish to dispute the fact that the quantitative analysis of CCV assembly and invagination is an important contribution. However, such a thorough analysis should also translate into some significant conceptual advances to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. This is not apparent from this study. There are a number of potentially interesting points that the authors make, such as the specific orientation of coat-associated proteins, the order of proteins (e.g. Sla1 and End3) assembly, the formation of a BAR domain lattice on the tubular part of the invagination, the predicted bending forces exerted on the membrane, the activation and termination of actin filaments nucleation prior to and following vesicle scission. My impression however is that these are only incremental advances more than a true discovery.</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>1) The accuracy of correction of chromatic aberration was not estimated, but it is expected to be in the range of measurable values. The alignment to the Abp1-mCherry is valid, because the systematic shift is common for the same type of fluorescent protein. However, the comparisons of shifts are valid only between the same fluorophores, e.g., Sla1-GFP to End3-GFP, but they are not for GFP and mCherry without a quantification of chromatic correction uncertainty.</p><p>2) This work is critically dependent on the accuracy of trajectory alignment. Unfortunately the procedure of two color alignment is very hard to follow. For example, in the Materials and methods: “These trajectory pairs were then used to align the average trajectory of the protein of interest to the average trajectory of Abp1-GFP […] that aligned the Abp1-GFP average trajectory to the Abp1-mCherry trajectory in the trajectory pair.” I am confused about which average trajectory aligns to which and how they are averaged. Were the tracks of Abp1-mCherry and of the GFP-proteins aligned independently of each other? I do not find it logical that a two-step alignment has higher accuracy than a single step alignment, against what the authors claim. All additional procedures have to increase uncertainty. In the case of doubling the number of measurements, the uncertainty decreases only by a factor square root of 2. Without a detailed description and controlled test it is impossible to judge the real accuracy of the proposed procedures. The correctness of error propagation is critical for the conclusions, but it is not reported in detail.</p><p>3) The number of molecules was estimated by a two-step comparison of fluorescence of the kinetochore proteins Nuf2 and Cse4. Unfortunately, the authors did not estimate the increase of the uncertainty by the additional step, but just multiplied the uncertainty of the first step by a scale factor (see Methods “Quantification of the number of molecules”). As such, the accuracy of number of molecules is overstated.</p><p>4) In the chapter “Assembly of Rvs proteins at the neck of the invagination” the authors described fitting procedures and estimations that are supposed to be numerical. Unfortunately, they did not provide any quantitative data and fit uncertainty estimation, but only a cartoon on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The small <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> just gives a crude value 100+-(?) molecules in the scission neck. The curve on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> raises the question of whether a fraction of Rvs has to be on the plasma membrane side of the scission neck. After cutting the neck the membranes with Rvs move to opposite directions, with the vesicular part moving towards the interior and the PM part moving retrogradely. One could expect that it will be reflected in an oscillatory behavior of centroid with mean position in the center of the neck and high level of uncertainty. Unfortunately, this process is below the time resolution of the authors' technique. The curve on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows a fast shift toward the vesicle. The authors commented that Rvs persists 2 sec longer on the vesicle than the plasma membrane. But another possible explanation is that a larger fraction of Rvs localized above the scission plane, something that would be inconsistent with the cartoon on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The spreads of red and green points on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> are clearly different, but the difference in SD is rather minor (15 and 18nm).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref>: units of Y-axis are neither on the figure nor in the legend.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2D</xref> has 3 mistakes:</p><p>1) The optical slice depth 400nm is an overestimation. A well aligned confocal microscope has f ∼ 750nm.</p><p>2) I suppose that the radius of a cell was taken equal 2.5 um, but it was not mentioned on the figure and in the legend.</p><p>3) In the formula on 2D there is a mistake: the square root is missing. It has to be sqrt(1-f^2/(4 * r ^2)) * I. The estimation of maximal error is done with an over-optimistic optical depth and by a wrong formula that result in a 0.6% value in the legend. Moreover, this value is inconsistent with the value in the main text where it was given as 10%.</p><p>On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> the color scheme is far from optimal. I could not figure out from the figure and legend which tracks belong to Abp1 and which to Myo5.</p><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Movie 2</xref> is packed with some uncommon codec, so I could not see it on two computers under 64bit Win7 and 32bit Win8 OS respectively.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>Major novel findings are limited as no new concepts are discovered. The idea that actin polymerizes primarily at the base of the pits is not really new (due in part to work of Kaksonen himself; a google search for images of actin at yeast actin patches or clathrin coated pits reveals that most schematic cartoon place actin polymerization at the base of the invagination), although this is proved elegantly here. On the other hand, this study is highly quantitative, fluorescent proteins are expressed at endogenous levels and the findings are supported by a large number of controls.</p><p>Issues to be addressed with discussion or new experimentation:</p><p>A major open question in the field is whether the dynamin homologue, Vps1, participates in fission at yeast actin patches. The authors mention Vps1, but do not show any data. Given the focus of this study, it would be great if the authors could analyze Vps1 and make a conclusive statement on this highly controversial topic.</p><p>The experiments with photobleaching of actin do not go past the time of scission (time = 0s). Thus, it remains unclear whether actin polymerization continues after scission. In this connection, several studies carried out on mammalian cells have demonstrated the occurrence of actin tails propelling newly formed endocytic vesicles. While tails were first described at sites of non-clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Merriefield and Almers, PMID: 10559868), a recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper demonstrated that also clathrin coated vesicles nucleate actin tails when the dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 is impaired (Nandez et al., PMID: 25107275). Thus, while the present study proves what had been implicit in previous studies, i.e. that actin nucleation occurs at the base of the invagination, could some actin eventually nucleate also from the newly formed vesicle (for example at the site of the scar left by the fission)? The authors show that a pool of Rvs remains partially associated with the vesicle and one wonders whether some actin nucleating factors may be present at the same site.</p><p>Concerning Rvs (the endophilin homologue): it was shown that endophilin deficiency at neuronal synapses results in a defect in uncoating, most likely due to a deficient recruitment of synaptojanin, a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase (Milosevic et al., PMID: 22099461). The Rvs pool that remains associated with the endocytic vesicles may be needed for uncoating, as Rvs167 binds a yeast synaptojanin. The authors may want to comment on this.</p><p>The authors state that as the number of Las17 molecules start decreasing before fission, suggesting that fission may not be assisted by the force generated by actin polymerization. Yet, one cannot exclude that the remaining Las17 may still be needed to generate a force. Photobleaching experiments show continued actin nucleation at least until the time of fission. As tagged Las17 does not behave as wild type Las17, these experiments must be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Why is Las17 not drawn bound to the membrane in the cartoon of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>? Las17/nWASP are actin nucleators at the plasma membrane.</p><p>The authors state that the number of Sla2 molecules remains relatively constant prior to scission, yet this is contrary to the data provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig7">Figure 2B, 3C and 7A</xref>), which shows that the number of Sla2 molecules starts declining a few seconds before scission.</p><p>Despite the thorough analysis of the correlation between changes in membrane shape and the recruitment of endocytic components, it remains unclear what causes the initial buckling of the plasma membrane. This work favors the idea that the initial deformation coincides with the nucleation of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), in line with the view presented in Kukulski, et al. (2012). The stronger evidence in favor of this model is that in the presence of Latrunculin A, no invaginations are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al. (2012)</xref> however, shows that there is an initial deformation of the membrane even in the presence of Latrunculin A. An alternative model suggests that early endocytic proteins like Syp1, Ede1 and Ent1 may act as the initiators of membrane curvature. What does the recruitment of these early endocytic proteins look like in this model and how does it relate to changes in membrane shape? Is the initial deformation the result of early endocytic proteins like Syp1, Ede1 and Ent1 coupled with actin polymerization? I note that, as often pointed out by Tom Kirchhausen who has extensively studied the structure of the clathrin lattice, it is unlikely that a flat clathrin lattice may convert to a curved clathrin lattice without undergoing a complete disassembly. Thus, it would seem more likely that the initial coated patch may already be curved. I realize that a thorough analysis of the spatio-temporal localization of early endocytic factors may go beyond the goal of this study, but these considerations should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>This is rigorous, technically demanding work on an interesting biological process. I am generally enthusiastic about the work and the presentation, but think that the authors should have taken a broader perspective on their work, since their work confirms many of findings and ideas of others working on fission yeast. That previous work does not detract from the value of the present work, but it should not be ignored.</p><p>Scientific issues:</p><p>Results section: “We thus produced a dataset in which all average trajectories are aligned to Abp1.” I am not concerned that some information was lost during averaging. The individual tracks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref> average out all of the lateral motion of the patches, because the motions to the right and left of the normal (zero on the x-axis) to the plasma membrane cancel out. This representation may not give the casual reader the right impression about the patch motions, which would be more apparent with plots of the averages of the absolute values of the left and right positions.</p><p>In the first paragraphs of the Results section: It might be informative to compare the patch alignment method used here with that of Berro (MBoC, 2014). My impression is that the two methods work about equally well. Berro discusses the biological variability. Do you have any measure of the biological variability in your system, since you seem to assume none. You should state this assumption, if you made it.</p><p>In the subsection “Organization of coat associated proteins”, in Results: An average localization precision of approximately 10 nm is extremely good; what is the evidence that the resolution is actually 10 nm?</p><p>In the beginning of the subsection “Assembly of Rvs proteins at the neck of the invagination”, in Results: The approach to calculating the membrane area covered by the Rvs dimers is identical to Arasada (2011) in fission yeast. Comparing the results may be informative.</p><p>In the same section: Berro, MBoC (2014) has evidence that the movements of the actin-covered vesicle are diffusive in the cytoplasm.</p><p>In the beginning of the subsection “Assembly of the actin cytoskeleton”: “The Myo5 trajectory remained almost stationary during the invagination of the plasma membrane, whereas the Las17 trajectory moved inward, but much less than Abp1, Arc18 and Act1 trajectories.” The behavior is similar in fission yeast (Arasada, 2011).</p><p>In the same section of the text, you state: “Note that because GFP-Act1 was expressed in addition to untagged actin, we do not know the ratio between tagged and untagged molecules that are recruited to the endocytic site and we can only provide relative abundance estimates.” Rather than using arbitrary units for Act1, measure the ratio of GFP-Act1 and wild type Act1with an anti-actin immunoblot and give the numbers of GFP-Act1 and the fraction tagged, allowing for a calculation of the total actin. Wu (2005) and Sirotkin (2010) explain how to do this.</p><p>In the beginning of the subsection “Actin polymerizes at the base of the invagination”, in Results: The FRAP experiments are elegant and informative. Abp1 is a nice control. However the authors do not include the most obvious model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, namely that new branches are formed on pre-existing filaments in proportion to the local concentration of the NPFs and then grow in random directions. This is what is expected from the mechanism of branch formation and does not presuppose a mechanism to align the branches in a certain direction (which seems unlikely). Arasada (2011) uses this assumption and the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> strongly support it. My impression is that the FRAP data are consistent with this model with local nucleation and random elongation, which the authors could simulate knowing the local concentrations of the two NPFs as established in this paper. Capping may be favored near the membrane (as assumed by some models of leading edge motility) and may bias the direction of growth, but the authors do not consider capping or other mechanisms to bias growth.</p><p>In the subsection headed “The endocytic coat”, in the Discussion, you state: “The disassembly of Sla1 and End3 begins after membrane invagination has started, but several seconds before scission, suggesting that these proteins may be important during early stages of vesicle budding.” This supports the model of Chen (2013) with adaptor proteins binding actin filaments to provide mother filaments to start the branching process.</p><p>Still in the Discussion, the first paragraph of the subheading “Endocytic actin network”: Berro (2010) uses data similar to that in this paper to calculate the evolution of the rates of the main actin assembly reactions from the beginning to the end of the patch life, so one does not need to speculate about “these data suggest that the nucleation of new actin filaments stops before vesicle scission occurs.” Dissociation of the NPF's is enough to explain the slowing of the rate of branching.</p><p>Subsection headed “The functional organization of the endocytic machinery”: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is the budding yeast version of fission yeast data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirotkin et al. (2010)</xref>. Arasada 2011 and Chen 2013 have additional quantitative data on other fission yeast actin patch proteins. The timing and numbers of molecules are remarkably similar in the two yeast in spite of &gt;400 my of divergent evolution. This certainly deserves some discussion. The new data in this paper leads to conclusions similar to those in the fission yeast papers. Given this new data from budding yeast, it would be interesting to make a formal comparison with fission yeast actin patches, including the peak times, peak numbers and depth of penetration of each homologous molecule: actin, Arp2/3 complex, Wsp1 (Las17), Myo1 (Myo5), Cdc15 and Bzz1 (Rvs167) and End4 (Sla2).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend: I would call the GFP-actin signal “polymerized actin” rather the “actin cytoskeleton,” since you use the latter term for actin filaments plus associated proteins. Since you can calculate the total numbers of polymerized actin molecules at each point along these curves and since you know the numbers of Arp2/3 complex, you should be able to make some simple calculations such as the lengths of the filaments and numbers of branches formed each second.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> legend: “Time ≈ -8 s: actin polymerization starts.” This drawing is misleading, since it shows Sla2 binding a branch, whereas the biochemical evidence strongly shows that branching only occurs on the side of a pre-existing filament. Where do the pre-existing filaments come from? Chen (2013) has one possible source. The drawings of the later time points show that the network propagates correctly from mother filament to branch, but this is not obvious, so it would be helpful to have some clue showing that the first branches end up at the tip of the invagination.</p><p>The model considers the branches to be stable, but actually the branches and the filaments are actually turning over rapidly on the time scale of this figure (as shown by the simulations of Berro, 2010). It would be helpful if the figure or the text could indicate this turnover.</p><p>Note that Berro, MBoC, 2014, has more realistic scale drawings the filaments in slices through actin patches. If the actin numbers are similar in budding yeast actin patches, you could make less schematic drawing of the actin network base on his calculations.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Visualizing the functional architecture of the endocytic machinery” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Nevertheless, Thomas Pollard (peer review) wrote: ”My main concern with the original paper was its narrow point of view. The presentation generally ignored highly relevant work on other organisms, especially fission yeast. The new work on budding yeast offers valuable, new insights, but much of the story is remarkably similar to what was found in fission yeast. Making this clear highlights the amazing conservation of the mechanisms over the hundreds of millions of years since these two yeast diverged. These comparisons detract in no way from the authors' accomplishments. Also, the authors seem to have misunderstood several suggestions to compare the data from the two yeasts. They declined to do so, saying that this would require new experiments. However, all they needed to do was to plot the published data on the same graphs as their new data and comment on what is the same and what is different.</p><p>Second, citations: The authors added citations to some of the work on fission yeast, but missed some opportunities to inform a reader about what was known.

The accuracy of the results critically depends on the accuracy of the trajectory alignment procedure used. Unfortunately, the description of the alignment procedure is cryptic (see below). In addition, even with an accurate procedure, every computer-based procedure will in all likelihood contain some implementation bugs. Therefore, its accuracy has to be tested in well controlled experiments</italic>.</p><p><italic>One additional problem is that the precise question addressed by this study is unclear. I do not wish to dispute the fact that the quantitative analysis of CCV assembly and invagination is an important contribution. However, such a thorough analysis should also translate into some significant conceptual advances to merit publication in eLife. This is not apparent from this study. There are a number of potentially interesting points that the authors make, such as the specific orientation of coat-associated proteins, the order of proteins (e.g. Sla1 and End3) assembly, the formation of a BAR domain lattice on the tubular part of the invagination, the predicted bending forces exerted on the membrane, the activation and termination of actin filaments nucleation prior to and following vesicle scission. My impression however is that these are only incremental advances more than a true discovery</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer brings out two issues: a technical problem, the lack of a detailed description of the method and its accuracy, and a conceptual problem, the lack of a true discovery.</p><p>We agree that the description of the method was rather cryptic and we have written a clearer and more detailed description of the alignment procedure. In addition, as suggested we performed extensive simulations that test the robustness of our method and the correctness of the software. These tests prove the accuracy of our method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplements 3, 4, and 5</xref>). The accuracy of our method is further supported by the experimental controls: the alignment of Abp1-GFP to itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>) and the separation between GFP-Sla2 and Sla2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A-F</xref>).</p><p>We disagree with the conceptual concern raised by the reviewer. Our work presents a number of new discoveries that are critical for a mechanistic understanding of the endocytic machinery: we show how key coat components (Sla2, End3 and Sla1) are spatially organized to perform their specific tasks in vesicle budding. We describe a quantitative dynamic model for the coverage of the plasma membrane invagination by N-BAR proteins in vivo. Finally, we solve the long lasting controversy about the location of actin filament polymerization. Understanding the spatiotemporal organization of actin polymerization is essential for understanding the mechanism of actin driven endocytosis.</p><p>Furthermore, we are absolutely convinced that for the mechanistic understanding of endocytosis (or any other cellular processes) a systematic quantitative analysis of its components in vivo is essential. We therefore believe that our results, which describe at the nm scale the interplay between the endocytic protein machinery and the membrane, should be considered “true discoveries”.</p><p><italic>Technical comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The accuracy of correction of chromatic aberration was not estimated, but it is expected to be in the range of measurable values. The alignment to the Abp1-mCherry is valid, because the systematic shift is common for the same type of fluorescent protein. However, the comparisons of shifts are valid only between the same fluorophores, e.g., Sla1-GFP to End3-GFP, but they are not for GFP and mCherry without a quantification of chromatic correction uncertainty</italic>.</p><p>We have added simulations and controls to demonstrate how the quality of the alignment depends on the aberration error. There are two sources of color related aberration in our set-up: the chromatic aberration and the aberration in the imaging setup used for the simultaneous acquisition of the two channels. We correct for both types of errors simultaneously. Our new simulations demonstrate that a systematic color shift between the centroid positions, does not significantly affect our trajectory alignment (See Materials and methods: Simulation of the accuracy of the two color alignment procedure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure1–figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, a systematic color shift between mCherry and GFP does not affect the relative positions of the average trajectories after the alignment, only the uncertainty in their position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). The reason is that the endocytic events in cells are oriented randomly within the field of view and thus the centroid positions of the mCherry and GFP fluorophores are shifted relatively to each other differently in each endocytic event. When we average the contribution of the different trajectories together, the color shift averages out without significantly affecting the estimate of the relative position between the two fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4A, B</xref>). However, larger color shift between the trajectory pairs, leads to larger uncertainty in the relative positions of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4C, D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) This work is critically dependent on the accuracy of trajectory alignment. Unfortunately the procedure of two color alignment is very hard to follow. For example, in the Materials and methods: “These trajectory pairs were then used to align the average trajectory of the protein of interest to the average trajectory of Abp1-GFP […] that aligned the Abp1-GFP average trajectory to the Abp1-mCherry trajectory in the trajectory pair.” I am confused about which average trajectory aligns to which and how they are averaged. Were the tracks of Abp1-mCherry and of the GFP-proteins aligned independently of each other? I do not find it logical that a two-step alignment has higher accuracy than a single step alignment, against what the authors claim. All additional procedures have to increase uncertainty. In the case of doubling the number of measurements, the uncertainty decreases only by a factor square root of 2. Without a detailed description and controlled test it is impossible to judge the real accuracy of the proposed procedures. The correctness of error propagation is critical for the conclusions, but it is not reported in detail</italic>.</p><p>We have rewritten a more detailed description of the two color alignment procedure (See Materials and methods: “Two color alignment procedure”). All uncertainties in the procedure are taken into account, propagated and represented together with the trajectories. We complemented the description of the two color alignment procedure with a detailed description of our error propagation (See Materials and methods – “Two color alignment procedure”).</p><p>The accuracy of the trajectory alignment was supported by experimental controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). We also added simulated tests of the accuracy of our alignment procedure that prove the reliability and accuracy of our method for the conclusions we are making (See Materials and methods: Simulation of the accuracy of the two colors alignment procedure; Simulation of the robustness to systematic shifts between the two channels; Simulation of the accuracy of the trajectory averaging; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s5">Figure1–figure supplement 3, 4, 5</xref>).</p><p>The two steps procedure is dictated by a practical consideration: The simultaneous acquisition setup gives dimmer and noisier signals and we need to use longer exposure times than when the proteins are imaged individually. By first imaging the proteins individually we can thus use a higher frame rate (better temporal resolution) and record a brighter signal (better localization precision), leading to higher precision in the description of the dynamic behavior of the proteins. The trajectories obtained by simultaneous acquisition of two proteins give lower precision of protein dynamics, but are however sufficient to align together the average trajectories obtained by the imaging of individual proteins. We removed the potentially misleading sentence stating that the two-step aligment has higher accuracy. We think it was anyway redundant as the two color alignment method and its implications are described in their dedicated section as well as in the Material and methods.</p><p><italic>3) The number of molecules was estimated by a two-step comparison of fluorescence of the kinetochore proteins Nuf2 and Cse4. Unfortunately, the authors did not estimate the increase of the uncertainty by the additional step, but just multiplied the uncertainty of the first step by a scale factor (see Methods “Quantification of the number of molecules”). As such, the accuracy of number of molecules is overstated</italic>.</p><p>The quantification of the average number of molecules is not a two-step procedure. We use only Nuf2 to quantify the fluorescence intensity of all the endocytic proteins as it has a brighter signal than Cse4. We used Cse4 to re-estimate the number of Nuf2 molecules. This allowed us to compare our Cse4 and Nuf2 ratio to Joglekar’s results, as a validation for our algorithm, and gave us an estimate of the uncertainty in the number of Nuf2 molecules, quantified with our algorithm, that we propagated in our quantifications.</p><p>When we checked the error propagation procedure we realized that a more appropriate description of the errors associated with the median is the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) scaled for asymptotically normal consistency, not the standard error of the mean that we used before. We also corrected the number of Cse4 molecules from 4.9 to 5, as reported in Lawrimore, 2012. These corrections do not change any of the conclusions of our work. We added the detailed description of the error propagation in the section of the Materials and methods “Quantification of the number of molecules” and “Calibration of the fluorescence intensity curve of the trajectories with the number of molecules”.</p><p><italic>4) In the chapter “Assembly of Rvs proteins at the neck of the invagination” the authors described fitting procedures and estimations that are supposed to be numerical. Unfortunately, they did not provide any quantitative data and fit uncertainty estimation, but only a cartoon on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>. The small</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>just gives a crude value 100+- (?) molecules in the scission neck. The curve on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref> <italic>raises the question of whether a fraction of Rvs has to be on the plasma membrane side of the scission neck. After cutting the neck the membranes with Rvs move to opposite directions, with the vesicular part moving towards the interior and the PM part moving retrogradely. One could expect that it will be reflected in an oscillatory behavior of centroid with mean position in the center of the neck and high level of uncertainty. Unfortunately, this process is below the time resolution of the authors' technique. The curve on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>shows a fast shift toward the vesicle. The authors commented that Rvs persists 2 sec longer on the vesicle than the plasma membrane. But another possible explanation is that a larger fraction of Rvs localized above the scission plane, something that would be inconsistent with the cartoon on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref>.</p><p>All the quantitative data used for the estimation of the Rvs coverage are listed in the “Materials and methods: Estimation of the membrane area covered by Rvs” and in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, where we list all the data used for the plots, the positions of the proteins and their abundances.

For clarity, we added a reference to the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> in each figure legend where average trajectories are shown.</p><p>The model that we present for Rvs dynamics is based on three simple assumptions: 1) All the Rvs molecules locate on the membrane; 2) Rvs molecules are homogeneously distributed; 3) The density of Rvs molecules is the same as reported for the Rvs homolog endophilin in vitro. It is possible that a small fraction of Rvs molecules remains at the plasma membrane transiently after scission, but we would not have the resolution to resolve this possibility. The mechanism of scission indeed remains an important question, but a description of this very fast process at the level of individual molecules will require further method development.</p><p><italic>The spreads of red and green points on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6F</italic></xref> <italic>are clearly different, but the difference in SD is rather minor (15 and 18nm)</italic>.</p><p>We recalculated the SD estimate and it is correct.

The idea that actin polymerizes primarily at the base of the pits is not really new (due in part to work of Kaksonen himself; a google search for images of actin at yeast actin patches or clathrin coated pits reveals that most schematic cartoon place actin polymerization at the base of the invagination), although this is proved elegantly here. On the other hand, this study is highly quantitative, fluorescent proteins are expressed at endogenous levels and the findings are supported by a large number of controls</italic>.</p><p>We strongly disagree with the lack of novelty in our work. First of all, the method we developed is conceptually novel and provides quantitative data about the endocytic machinery that was simply not accessible before. Furthermore, we describe the organization of coat proteins that are critical for normal vesicle budding, and provide a dynamic quantitative model of the membrane coverage by a BAR domain protein in vivo. We believe these data are essential for understanding the process of endocytic vesicle budding.</p><p>Different models for actin have indeed been proposed but there is no consensus in the scientific literature about the correct model. The available data has been indirect or has been derived from mutant cells whose normal endocytic process was impaired. Therefore, the question where actin primarily polymerizes has remained unsolved. Here we provide, for the first time, direct data to answer that question. We believe this is very important for understanding the mechanism of actin driven endocytosis.</p><p><italic>Issues to be addressed with discussion or new experimentation</italic>:</p><p><italic>A major open question in the field is whether the dynamin homologue, Vps1, participates in fission at yeast actin patches. The authors mention Vps1, but do not show any data. Given the focus of this study, it would be great if the authors could analyze Vps1 and make a conclusive statement on this highly controversial topic</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have analyzed the localization of Vps1. We have not been able to detect any fluorescently tagged Vps1 protein at the endocytic sites. We have imaged the Vps1-GFP also with TIRF microscopy, which gives very high sensitivity, but have failed to detect it at endocytic sites. We have expressed Vps1-GFP either alone or together with untagged Vps1, but have in all cases failed to detect any endocytic localization.</p><p>We conclude that if Vps1 is directly involved in endocytosis it must be present in a very low copy number, which is below the detection threshold. Unfortunately, as we cannot use our tracking method to study Vps1’s endocytic role, we think this question is outside of the scope of this current manuscript.</p><p><italic>The experiments with photobleaching of actin do not go past the time of scission (time = 0s). Thus, it remains unclear whether actin polymerization continues after scission. In this connection, several studies carried out on mammalian cells have demonstrated the occurrence of actin tails propelling newly formed endocytic vesicles. While tails were first described at sites of non-clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Merriefield and Almers, PMID: 10559868), a recent eLife paper demonstrated that also clathrin coated vesicles nucleate actin tails when the dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 is impaired (Nandez et al., PMID: 25107275). Thus, while the present study proves what had been implicit in previous studies, i.e. that actin nucleation occurs at the base of the invagination, could some actin eventually nucleate also from the newly formed vesicle (for example at the site of the scar left by the fission)? The authors show that a pool of Rvs remains partially associated with the vesicle and one wonders whether some actin nucleating factors may be present at the same site</italic>.</p><p>The yeast actin patches disassemble in few seconds after scission, so the possible time window for post scission actin polymerization is very short. We actually did perform photobleachings also later than the scission time, during the disassembly of the actin patch. After these late bleachings we did not observe any recovery, which would suggest that actin polymerization does not continue after scission. We don’t discuss these results in the manuscript because without a second marker to follow the vesicle, we cannot definitively know that the bleached vesicle is still in the focal plane. (This would be technically extremely challenging). A recent study in fission yeast showed that the movement of the newly formed vesicles just after scission is diffusive, and therefore not likely to be directed by an actin driven mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Different locations for the nucleation and polymerization of the actin filaments at the endocytic sites have been proposed in many previous studies but no conclusive evidence has been provided so far and the debate is still ongoing. A recent review by Mooren et al., summarizes this debate well (2012, Annu. Rev. Biochem; PMID: 22663081). Our results provide the first rigorous test of the different hypotheses, by direct visualization of the region of actin polymerization.</p><p><italic>Concerning Rvs (the endophilin homologue): it was shown that endophilin deficiency at neuronal synapses results in a defect in uncoating, most likely due to a deficient recruitment of synaptojanin, a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase (Milosevic et al., PMID: 22099461). The Rvs pool that remains associated with the endocytic vesicles may be needed for uncoating, as Rvs167 binds a yeast synaptojanin. The authors may want to comment on this</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting possibility and we now discuss it in the text.</p><p><italic>The authors state that as the number of Las17 molecules start decreasing before fission, suggesting that fission may not be assisted by the force generated by actin polymerization. Yet, one cannot exclude that the remaining Las17 may still be needed to generate a force. Photobleaching experiments show continued actin nucleation at least until the time of fission. As tagged Las17 does not behave as wild type Las17, these experiments must be interpreted with caution</italic>.</p><p>We proposed that nucleation of actin filaments decreases before scission happens. However, we agree that the polymerization of actin filaments may still continue and play a role in generating the force for scission. We changed the text to be more precise, also in agreement with the comments of reviewer 3 (please see the beginning of the subsection headed “The functional organization of the endocytic machinery”).</p><p><italic>Why is Las17 not drawn bound to the membrane in the cartoon of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>?

This work favors the idea that the initial deformation coincides with the nucleation of actin (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>), in line with the view presented in Kukulski, 2012. The stronger evidence in favor of this model is that in the presence of Latrunculin A, no invaginations are observed (Kukulski, 2012).</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"><italic>Idrissi et al. (2012)</italic></xref> <italic>however, shows that there is an initial deformation of the membrane even in the presence of Latrunculin A. An alternative model suggests that early endocytic proteins like Syp1, Ede1 and Ent1 may act as the initiators of membrane curvature. What does the recruitment of these early endocytic proteins look like in this model and how does it relate to changes in membrane shape? Is the initial deformation the result of early endocytic proteins like Syp1, Ede1 and Ent1 coupled with actin polymerization? I note that, as often pointed out by Tom Kirchhausen who has extensively studied the structure of the clathrin lattice, it is unlikely that a flat clathrin lattice may convert to a curved clathrin lattice without undergoing a complete disassembly. Thus, it would seem more likely that the initial coated patch may already be curved. I realize that a thorough analysis of the spatio-temporal localization of early endocytic factors may go beyond the goal of this study, but these considerations should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>With our tracking method, we could not detect any inward movement of the coat proteins that would indicate membrane bending prior to the appearance of the actin filaments. Sla2-GFP and GFP-Sla2, which are our best markers for the invagination dynamics among the early arriving endocytic proteins, show detectable movement only after actin locates at the endocytic site, in agreement with the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al. (2012)</xref> suggest that the membrane bending starts after the clathrin coat has assembled at the time of Vrp1 arrival (∼20 s before scission). Our coat protein trajectories do not show any inward movement during this time. Of course, a very shallow membrane bending might not be detectable by our method. All the other endocytic proteins that arrive before Sla2 (e.g. Syp1 and Ede1) can be knocked out in yeast without affecting the final vesicle budding process so they are unlikely to provide functionally significant membrane curvature. We added a discussion about this topic.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p><italic>This is rigorous, technically demanding work on an interesting biological process. I am generally enthusiastic about the work and the presentation, but think that the authors should have taken a broader perspective on their work, since their work confirms many of findings and ideas of others working on fission yeast. That previous work does not detract from the value of the present work, but it should not be ignored</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their enthusiasm about our work.

The individual tracks in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B and D</italic></xref> <italic>average out all of the lateral motion of the patches, because the motions to the right and left of the normal (zero on the x-axis) to the plasma membrane cancel out.

There, we plot the average trajectory oriented so that the average position along the plasma membrane, which is the movement right and left of the normal, is illustrated by the X-axis while the trajectory movement along the invagination direction is illustrated by the Y-axis. We clarified this point in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>In the first paragraphs of the Results section: It might be informative to compare the patch alignment method used here with that of Berro (MBoC, 2014). My impression is that the two methods work about equally well. Berro discusses the biological variability. Do you have any measure of the biological variability in your system, since you seem to assume none. You should state this assumption, if you made it</italic>.</p><p>We did not assume that there is no biological variability. We cannot completely discern between the biological variability of the samples and the variability due to the imaging method. However, the variability in the dynamics and in the life times of the individual endocytic proteins that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) confirms that the endocytic process in yeast is extremely stereotypical. We added a sentence to the manuscript where we compare our method with the method of Berro.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Organization of coat associated proteins”</italic>, <italic>in Results: An average localization precision of approximately 10 nm is extremely good; what is the evidence that the resolution is actually 10 nm?</italic></p><p>A localization precision of 10 nm or better is regularly achieved with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 under comparable experimental conditions (Dempsey et al., “Evaluation of fluorophores for optimal performance in localization-based super-resolution imaging”, Nat Meth 8, 1027–1036, 2011, and our own work: Ries et al., “A simple, versatile method for GFP-based super-resolution microscopy via nanobodies,” Nat Methods 9, 582–584, 2012).

We added a citation to the Arasada paper for the approach.</p><p><italic>In the same section: Berro, MBoC (2014) has evidence that the movements of the actin-covered vesicle are diffusive in the cytoplasm</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent point. We have added a citation to Berro’s work to support the statement about the free diffusion of the vesicle in the cytoplasm.</p><p><italic>In the beginning of the subsection “Assembly of the actin cytoskeleton”: “The Myo5 trajectory remained almost stationary during the invagination of the plasma membrane, whereas the Las17 trajectory moved inward, but much less than Abp1, Arc18 and Act1 trajectories.” The behavior is similar in fission yeast (Arasada, 2011)</italic>.</p><p>According to Arasada, the fission yeast Las17 moves much further at the tip of the invagination, while the budding yeast Las17 remains still closer to the base of the invagination. This is a very interesting difference between the species and could reveal interesting insight into the evolvability of the actin system. However, we feel that a quantitative side-by-side comparison between the two species will be needed.</p><p><italic>In the same section of the text, you state: “Note that because GFP-Act1 was expressed in addition to untagged actin, we do not know the ratio between tagged and untagged molecules that are recruited to the endocytic site and we can only provide relative abundance estimates.” Rather than using arbitrary units for Act1, measure the ratio of GFP-Act1 and wild type Act1with an anti-actin immunoblot and give the numbers of GFP-Act1 and the fraction tagged, allowing for a calculation of the total actin. Wu (2005) and Sirotkin (2010) explain how to do this</italic>.</p><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and quantified the amount of GFP-Act1 present at the endocytic patches. We then estimated by Western blotting the fraction of GFP-Act1 to be 9% ± 1% of the total cellular actin. We could thus estimate that the total peak number of actin molecules in actin patches is ∼3000. Assuming ∼200 filaments (based on the number of Arp2/3 molecules), each filament would be in average ∼40 nm long. We added this information to the manuscript: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, as well as “Materials and methods: Quantification of the ratio between GFP-Actin and the endogenous actin”.</p><p><italic>In the beginning of the subsection “Actin polymerizes at the base of the invagination”, in Results: The FRAP experiments are elegant and informative.

My impression is that the FRAP data are consistent with this model with local nucleation and random elongation, which the authors could simulate knowing the local concentrations of the two NPFs as established in this paper.
