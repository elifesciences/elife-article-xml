This challenge is magnified for variants residing in non-coding regions of the genome. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5ʹ untranslated region (5ʹ-UTR) of the ferritin light chain (<italic>FTL</italic>) gene that cause hyperferritinemia are reported to disrupt translation repression by altering iron regulatory protein (IRP) interactions with the <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA 5ʹ-UTR.

However, if not properly managed, excess iron catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To safeguard against these toxic effects, cells sequester iron in ferritin, a cage-like protein complex composed of a variable mixture of two structurally similar but functionally distinct subunits, the ferritin heavy chain (FTH) and the ferritin light chain (FTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison and Arosio, 1996</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knovich et al., 2009</xref>).

For example, the FTL subunit composition of ferritin is altered in response to environmental factors such as hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sammarco et al., 2008</xref>). We recently found that eIF3 can function beyond its scaffolding role in general translation initiation by acting as either an activator or repressor of translation in a transcript-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).

Notably, we found that <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA cross-links to eIF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), but the role eIF3 plays in regulating <italic>FTL</italic> translation has not been established.</p><p>Here, we report a previously unknown mode of <italic>FTL</italic> translation regulation with a direct link to disease-related genetic mutations. We show that eIF3 binds to human <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA by means of sequences in the 5ʹ-UTR immediately adjacent to the IRE, and provides additional regulation of <italic>FTL</italic> translation independent of IRP-IRE. After using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to delete the endogenous eIF3 interaction site in <italic>FTL</italic>, we monitored direct phenotypic responses of cells under normal and iron modulated conditions. Lastly, we used competitive IRP binding assays to explore the potential role of eIF3 in hyperferritinemia. These experiments reveal that eIF3 acts as a repressor of <italic>FTL</italic> translation, and disruption of eIF3 interactions with <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA due to specific SNPs in the <italic>FTL</italic> 5ʹ-UTR likely contributes to a subset of hyperferritinemia cases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the eIF3-<italic>FTL</italic> mRNA interaction site</title><p>In order to understand the functional effect of the interaction between eIF3 and <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA, we utilized <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (rLuc) reporter mRNAs in which the 5ʹ-UTR from <italic>FTL</italic> was placed upstream of the <italic>Renilla</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To measure the importance of the <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA region identified by PAR-CLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), various mutations were introduced into the <italic>FTL</italic> 5ʹ-UTR to disrupt eIF3 binding.

To evaluate the effect of the deletions (<italic>∆PAR, ∆3RE</italic>) on IRP binding, we carried out RNA-electrophoretic mobility shift assays with near-IR-labeled <italic>FTL</italic> 5ʹ-UTR RNA and recombinant IRP1. As expected, IRP1 bound to the wild type 5ʹ-UTR of <italic>FTL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

It had been shown previously that moving the IRE in the <italic>FTH1</italic> 5ʹ-UTR further than 60 nucleotides from the 5ʹ m<sup>7</sup>G-cap partially relieves IRP-dependent inhibition of <italic>FTH1</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goossen and Hentze, 1992</xref>). Inhibition is lost because bound IRP can no longer fully sterically block the assembly of the 43S preinitiation complex on the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muckenthaler et al., 1998</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paraskeva et al., 1999</xref>). To further investigate if this holds for <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA, we used the <italic>FTL</italic> and <italic>∆3RE</italic> luciferase reporter constructs and placed the characteristic C bulge of the IRE either 32 nucleotides away (native) or 70 nucleotides away (extended) from the 5ʹ-cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As with <italic>FTH1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goossen and Hentze, 1992</xref>), moving the IRE further from the 5ʹ-cap partially derepressed translation of the <italic>FTL</italic>-based luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, overall translation was much higher from both <italic>∆3RE</italic> mRNAs, even with partial removal of IRP-dependent repression due to the distance from the 5ʹ-cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This cap position-independent derepression is unique to <italic>FTL</italic> as the 3RE region is not conserved in the <italic>FTH1</italic> 5’-UTR. Furthermore, combining the <italic>∆3RE</italic> mutation with a mutation that disrupts IRP binding to the IRE entirely (Loop) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cazzola et al., 1997</xref>) synergistically derepressed luciferase reporter translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, compare Double to Loop and <italic>∆3RE</italic>). We verified the mRNAs were equally stable during the 6 hr time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), ensuring the observed phenotypic changes are caused by changes in translational regulation. The slight inconsistency in the amount of derepression observed with the double mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and the extended ∆3RE mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) may be due to the fact that the extension of the 5’-UTR from its native state does not completely abolish the repression of <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA translation by IRP, in contrast to the loop mutation which abolishes IRP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cazzola et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, it is not clear how the distance from the 5’-cap affects repression mediated by eIF3. Taken together, these results indicate that IRP-mediated inhibition of translation is maintained in the <italic>∆3RE</italic> mRNA, and that eIF3 confers an additional level of repression beyond that which can be provided by IRP.</p><p>We used the luciferase reporter results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> to formulate a mathematical model to determine whether eIF3 and IRP can bind and regulate <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA simultaneously (See Materials and methods for details). Such a model would be useful in conditions with different extents of iron-response regulation. We defined a system in which IRP and eIF3 do not bind the same mRNA. This leaves three possible states in which the <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA could exist: the fraction bound solely by IRP (<italic>x<sub>1</sub></italic>), the fraction bound solely by eIF3 (<italic>x<sub>2</sub></italic>), and the remainder of the mRNA which is unbound by either factor (<italic>x<sub>3</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We further elaborated this model to include translation efficiency (<italic>y</italic>). Here we assume the mutations do not affect the translation efficiency of the unbound species (<italic>x<sub>3</sub></italic>), while the other two populations (<italic>x<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>2</sub></italic>) have translational efficiencies (<italic>y<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>y<sub>2</sub></italic>) scaled between full repression (<italic>y<sub>n</sub></italic> = 0) and no repression (<italic>y<sub>n</sub></italic> = 1). Lastly, we assumed the mutations that disrupt binding shift the equilibrium of the total mRNA population between bound and unbound fractions of the alternate factor by some amount, either α for those affecting eIF3 binding or β for IRP binding. Using the translational output determined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, we find that the data are inconsistent with the model that eIF3 and IRP cannot bind the same mRNA. Rather, the data indicate that IRP and eIF3 likely act in cis on at least a fraction of the <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Physiological response to loss of eIF3-dependent repression</title><p>To investigate the physiological response to the loss of eIF3-based repression, we genetically engineered either HEK293T or HepG2 cells to generate the <italic>∆3RE</italic> mutation in the 5ʹ-UTR in the <italic>FTL</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>).

Although the PAR-CLIP methodology maps the region of interaction between an RNA and protein of interest, it does not always capture the full interaction site due to the requirement for 4-thiouridine cross-linking and subsequent RNase digestion to generate fragments for deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether the G51C and G52C SNPs could potentially impact eIF3 repression of <italic>FTL</italic> mRNA translation, due to the proximity of the G51C and G52C mutations to the eIF3 PAR-CLIP site. We generated luciferase reporter constructs with either of the G51C and G52C SNPs, as well as a control with the previously described mutations in the IRE apical loop, and used mRNA transfections to test their effects on luciferase translation levels. All mutations led to an increase in luciferase levels, indicating that they alleviated translational repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We also observed that the G51C and G52C mRNAs do not interact with eIF3, based on eIF3 immunoprecipitations from transfected HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the G51C and G52C SNPs maintained near wild-type IRP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), in stark contrast to the mutations in the IRE apical loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which completely abolished the interaction between IRP1 and the 5ʹ-UTR element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, using stable cell lines, we observe iron-responsive regulation of luciferase reporter mRNAs with G51C or G52C SNP-containing <italic>FTL</italic> 5ʹ -UTRs, as well as IRP binding to these mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The specific genetic mutations we analyzed (G51C, G52C) map to the less-conserved lower stem of the IRE, and are predicted to have no direct physical interaction with IRP1 (PDB: 3SNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walden et al., 2006</xref>).

This form of labeling has been shown not to disrupt protein-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Köhn et al., 2010</xref>). Unlabeled RNA was transcribed and purified as described above.</p><p>Binding experiments were carried out with a final concentration of 300 pM of labeled RNA and 225 nM of recombinant human IRP1, which facilitated a 1:1 ratio of RNA binding to IRP1. We first ensured the RNA competition experiments reached equilibrium – which required at least 11 hr of incubation – by measuring the approximate dissociation rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) of WT <italic>FTL</italic> 5ʹ-UTR from IRP1. Heparin was included at the beginning of the reaction at a final concentration of 4.5 µg/mL.

In preliminary experiments, we found the k<sub>off</sub> to be roughly 0.006 min<sup>−1</sup> using an 8 hr incubation time course with competitor. We then tested the fraction of IRP bound after 11 hr and 18 hr incubations with competitor <italic>FTL</italic> RNA and observed no changes in the residual fraction of IRP bound to RNA (~15%), indicating the reactions had reached equilibrium. Thus, subsequent experiments with competitor RNAs were carried out for 18 hr, after the first 30 min pre-incubation in the absence of competitor. The reactions were resolved on Tris-glycine gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat.# XP04122BOX) and gels was visualized using an Odyssey Licor set to 700 nM wavelength and an intensity of 6.5. Band intensity quantification was carried out using Image Studio (Licor).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leos Shivaya Valasek (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This report provides evidence that eIF3 binds to ferritin light chain mRNA (FTL) adjacent to and overlapping with the IRE element where IRP1 binds to exert the well-known repression of FTL mRNA translation in low iron conditions. They show that a deletion of the eIF3 binding site that does not include the region of overlap with the IRE derepresses expression of a FTL-5'UTR-LUC reporter by ~10-fold (although the fold-increase seems to vary between 4x and 20X in different experiments). This Δ3RE deletion does not strongly reduce binding of recombinant IRP1 to the FTL 5'UTR in vitro, reducing affinity ~4-fold; and it also still confers derepression of reporter mRNA in the presence of mutations that impair IRP1 binding or function (although the extent of derepression by Δ3RE is diminished when IRP1 function is reduced by moving the IRE further from the cap.) Gene editing was used to introduce Δ3RE into FLT mRNA in cultured cells and it is shown that the mutation derepresses native FTL protein expression apparently without reducing native IRP1 binding to the mRNA (although there are several issues complicating this conclusion), and evidence is presented that the increased FTL expression and concomitant decreased FTH chain expression confers increased stability on the ferritin complex (although there are issues with these results too.) In addition, the expected responses of FTL expression to iron excess or depletion achieved pharmacologically remain intact for the Δ3RE mutated FTL gene. These findings lead the authors to conclude that eIF3 represses translation of FTL mRNA independently of IRP1. They go on to show that two SNPs in FTL associated with hyperferritinemia that are expected to affect IRP1 binding but are close to the eIF3 binding site that they mapped previously by PAR-CliP derepress expression of the FTL-5'UTR-LUC reporter comparably to the Δ3RE mutation and reduce binding of eIF3 to the reporter mRNA in cells, but only weakly reduce binding of recombinant IRP1 to the FTL mRNA in vitro. It was not shown however that the SNP mutations allow for normal IRP1 binding to reporter mRNA in cells; nor was it shown that the mutated reporters respond normally to iron excess or depletion, which appear to be a significant omissions. The results are significant in linking eIF3-mediated repression of a specific mRNA to a human disease and also add an additional layer of regulation to the well-established mechanism of iron-mediated translational control by IRP1.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– It should be verified that equal amounts of WT vs delta3RE and WT vs. G51C and G52C reporter mRNAs are present in the transfected cells from which the luciferase expression levels were obtained</p><p>– Results shown in panels 2E and 2F appear to be inconsistent. In 2E, delta3RE causes a 32-fold luminescence change; in 2F, the same mutation/construct causes only a 4.4-fold change. Moreover, in 2F, IRP and eIF3 binding have an “additive” (rather than “synergistic”) effect, whereas in 2E, there is no such additive effect (the expectation would be more than 32-fold).

They show that a deletion of the eIF3 binding site that does not include the region of overlap with the IRE derepresses expression of a FTL-5'UTR-LUC reporter by ~10-fold (although the fold-increase seems to vary between 4x and 20X in different experiments). This Δ3RE deletion does not strongly reduce binding of recombinant IRP1 to the FTL 5'UTR in vitro, reducing affinity ~4-fold; and it also still confers derepression of reporter mRNA in the presence of mutations that impair IRP1 binding or function (although the extent of derepression by Δ3RE is diminished when IRP1 function is reduced by moving the IRE further from the cap.) Gene editing was used to introduce Δ3RE into FLT mRNA in cultured cells and it is shown that the mutation derepresses native FTL protein expression apparently without reducing native IRP1 binding to the mRNA (although there are several issues complicating this conclusion), and evidence is presented that the increased FTL expression and concomitant decreased FTH chain expression confers increased stability on the ferritin complex (although there are issues with these results too.) In addition, the expected responses of FTL expression to iron excess or depletion achieved pharmacologically remain intact for the Δ3RE mutated FTL gene. These findings lead the authors to conclude that eIF3 represses translation of FTL mRNA independently of IRP1. They go on to show that two SNPs in FTL associated with hyperferritinemia that are expected to affect IRP1 binding but are close to the eIF3 binding site that they mapped previously by PAR-CliP derepress expression of the FTL-5'UTR-LUC reporter comparably to the Δ3RE mutation and reduce binding of eIF3 to the reporter mRNA in cells, but only weakly reduce binding of recombinant IRP1 to the FTL mRNA in vitro. It was not shown however that the SNP mutations allow for normal IRP1 binding and translational repression by IRP1 in cells, and it seems important to show at least that the mutated reporters respond normally to iron excess or depletion. The results are significant in linking eIF3-mediated repression of a specific mRNA to a human disease and also add an additional layer of regulation to the well-established mechanism of iron-mediated translational control by IRP1. However, there are a number of significant shortcomings with the study, as noted above, and described below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>– Figure 1E: Determine the effects of the Δ3RE mutations on reporter mRNA levels, and show that Δ3RE increases the polysome size of the reporter mRNA in the event that it is found to reduce mRNA levels, in order to rigorously establish derepression at the level of translation.</p><p>– Figure 3A: the results of Western blots from multiple biological replicates must be presented and statistical analysis of the differences in mean values determined to rigorously establish that the Δ3RE mutation derepresses FTL protein expression.</p><p>– Subsection “Physiological response to loss of eIF3-dependent repression” and Figure 3A and C: Why weren't WB results from HEK cells presented, whereas the text would lead one to believe that the effect of the mutation was the same in both cell lines?

They propose that eIF3 acts as a specific repressor of the FTL mRNA translation that binds to its structured 5' UTR simultaneously with another repressor – the iron regulatory protein (IRP) – and thus adds another, IRP-IRE-independent layer of the negative control. Since a few specific SNPs located in the eIF3-binding site in the FTL 5' UTR that have been associated with the aforementioned disease disturb this eIF3-specific control, authors conclude that this is the first study identifying a direct role for eIF3-mediated translational control in a specific human disease.</p><p>It is an interesting and well-executed work that, in my opinion, deserves to be eventually published in the <italic>eLife</italic> journal.</p><p>Major criticism:</p><p>The IRE is a well-defined structural element that has been specifically mutated and I think that this work would benefit from the analysis of secondary structures of the deltaPAR and delta3RE mutant mRNAs; it may greatly help with the interpretation of the proposed synergy between IRP and eIF3.

This was not rationalized.</p><p>Were the Luc experiments (like the one shown in Figure 1E) normalized to the mRNA levels?

It examines at the molecular level whether and how the general eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) affects the translation of a specific target mRNAs (human ferritin light chain mRNA, FTL mRNA) to which it makes sequence or structure-specific contacts. This work is a follow-up of a previous genome-wide PAR-CLIP analysis by the Cate lab that identified numerous eIF3 target mRNAs. Pulos-Holmes now demonstrate as a proof-of-principle how particular disease-causing human SNPs in the 5'UTR of FTL mRNA cause translational mis-regulation as a consequence of failed eIF3 interaction and not, as previously assumed, as a consequence of a failed interaction with the iron-response-protein (IRP). IRP is a highly specific RNA-binding protein with a close-by but distinct RNA target site and long known to regulate FTL mRNA in an iron-dependent manner. Conceptually, the present work advances our understanding of how also general translation factors such as eIF3 can cause specific RNA regulation in addition to and in combination with specific RNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, the authors identify the molecular pathway of how particular SNPs cause human disease and they show that even closely-spaced SNPs can act via distinct molecular interactions.</p><p>The manuscript is concise, generally well-written and easy to follow also for a general audience. Nevertheless, I have some comments and suggestions, also regarding experimental details, that should be clarified before publication.</p><p>1) It should be useful to add nucleotide numbers to Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, also marking already here the delta3RE and loop dinucleotide mutations (“loop”) that are used throughout the work. Also the legends should be updated accordingly. Otherwise it is for example not quite clear that “loop” means point mutations and not a larger deletion.</p><p>2) Also please explain the meaning of “Double” in the legend of Figure 2. What does the line “N.A., the IC50 value.…” in the Figure 2C legend refer to?</p><p>3) The Figure referring to the “mathematical modelling” (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) is not very well explained. What is y1 and y2, what are the brown balls, what is meant by “previously”? One can understand the idea of the modelling only after reading through the Materials and methods in detail. Modeling is claimed to “demonstrate that IRP and eIF3 seem to work synergistically”. This sentence sounds odd. In my view, the described modeling approach seems like an “overkill”, unnecessarily complicated and rather indirect, because the data in the end excludes the described model. Isn't it sufficient in Figure 2F to see that, starting from “Double”, the repression in “FTL” (~40-fold) is roughly the product of the repression by IRP in “delta3RE” (~10 fold) and the repression by eIF3 in “Loop” (~4-fold)? If only one of the two binders could act at a time, the maximum repression would be (~10 fold) by IRP. Maybe I am missing something, but then it needs to be better explained.</p><p>4) The description of the Western blots and sample dilutions in Figure 3A, B, D and Figure 3—figure supplement 3 is not very clear, and/or it may be advisable to show more convincing blots. It is not always clear which lane shows diluted samples and whether the β Actin controls were co-diluted or not (It seems to me that the b Actin controls were run on separate lanes of the gel and were undiluted). Moreover, in Figure 3D, the lanes in the absence of FAC would be expected to look exactly like the lanes in the absence of DFO (in both cases the cells are still untreated), but this is not really the case. Although all of the cells are still reactive to FAC or DFO, it would be more convincing if the starting material looked the same. Similar in Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>5) In Figure 3B, it might be good to clarify that “delta3RE” refers to the respective mutation in the FTL RNA, e.g. by labelling “delta3RE” in Figure 3A, B as “FTL-delta3RE”. Moreover, the authors do not give any explanation for the puzzling result that FTH protein expression is apparently decreased when FTL RNA is mutated. Is it possible that “delta3RE” cells try to compensate the lack of FTL RNA translational repression by producing generally more IRP protein and that this excessive IRP protein then downregulates FTH RNA? Did the authors try and look at endogenous IRP protein levels in WT and “delta3RE” cells with e.g. a suitable antibody?</p><p>6) Is there any explanation for why DFO does not downregulate FTH RNA in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B?</p><p>7) It should be clarified in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 that this is a Coomassie-stained native gel (maybe show in blue?) of the purified ferritin complex, presumably containing different ratios of FTL and FTH chains (predominantly FTL in the case of delta3RE cells?). The text claims that the delta3RE cells contain 8x as much ferritin as the WT cells, but this is not obvious from the figure. Moreover, the text also claims the complexes from delta3RE cells to be more “stable”. Presumably this does not refer to the physiological half-life of the complex in the cell but to the “stability” of the complex in the harsh purification procedure using 40% methanol and 75 deg C. Does the ferritin complex remain intact and folded in this process or does it undergo unfolding/refolding and/or disassembly/reassembly? Does protein concentration and purity matter in this process and possibly lead to wrong conclusions regarding “stability”?</p><p>8) The text lacks general information for a general reader on what is the physiological difference between FTL and FTH proteins and whether the ratio in which they occur in ferritin has physiological importance. Are FTL-exclusive ferritins more stable than FTH-containing ones? This is important, because eIF3 binding appears to affect not only the total amount of FTL, but even more so the ratio of FTL to FTH, possibly generating ferritin complexes with different properties. This is somewhat mentioned at the end of the Discussion, but the authors could elaborate on this point of physiological significance.</p><p>9) Some statements in the text could be revisited:</p><p>Abstract: SNPs.… “are thought” to disrupt.…. Do you mean “were described/reported” to disrupt? Otherwise that statement sounds like a hypothesis and creates the impression that the study might continue with a proof of IRP-dependence. See also the first paragraph of subsection “SNPs in FTL that cause hyperferritinemia” for a very similar statement.</p><p>Subsection “Identification of the eIF3-FTL mRNA interaction site”: “a secondary structure element that overlaps” or do you mean “a 24 nucleotide sequence.… that overlaps”?</p><p>In the same section: “.… in a deletion the/that maintained”.…</p><p>Subsection “Decoupling the repressive role of eIF3 on FTL mRNA from that of IRP”: What is “the characteristic C bulge”?</p><p>In the same section: List/ explain the loop mutation as a A15G/G16C dinucleotide mutation (clarify numbers in Figures; 40/41 in Figure 5?)</p><p>Subsection “Physiological response to loss of eIF3-dependent repression”: “significantly” suggests statistically evaluated significance, maybe use “considerably”.</p><p>In the same section check the following statement: “This implicates eIF3 in regulating not only the abundance of the two ferritin subunits, but also the dynamics and stability of the ferritin complex” This statement needs further explanation on how this is thought to occur – for example that different ratios of FTL and FTH within a given ferritin complex could cause such differences (maybe add references if data exists on this).</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2 legend: Explain FAC and DFO here instead of later in the Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Figure 4 legend: small caps for “hyperferritinemia”. “EIF3B” or “eIF3B”? “in the IP compared to/with input levels”. “Loop” mutant with reference to Cazzola et al.?

In 2E, delta3RE causes a 32-fold luminescence change; in 2F, the same mutation/construct causes only a 4.4-fold change.

The authors need to convincingly address this issue, ideally by performing both sets of experiments in parallel under identical conditions (according to legend 2F, e.g. the incubation times were different).</p></disp-quote><p>There are two potential factors that could explain why the derepression values observed in Figure 2F are seemingly not consistent with the extended ∆3RE construct in Figure 2E. First, the extension of the 5′-UTR from its native state does not completely abolish the repression mediated by IRP. It only significantly dampens it (See Goossen and Hentze, 1992). This is in contrast to the loop mutations which abolish IRP binding entirely (Figure 4D and Cazzola et al., 1997). We note that in the original submission, the experiment in Figure 2E was carried out for 12 hrs. We have seen that with HepG2 cells there is still an increase in luminescence beyond shorter (i.e. 6 hr) incubation times. For example, see Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. In a separate experiment, which we now include as the new Figure 2E, we used a 6-hr incubation. In this experiment, derepression of the WT FTL with extended 5′-UTR is about 5-fold. By contrast, the loop mutation derepressed FTL translation 12-fold in the 6-hr incubation in Figure 2F.</p><p>Second, it is not clear how the distance from the 5′-cap affects repression mediated eIF3.

Although we have not checked if the abundance of IRP differs in these cell lines, if it did, other IRP-regulated transcripts such as that for Ferroportin would likely be affected in the same way as FTH. Thus, we have also looked at another protein, Ferroportin, which also has an IRE in the 5′-UTR of its mRNA. Notably, we see no difference in Ferroportin abundance comparing the wild type and ∆3RE cell line, suggesting that the decrease in FTH levels is not due to a mass action process.

Although FAC treatment does not seem to release IRP as efficiently from the G51C and G52C reporters compared to endogenous FTL, we suggest that these mutant constructs are more efficiently bound by IRP in cells than the WT, as seen in the IRP-FLAG IP results in Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, or due to possible post-translational regulation of FTL, which is not recapitulated using luciferase as a reporter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Make the appropriate revisions of text to address all other major comments of the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional modifications to the text and figures are described below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Please see our overall responses above.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] It is an interesting and well-executed work that, in my opinion, deserves to be eventually published in the eLife journal.</p><p>Major criticism:</p><p>The IRE is a well-defined structural element that has been specifically mutated and I think that this work would benefit from the analysis of secondary structures of the deltaPAR and delta3RE mutant mRNAs; it may greatly help with the interpretation of the proposed synergy between IRP and eIF3.

In my view, the described modeling approach seems like an “overkill”, unnecessarily complicated and rather indirect, because the data in the end excludes the described model. Isn't it sufficient in Figure 2F to see that, starting from “Double”, the repression in “FTL” (~40-fold) is roughly the product of the repression by IRP in “delta3RE” (~10 fold) and the repression by eIF3 in “Loop” (~4-fold)? If only one of the two binders could act at a time, the maximum repression would be (~10 fold) by IRP. Maybe I am missing something, but then it needs to be better explained.</p><p>4) The description of the Western blots and sample dilutions in Figure 3A, B, D and Figure 3—figure supplement 3 is not very clear, and/or it may be advisable to show more convincing blots. It is not always clear which lane shows diluted samples and whether the β Actin controls were co-diluted or not (It seems to me that the b Actin controls were run on separate lanes of the gel and were undiluted). Moreover, in Figure 3D, the lanes in the absence of FAC would be expected to look exactly like the lanes in the absence of DFO (in both cases the cells are still untreated), but this is not really the case. Although all of the cells are still reactive to FAC or DFO, it would be more convincing if the starting material looked the same. Similar in Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>5) In Figure 3B, it might be good to clarify that “delta3RE” refers to the respective mutation in the FTL RNA, e.g. by labelling “delta3RE” in Figure 3A, B as “FTL-delta3RE”. Moreover, the authors do not give any explanation for the puzzling result that FTH protein expression is apparently decreased when FTL RNA is mutated. Is it possible that “delta3RE” cells try to compensate the lack of FTL RNA translational repression by producing generally more IRP protein and that this excessive IRP protein then downregulates FTH RNA? Did the authors try and look at endogenous IRP protein levels in WT and “delta3RE” cells with e.g. a suitable antibody?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our overall responses above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Is there any explanation for why DFO does not downregulate FTH RNA in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not have an explanation for this at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It should be clarified in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 that this is a Coomassie-stained native gel (maybe show in blue?) of the purified ferritin complex, presumably containing different ratios of FTL and FTH chains (predominantly FTL in the case of delta3RE cells?). The text claims that the delta3RE cells contain 8x as much ferritin as the WT cells, but this is not obvious from the figure. Moreover, the text also claims the complexes from delta3RE cells to be more “stable”. Presumably this does not refer to the physiological half-life of the complex in the cell but to the “stability” of the complex in the harsh purification procedure using 40% methanol and 75 deg C. Does the ferritin complex remain intact and folded in this process or does it undergo unfolding/refolding and/or disassembly/reassembly? Does protein concentration and purity matter in this process and possibly lead to wrong conclusions regarding “stability”?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the figure legend to address that this is a coomassie stained gel. You are correct that we are referring to the stability of the complex during the purification process and not its half life. Based on literature precedence (cited in the manuscript) we believe that this is an intact and folded complex throughout the purification process. This method of purification is very common for ferritin and because of how harsh it is, we do not feel extremely worried about contaminants in the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The text lacks general information for a general reader on what is the physiological difference between FTL and FTH proteins and whether the ratio in which they occur in ferritin has physiological importance. Are FTL-exclusive ferritins more stable than FTH-containing ones? This is important, because eIF3 binding appears to affect not only the total amount of FTL, but even more so the ratio of FTL to FTH, possibly generating ferritin complexes with different properties. This is somewhat mentioned at the end of the Discussion, but the authors could elaborate on this point of physiological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>There are physiological differences between FTL and FTH. For example, FTH is the catalytic subunit of the two whereas FTL promotes complex stability and aids in the iron mineralization process. We expanded our description of FTH in various places, i.e. in terms of its effect on Ferritin stability, and the observation of post-transcriptional downregulation of FTH levels, but not Ferroportin levels, based on our new experiments. However, we have not strongly elaborated on this process because we feel that it goes beyond the scope of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Some statements in the text could be revisited:</p><p>Abstract: SNPs.… “are thought” to disrupt.….
