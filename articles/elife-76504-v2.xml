ε-subunits. To form functional channels, the subunits must assemble with one another in a precise stoichiometry and arrangement. Despite being different, the four subunits share a common ancestor that is presumed to have formed homopentamers. The extent to which the properties of the modern-day receptor result from its subunit complexity is unknown. Here, we discover that a reconstructed ancestral muscle-type β-subunit can form homopentameric ion channels. These homopentamers open spontaneously and display single-channel hallmarks of muscle-type acetylcholine receptor activity. Our findings attest to the homopentameric origin of the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor, and demonstrate that signature features of its function are both independent of agonist and do not necessitate the complex heteropentameric architecture of the modern-day protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>single-channel</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant RGPIN-2016-04801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>daCosta</surname><given-names>Corrie JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant 377068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>daCosta</surname><given-names>Corrie JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000121</institution-id><institution>Ontario Council on Graduate Studies, Council of Ontario Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tessier</surname><given-names>Christian JG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New Frontiers in Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NFRFE-2018-453 00064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>daCosta</surname><given-names>Corrie JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reconstructed ancestral muscle-type acetylcholine receptor β-subunits readily form homopentameric ion channels that open spontaneously, and display functional hallmarks of the modern-day heteropentameric receptor despite being devoid of canonical agonist-binding sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ligand-gated ion channels convert chemical signals into electrical impulses by coupling the binding of small molecules to the opening of an ion-conducting transmembrane pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hille, 2001</xref>). Of the many types of ligand-gated channels, the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) is the largest and most structurally and functionally diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaiteh et al., 2016</xref>). Formed from five identical or homologous subunits arranged around a central ion-conducting pore, pLGICs are found in almost all forms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corringer et al., 2012</xref>). In prokaryotes, pLGICs appear to be exclusively homopentameric, while in eukaryotes both homo- and heteropentameric channels are common. Humans express more than 40 different pLGIC subunits, which are subdivided based on whether they form cation-selective channels activated by acetylcholine or serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT<sub>3</sub>]), or anion-selective channels activated by γ-aminobutyric acid or glycine. This repertoire of pLGIC subunits, combined with their ability to form homo- and heteropentamers, leads to a wealth of structural and functional diversity, presumably to meet a variety of synaptic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sine and Engel, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The archetypal pLGIC is the heteropentameric muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), with the human adult form composed of two α-subunits, and one each of the β-, δ-, and ε-subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Changeux, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Changeux, 2020b</xref>). To gain insight into the structure, function, and evolution of the AChR, we have employed an ancestral reconstruction approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emlaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tessier et al., 2017</xref>). Previously we resurrected a putative ancestral AChR β-subunit. Referred to as ‘β<sub>Anc</sub>’, this subunit differed from its human counterpart by 132 amino acids (i.e. approximately 30% of the total amino acid sequence), yet was able to substitute for the human β-subunit, and also supplant the human δ-subunit, forming functional hybrid ancestral/human AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>). These hybrid AChRs were ternary mixtures, containing two β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits, two human α-subunits, and one human ε-subunit. A concatameric construct confirmed that the two β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits resided next to each other, occupying positions in the heteropentameric complex usually reserved for the human β- and δ-subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>). Regardless of whether they bind agonist or not, all pLGIC subunits have both principal (+) and complementary (−) subunit interfaces. To sit next to each other, the (+) and (−) interfaces of any two neighbouring subunits must be structurally compatible. Thus, for β<sub>Anc</sub> to replace both the human β- and δ-subunits, the (+) and (−) interfaces of β<sub>Anc</sub> must be compatible with each other, raising the possibility that multiple β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits could coassemble to form β<sub>Anc</sub> homomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Subunit composition of heterologously expressed acetylcholine receptors (AChR).</title><p>Subunit stoichiometry and arrangement of the human adult muscle-type AChR (left), where the agonist-binding sites at the α–δ and α–ε subunit interfaces are indicated with asterisks (*). A reconstructed ancestral β-subunit (β<sub>Anc</sub>; purple) forms hybrid AChRs (middle) where β<sub>Anc</sub> substitutes for the human β-subunit (β; orange) and supplants the human δ-subunit (δ; green). The principal (+) and complementary (−) interfaces of β<sub>Anc</sub> must be compatible for two β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits to sit side-by-side (red highlight), which predicts that homomers formed from multiple β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits should be possible (right, boxed).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76504-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Here, using single-channel measurements, we demonstrate that β<sub>Anc</sub> readily forms homopentameric channels that open spontaneously in the absence of acetylcholine. This spontaneous activity displays hallmarks of the muscle-type AChR, including steady-state single-channel burst behaviour. These findings demonstrate how fundamental characteristics of AChR activation are independent of agonist, and not a result of the complex heteropentameric architecture of the muscle-type AChR. Finally, an alternate ancestral β-subunit, reconstructed using a phylogenetic tree that matched the accepted species relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>), and which only shared ~85% identity with β<sub>Anc</sub>, revealed that these unexpected characteristics of β<sub>Anc</sub> are robust to phylogenetic uncertainty, and thus deeply embedded within AChR β-subunit structure and evolutionary history.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our first inkling that β<sub>Anc</sub> may be able to form homomeric channels came from heterogeneity in single-channel recordings acquired after alterations to our original heterologous expression/transfection protocol. Typical cotransfection of cDNAs encoding human α-, δ-, and ε-subunits with a cDNA encoding β<sub>Anc</sub> leads to robust cell surface expression of β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing hybrid AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinston et al., 2017</xref>). In an attempt to lower overall AChR expression with the purpose of facilitating single-channel analysis, we reduced the total amount of subunit cDNA in our transfections (~sixfold), while maintaining the same 2:1:1:1 subunit cDNA ratio (by weight; α:β<sub>Anc</sub>:δ:ε). Reducing the amount of cDNA lowered overall AChR expression as expected, but also led to heterogeneity in our patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which was not present in original single-channel recordings of β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinston et al., 2017</xref>). Instead of a single population of channels with a uniform amplitude of ~10 pA, and a burst behaviour indicative of β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing AChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; left inset), we also observed a second class of channels with a different kinetic signature, and an increased amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; right inset). A similar trend was not observed when cDNA encoding the wild-type human β-subunit was cotransfected instead of β<sub>Anc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that β<sub>Anc</sub> was the source of the heterogeneity. Consistent with this, lowering the proportion of β<sub>Anc</sub> cDNA in the transfection mixture reduced the fraction of high amplitude channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>), while transfecting exclusively with β<sub>Anc</sub> cDNA resulted in patches where all channel openings had a uniformly high amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). This demonstrated that when transfected alone, β<sub>Anc</sub> forms functional ion channels. The present work stems from this unexpected observation and describes characterisation of these previously unobserved channels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-channel recordings of β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative continuous recording from a cell-attached patch where cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding human muscle-type α-, δ-, and ε-subunits, and an additional cDNA encoding β<sub>Anc</sub> at a cDNA ratio of 2:1:1:1 (α:β<sub>Anc</sub>:δ:ε).

In the human adult muscle-type AChR, the agonist-binding sites are located at the α–δ and α–ε interfaces, and the β-subunit is the only subunit that does not participate directly in agonist binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rahman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>). We were therefore surprised to see single-channel activity in patches from cells transfected exclusively with β<sub>Anc</sub>, as channels formed from a muscle-type β-subunit alone would not be expected to have intact agonist-binding sites. To determine if the activity of β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels was dependent upon acetylcholine, we recorded single-channel activity in the absence of acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). When no acetylcholine was present, patches from cells that were transfected exclusively with β<sub>Anc</sub> cDNA still displayed single-channel activity, indicating that β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels open spontaneously under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, spontaneous activity occurred as bursts of closely spaced openings, separated by brief closings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1982</xref>).

This suggested that a minimal scheme with a single open state and two closed states is necessary and sufficient to describe the spontaneous activity of β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels. Based on this, we then fit the sequence of single-channel dwells using the three possible kinetic schemes, two linear and one cyclic, comprising a single open state and two closed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a control, we also fit a simplified two-state scheme, where a single open state was connected to a single closed state, which, based on the relatively poor fit of the closed durations, confirmed that inclusion of a second closed state was justified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overlaying the resulting fits on top of duration histograms revealed that each of the possible three-state schemes fits the observed dwells equally well, thus discriminating between the possible kinetic schemes is not trivial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We settled upon the simple linear scheme, where β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels transition from a closed state, C, to an intermediate closed state, C′, before opening to O′. The form of this scheme, with an intermediate closed state that precedes channel opening, is guided by models of AChR activation that include a single ‘flipping’ or multiple ‘priming’ steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukhtasimova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>). Given that for β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels there is a single intermediate closed state that precedes channel opening, we refer to this state in our scheme as ‘flipped’ or ‘primed’.</p><p>In the presence of acetylcholine, the single-channel current traces appeared different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As the concentration of acetylcholine increased from 10 to 100 μM, there was a progressive decrease in the duration of openings, as well as a reciprocal increase in the number of short-lived closings within each burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This can be observed as a leftward shift in the open duration histograms as the concentration of acetylcholine is increased. This single-channel behaviour is a hallmark of open-channel block, a ubiquitous property of AChR agonists, including acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lape et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukhtasimova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogden and Colquhoun, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sine and Steinbach, 1984</xref>).

To compare the open state structures of β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone homomers with wild-type AChRs, we determined the kinetics of acetylcholine and QX-222 block for both types of channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). To fit our β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone single-channel data recorded in the presence of a blocker, we introduced an additional open, but blocked (i.e. non-conducting) state connected to our open state, where the forward rate of block was dependent upon the concentration of the blocking molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neher and Steinbach, 1978</xref>). We then globally fit each of our β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone datasets encompassing between 0 and 100 μM acetylcholine or QX-222. Initially, we restricted the rates of the core (C-C′-O′) scheme to those inferred in the absence of blocker; however, allowing all parameters to be estimated, led to negligible changes in the inferred rates of block. For β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone and wild-type channels, the rates of acetylcholine and QX-222 block were comparable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Of note, while the forward rate of QX-222 block (<italic>k</italic><sub>+B</sub>) was almost the same for both types of channels, the reverse rate of QX-222 unblocking (<italic>k</italic><sub>–B</sub>) was nearly twofold faster for β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels, indicating that the open pore of β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels has a slightly reduced affinity for QX-222. Regardless of this nuance, the similarity in the profiles of acetylcholine and QX-222 block suggests that the structure of the open pore in the two types of channels is similar.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Single-channel kinetics of spontaneously opening β<sub>Anc</sub> homomers.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Homomer</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>+1</sub>′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>K</italic>′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Θ</italic><sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>+B</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>-B</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>K</italic><sub>B</sub>(μM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">No agonist<break/>(<italic>3 patches</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3900<break/>(110)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7600<break/>(450)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.51</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10,000<break/>(300)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">310<break/>(3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">32.26</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acetylcholine<break/>(<italic>15 patches</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3500<break/>(85)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5400<break/>(265)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.65</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8000<break/>(200)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">330<break/>(3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">24.24</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">170*<break/>(1.8)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">62,000<break/>(450)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">364.71</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">QX-222<break/>(<italic>15 patches</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4000<break/>(110)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8000<break/>(440)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.50</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10,500<break/>(300)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">320<break/>(3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">32.81</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">95*<break/>(0.5)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1400<break/>(7)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">14.74</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acetylcholine (Constrained)<break/>(<italic>15 patches</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>3900</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>7600</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>0.51</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>10,000</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>310</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>32.26</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">170*<break/>(1.5)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">60,800<break/>(410)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">357.65</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">QX-222 (Constrained)<break/>(<italic>15 patches</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>3900</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>7600</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>0.51</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>10,000</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>310</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><italic>32.26</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">95*<break/>(0.5)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1400<break/>(6.5)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">14.74</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Note: Rate constants were estimated from fitting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Scheme 1</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S2">Scheme 2</xref> presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, respectively.

To determine the subunit stoichiometry of β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels, we employed a single-channel electrical fingerprinting strategy, where mutations altering unitary conductance were used to count the number of individual β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits in β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels. A similar strategy has been employed with tetrameric potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niu and Magleby, 2002</xref>), and other pLGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>), including both the homopentameric α7 AChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">daCosta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">daCosta and Sine, 2013</xref>) and the heteropentameric muscle-type AChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>). The approach relies on identifying high-conductance (HC) and low-conductance (LC) variants of the β<sub>Anc</sub> subunit, and then co-expressing them to reveal a number of amplitude classes. Openings in each amplitude class originate from channels incorporating the same ratio of HC to LC subunits, and based on the total number of amplitude classes, the number of β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits within β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels can be inferred.</p><p>When β<sub>Anc</sub> is expressed alone, the resulting channels exhibit a single, uniform amplitude, distributed around a mean of ~16 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>), making the wild-type β<sub>Anc</sub> subunit an ideal HC subunit for electrical fingerprinting. To identify a LC variant of β<sub>Anc</sub>, we took advantage of a structural feature inherent to eukaryotic pLGICs: as conducting ions exit the channel’s transmembrane pore, they are obliged to pass through one of five portals in the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Unwin, 2005</xref>). Framed by charged or polar residues from each subunit, these portals influence single-channel conductance. Mimicking the homologous 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> receptor, which has an unusually low single-channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hales et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters et al., 2004</xref>), we substituted three arginine residues (E420R, D424R, and E428R) into this region of β<sub>Anc</sub>. When β<sub>Anc</sub> harbouring three arginines in this region was transfected by itself, the resulting channels exhibited a reduced single-channel amplitude centred around~1–2pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>).

The difference in amplitude between successive classes was somewhat regular, demonstrating five approximately equal contributions to single-channel conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that β<sub>Anc</sub>-alone channels are homopentamers.</p><p>As noted previously, reconstruction of β<sub>Anc</sub> was based upon a molecular phylogeny that diverged from the accepted species phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emlaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tessier et al., 2017</xref>). Reconstruction of ancestral protein sequences is based upon a best-fit model of amino acid evolution, a multiple sequence alignment, as well as a phylogenetic tree relating the sequences within the alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thornton, 2004</xref>). We therefore wondered if the ability of β<sub>Anc</sub> to form spontaneously opening homomers was an artefact of the discordant tree used to reconstruct it. To test this, we took advantage of an alternate ancestral β-subunit, called ‘β<sub>AncS</sub>’, whose reconstruction was based upon a molecular phylogeny that matched the accepted species phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>). Despite 67 substitutions and 6 indels relative to β<sub>Anc</sub>, when expressed alone, β<sub>AncS</sub> still formed homomeric channels that opened in bursts in the absence of acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This demonstrated that the ability of β<sub>Anc</sub> to form homomers that spontaneously open is not an artefact of the phylogeny used to reconstruct it. Instead, this surprising ability of β<sub>Anc</sub> is robust to the phylogenetic uncertainties inherent in ancestral sequence reconstruction, as well as substantial variation in the amino acid sequence of the reconstructed ancestral β-subunits.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous single-channel openings of homomers formed from an alternate ancestral β-subunit (β<sub>AncS</sub>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative continuous recording of a cell-attached patch from cells transfected with a single cDNA encoding β<sub>AncS</sub>.

For β<sub>AncS</sub>, single-channel bursts were heterogeneous, displaying at least three distinct kinetic behaviours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In some cases, the kinetic behaviour changed within a burst, demonstrating that the different kinetics were possible within the same channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; boxed). This heterogeneity was also reflected in apparent open and closed duration histograms, with each displaying a minimum of three exponential components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The increased number of exponential components indicated additional open and closed states relative to β<sub>Anc</sub>, and thus that the three-state scheme used to fit β<sub>Anc</sub> was insufficient to describe the spontaneous activity of β<sub>AncS</sub>. To account for the additional states, we expanded our original scheme to include two additional ‘priming’ steps, where openings could occur from one of three primed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This scheme, with multiple priming steps, builds directly upon the one used to fit muscle-type AChRs that had been engineered to open spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>). Given the heterogeneity of the β<sub>AncS</sub> single-channel activity, and the complexity of this scheme, we caution against over interpretation of the inferred rates. Nevertheless, we note that in accord with the muscle-type AChR, the equilibrium gating constants appear to increase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; compare <italic>Θ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>Θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>Θ</italic><sub>3</sub>), and thus the open states become more and more favoured, for each successive priming step. In any case, the fits suggest that a scheme of this form, with multiple stages of priming, is adequate to describe the complex spontaneous single-channel activity of β<sub>AncS</sub> homomers.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Single-channel kinetics of spontaneously opening β<sub>AncS</sub> homomers.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>+1</sub>′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Θ</italic><sub>1</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>+2</sub>′′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>′′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>α</italic><sub>2</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Θ</italic><sub>2</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>+3</sub>′′′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>k</italic><sub>-3</sub>′′′</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>β</italic><sub>3</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>α</italic><sub>3</sub></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Θ</italic><sub>3</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">β<sub>AncS</sub><break/>(<italic>3 pat</italic>.)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">2000<break/>(80)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">2500<break/>(140)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">11,500<break/>(450)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">17,000<break/>(800)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">0.676</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">13,650<break/>(400)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">14,800<break/>(2000)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">175,000<break/>(17,000)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">6800<break/>(1400)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">25.74</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">2000<break/>(300)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">5000<break/>(450)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">40,000<break/>(1550)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">500<break/>(15)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom" rowspan="2">80</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Note: Rate constants were estimated from fitting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S5">Scheme 5</xref> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (and below).

The heterogeneity in single-channel activity was only evident upon modification of our original transfection protocol. Specifically, when the total amount of transfected AChR subunit cDNA was reduced ~sixfold, a second class of single-channel openings with increased amplitude and a different kinetic signature was observed. Evidently, β<sub>Anc</sub> can both incorporate into heteropentameric AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>), and self-associate to form homopentameric β<sub>Anc</sub> channels. Reducing the overall expression of AChR subunits was sufficient to tip the balance between the incorporation of β<sub>Anc</sub> into hetero- versus homopentamers, and thus unmask this previously unobserved ability of β<sub>Anc</sub> to form homomeric channels.</p><p>At first glance, the ability of β<sub>Anc</sub> to form homopentamers is unexpected. Modern-day muscle-type β-subunits do not appear to form homopentamers, and instead appear fully entrenched within heteropentameric muscle-type AChRs. Since reconstruction of β<sub>Anc</sub> was informed almost exclusively by modern muscle-type β-subunits, there was no reason to expect that β<sub>Anc</sub> would behave differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinston et al., 2017</xref>). However, as mentioned previously, β<sub>Anc</sub> can replace both the human muscle-type β- and δ-subunits in hybrid ancestral/human AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emlaw et al., 2021</xref>). For this to be possible the principal (+) and complementary (−) subunit interfaces of β<sub>Anc</sub> must be compatible with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), leading to the logical hypothesis, confirmed here, that β<sub>Anc</sub> can form homopentamers. From an evolutionary perspective, this ability to revert the muscle-type β-subunit, which is entrenched in a heteropentamer, back to a subunit capable of forming homopentamers, attests to the presumed homopentameric origins of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortells and Lunt, 1995</xref>).</p><p>We have also shown that β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers open spontaneously. This is surprising. What is even more surprising is that the spontaneous single-channel activity of β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers resembles that of the agonist-activated muscle-type AChR. Some of the first single-channel recordings of frog AChRs activated by agonists revealed that agonist-activated openings occur in quick succession, as bursts of activity originating from the same channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakmann et al., 1980</xref>). The main effect of increasing the concentration of agonist was to increase the open probability within bursts, with saturating concentrations of full agonists, such as acetylcholine, leading to bursts where the open probability exceeded 0.90 (i.e. the channel was open for more than 90% of the duration of the burst). Spontaneous openings of β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers also occur in bursts, and despite the absence of agonist, activation appears efficient, with the probability of being open within a burst also exceeding 0.90. The kinetic structure of bursts of spontaneous β<sub>Anc</sub> openings also resembles that of the agonist-activated AChR, with bursts containing several types of closings, the briefest of which are reminiscent of classic ‘<italic>nachschlag</italic> shuttings’. This is significant because it was originally proposed that the duration of <italic>nachschlag</italic> shuttings was related to agonist efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colquhoun and Sakmann, 1981</xref>). However, subsequent work showed that <italic>nachschlag</italic> shuttings were independent of agonist, which necessitated the introduction of an additional closed state appended to the agonist-activated open state in early schemes of AChR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sine and Steinbach, 1986</xref>). This latter finding was some of the impetus for refined schemes, where the additional closed states preceded channel opening and were referred to as ‘flipped’ or ‘primed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>). Our kinetic analysis has shown that the spontaneous activity of β<sub>Anc</sub> fits an analogous scheme, containing an intermediate closed state that also precedes channel opening, but where the agonist binding steps have been omitted due to the absence of agonist. Evidently, these functional hallmarks of AChR activation do not arise from the complex heteropentameric architecture of the muscle-type receptor, nor do they depend upon the presence of agonist. Instead, they are fundamental properties preserved and encoded in the reconstructed ancestral amino acid sequence of β<sub>Anc</sub> (and β<sub>AncS</sub>).</p><p>Relative to the human β-subunit, which does not form spontaneously opening homopentamers, β<sub>Anc</sub> contains 125 individual substitutions and 7 deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prinston et al., 2017</xref>). These 132 amino acid differences are scattered throughout the entire β-subunit, and presumably not all of them are required for β<sub>Anc</sub> to form spontaneously opening homopentamers. Thus, although the differences in amino acid sequence between β<sub>Anc</sub> and the human β-subunit are <italic>sufficient</italic> to convert the human β-subunit into a subunit capable of (1) forming homopentamers and (2) spontaneously opening, the large number of residues involved, as well as their delocalised nature, obscures the subset of residues strictly <italic>necessary</italic> for either (or both) functions. Nevertheless, several of the residues substituted between the human β-subunit and β<sub>Anc</sub> align with known determinants of homomeric assembly and spontaneous activity in various pLGICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the human wild-type and β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing AChRs, β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers exhibit increased single-channel amplitude and thus conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This increased conductance can be explained by amino acid differences in the second transmembrane segment (i.e. M2) of each subunit, which is one of the more conserved regions across all pLGICs. M2 lines the channel pore at its narrowest constriction and is a well-known determinant of single-channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imoto et al., 1986</xref>). With exception of the 2′ and 6′ positions, M2 is conserved between β<sub>Anc</sub> and the human β-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emlaw et al., 2020</xref>). However, to reconcile the differences in conductance, it is important to consider the M2 segments of not just the β-subunits, but all the subunits that make up the various channels. Owing to the symmetric (homopentamers) or pseudosymmetric (heteropentamers) architecture of pLGICs, analogous M2 residues from each subunit occupy similar positions in the pore, forming concentric rings of amino acids. Several of these rings influence conductance, with the –4′, –1′, 2′, and 20′ positions being particularly important, and referred to as the ‘cytoplasmic’, ‘intermediate’, ‘central’, and ‘extracellular’ rings, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imoto et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imoto et al., 1988</xref>). In β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers, with five identical β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits, the amino acids contributed from individual subunits are identical. This is significant because β<sub>Anc</sub> contains acidic residues at the –4′ (Asp), –1′ (Glu), and 20′ (Asp) positions, meaning that all 15 residues forming these three decisive rings are acidic, effectively maximising their negative potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). In heteropentamers, such as human wild-type and β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing AChRs, the residues contributed by individual subunits are in some cases different, with polar/neutral (Gln) and basic (Lys) residues contributed by the ε- and δ-subunits, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Substitution of neutral or basic residues into any of these three rings has been shown to reduce conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imoto et al., 1988</xref>). Thus, unlike for β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers that have higher conductance, the negative potential of these rings is not maximised in human wild-type and β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing heteropentamers.</p><p>Based upon the rates of open-channel block by acetylcholine and the well-known open-channel blocker, QX-222, the structure of the open pore in β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers and the wild-type AChR appear to be similar. Nevertheless, kinetic fitting revealed that compared to wild-type, β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers exhibit an almost twofold reduced affinity for QX-222. While we have employed the simplest model for open-channel block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neher and Steinbach, 1978</xref>), which neglects potential increased complexity at higher QX-222 concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neher, 1983</xref>), the simplest interpretation is that, like conductance, this reduced apparent affinity can be explained by amino acid differences in M2. Specifically, the 6′ and 10′ sites are known determinants of QX-222 block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charnet et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leonard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pascual and Karlin, 1998</xref>), with a more polar environment at 6′, and a less polar environment at 10′, favouring interaction with QX-222 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charnet et al., 1990</xref>). In the wild-type AChR, the polarity of the 6′ ring is limited by a hydrophobic phenylalanine residue contributed by the human β-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). In β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers, the 6′ ring does not contain this phenylalanine residue and is instead composed of five polar serine residues, predicting an increased affinity for QX-222. Conversely, the 10′ ring in β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers contains five threonine residues making it more polar, and thus a less favourable environment for QX-222, than in the wild-type AChR, which contains two nonpolar alanine residues (from the δ- and ε-subunits) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Evidently, the energetic contributions of these two rings to QX-222 blockage balance out such that β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers exhibit only a slightly reduced apparent affinity for QX-222 compared to the wild-type AChR.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses of pLGICs suggests that present-day heteropentameric subunits, such as those entrenched in the muscle-type AChR, evolved from ancestral subunits capable of self-associating to form homopentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaiteh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Novère and Changeux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortells, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortells and Lunt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedersen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsunoyama and Gojobori, 1998</xref>). Within this framework, strictly entrenched subunits have lost compatibility between their (+) and (–) interfaces, and thus the ability to self-associate. This is significant because the pentameric architecture of pLGICs places a constraint upon when the ability to self-associate became dispensable, and thus when strict subunit entrenchment could have evolved. For the simplest heteropentamers, made up of two types of subunits, at least one of the subunit types will have to occupy a minimum of three positions within the pentamer. In these cases, two copies of the same subunit must sit next to each other, and thus retain the ability to self-associate. Indeed, in neuronal α4β2 heteropentameric AChRs, both the α4- and β2-subunits have retained the ability to self-associate and form α4–α4 or β2–β2 interfaces, meaning that in principle, a variety of subunit stoichiometries and arrangements are possible. While additional factors such as subunit packing, relative expression, trafficking and assembly, and the presence of cellular chaperones provide additional constraints that limit the stoichiometries and arrangements observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mazzaferro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moroni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Son et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>), the requirement for self-association must remain for at least one of the subunit types. Thus, while the ability to self-associate is not sufficient to permit all possible heteropentameric stoichiometries and arrangements, it is necessary.</p><p>Unlike neuronal heteropentameric channels, such as α4β2 above, whose subunit stoichiometries and arrangements exhibit a degree of plasticity, the subunits in the muscle-type AChR are strictly entrenched. In this case, the definition of <italic>strict</italic> entrenchment neglects the γ- for ε-subunit swap that occurs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishina et al., 1986</xref>), because it occurs at the same location within the heteropentamer, and thus does not alter the stoichiometry and arrangement of the α-, β-, or δ-subunits. The above structural considerations imply that such strict entrenchment should only be expected in heteropentamers composed of three or more subunit types, and where each of the subunits has also lost the ability to self-associate. Muscle-type AChRs fulfill both criteria, in that they are made up of four types of subunits that are each incapable of self-associating and forming homopentamers. The finding that reconstructed ancestral β-subunits retain the ability to self-associate and form homomers, suggests that, unlike their extant human and <italic>Torpedo</italic> counterparts, the ancestral β-subunits were not strictly entrenched, and that their entrenchment occurred in parallel lineages after the last common ancestor shared by humans and Torpediniformes (i.e. Gnathostomata).</p><p>A degree of uncertainty is inherent in the reconstruction of any ancestral protein, and to solidify evolutionary conclusions it is important to assess whether the functions of putative ancestors are robust to these uncertainties. We have shown that an alternate ancestral β-subunit (β<sub>AncS</sub>), with 67 substitutions and 6 indels relative to β<sub>Anc</sub>, was still able to form homomers that opened spontaneously. Furthermore, spontaneous openings of β<sub>AncS</sub> homomers also occurred in bursts that contained brief closings (i.e. ‘<italic>nachschlag</italic> shuttings’) and had an open probability that exceeded 0.90. These findings demonstrate that the ability of β<sub>Anc</sub> to form spontaneously opening homomers is robust to substantial variations in the inferred ancestral β-subunit amino acid sequence. Thus, the capacity of these reconstructed ancestral β-subunits to form spontaneously opening homomers is deeply embedded in their structure and evolutionary history.</p><p>The kinetic behaviour of β<sub>AncS</sub> homomers was more complex than originally observed with β<sub>Anc</sub>. This increased complexity necessitated the expansion of the original scheme used to fit β<sub>Anc</sub> to include two additional priming steps. Both the original β<sub>Anc</sub> and expanded β<sub>AncS</sub> schemes parallel the scheme used to describe the muscle-type AChR, which included two priming steps (i.e. ‘singly’ and ‘doubly’ primed) that each correlated with conformational changes around the two agonist-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>). In the case of β<sub>AncS</sub>, which lacks agonist-binding sites, the simplest interpretation is that the different levels of priming correlate with conformational changes occurring within individual subunits. Although the states in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S5">Scheme 5</xref> are labelled as ‘singly’, ‘doubly’, and ‘triply’ primed, the three priming steps could represent the three most terminal priming steps, where (assuming that β<sub>AncS</sub> also forms homopentamers) three, four, or five β<sub>AncS</sub> subunits are primed. Within this framework, openings from β<sub>AncS</sub> channels with zero, one, or two primed subunits are presumably unstable, and thus not observed in our single-channel recordings. In an alternate scenario, ‘singly’ and ‘doubly’ primed could refer to β<sub>AncS</sub> channels with one or two primed subunits, respectively. While ‘triply’ primed could refer to channels with three or more primed subunits, but where openings from β<sub>AncS</sub> channels with three, four, or five primed subunits are indistinguishable. Applied to β<sub>Anc</sub>, these interpretations suggest that either (1) openings from only the terminal priming step, where all five β<sub>Anc</sub> subunits are primed, are stable enough to be observed in β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers, or (2) openings can occur with fewer than five primed subunits, but these openings are kinetically indistinguishable. Regardless of the interpretation, priming is an important step in the activation of both β<sub>AncS</sub> and β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers.</p><p>Modern mechanisms of AChR activation include intermediate closed states, which place the roots of agonism at a stage in the activation process that precedes channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukhtasimova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>). A consequence of these mechanisms is that the ultimate opening and closing rates of the channel are independent of agonist. Here, we have shown that additional single-channel hallmarks of AChR function are independent of agonist, as they occur in spontaneously opening homopentameric channels that are devoid of agonist-binding sites, and which are formed from reconstructed ancestral AChR β-subunits. Often overlooked, the β-subunit is the least conserved of the four AChR subunits, and is the only subunit that does not contribute residues to the two AChR agonist-binding sites. Despite these considerations, hallmarks of AChR function remain deeply embedded in β-subunit sequence, structure, and evolutionary history. Given that these functional hallmarks are independent of agonist, it is tempting to speculate that they predate agonism, and thus that agonism evolved subsequently as an additional layer of regulation in this family of pentameric ion channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BOSC 23</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL11270<break/>(discontinued)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Modified <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> embryonic kidney cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pRBG4 – AChR α1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Provided by Steven M.

The authors elegantly demonstrate that ancestral AChR β subunits can form homomeric channels that share important functional hallmarks with their modern cousins, including unliganded gating. The work provides an intriguing framework to evaluate the evolution of the broader family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76504.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Pless</surname><given-names>Stephan A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035b05819</institution-id><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Silvilotti</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Wayland WL</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.12.475990">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.12.475990v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lucia Silvilotti (Reviewer #2); Wayland WL Cheng (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers agree that no additional experiments are necessary, they would like the authors to carefully address all of the comments brought up in their respective reviews. Particular attention should be paid to the following aspects:</p><p>1) The work could be improved by providing additional mechanistic insight and discussion, specifically into the basis of homomeric assembly and unliganded gating in the ancestral channels. Please add a careful analysis and/or discussion regarding the sequence/structure of these ancestral proteins that may explain homomeric assembly and spontaneous opening. This could be aided by e.g. the literature on gain-of-function mutations and subunit assembly etc.</p><p>2) To make the manuscript accessible to a broad readership, please ensure that the main research question in clearly communicated throughout the manuscript, and include a clearer discussion and explanation of the potential evolutionary implications. Please see &quot;Public review&quot; by reviewer #1 and final comment by reviewer #2 in &quot;Recommendations for the authors&quot; for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The scientific questions asked by this study, and thus what we should take from this study, are not entirely clear, perhaps because the work emerged from a surprising finding in a closer examination of their earlier work. If the question is &quot;did ancestral homo-pentamers evolve into α homo-pentamers and β homopentamers that then gave rise to obligate α/β heteropentamers?&quot;, the results would be interesting but require some analysis of amino acid sequences, both regarding receptor assembly and channel gating: this would be aided by a wealth of such analyses on acetylcholine receptors available in the literature. If the question is &quot;did intermediate gating steps evolve before or after agonist binding?&quot; then I don't think this has been adequately addressed, as β subunits, shown here to contain the intermediate steps but lack the requirement for agonist binding, evolved (1)long after agonist binding had emerged and (2) long after after acetylcholine receptors had diverged from other (homomeric) pLGICs that show similar intermediate steps.</p><p>Lines 201-209</p><p>It sounds reasonable/consistent with other work that increasing concentrations of acetylcholine would block the channel. But perhaps this interpretation deserves more detailed explanation, because I do not see how exactly the data in Figure 4 are consistent with the effects of channel block on dwell time histograms in Ref. 25. There is also a decrease in apparent current amplitude in the presence of QX-222, consistent with the blocker terminating the current before reaching its proper value (ref. 25) which I don't see for current in the presence of ACh. And while I understand that block by ACh might occur at lower concentrations than activation (or desensitization) by ACh, does block occur at concentrations as low as 10 μM? The analysis in Figure 4 (schemes) and table S2 seems to show that block is indeed similar for both ACh and QX-222, but I think the paragraph in question could be spelled out a little, given the focus of this paper on the activation mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The electrophysiology and its analysis is of high quality and supports well the conclusions. I would just like perhaps a bit more discussion of some points.</p><p>The discussion of why the conductance of the homomeric β receptors is higher than that of the heteromeric nAChR is quite short, it just says that it is to do with M2.

In page 17 lines 329-331, they state that the results for β-Anc and β-AncS show that the functional hallmarks of flipped/primed states in the AchR do not arise from heteropentameric architecture or the presence of agonist. While this is a reasonable statement, the results from this study are not the only evidence to support these claims. There is evidence for primed states in other homopentameric ligand-gated ion channels, and in muscle-type acetylcholine receptor mutants that exhibit unliganded activity (reference 24 and other studies).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76504.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers agree that no additional experiments are necessary, they would like the authors to carefully address all of the comments brought up in their respective reviews.

We also point out that the heterogeneity in our single-channel recordings was not present in earlier, published, recordings, and only became evident upon modification of our transfection protocol aimed at reducing the overall expression of β<sub>Anc</sub>-containing AChRs to facilitate kinetic analysis. Thus, this work does not stem from “a surprising finding in a <italic>closer examination</italic> of their (our) earlier work”, but instead from new single-channel data exhibiting heterogeneity that was not present in our previous work.</p><p>We agree that the present work does not uncover the complete and complex evolutionary history of α- and β-subunits, as well as the rise of α/β (and other) heteropentamers. We have now added explicit discussion of what we think the potential evolutionary implications of our findings are (lines 360-395).</p><p>We also agree that our findings do not uncover whether “intermediate gating steps evolve(d) before or after agonist binding”. Our findings demonstrate (as have others; see PMID: 19339970) that intermediate gating steps occur in the absence of agonist. In our case we also show, for the first time, that intermediate gating steps occur in a channel that is devoid (presumably) of agonist-binding sites (i.e. β<sub>Anc</sub> homomers).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 201-209</p><p>It sounds reasonable/consistent with other work that increasing concentrations of acetylcholine would block the channel.

In our revised document we correct this and provide several, more appropriate, references to support the statement that the observed “single-channel behaviour is a hallmark of open-channel block”.</p><p>The reviewer mentions that “there is also a decrease in apparent current amplitude in the presence of QX-222”. Motivated by this comment we have examined this apparent effect in detail, and while we agree that the individual burst originally shown in Figure 4B (at 60 μM QX-222) has a visibly lower amplitude, the effect is not robust across 30 bursts (from three recordings), as well as additional recordings made at –70 mV (not shown). Given this, and Neher’s 1983 work on QX-222 block of frog endplate AChRs (PMID: 6310093), where he showed that the “amplitude of the individual current pulses was not changed by the presence of the drug up to a concentration of 250 μM” we cannot make the case that this is a legitimate phenomenon for either adult human wild-type AChRs or β<sub>Anc</sub> homopentamers. For these reasons, we have refrained from discussing this potential effect of the blocker. In addition, to avoid leading the reader to a similar conclusion as the reviewer, we have replaced the original burst in question in Figure 4B with a burst that has an amplitude more representative of the mean amplitude for this condition (from 30 bursts from a total of three recordings).</p><p>Finally, as requested by the reviewer we have expanded our explanation of how block is similar for both ACh and QX-222 in the wild-type AChR and β<sub>Anc</sub> homomers in both the Results (lines 170-175) and Discussion sections (lines 340-359).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The electrophysiology and its analysis is of high quality and supports well the conclusions.

Our revised manuscript now contains extensive discussion, and an additional Appendix figure (Appendix 1–figure 2), detailing why the conductance of β<sub>Anc</sub> homomers is higher than that of the heteromeric AChR (lines 313-413), as well as why block is similar between the two types of channels (lines 340-359).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why do these channels open spontaneously? Is there any obvious gain-of-function &quot;mutation&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important question. At present it is unclear why these channels open spontaneously. We now explicitly mention in the main text that pinpointing the residue (or set of residues) necessary is not trivial (lines 376-386), and identifying these residues is beyond the scope of the present work. Nevertheless, to facilitate preliminary hypotheses, our revised manuscript now contains a multiple sequence alignment highlighting positions that differ between β<sub>Anc</sub> (or β<sub>AncS</sub>) and the human β-subunit, and that have also been shown to lead to spontaneous activity in other pLGICs (see Appendix 1–figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I accept that the evolutionary questions (last sentence of the public review) are very hard/impossible to answer, but a clearer discussion and explanation of these issues would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>At the request of the reviewer, we have added two paragraphs to the Discussion section explaining potential evolutionary implications (lines 360-395).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors may consider adding the following to their discussion.
