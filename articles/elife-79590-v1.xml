Existence of functional Notch signaling in enucleate platelets remains elusive.</p> <p><bold>Methods:</bold> Transcripts/peptides of Notch1 and Delta-like ligand (DLL)-4 were detected in platelets isolated from human blood by RT-qPCR, Western analysis and flow cytometry. Platelet aggregation, granule secretion and platelet-leucocyte interaction were analyzed by lumi-aggregometry and flow cytometry. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles were documented with Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer. Platelet thrombus on immobilized collagen was quantified using microfluidics platform. Intracellular calcium was monitored by fluorescence spectrophotometry. Whole blood coagulation was studied by thromboelastography. Ferric chloride-induced mouse mesenteric arteriolar thrombosis was imaged by intravital microscopy.</p> <p><bold>Results:</bold> We demonstrate expression of Notch1, its ligand DLL-4 and their respective transcripts in human platelets. Synthesis and surface translocation of Notch1 and DLL-4 were upregulated by thrombin. DLL-4, in turn, instigated neighbouring platelets to switch to 'activated' phenotype through cleavage of Notch receptor and release of its intracellular domain (NICD), which was averted by inhibition of γ-secretase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of Notch signaling, too, restrained agonist-induced platelet activation, and significantly impaired arterial thrombosis in mice. Strikingly, prevention of DLL-4-Notch1 interaction by a blocking antibody abolished platelet aggregation and extracellular vesicle shedding induced by thrombin.</p> <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study presents compelling evidence in support of non-canonical juxtacrine Notch signaling within platelet aggregates that synergizes with physiological agonists to generate occlusive intramural thrombi. Thus, Notch pathway can be a potential anti-platelet/anti-thrombotic therapeutic target.</p> <p><bold>Funding:</bold> Research was supported by grants received by DD from JC Bose Fellowship (JCB/2017/000029), ICMR (71/4/2018-BMS/CAR), DBT (BT/PR-20645/BRB/10/1541/2016) and SERB (EMR/2015/000583).
