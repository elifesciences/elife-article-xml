In rat axons, mitochondria respond to glucose levels by halting active transport in high glucose regions. We employ quantitative modeling to explore physical limits on spatial organization of mitochondria and localized metabolic enhancement through regulated stopping of processive motion. We delineate the role of key parameters, including cellular glucose uptake and consumption rates, that are expected to modulate mitochondrial distribution and metabolic response in spatially varying glucose conditions. Our estimates indicate that physiological brain glucose levels fall within the limited range necessary for metabolic enhancement. Hence mitochondrial localization is shown to be a plausible regulatory mechanism for neuronal metabolic flexibility in the presence of spatially heterogeneous glucose, as may occur in long processes of projection neurons. These findings provide a framework for the control of cellular bioenergetics through organelle trafficking.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40986.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are equipped with power factories called mitochondria that turn nutrients into chemical energy to fuel processes in the cell.

A number of quantitative studies have focused on metabolic control through modulating reactant and enzyme concentrations and turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grima and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amar et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies generally neglect the spatial organization of metabolic components within the cell. By localizing specific enzymes in regions of high metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laughton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zecchin et al., 2015</xref>), as well as clustering together consecutively acting enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>), cells have the potential to substantially enhance their metabolism.</p><p>Spatial organization is particularly critical in highly extended cells, such as mammalian neurons, whose axons can grow to lengths on the meter scale. Metabolic demand in neurons is spatially and temporally heterogeneous, with especially rapid ATP turnover found in the presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>), and ATP requirements peaking during synaptic activity and neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shulman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weisová et al., 2009</xref>). Neurons rely primarily on glucose as the energy source for meeting these metabolic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peppiatt and Attwell, 2004</xref>). Due to the long lengths of neural processes, the glucose supply can vary substantially over different regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weisová et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2012</xref>). In myelinated neurons, for instance, it has been speculated that glucose transport into the cell is localized primarily to narrow regions around the nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris and Attwell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenbluth, 2009</xref>), which can be spaced hundreds of microns apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ibrahim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butt et al., 1998</xref>). Glucose transporters in neurons have also been shown to dynamically mobilize to active synapses, providing a source of intracellular glucose heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashrafi et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, varying levels of activity in the mammalian brain may lead to varying extracellular glucose levels, resulting in spatially heterogeneous nutrient access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 1979</xref>). Individual axons have been shown to span across multiple regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>), enabling them to encounter regions with different glucose concentrations.</p><p>Most ATP production in neurons occurs within mitochondria: motile organelles that range from interconnected networks to individual globular structures that extend throughout the cell. As energy powerhouses and metabolic signaling centers of the cell, mitochondria are critical for neuronal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>). Their spatial organization within the neuron plays a pivotal role in growth and cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Defects in mitochondrial transport are involved in the pathologies of several neurological disorders such as peripheral neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baloh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baloh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have shown that mitochondria are localized preferentially to regions of high metabolic demand, such as the synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Reynolds, 2006</xref>). Such localization can occur via several molecular mechanisms, mediated by the Miro-Milton mitochondrial motor adaptor complex that links mitochondria to the molecular motors responsible for transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mishra and Chan, 2016</xref>). Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at active synapses lead to loading of calcium binding sites on Miro, releasing mitochondria from the microtubule and thereby halting transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macaskill et al., 2009</xref>). High glucose levels can also lead to stalling, through the glycosylation of motor adaptor protein Milton by the glucose-activated enzyme <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pekkurnaz et al., 2014</xref>). This mechanism has been shown to lead to mitochondrial accumulation at glucose-rich regions in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pekkurnaz et al., 2014</xref>). It is postulated to regulate mitochondrial spatial distribution, allowing efficient metabolic response to heterogeneous glucose availability.</p><p>Mitochondrial positioning relies on an interplay between heterogeneously distributed diffusive signaling molecules (such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glucose), their consumption through metabolic and other pathways, and their effect on motor transport kinetics. While the biochemical mechanisms and physiological consequences of mitochondrial localization have been a topic of much interest in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacAskill and Kittler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mishra and Chan, 2016</xref>), no quantitative framework for this phenomenon has yet been developed.</p><p>In this work we focus on glucose-mediated regulation of mitochondrial transport, developing quantitative models to examine the consequences of this phenomenon for metabolism under spatially varying glucose conditions. Our approach relies on a reaction-diffusion formalism, which describes the behavior of species subject to both consumption and diffusion. Reaction-diffusion systems have been applied to describe the spatial organization of a broad array of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kondo and Miura, 2010</xref>), ranging from protein oscillations in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howard et al., 2001</xref>), to coordination of mitotic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>), to pattern formation in developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunow et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gregor et al., 2005</xref>). The response of actively moving particles to spatially heterogeneous, diffusive regulators has also been extensively investigated in the context of chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Haastert and Devreotes, 2004</xref>). In contrast to most chemotactic cells, however, mitochondria have no currently known mechanism for directly sensing glucose gradients. Instead, they are expected to accumulate in response to local glucose concentration only. Our goal is to delineate the regimes in which such a crude form of chemotaxis can lead to substantial spatial organization and enhancement of metabolism.</p><p>Specifically, we model the modulation of mitochondrial density with glucose concentration in a tubular axonal region, focusing on two forms of spatial heterogeneity. In one case, we consider an axonal domain between two localized regions of glucose entry, representing the internodal region between nodes of Ranvier in myelinated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The second case focuses on an unmyelinated cellular region with continuous glucose permeability, embedded in an external glucose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In both cases, we show that mitochondrial accumulation and enhanced metabolic flux is expected to occur over a limited range of glucose concentrations, which overlaps with physiological brain glucose levels. Our simplified quantitative model allows identification of a handful of key parameters that govern the extent to which glucose-mediated mitochondrial halting can modulate metabolism. We establish the region of parameter space where this mechanism has a substantial effect, and highlight its potential importance in neuronal metabolic flexibility and ability to respond to spatially varying glucose.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40986.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of a simplified model for glucose-mediated mitochondrial transport regulation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Myelinated axonal region, with glucose entry localized at the nodes of Ranvier.

This situation arises in myelinated neurons, which have glucose transporters enriched at the nodes of Ranvier, leading to highly localized sources of glucose spaced hundreds of micrometers apart within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saab et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal glucose transporters are known to be bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>), allowing glucose concentration within the cell to equilibrate with external glucose. For simplicity, we assume rapid transport of glucose through these transporters, so that the internal concentration of glucose at the nodes where transporters are present is assumed to be fixed. The cellular region between two glucose sources is modeled as a one-dimensional interval of length <italic>L</italic> with glucose concentration fixed to a value <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> at the interval boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

For simplicity, we assume the mitochondria are equally likely to move in the positive (+) or negative (-) direction each time they initiate a processive walk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>It has recently been demonstrated that the key motor adaptor protein (Milton) is sensitive to glucose levels, halting mitochondrial motility when it is modified through O-GlcNAcylation by the OGT enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pekkurnaz et al., 2014</xref>). Our model employs a highly simplified description of mitochondrial dynamics, which assumes that all pauses are associated with such an O-GlcNAcylation event. Recovery from the pause at the constant rate <italic>k<sub>w</sub></italic> corresponds to removal of the modification through the activity of the complementary enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Although there is evidence indicating long-term glucose deprivation can reduce OGA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zou et al., 2012</xref>), for simplicity we assume in our model that OGA activity is independent of glucose levels. In vivo axonal mitochondria have been observed to undergo short-lived sporadic pausing while continuing to move processively in their previous anterograde or retrograde direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>). Such pauses are subsumed into an effective processive velocity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in our model. Other sources of pausing, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated motor disengagement, PINK1/Parkin-mediated detachment of motors, and anchoring to the microtubules by syntaphilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwarz, 2013</xref>), are not considered here in order to focus specifically on the effect of glucose-dependent mitochondrial spatial organization.</p><p>Upon entry into the cell, the first rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism is its conversion into glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase. Further downstream metabolic pathways split, with much of the flux going to glycolysis while a small fraction is funneled into the pentose phosphate pathway and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). The HBP produces UDP-GlcNAc, the sugar substrate for O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 2011</xref>). In our model, we assume that the rate of UDP-GlcNAc production equals the rate of glucose conversion by hexokinase, scaled by the fraction of G6P that is channeled into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This assumption is valid if, at each point of pathway branching, the Michaelis-Menten saturation constants for the two branches are similar. This in fact appears to be the case for both the branching of the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis from the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway which is the focus of this work (see Appendix 2). Consequently, saturation of the initial glucose conversion step will imply saturation of the entire hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. We therefore model the kinetics of Milton modification using the same Michaelis-Menten form as for hexokinase activity, with the pathway flux leading to Milton modification subsumed within a rate constant for mitochondrial stopping (<italic>k<sub>s</sub></italic>).</p><p>We note that the subcellular organization of the intermediates in the conversion from glucose into O-GlcNAcylated Milton is largely unknown. In our model, we make the extreme case assumption that all intermediates are localized to mitochondria, with only the initial glucose substrate capable of diffusing through the cytoplasm. We note that cytoplasmic diffusion of any of the pathway intermediates would attenuate the effect on mitochondrial localization. Our simplified model thus gives an upper limit on the extent to which mitochondria can localize at high glucose regions through the Milton modification mechanism. Following these simplified assumptions, we treat the kinetics of mitochondrial halting as dependent only on the local glucose concentration, according to the functional form<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the Michaelis-Menten constant of hexokinase.</p><p>We proceed to evolve the simulation forward in time, with glucose consumption localized to regions within <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of each discrete mitochondrial position (details in Materials and methods).

The drop-off in enhancement at low values of the internal glucose concentration (low <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf123"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) is due to the coupling between glucose levels and mitochondrial localization. Specifically, mitochondrial accumulation at the region subject to high glucose concentration increases the local rate of consumption in that region, driving down local internal glucose levels. Consequently, the difference in internal glucose concentrations between the two ends of the cell is decreased when internal levels fall substantially below <italic><sub>M</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), reducing the enhancement of metabolic flux. Although mitochondrial accumulation decreases metabolic flux in the low glucose region, the total rate of glucose consumption integrated throughout the cell is enhanced by up to approximately 14% when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf124"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the typical physiological range of external glucose levels spans the narrow band of parameter space where metabolic enhancement is expected (white lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref>). These results implicate glucose-dependent mitochondrial stopping as a quantitatively plausible mechanism of metabolic flexibility, increasing metabolism in regions with high nutrient availability for axonal projections that span between hypoglycemic and euglycemic regions. The magnitude of this effect can be tightly controlled by the cell through modulating overall rates of glucose entry and consumption. Thus, by coupling mitochondrial transport to local glucose levels, whole-cell changes in hexokinase or glucose transporter recruitment can be harnessed to tune the cell’s response to spatially heterogeneous glucose concentrations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The minimal model described here provides a quantitative framework to explore the interdependence of glucose levels and mitochondrial motility and their combined effect on neuronal metabolic flux. Glucose-mediated halting of mitochondrial transport is shown to be a plausible regulatory mechanism for enhancing metabolism in cases with spatially heterogeneous glucose availability in the neuron.</p><p>We have quantitatively delineated the regions in parameter space where such a mechanism can have a substantial effect on mitochondrial localization and metabolic flux. Specifically, mitochondrial positioning requires both sufficient spatial variation in intracellular glucose and sufficiently low absolute glucose levels compared to the saturation constant of the hexokinase enzyme. In the case of tightly localized glucose entry (as at the nodes of Ranvier), intracellular spatial heterogeneity requires a small value of the dimensionless length scale for glucose decay (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf125"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>≪</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). For physiologically estimated values, mitochondrial localization to the nodes is expected to occur for glucose levels below approximately 2 mM, comparable to physiological brain glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McNay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">John et al., 2008</xref>). In the case where glucose can enter homogeneously throughout the cell surface (as with unmyelinated axons), heterogeneity can arise from an external glucose gradient.

Other regulatory pathways that determine mitochondrial positioning are not included in this basal model. In particular, we do not consider here calcium-based transport regulation, which is known to localize mitochondria to regions of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacAskill and Kittler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macaskill et al., 2009</xref>). Upregulating OGT signaling in cultured cells has been shown to decrease the fraction of motile mitochondria by a factor of three, while reducing endogenous OGT nearly doubles the motile fraction, indicating that a substantial number of stationary mitochondria are stopped as a result of OGT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pekkurnaz et al., 2014</xref>). Our model assumes the extreme case where all stopping events are triggered in a glucose-dependent manner, thereby isolating the effect of glucose heterogeneity. Stopping mechanisms dependent on neuronal firing activity could alter mitochondrial distribution in concert with glucose-dependent halting, increasing the density of mitochondria at presynaptic boutons or near areas of localized calcium influx as at the nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We note that mitochondria have previously been shown to accumulate at spinal nodes of Ranvier in response to neuronal firing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabricius et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanism described here provides an additional driving force for mitochondrial localization near the nodes even in quiescent neurons.</p><p>Additional metabolic feedback loops, not included in our model, may result in a more complex dependence of mitochondrial stopping on glucose concentration. In particular, both the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis generate intermediates that feed back into UDP-GlcNAc production by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kruger and von Schaewen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shirato et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, several of the enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways linking glucose levels to Milton O-GlcNacylation may be regulated in a glucose-dependent manner. For example, the activity of the fructose-6-phosphate metabolizing enzyme GFAT is believed to be regulated by intermediates in the hexosamine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Traxinger and Marshall, 1991</xref>) and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) itself is directly regulated by UDP-GlcNAc levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2007</xref>). Other enzymes, such as the de-GlcNAcylating enzyme OGA exhibit long term regulation of expression in response to altered glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zou et al., 2012</xref>). These regulatory mechanisms provide additional potential routes of metabolic control through mitochondrial positioning.</p><p>Several key parameters that regulate mitochondrial localization in response to glucose heterogeneity can be dynamically regulated in neurons. Specifically, the rate of glucose consumption (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf127"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) can be tuned by modulating the concentration or activity of hexokinase within mitochondria or by altering total mitochondrial size and number. This parameter controls both the glucose decay length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf128"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> in the case of localized glucose influx and the ratio of glucose entry to consumption <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf129"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in the case of spatially distributed entry. We note that our model assumes hexokinase to be localized exclusively to mitochondria. The predominant form of hexokinase in the brain (HK1) is known to bind reversibly to the mitochondrial membrane, with exchange between a mitochondria-bound and a cytoplasmic state believed to contribute to the regulation of its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golestani et al., 2007</xref>). Release of hexokinase into the cytoplasm would result in more spatially uniform glucose consumption, negating the metabolic enhancement achieved through mitochondrial localization.</p><p>An additional parameter known to be under regulatory control is the rate of glucose entry into the neuron (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf130"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). The glucose transporters GLUT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simpson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duelli and Kuschinsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weisová et al., 2009</xref>) and GLUT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashrafi et al., 2017</xref>) have been shown to be recruited to the plasma membrane in response to neuronal firing activity. Interestingly, transporter densities are themselves spatially heterogeneous, concentrating near regions of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashrafi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashrafi and Ryan, 2017</xref>). The model described in this work quantifies the extent to which a locally increased glucose influx can enhance total metabolic flux, given the ability of mitochondria to accumulate at regions of high intracellular glucose.</p><p>A number of possible feedback pathways linking glucose distribution and mitochondrial positioning are not included in our basic model. For instance, hexokinase release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (potentially altering <italic>k<sub>g</sub></italic>) is known to be triggered at least in part by glucose-6-phosphate, the first byproduct in glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crane and Sols, 1954</xref>). Chronic hypoglycemia has been linked to an upregulation in GLUT3 in rat neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uehara et al., 1997</xref>), which would in turn lead to an increased glucose uptake (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf131"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). The fraction of glucose funneled into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (incorporated within <italic>k<sub>s</sub></italic>) can also be modified through feedback inhibition of GFAT by the downstream metabolic product UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Such feedback loops imply that several of our model parameters (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf132"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>k<sub>g</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>s</sub></italic>) are themselves glucose-dependent and may become spatially non-uniform in response to heterogeneous glucose. Incorporating these effects into a spatially resolved model of metabolism would require quantifying the dynamics of both the feedback pathways and mitochondrial positioning, and forms a promising avenue for future study.</p><p>Control of glucose entry and consumption underlies cellular metabolic flexiblity, and defects in the associated regulatory pathways can have grave consequences for neuronal health. Misregulation of hexokinase has been highlighted as a contributor to several neurological disorders, ranging from depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Regenold et al., 2012</xref>) to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). Neuronal glucose transporter deficiency has been linked to autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>) and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, defects in mitochondrial transport, with the consequent depletion of mitochondria in distal axonal regions, contribute to peripheral neuropathy disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baloh, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Glucose-dependent mitochondrial localization provides an additional layer of control, beyond conventionally studied regulatory mechanisms, which allows the cell to respond to spatial heterogeneity in glucose concentration.

In our simplified quantitative model, we assume that all pauses are associated with an O-GlcNAcylation event. Recovery from the pause at the constant rate k<sub>w</sub> represents the removal of the modification of Milton through the activity of the complementary enzyme O-GlcNAcase. We have added a paragraph to our manuscript more thoroughly explaining the rationale behind our simplified model for mitochondrial dynamics, quoted below:</p><p>“It has recently been demonstrated that the key motor adaptor protein (Milton) is sensitive to glucose levels, halting mitochondrial motility when it is modified through OGlcNAcylation by the OGT enzyme [Pekkurnaz et al., 2014]. […] Other sources of pausing, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated motor disengagement, PINK1/Parkin-mediated detachment of motors, and anchoring to the microtubules by syntaphilin [Schwarz, 2013], are not considered here in order to focus specifically on the effect of glucose-dependent mitochondrial spatial organization.”</p><p>Furthermore, we include an additional paragraph in the Discussion pointing out simplifications in this model that ignore potential glucose-dependent regulation of other steps in the metabolic pathway connecting glucose and mitochondrial stopping:</p><p>“Additional metabolic feedback loops, not included in our model, may result in a more complex dependence of mitochondrial stopping on glucose concentration. […] These regulatory mechanisms provide additional potential routes of metabolic control through mitochondrial positioning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also only consider two possible fates of Glucose 6P (glycolysis and the hexosamine pathway). The pentose phosphate pathway is another possible shunt that should probably at the very least be discussed or its omission justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission. We have now included the metabolic branch for the pentose phosphate pathway in our schematic in Figure 1C. We note that pathway branches where the saturation constants are similar to the corresponding step in the HBP, will not affect the overall kinetics in our model, except by changing the fraction of glucose that flows down the HBP pathway. This fraction is subsumed in the effective pausing rate k<sub>s</sub>. We have modified the relevant paragraph in the model development section to address this issue:</p><p>“Upon entry into the cell, the first rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism is its conversion into glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase. […] We therefore model the kinetics of Milton modification using the same Michaelis-Menten form as for hexokinase activity, with the pathway flux leading to Milton modification subsumed within a rate constant for mitochondrial stopping (k<sub>s</sub>).”</p><p>We also include a detailed justification of using the same saturation constant K<sub>M</sub> for both glucose consumption and O-GlcNAcylation of Milton in Appendix 2. A schematic with appropriate citations has been added to Appendix 2, listing the saturation constants of both the pentose phosphate and glycolysis branching pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A forward Euler scheme was used to solve the reaction-diffusion Equation 1.

However, such methods can be used for simple systems, provided a sufficiently small time-step is used to assure convergence (smaller than the fastest time-scale in the system, including the scale set by the spatial discretization). We know convergence is achieved in our model because the magnitude of the time derivative goes to zero as the simulation approaches steady state. To clarify this issue, we have added additional description of our choice of timestep and convergence criteria in the Materials and methods section, under “Discrete mitochondria simulations”:</p><p>“Because forward Euler methods have stringent conditions for stability and convergence, we use a time-step that is much smaller than both the glucose decay time-scale and the time-scale associated with diffusion over our spatially discretized grid (see below).”</p><p>“We integrate the simulation forward in time-steps of δt=0.2∆x2D, where ∆x is the spatial discretization. This time-scale is much smaller than the relevant decay time for glucose consumption τg=kgM-KM-1. Using these small time-steps allows for stability and robust convergence with the forward Euler method.”</p><p>In the section titled “Numerical solution for steady-state distributions with localized glucose entry” we note the convergence criterion for the continuum model: “The distributions are assumed to be converged once the root mean squared rate of glucose change drops below the minimal cutoff: 10<sup>−6</sup><italic>k<sub>g</sub>M</italic>.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
