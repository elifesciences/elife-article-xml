Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific Rela-Stat3 network as a promising therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IBD</kwd><kwd>Rela</kwd><kwd>Stat3</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>Liver</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studies in murine model identify hepatic Rela-Stat3 network as a potential driver of gut inflammation and a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease, offering new insights into liver-gut crosstalk.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Under physiological conditions, the liver is continuously exposed to gut-derived antigens, which are either derived from the food we consume or are the product of microbial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tripathi et al., 2018</xref>). The continuous interaction of extraneous antigens with the liver tissue makes it a tolerogenic organ, thereby justifying its unique anatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horst et al., 2016</xref>). However, during intestinal inflammation or dysbiosis, as seen in conditions like IBD, there is an unregulated exchange of molecules across the gut vascular barrier, this potentially rewires the local as well as hepatic immunological and metabolic milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2023</xref>). Over the last decade, several studies have focussed on analyzing the mechanistic aspects of gut-liver crosstalk, which intend to develop successful multi-organ therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tilg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kessoku et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, IBD overlaps with hepatobiliary conditions, it has been reported that 30% of IBD cases have abnormal liver function tests and around 5% of them even develop chronic hepatobiliary diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cappello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaspar et al., 2021</xref>). During colitis, the first responders to extraneous agents incoming from the leaky gut are the Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamada et al., 2003</xref>). These cells have been shown to switch from a pro to an anti-inflammatory state in response to signals received from the colitogenic gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taniki et al., 2018</xref>). Besides kuffer cells, the parenchymal cells, hepatocytes which occupy ~80% of the liver, also respond to these varied danger signals. Hepatocytes have a robust secretary machinery and are known to secrete a variety of factors like the complement proteins, clotting factors, hepatokines, bile acids, etc. which regulate local as well as distant organ functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Among the secreted factors, albumin is the most abundantly produced serum protein, which is implicated in the maintenance of redox balance and is known to attenuate DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2021b</xref>). Highlighting the importance of liver secretome, a recent study suggests that FNDC4 has the potential to reduce colonic inflammation by acting on the colonic macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosma et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, bile acids are also known to play a pivotal role in regulating mucosal immune responses. Primary bile acids produced by the liver are often related to an enhanced proinflammatory state and its turnover to secondary bile acids is considered to be a critical step in the maintenance of homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). The primary bile acids have been reported to accumulate in the inflamed colon, suggesting some intriguing crosstalk between the gut and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is obscure, how the liver perceives signals due to the disease-mediated impaired gut barrier to rewire secretory machinery and tackle the enhanced endotoxins influx.</p><p>Through this study, we propose Rela and Stat3 as key responders of inflammatory signaling in the liver tissue in response to intestinal aberrations. We further define a colitis resistance model based on the liver-specific knockout animals and propose a Rela/Stat3-CYP enzyme-mediated elevation of primary bile acid leading to immune-mediated damage to the gut. Briefly, this study establishes the functional significance of hepatic Rela and Stat3 in intestinal inflammation and emphasizes the therapeutic importance of targeting multiorgan crosstalk in inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engagement of hepatic Rela and/or Stat3 pathways in murine colitis model</title><p>Several studies have shown that the gut-liver bidirectional communication is critical in both the establishment and progression of IBD. Towards identifying liver pathways that affect intestinal impairment during IBD, we firstl examined whether 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute experimental colitis results in changes in liver pathophysiology. Analysis of biochemical parameters on day 6 of DSS treatment showed no significant alterations in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Furthermore, histological studies of these treated liver tissues from C57BL/6 mice showed neither morphological differences nor any hepatocellular fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Thus, in general, the liver functionalities are maintained and no major damage in the liver tissue occurs in the colitogenic mice model. We then performed global transcriptomic studies of the liver tissue from day 6 colitogenic mice. Unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data by principal component analysis (PCA) segregated the treated and control samples on PC1 with a variance of 53% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Immunological and metabolic pathways appeared to be enriched in the list of regulated pathways. LPS-mediated signaling in the liver was identified as among the key differentially expressed systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is proposed that microbial components, including LPS from the gut, can reach the liver through portal blood, activating the hepatic immune response during colitis-mediated barrier impairment. Interestingly, Rela and Stat3 are two important transcription factors activated by the microbial LPS and these two pathways frequently converge to elicit protective responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahyi et al., 2013</xref>). Further analysis of the transcript abundance of Rela, Stat3, and other downstream genes reflected higher transcript abundance in the DSS-treated group as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Functional activation of Rela and Stat3 pathways requires phosphorylation of key residues, which we investigated in the liver sections of DSS-treated mice. Immunostaining studies showed an enhanced signal intensity of p-Rela (Ser536), p-Stat3 (Ser727), and p-Stat3 (Tyr705) in the treated liver sections, as compared to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Initiation of colitis in mice leads to hepatic Rela and Stat3 activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GO pathway enrichment analysis was done for DEGs with adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 on day 6 post DSS treatment.

The RelA phosphorylation at Ser536 peaks at day 2 (about eightfold increase) following which a two to threefold increase was sustained till day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The Stat3 phosphorylation at Ser727 increases gradually from day 2 (eightfold) to day 6 (17-fold). Tyrosine phosphorylation, on the other hand, is transient and can be detected at day 4 (ninefold) post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>Antibiotic-induced gut microbiome depletion has been frequently used to study gut microbiome roles in pathological conditions. Altered microbiota is also likely to modulate endotoxin influx. We, therefore, examined hepatic Rela/Stat3 activation after subjecting mice to oral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (Amplicin, Neomycin, Metronidazole and Vancomycin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernández-Chirlaque et al., 2016</xref>). Substantial decrease in bacterial load after 4 weeks was confirmed microbiologically. We induced colitis in mice with 2% DSS treatment along with antibiotic administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Previous data indicates that pStat3 (Ser727) is the most prominent marker that gets highly activated 6 days post DSS-treatment. Time course activation studies had indicated pStat3 (Ser727) as the most prominent marker to be activated 6 days post DSS-treatment; we examined the levels through western blotting. A marked reduction in pStat3 (Ser727) levels post-antibiotic treatment in the colitogenic wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>) could be noted, suggesting that optimal endotoxin flux may be a major driver of hepatic Rela/Stat3 signaling. Although it is important to note that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion alters metabolic homeostasis by affecting gut signaling and colonic metabolism, in turn altering hepatic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zarrinpar et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hepatocyte-specific functions of Rela and Stat3 exacerbate experimental colitis</title><p>In order to discern the importance of transcriptional networks regulated by Rela and Stat3 we utilized a hepatocyte-specific knockout model. The Cre recombinase under albumin promoter drives the deletion of Rela and/or Stat3 in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

Previous studies suggest development of colitis in acute models is accompanied by shortening of the colon length, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding which is measured as the disease activity index (DAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chassaing et al., 2014</xref>). Time course measurement of DAI in the wild-type showed an expected increase from day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Chronic intestinal inflammation remodels the permeability barrier resulting in leakage of microbial components, including LPS, through the portal circulation thereby engaging extraintestinal organs such as the liver. The conventional treatment regimen for IBD involves aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and anti-TNF agents to counter bowel inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gómez-Gómez et al., 2015</xref>). Systemic effects are only addressed upon worsening of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Veloso, 2011</xref>). To improve the clinical management of IBD, there is a need to identify targets and mechanisms that can concurrently address other associated causes. In this study, we reveal the surprising role of hepatic Rela-Stat3 in regulating the biosynthesis of primary bile acids, whose activation augments intestinal inflammation.</p><p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), one of the key components of microbial products, is known to induce inflammasome assembly by NF-κB/Lipocalin2-dependent axis in macrophages of colitogenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, LPS-mediated non-canonical Stat3 activation through TLR4 ligand reprograms metabolic and inflammatory pathways in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balic et al., 2020</xref>). In the acute DSS-induced colitis model, the release of LPS and other endotoxins would first activate kupffer cells of the liver, which then progressively triggers a response in relatively quiescent hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taniki et al., 2018</xref>). We argued that Stat3-NF-κB signaling may be of specific significance since these pathways in hepatocytes are known to control the secretion of hepatic factors. We indeed observed activation of the canonical arm of the NF-κB signaling pathway with RelA phosphorylation at Ser536 residue following DSS treatment. Interestingly, non-canonical Stat3 activation was detected with Ser727 phosphorylation preceding the phosphorylation of canonical Tyr705 residue. To understand the significance of these signaling pathways of hepatocytes in the context of disease outcomes and its functional consequence in disease management, we subjected the single and double hepatocyte-specific knockout mice to DSS treatment. Surprisingly, the <italic>Rela</italic>Δhep<italic>Stat3</italic>Δhep mice had attenuated disease activity index as well as diminished inflammatory response in the gut. Previous studies wherein attenuation of the colitogenic phenotype has been reported are for the gut-resident cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chawla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weisser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bessman et al., 2020</xref>). This study is amongst the first such, where ablation of genes in a distal organ - the liver - ameliorates colitis.</p><p>We then investigated the mechanisms underlying signaling networks in the liver that promote the colitis phenotype. Previously, hepatic Rela and Stat3 have been reported to act cooperatively to render protection against pulmonary infection, by eliciting an acute phase response, which enhances the pulmonary immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quinton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilliard et al., 2015</xref>). We observe similar hepatic functions of Rela and Stat3 that amplify the immune response during experimental colitis, aggravating intestinal pathologies. Our unbiased transcriptome analysis of the liver genes revealed several metabolic and immune pathways to be altered in colitogenic mice. Amongst these, the biosynthesis of primary BAs prompted our immediate attention. The primary bile acids are known to have inflammatory activity and the cardinal paradigm in IBD is the decreased levels of secondary bile acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2021a</xref>). This has been attributed to the altered gut microflora that are known to convert primary BAs into secondary BAs. It is important to note that most of these studies are carried out with fecal samples and a recent study that profiled the human intestinal environment under physiological conditions concluded that stool-based measurements do not reflect the true composition of BAs along the intestinal tracts. Intestinal samples were dominated by primary BAs, whereas stool samples were dominated by secondary BAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shalon et al., 2023</xref>). We, therefore, measured the intestinal BAs in IBD subjects by using mucosal biopsies and observed elevated levels of primary BAs in the IBD subjects as compared to non-IBD subjects.</p><p>Analysis of colitogenic mice intestinal samples also revealed enhanced primary BAs using mass spectrometry-based measurements. We observe both CDCA and CA accumulate in the intestine and liver of colitogenic wild-type mice when compared to knockout littermates. This accumulation of primary BA in both the intestine and liver is likely to be a consequence of increased biosynthesis in the liver and subsequent transport to the gut. Indeed, multiple primary bile synthesis pathway genes namely <italic>Cyp7a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp27a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp7b1</italic>, and <italic>Cyp8b1</italic> were substantially upregulated in the liver. Our observation is contradictory to the recently published work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gui et al., 2023</xref> which suggests that during IBD there is a downregulation of the biosynthesis machinery leading to reduced bile levels. Currently, we assume that these differences may arise due to the dose of DSS, the time course of the experiment, and the mice strain adapted for different studies leading to the difference in the transcriptional and metabolic landscape during IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gui et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Conventionally the cyp450 enzymes involved in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway are known to be regulated by the FXR signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eloranta and Kullak-Ublick, 2008</xref>). Our data suggest that RelA and Stat3 transcriptionally control these pathways under stress conditions. These two transcription factors have been known to collaborate in a variety of physiological and disease settings. Further studies would elucidate a mechanistic understanding of how these hepatocyte-specific transcriptional regulatory circuitry drives hepatic bile synthesis during gastrointestinal abnormalities. Mutant mice showed refractory behavior towards colitogensis, where mere supplementation of CDCA resulted in exacerbated colitis phenotype in the gut. Previous studies of increased CA have been attributed to colitis and CA was shown to limit the self-renewal capacity of intestinal stem cells leading to impaired intestinal restitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). We now propose that increased synthesis and secretion of the primary bile acids orchestrates intestinal inflammation. It is increasingly important to understand how bile acid signaling networks are affected in distinct organs where the bile acid composition differs, and how these networks impact intestinal diseases. Our studies identify a new, important Rela-Stat3 network system of hepatocytes that could enable the development of therapeutics that target BA imbalance by suppressing host-specific stress-induced pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model depicting the immuno-metabolic network linking the inflammation-induced hepatic signaling pathway to intestinal pathologies in mice.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93273-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Until now, only immunosuppressive agents and immunomodulators have been conventionally considered as therapeutic measures to manage IBD. However, with increasing research on the role of hepatic bile acid metabolism during experimental colitis, its potential cannot be undermined in the clinical setting. The potential of bile acids as a therapeutic target has been harnessed in the past; bile acid sequestrants have been utilized as a treatment for hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camilleri and Gores, 2015</xref>). Remedies like fecal microbial transplantation, which serve to normalize the bile acid ratios in the gut, have emerged as potential therapeutics in the last decade for IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paramsothy et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinha et al., 2020</xref>). However, the potential of altering hepatic bile metabolism has remained unexplored for IBD, possibly due to a lack of mechanistic insight. Towards this, our work demonstrates the pro-inflammatory potential of CDCA during colitis following the activation of the Rela/Stat3 pathway. The suppression of Rela/Stat3-induced CDCA could provide beneficial effects in IBD patients while protecting the basal bile acid levels (through FXR signaling). Thus our studies identify a hepatocyte-specific Rela/Stat3 network as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal diseases. Another approach could be the use of bile acid sequestrants, which will temporarily decrease the levels of primary bile acids in the colon until the proinflammatory pathways are dampened as a combinatorial therapy alongside existing treatments.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th

Subsequently, body weight and disease activity were assessed for 6 days from the onset of DSS treatment. All experiments were performed using littermate mice cohoused for a week prior to the initiation of the experiments. The disease activity index was estimated based on stool consistency and rectal bleeding. The score was assigned as follows – 0 points were given for well-formed pellets, 1 point for pasty and semi-formed stool, 2 points for liquid stool, 3 points for bloody smear along with stool, and 4 points were assigned for bloody fluid/mortality. Mice with more than 30% loss of body weight were considered moribund, and euthanized. For specific experiments, mice were euthanized at the indicated days post-onset of DSS treatment, and colon tissues were collected.</p><p>10 mg/kg body weight of chenodeoxycholic acid dissolved in DMSO was injected via intraperitoneal route into mice as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histopathological studies</title><p>At day 6 of DSS treatment, mice with the indicated genotypes were euthanized, and the entire colon was excised.

However, with increasing research on the role of hepatic bile acid metabolism during experimental colitis, its potential cannot be undermined in the clinical setting. The potential of bile acids as a therapeutic target has been harnessed in the past; bile acid sequestrants have been utilized as a treatment for hyperlipidemia 46. Remedies like fecal microbial transplantation, which serve to normalize the bile acid ratios in the gut, are emerging as potential therapeutics in the last decade for IBD 47, 40. However, the potential of altering hepatic bile metabolism has remained unexplored for IBD, possibly due to a lack of mechanistic insight. Towards this, our work demonstrates the pro-inflammatory potential of CDCA during colitis following the activation of the Rela/Stat3 pathway. The suppression of Rela/Stat3-induced CDCA could provide beneficial effects in IBD patients while protecting the basal bile acid levels (through FXR signaling). Thus our studies identify a hepatocyte-specific rela/stat3 network as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal diseases. Another approach could be the use of bile acid sequestrants, which will temporarily decrease the levels of primary bile acids in the colon until the proinflammatory pathways are dampened as a combinatorial therapy alongside existing treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor:</p><p>Fig. 4C should be Fig. 4D and vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>Our reply: We have swapped Fig. 4C and Fig. 4D and corresponding changes have been incorporated in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please make note of the following specific comments</p><p>The immunostainings for phosphorylated p-Rela and STAT3 are unclear.
