Although exercise is effective in treating sarcopenia it is not always a viable option clinically, and currently, there are no pharmacological therapeutic interventions for sarcopenia. Here, we show that chronic treatment with pan-adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon improved muscle function in male mice by a mechanism linked to skeletal muscle metabolism and tissue remodeling. In aged mice, 6 weeks of AdipoRon treatment improved skeletal muscle functional measures in vivo and ex vivo. Improvements were linked to changes in fiber type, including an enrichment of oxidative fibers, and an increase in mitochondrial activity. In young mice, 6 weeks of AdipoRon treatment improved contractile force and activated the energy-sensing kinase AMPK and the mitochondrial regulator PGC-1a (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator one alpha). In cultured cells, the AdipoRon induced stimulation of AMPK and PGC-1a was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential, reorganization of mitochondrial architecture, increased respiration, and increased ATP production. Furthermore, the ability of AdipoRon to stimulate AMPK and PGC1a was conserved in nonhuman primate cultured cells. These data show that AdipoRon is an effective agent for the prevention of sarcopenia in mice and indicate that its effects translate to primates, suggesting it may also be a suitable therapeutic for sarcopenia in clinical application.</p></abstract><kwd-group

in skeletal muscle mass that is accompanied by reduced muscle strength and reduced physical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruz-Jentoft and Sayer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heymsfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santilli et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of skeletal muscle function significantly increases the risk for impaired mobility, falls, fractures, and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angulo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landi et al., 2013</xref>). Sarcopenia also has significant metabolic consequences; in humans, skeletal muscle is the largest insulin-sensitive tissue in the body and its loss during aging dramatically increases the risk for sarcopenic obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cleasby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Srikanthan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stenholm et al., 2008</xref>). Exercise is the only known intervention to prevent sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joseph et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mcleod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rebelo-Marques et al., 2018</xref>); however, mobility disability and polymorbidity can prevent its effectiveness as a means to counter skeletal muscle functional loss. Pharmacological therapeutic interventions to treat or prevent sarcopenia would be a considerable clinical advance but none have yet been identified.</p><p>Skeletal muscle composition is matched to function such that the muscles required for posture are not equivalent to those engaged in physical activity. Contractile content includes individual muscle fibers with differing force and endurance properties and differing metabolic fuel preference. Skeletal muscle also includes non-contractile components, including satellite cells and stromal-derived stem cells, vascular tissues, adipose, and extracellular matrix. With increasing age, muscle fibers undergo atrophy, and the levels of fibrosis and intra-muscular fat increase within and around the fiber bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akazawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brioche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lees et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahdy, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGregor et al., 2014</xref>). Sarcopenia is associated with loss of mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Picca et al., 2019</xref>), although in a variety of species from rodents to nonhuman primates and humans, it is the more oxidative fibers that are resilient to age-related atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crupi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lexell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murgia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh et al., 2013</xref>). At the cellular level, aging is associated with fatty acid oxidation insufficiency and the accumulation of intracellular lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koves et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, our previous work in nonhuman primates show that age-related changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism, cellular redox, and lipid storage anticipate the onset of sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh et al., 2013</xref>), and occur in advance of physical activity decline and frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that changes in energy metabolism could be a contributing factor to age-related loss in muscle mass and function, and point to interventions that correct metabolic deficiency as potential agents for the treatment of sarcopenia.</p><p>Adiponectin is an adipose-derived peptide hormone that influences skeletal muscle cellular metabolism to activate lipid utilization and mitochondrial oxidative pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shetty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stern et al., 2016</xref>). Adiponectin signaling is transmitted via the ubiquitously expressed <italic>Adipor1</italic> and <italic>Adipor2</italic> receptors, with a poorly defined contribution from the T-cadherin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker-Duffen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaguchi et al., 2007</xref>). A major effector protein in adiponectin receptor activation in skeletal muscle is the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwabu et al., 2010</xref>), a critical cellular energetic sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkewitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardie et al., 2012</xref>). The actions of adiponectin somewhat resemble those of exercise: first, the adaptive response to exercise involves activation of metabolism in skeletal muscle and requires AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fentz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee-Young et al., 2009</xref>), and second, adiponectin and exercise share effectors downstream of AMPK including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1a), a key regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2019a</xref>) and a major player in the beneficial effects of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantó and Auwerx, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Short et al., 2003</xref>). In fact, genetic approaches to increase expression of PGC-1a in skeletal muscle specifically enhance endurance and protect against muscle aging in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gill et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Adipor1</italic> knockout studies reveal that adiponectin signaling is required for maintenance of skeletal muscle oxidative fibers in vivo and for exercise capacity, with both AMPK and PGC-1a implicated in its actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwabu et al., 2010</xref>). AdipoRon is a small-molecule adiponectin receptor agonist, and treatment with AdipoRon corrects metabolic dysfunction in genetically obese and metabolically dysfunctional db/db mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okada-Iwabu et al., 2013</xref>). Although AdipoRon has been shown to impact gene expression in skeletal muscle in short-term treatment of young mice, the ability of the drug to impact skeletal muscle in older mice is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AdipoRon improves skeletal function and indices of insulin sensitivity in aged mice</title><p>To assess the ability of AdipoRon to influence skeletal muscle aging, AdipoRon (1.2 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) were administered intravenously to 25-month-old C57BL/6J male mice three times per week for 6 weeks. AdipoRon treatment resulted in a decline in body weight in aged animals, which did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Body composition analysis revealed significant loss in fat mass in AdipoRon treated animals, although there was no difference in lean mass compared to Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). AdipoRon treated animals had significantly lower fasting glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and a trend toward decreased fasting insulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In line with these findings, the HOMA-IR index of insulin resistance was significantly lower in AdipoRon treated animals. Circulating levels of triglycerides were not different between Control and AdipoRon treated animals. In metabolic chamber assessments, food consumption, spontaneous activity, energy expenditure (EE), or respiratory exchange ratio (RER) did not differ significantly between Control and AdipoRon treated animals over a 24-hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–S1</xref>). Parsing these data into smaller increments revealed differences in EE and RER at discrete time points only (t-test; unadjusted p&lt;0.05). In gastrocnemius, a mixed fiber muscle in the lower leg with Type II fibers predominating, PGC-1a protein levels were higher from AdipoRon treated mice than from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that activation of PGC-1a could be mediating the effects of AdipoRon in aged mice. Levels of VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel), an index of mitochondrial content, were not different between control and AdipoRon treated mice, indicating that mitochondrial biogenesis was not induced by AdipoRon in gastrocnemius.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic and functional effects of chronic AdipoRon treatment in aged mice.</title><p>Chronic AdipoRon treatment (1.2 mg/kg BW, intravenous injection three times per week for 6 weeks) in aged male C57BL/6J mice (25 months old).

Ex vivo contractility measurements in extensor digitorum longus (EDL, predominantly glycolytic) and soleus (predominantly oxidative) muscles were performed to determine the effects of AdipoRon treatment on whole muscle contractile behavior. Muscle maximal specific force generation and fatigability are known to be dependent on the type and quantity of expression of myosin heavy chains isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geiger et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this, the decline of tetanic force after initial simulation (fatigue) observed in Type II fiber-enriched EDL was greater than that of Type I enriched soleus muscle in untreated aged mice. Force generation after repeated tetanus stimulation was significantly greater in the EDL from AdipoRon treated animals compared to controls, signifying a greater resistance to fatigue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Electrical stimulation-induced force generation after a 20-min recovery period was also significantly higher, indicative of greater muscle endurance following AdipoRon treatment. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of AdipoRon on fatigability were detected in EDL but not soleus muscle that had numerically greater values for both parameters at baseline compared to EDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These data suggest that oxidative muscles (soleus) are less sensitive to AdipoRon treatment compared to muscles with more reliance on glycolytic metabolism (EDL).

These data demonstrate that the molecular response to AdipoRon is conserved among cell types, although there is cell type specificity in the expression of adiponectin receptors and in the sensitivity of response through AMPK signaling and activation of PGC-1a transcriptional co-activation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>AdipoRon activates AMPK, increases the expression of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>, and activates PGC-1a gene targets in diverse cultured cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-PCR detection of adiponectin receptors in NIH-3T3 fibroblast, day 7 differentiated C2C12 myotubes, and rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n=7, 7, and 4, respectively), (<bold>B</bold>) phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 after AdipoRon treatment (10 or 50 µm) for 10 min (n=3 per group) in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, (<bold>C</bold>) transcript levels of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and its gene targets after 90 min of AdipoRon treatment (10 or 50 µm, n=4–5 per group, relative to <italic>Rn18s</italic> RNA), (<bold>D</bold>) phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 after AdipoRon treatment for 10 min in day 7 differentiated myotubes (n=3 per group), (<bold>E</bold>) transcript levels of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and its gene targets after 90 min of AdipoRon treatment (10 or 50 µm, n=7 per group, relative to <italic>Rn18s</italic> RNA), (<bold>F</bold>) mitochondrial membrane potential measured by TMRE assay at 2 and 4 hr of AdipoRon treatment (n=7 per group), (<bold>G</bold>) RT-PCR detection of myosin isoforms relative to <italic>Rn18s</italic> in day 7 differentiated myotubes, (<bold>H</bold>) phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 after AdipoRon treatment (10 or 50 µm) for 10 min in cultured rhesus monkey PBMCs (n=3–4 per group), and (<bold>I</bold>) transcript levels of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and PGC1a gene targets after 60 min of AdipoRon treatment (n=3–4 per group).

In vivo and ex vivo, functional assessments of skeletal muscle revealed that 6 weeks of AdipoRon treatment improved skeletal muscle function in aged mice. Interestingly, the effect was muscle type specific, where AdipoRon impacted functional, metabolic, and gene expression outcomes in <italic>predominantly</italic> glycolytic muscles (EDL and gastrocnemius) but not in <italic>predominantly</italic> oxidative soleus muscle. Skeletal muscle is known for its heterogeneous population of muscle fibers, each with distinct structural, biochemical, and metabolic properties. Studies in humans and nonhuman primates have previously demonstrated that there is a selective decrease in fiber size and mitochondrial activity of Type II fibers with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murgia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh et al., 2013</xref>). AdipoRon treatment increased mitochondrial activity in a fiber-type-specific manner in the gastrocnemius muscle of aged mice and resulted in an increase in the number of Type IIa fibers. Given the narrow time frame of the intervention and prior links between PGC-1a expression and fiber type switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2002</xref>), it seems more likely that AdipoRon remodels existing fibers rather recruiting new fibers from the satellite pool. In situ histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity combined with fiber typing in muscle cryosections allowed us to investigate the structural and metabolic effects of AdipoRon based on fiber types. One of the striking findings of our study is that AdipoRon distinctively augmented mitochondrial metabolism in Type IIb fibers in aged mice. At the whole tissue level, this effect translated to increases in the force of contractility and endurance in the EDL, a glycolytic muscle that is rich in Type IIb fibers but not in the soleus muscle that is rich in Type I fibers.</p><p>Consistent with previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okada-Iwabu et al., 2013</xref>), AdipoRon had a positive impact on glucoregulatory function in aged mice. In young, fit mice, the effects of AdipoRon at the cellular level were conserved but the systemic glucoregulatory and functional outcomes were not. It seems likely that AdipoRon may not be effective to stimulate muscle function outside of an existing age-related, genetic, or diet-induced decline. Experiments in isolated muscle preparations may shed light on the tissue autonomous versus systemic effects of AdipoRon on skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly in the context of aging. In our study, the beneficial impact of AdipoRon treatment in skeletal muscle was mechanistically linked with PGC1a activation. Previous studies on muscle-specific overexpression of PGC1a have reported similar findings; however, in some genetic models, whole-body insulin sensitivity was adversely affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Our results show that AdipoRon treatment resulted in increase in the expression of endogenous <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> mRNA with concomitant modest but significant increases in PGC-1a protein levels. These data suggest that the activation of regulatory pathways upstream of PGC-1a may be key to exerting beneficial effects beyond skeletal muscle energetics, although we cannot rule out systemic effects of AdipoRon to alter metabolism in other tissues playing a role in glucoregulatory outcomes.</p><p>A decline in muscle energy metabolism precedes the onset of sarcopenia in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh et al., 2013</xref>), a finding that promoted this study of AdipoRon as a potential therapeutic agent. Our data show not only the activation of AMPK and of PGC-1a, but also reveal functional metabolic changes in response to AdipoRon treatment, in tissues as described above but also in cultured cells. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular respiration, proliferation, and mitochondrial architecture were all impacted by AdipoRon. AMPK plays a central role in adaptive energetics and connects with other pathways regulating growth, including mTOR and insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). A broader investigation not limited to factors directly implicated in adiponectin receptor signaling could be fruitful and may reveal further connectivity among growth and energetic pathways.</p><p>Prior studies in renal endothelial cells report lipid remodeling subsequent to adiponectin receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if the changes in mitochondrial function reported here extend to lipid metabolism and the composition of lipid structures including droplets, organelle membranes, and plasma membrane. Genetic studies of modest PGC-1a overexpression in preadipocytes identified similar changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration that were coincident with greater capacity for lipid fuel utilization, changes in lipid handling, lipid storage, and membrane lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 2019b</xref>). Anti-inflammatory actions of AdipoRon could also exert beneficial muscle outcomes as recently reported in a genetic mice model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and warrants investigation in our aging study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Samra et al., 2020</xref>). The impact of AdipoRon on differentiated C2C12 cells was similar but not equivalent to the response in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. AMPK activating phosphorylation was increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was elevated, and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> expression was increased; however, activation of gene targets of PGC-1a was not the same between the two cell types. Differences in relative levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 may account for cell type specificity in AdipoRon’s actions. Furthermore, the expression of myosin isoforms is linked to metabolic status in muscles. It will be interesting to understand the expression of myosin isoforms among the individual myotubes, how that relates to cellular metabolism, and if that might account for differences in the ability of AdipoRon to influence gene targets of PGC-1a. In nonhuman primate PBMCs, AdipoRon is equally potent in activating AMPK and PGC1a indicating that AdipoRon’s ability to stimulate the AMPK/PGC-1a axis may be translatable to nonhuman primates and perhaps humans. In addition, activation of adiponectin signaling has implications for aging and longevity as it shares signaling mechanisms involving AMPK and PGC1a with a known anti-aging intervention, calorie restriction (CR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2017</xref>). CR is associated with higher circulating adiponectin, especially the high molecular weight (HMW) isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), which is the most potent in insulin sensitization.</p><p>Although these findings are promising, there are important caveats. The first is that the data shown here were generated in male mice only. Sex dimorphism is increasingly a focus in aging studies and across biomedical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sampathkumar et al., 2020</xref>). Our ongoing studies in mice and in nonhuman primates point to sex dimorphism in skeletal muscle mass and function, the impact of age on both parameters, and in the molecular and cellular effects of aging and CR. It will be critical to extend these studies of AdipoRon to female mice to determine its potential as an intervention to prevent and treat sarcopenia in both sexes. Additional studies translating the work to nonhuman primates, including both male and female monkeys, would set the stage for clinical investigations. The second limitation is that for logistical reasons, the genetic background of the young and old cohorts of mice was not the same in this study. It is possible that differences in underlying genetics contributed to differences in the outcome of AdipoRon treatment; however, a more likely explanation is that young mice are refractory to enhancement because they are already fit and healthy and the axis targeted by AdipoRon cannot be further boosted beyond this youthful setting. Finally, this study is cross-sectional, tested only one dose of AdipoRon, and investigated one time point only. A larger-scale study involving multiple time points with longitudinal measures would clarify when the optimum time for treatment occurs and would further delineate the age-related phenotypes that are responsive to stimulation of the adiponectin receptor signaling pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that AdipoRon, through its actions on mitochondrial metabolism, skeletal muscle composition, fiber fatigability and function, and physical capacity, is a promising therapeutic agent to preserve skeletal muscle function in aged populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and treatment</title><p>Two cohorts of mice were used. Six-week-old male B6C3F1 hybrid mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and 24-month-old male C57BL/6J mice from the NIA aged mouse colony. The animals were housed under controlled pathogen-free conditions. The animals were fed ad-libitum Purina LabChow 5001 diet with free access to water and placed on a 12-h light/dark cycle. AdipoRon (10 mg) (Adipogen, CA) was reconstituted with 500 µl of DMSO (stock) and stored at –20°C. For the acute experiment, the animals were given either a single intravenous dose of AdipoRon @1.2 mg/kg BW in PBS (n=5) or an equivalent volume of DMSO in PBS (n=3, Controls) in a total volume of 100 µl. EDL and soleus muscle groups were harvested after 90 min. For the chronic experiments in young B6C3F1 mice (n=12) and old C57BL/6J mice (n=20), the animals in each age group were divided into two groups and received either AdipoRon @1.2 mg/kg BW in PBS or an equivalent volume of DMSO in PBS via tail vein injections three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 6 weeks. Body weight and food intake measurements were recorded once a week. Body composition was measured at the beginning and at the end of the treatment period using EchoMRI Body Composition Analyzer (Houston, TX). Rotarod balance measures were performed on a Columbus Instruments Rotamax system. During the test, the instrument speed increased from 5 to 60 rpm over a 3-min interval. Animals were trained on the instrument 1 day prior to the test and were allowed three attempts during test. Time on the rotarod and the speed when the mice falls are recorded. At the end of the treatment period, animals were sacrificed. EDL, soleus, and gastrocnemius muscle specimens were mounted in OCT oriented to present fiber cross-section for tissue sectioning or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C.

Isolated muscles were attached to a contractile apparatus capable of measuring force (Aurora Scientific) and were electrically stimulated using parallel platinum electrodes. Maximal twitch force and tetanic force were determined by adjusting the length of the muscle until maximal twitch force is reached, defining the optimal length. A 15-min period of rest allowed muscle to equilibrate to the new environment. Fatigability was defined as the decline in tetanic force following 10 min of continuous stimulation. Muscles were tetanically stimulated at 100 Hz for 500 ms every 5 se at a voltage that generates the maximal force. Following 10 min of fatiguing stimulation, a 20-min recovery period was allowed, where there was no stimulation in an oxygenated Tyrode’s perfusion. After the recovery period, muscle was electrically stimulated again to quantify the amount of recovery force. A recovery force higher relative to fatiguing force was taken as an indication that the decline in force during fatiguing stimulation is reversible. The amount of fatigue and recovery force was represented as a percentage of the initial force (before fatiguing stimulation). Following these measurements, fatigued muscles were weighed, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Equal amounts of skeletal muscle protein extract (45 µg) were separated on Mini-Protean TGX precast protein gels (Bio-Rad, CA) and transferred to a PVDF membrane using a Trans-Blot semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John C Newman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Use an additional, more reliable potentiometric dye (e.g. TMRE) instead to validate the JC-1 findings</p><p>2) Justify the different time points or present time-course experiments for the cell culture results, possibly in a more relevant cell model. The use of 3T3 and PBMC instead of more relevant cell models</p><p>3) Better description of the sample size, especially for endpoint measurements.</p><p>Describe in more details the sample sizes for each cohort</p><p>4) Re-evaluate the claims of improved muscle function and increased lipid metabolism.</p><p>Optional – do the results hold true in the opposite sex, though I can understand if budgetary constraints prevent the authors for repeating the assays in female mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Overall this work provides a strong justification for continuing studies of AdipoRon in larger rodent experiments and in non-human primates, and provides excellent biomarker candidates for those. The underpowered mouse cohorts, though, leads to a lack of whole-animal muscle functional data. &quot;Improved skeletal muscle function&quot; and the like, used throughout, could be read to imply an improvement in relevant behavioral outcomes (e.g. rotatod, grip strength, frailty index, running speed, spontaneous activity, etc.) which are not present here. Muscle mass does not increase in the aged mice either. This is the key issue to be careful with in the presentation of the findings.</p><p>2) What were the final numbers in the aged cohorts? Methods states starting with 20 mice total, and Figure 1 legend says ending with 7-10 control and 6-8 AdipoRon. Did some mice die or were otherwise excluded? Were more of these in the AdipoRon group? One way or another, it is important to account for missing data and any signals of safety issues.</p><p>3) I appreciate the prominent mentions of the limitations of a male-only study, although an even better approach would be to validate some of the findings in a female cohort! Given the pilot-sized experiments this seems not entirely unreasonable.</p><p>4) As in the public review, why use different strains for young and old mice? I assume a practical reason (young hybrids readily available on site, old B6 available from NIA) which is understandable enough but the limitations of cross-comparing different strains at different ages should be explicitly stated.</p><p>5) As in the public review, why use NIH3T3 for in vitro pathway studies instead of a more muscle-like cell line or primary cell type? Similarly for using primate PBMCs. I didn't see confirmation that these cell types express adiponectin receptors, or other downstream components, and how similar the molecular responses are expected to be to muscle. Is there literature about PMBCs responding to adiponectin physiologically in vivo?</p><p>6) The densitometry for Pgc1a in Figure 1I does not obviously correspond to the Pgc1a band intensity, and if normalized to Ponceau (which is not stated) the Ponceau difference between groups doesn't obviously account for a 2x difference in Pgc1a/Ponceau. This is worth a double-check.</p><p>7) It is not always obvious what the reference condition is for presentation of &quot;relative mRNA&quot; and &quot;mRNA Fold change&quot; panels – one expects normalization to a comparison group mean set to 1.0 for each panel, but for most that comparison group is not clear.</p><p>8) The in vitro acute treatments included varying treatment times, which were not always specifically described for each experiment in the legend or methods.</p><p>9) The text states that food consumption was the same between groups in the aged mouse cohort, but these data do not appear to be shown. If food consumption is the same, activity is the same, and energy expenditure is the same, what explains the fat mass weight loss in the AdipoRon-treated group? Given the changes observed in fat metabolism and the loss of fat mass in old mice, why was no difference observed in RER?</p><p>10) Why are the phenotype data that were collected different between the young and aged chronic treatment cohorts (Figure 1 and 3)? E.g. no body composition measurements, insulin, HOMA-IR, metabolic cages in young mice.</p><p>11) A brief explanation of mTOR inhibition by AMPK activation (cell proliferation) could be included in the discussion of this study to further explain sarcopenia and other age-related muscle loss.</p><p>12) The explanation of the glucoregulatory function in aged mice by AdipoRon could be accompanied by the catabolic pathways triggered by AMPK activation.</p><p>13) The first two-thirds of the section titled &quot;nonhuman primate cultured cells&quot; continues to describe experiments in NIH3T3, which is confusing. The first sentence of the Figure 6 legend causes the same confusion, although the panel descriptions are clear which is which.</p><p>14) In general, I appreciate the careful language used to describe suggestive but not statistically significant results.</p><p>15) How was AdipoRon obtained? Was it donated by the company? Were there any considerations provided by the company for the study?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>With the exception of the JC-1 assays, the study appears well done, with sufficient rigor in terms of numbers of animals used per group etc. However, in addition to the well known problems with the JC-1 dye being used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, there a couple of minor quirks, which can easily be corrected.</p><p>1) On page 4, references are made to Benton and Ruas as showing PGC-1a over expression protecting against muscle aging in mice. Neither of these papers show this. Benton et al. has no aging data. Ruas also has no aging data, and is in rats, not mice. Cite the correct references, and remove these.</p><p>2) Rename the EchoMRI to &quot;body composition measures&quot;. This is super confusing to those who don't know this instrument (it is neither &quot;echo&quot; nor &quot;MRI&quot;).</p><p>3) On page 5 there is reference to EDL and soleus being glycolytic and oxidative. As the authors point out repeatedly later on, these muscle are mixed fibre types, albeit heavily glycolytic or oxidative. I think there should be consistency on this point.</p><p>Regarding JC-1, this results should be removed altogether for measuring mitochondrial membrane potential. Its problems have been documented extensively, and I'm not sure why investigators still use it. Its well known to be non specific to plasma membrane potential in addition to mitochondria, and has multiple problems with regards to specificity. The authors should revise their manuscript substantially on this point. Use of this assay spoils an otherwise good paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Page 6: &quot;Expression levels of both receptors were numerically lower in AdipoRon treated mice. In soleus muscle, AdipoR1 expression was not altered with age (Figure S2) and AdipoRon increased expression, although neither change reached significance. AdipoR2 levels declined with age in soleus of control mice, but not in mice treated with AdipoRon.&quot;</p><p>The two sentences seem to be at odds with one another. The first sentence is also not consistent with the data in figure S2.</p><p>Page 9: JC-1 measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential can give artifacts, especially when fluorescence is measured via a plate reader and not visualized via microscopy or flow cytometry. I would encourage the authors to validate their results with TMRE or TMRM staining.</p><p>Page 9: Why the different time points for measurements of cell proliferation, markers of mitochondrial function, and ATP levels (24 vs 48h vs 12h) ?</p><p>Page 11: :The inference is a shift toward fatty acid fuel utilization, aligning with prior reports of lipid remodeling outcomes reported in renal endothelial cells&quot;</p><p>I don't know whether this inference is warranted without RER measurements or at least evidence of activation of fitty acid oxidation. Indeed, the in vivo indirect calorimetry failed to show a shift towards lipid catabolism, which is at odds with this statement.</p><p>Page 12: Could you provide a justification for using only male animals and using two different strains between old and young animals?</p><p>Page 13: Please include clone or catalog number for all antibodies used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Use an additional, more reliable potentiometric dye (e.g. TMRE) instead to validate the JC-1 findings</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the experiments on mitochondrial membrane potential using the TMRE dye as suggested.

In this study AdipoRon is associated with significant protection against age-related functional loss in males, although the study is not yet complete and we expect longitudinal analysis will yield greater insight than a cross-sectional approach. We are currently assessing the tissue, cellular, and molecular effects of aging and of AdipoRon in both males and females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Overall this work provides a strong justification for continuing studies of AdipoRon in larger rodent experiments and in non-human primates, and provides excellent biomarker candidates for those.

In revising the manuscript, we have been careful to distinguish between statements of fact that those that are more interpretive or speculative. We recognize the limited set of parameters measured here, and as this reviewer will appreciate it is tricky with mice to get estimates of muscle mass in vivo – most investigations just report “lean mass” which is not muscle of course but everything that is not fat. As mentioned in our response above we have been conducting a follow-up study in mice that will allow for a more detailed investigation of the tissue, cellular, and molecular signatures of aging and of the response to AdipoRon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What were the final numbers in the aged cohorts? Methods states starting with 20 mice total, and Figure 1 legend says ending with 7-10 control and 6-8 AdipoRon. Did some mice die or were otherwise excluded? Were more of these in the AdipoRon group? One way or another, it is important to account for missing data and any signals of safety issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In the revised figures we now specify the numbers of animals/observations contributing to the data reported. We lost 2 of the AdipoRon mice but given the advanced age of the cohort this was not unexpected. We were limited to the 20 starting mice and a loss of 2 (10%) in the period from 25 to 27 months of age (the study period) is aligned with the mortality expectation for this line for which 50% mortality is around 30 months of age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I appreciate the prominent mentions of the limitations of a male-only study, although an even better approach would be to validate some of the findings in a female cohort! Given the pilot-sized experiments this seems not entirely unreasonable.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we have undertaken a follow up study and are analyzing the tissues now. The study described in this manuscript was exploratory and at the time we could only work with what was to hand. The follow up study is more comprehensive but we are eager to share our results now as we see terrific promise in the use of adiponectin receptor stimulation as a means to counter skeletal muscle aging. Our hope is that this paper will draw others to investigate metabolism as a target for delaying aging in skeletal muscle and hopefully in a shared effort we can move the field forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As in the public review, why use different strains for young and old mice? I assume a practical reason (young hybrids readily available on site, old B6 available from NIA) which is understandable enough but the limitations of cross-comparing different strains at different ages should be explicitly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We realize the importance of genetics and highlight this limitation in the revised manuscript. We would add that our follow up study in C3B6F1 hybrid mice reproduces the outcomes described here. In those mice there was very little impact of AdipoRon in young mice that were fit and healthy (6 months of age), modest differences in metabolic and functional outcomes late middle age (22 months) and significant differences at advanced age (28 months).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As in the public review, why use NIH3T3 for in vitro pathway studies instead of a more muscle-like cell line or primary cell type? Similarly for using primate PBMCs. I didn't see confirmation that these cell types express adiponectin receptors, or other downstream components, and how similar the molecular responses are expected to be to muscle. Is there literature about PMBCs responding to adiponectin physiologically in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted analysis of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression in each of the cultured cell models (NIH-3T3; C2C12; and PBMC), and these data are now shown in Figure 6. We do expect there to be cell type specificity in the outcome of AMPK/PGC-1a axis activation as this is a primary mode of action for adiponectin receptor stimulation; however, we suspect that there will be differences by cell type as far as the cellular consequence. Of relevance here, we expect differences by muscle group in the molecular consequence of AMPK/PGC-1a activation depending on fiber type distribution. Other skeletal muscle tissue resident cell types may also contribute. We know that age can impact tissue composition (fibrosis, adiposity, vascularization, infiltration of immune cells), and recognize the potential for differences in the responsiveness of various effectors both upstream and downstream in the signaling pathway. We should be able to make some headway in defining these differences in our ongoing follow up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The densitometry for Pgc1a in Figure 1I does not obviously correspond to the Pgc1a band intensity, and if normalized to Ponceau (which is not stated) the Ponceau difference between groups doesn't obviously account for a 2x difference in Pgc1a/Ponceau. This is worth a double-check.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this error, there was a mistake in the quantification that I didn’t catch and I am relieved that you spotted this so we could fix it. We now show that the enrichment of PGC-1a protein is ~1.5 fold and state that the relative density based on normalization to ponceau, now shown in revised (Figure 1). As might be expected we do have some variability among individuals but this is a common feature in aging studies, in fact we believe that increased variance is a trait of aging and are pursuing this idea in our primate studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is not always obvious what the reference condition is for presentation of &quot;relative mRNA&quot; and &quot;mRNA Fold change&quot; panels – one expects normalization to a comparison group mean set to 1.0 for each panel, but for most that comparison group is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear in our description. Briefly, there were two main ways in which the data were presented. The first, labeled “relative expression” shows the data as δ-CT against 18S, for this allows for comparison of expression among transcripts detected in the same specimen and is applied only for primer sets of equivalent efficiency. The second, labeled “fold change” normalizes the controls to 1 to emphasize the impact of AdipoRon. We now include this description in the methods and clarify in the text which comparisons are being made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The in vitro acute treatments included varying treatment times, which were not always specifically described for each experiment in the legend or methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight, these details are now provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The text states that food consumption was the same between groups in the aged mouse cohort, but these data do not appear to be shown. If food consumption is the same, activity is the same, and energy expenditure is the same, what explains the fat mass weight loss in the AdipoRon-treated group? Given the changes observed in fat metabolism and the loss of fat mass in old mice, why was no difference observed in RER?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises important issues, a few explanations come to mind. Although we did not see differences in 12hour averages for EE or RER or activity, on closer inspection looking at 15-minute increments we do see changes indicative of differences between control and AdipoRon treated animals, but at specific time intervals only. These data are now shown in revised Figure 1. The magnitude of difference is modest; however, having the animals in the cages to acclimatize 24 hours before the start of measures means that they are at least a day out from the last injection with AdipoRon. In addition, the mice had continuous access to food such that circadian rhythm is quite blunted. In our experience, meal fed animals show much clearer profiles of fed and fasted but that was not the case with ad libitum feeding regimen used here. In hindsight it might have been worth conducting additional measures directly following injection and that is something we can consider doing in a separate group of mice. We would add confidentially that in our follow up study the trends reported here are reproduced, both males and females show changes in their RER and EE patterns, being quicker to adapt to feeding and to resolve post feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Why are the phenotype data that were collected different between the young and aged chronic treatment cohorts (Figure 1 and 3)? E.g. no body composition measurements, insulin, HOMA-IR, metabolic cages in young mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Substantive changes in young animals were not expected, mice of 6 months of age were lean and fit. In our follow up study, we confirm body and HOMA-IR effects in old C3B6F1 hybrid mice. We now provide insulin data from the young mice on AdipoRon showing that insulin levels are not altered, based on the fact that the body weight did not differ we would argue a change in body fat is unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) A brief explanation of mTOR inhibition by AMPK activation (cell proliferation) could be included in the discussion of this study to further explain sarcopenia and other age-related muscle loss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion. We have added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The explanation of the glucoregulatory function in aged mice by AdipoRon could be accompanied by the catabolic pathways triggered by AMPK activation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also a great suggestion, we have added it to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The first two-thirds of the section titled &quot;nonhuman primate cultured cells&quot; continues to describe experiments in NIH3T3, which is confusing. The first sentence of the Figure 6 legend causes the same confusion, although the panel descriptions are clear which is which.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We have rewritten this section addressing this concern and adding the new data on the differentiated C2C12 as shown in revised Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) In general, I appreciate the careful language used to describe suggestive but not statistically significant results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, as mentioned above aging is accompanied by increase in variance for a host of measured parameters. We favor discussing all outcomes that we believe are biologically meaningful while being careful to note whether or not there was statistical significance in differences reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) How was AdipoRon obtained? Was it donated by the company? Were there any considerations provided by the company for the study?</p></disp-quote><p>AdipoRon was obtained at considerable cost. As indicated in our declaration of no conflict, we did not receive favor or inducements of any kind from the manufacturer or any other party.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>With the exception of the JC-1 assays, the study appears well done, with sufficient rigor in terms of numbers of animals used per group etc. However, in addition to the well known problems with the JC-1 dye being used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, there a couple of minor quirks, which can easily be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the JC-1 assay with the TMRE as recommended. Although the outcome is similar, TMRE confirms the ability of AdipoRon to impact mitochondrial membrane potential, we are eager to make sure we are using the right tool for the job by eliminating the possibility that our signature is compromised by changes in extra-mitochondrial membranes. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) On page 4, references are made to Benton and Ruas as showing PGC-1a over expression protecting against muscle aging in mice. Neither of these papers show this. Benton et al. has no aging data. Ruas also has no aging data, and is in rats, not mice. Cite the correct references, and remove these.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the incorrect references and replaced them with the correct ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Rename the EchoMRI to &quot;body composition measures&quot;. This is super confusing to those who don't know this instrument (it is neither &quot;echo&quot; nor &quot;MRI&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out, we have made the suggested correction to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) On page 5 there is reference to EDL and soleus being glycolytic and oxidative. As the authors point out repeatedly later on, these muscle are mixed fibre types, albeit heavily glycolytic or oxidative. I think there should be consistency on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is spot on here and we apologize for not being clearer about this in our initial submission. We have revised the manuscript to make sure we are consistent in our description of the fiber type and metabolic setting of the different muscle groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Page 6: &quot;Expression levels of both receptors were numerically lower in AdipoRon treated mice. In soleus muscle, AdipoR1 expression was not altered with age (Figure S2) and AdipoRon increased expression, although neither change reached significance. AdipoR2 levels declined with age in soleus of control mice, but not in mice treated with AdipoRon.&quot;</p><p>The two sentences seem to be at odds with one another. The first sentence is also not consistent with the data in figure S2.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for picking up on this clumsy wording. The first part is about gastrocnemius and the second refers to soleus. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 9: JC-1 measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential can give artifacts, especially when fluorescence is measured via a plate reader and not visualized via microscopy or flow cytometry. I would encourage the authors to validate their results with TMRE or TMRM staining.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we have replaced the JC-1 with TMRE as requested, please see our responses to reviewers 1 and 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 9: Why the different time points for measurements of cell proliferation, markers of mitochondrial function, and ATP levels (24 vs 48h vs 12h) ?</p></disp-quote><p>The timing of the experiments was matched to the outcomes being measured. For the immediate responses, cell signaling through AMPK and PGC-1a directed gene expression, we measured within 90 mintues based on time course experiments. The activation of AMPK is transient, as is the activation of gene expression. For physiological responses, membrane potential and respiration, we measured hours after exposure and show data from 2 and 4 hours. For ATP production we include data that we had left out initially. At 2 and 4 hours ATP production is lower but then corrects and is elevated relative to untreated cells at 12 hours. We have no explanation for the biphasic response which is why we had left it out of the initial submission. For proliferation we were guided by the doubling time of the cells, and for the and mitochondrial remodeling we were guided by a time course showing gradual changes that become significant at 24 hours and persist to 48 hours. We have included some of this detail in the revised manuscript and hope we have struck the correct balance with just enough information without getting lost in the detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 11: :The inference is a shift toward fatty acid fuel utilization, aligning with prior reports of lipid remodeling outcomes reported in renal endothelial cells&quot; I don't know whether this inference is warranted without RER measurements or at least evidence of activation of fitty acid oxidation. Indeed, the in vivo indirect calorimetry failed to show a shift towards lipid catabolism, which is at odds with this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this sentence to separate out what is known and reported previously in the literature from speculation on our part. The reviewer is correct that the definitive test would be done using ex vivo tissues to demonstrate preference for lipid fuel. We are pursuing this avenue now but in the meantime have made changes in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 12: Could you provide a justification for using only male animals and using two different strains between old and young animals?</p></disp-quote><p>At the time these experiments were conducted we were limited by what was available. We expanded our thoughts on these limitations in the discussion. Please also see the responses to reviewers 1 and 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 13: Please include clone or catalog number for all antibodies used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this oversight, this information is now provided.</p></body></sub-article></article>
