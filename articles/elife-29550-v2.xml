Despite this progress, the precise physical nature of observed structures and the forces that govern their establishment remain poorly understood. Here we present high resolution Hi-C data from early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. We demonstrate that boundaries between topological domains of various sizes map to DNA elements that resemble classical insulator elements: short genomic regions sensitive to DNase digestion that are strongly bound by known insulator proteins and are frequently located between divergent promoters. Further, we show a striking correspondence between these elements and the locations of mapped polytene interband regions. We believe it is likely this relationship between insulators, topological boundaries, and polytene interbands extends across the genome, and we therefore propose a model in which decompaction of boundary-insulator-interband regions drives the organization of interphase chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29550.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA inside a cell is packaged into threaded structures called chromosomes. Early studies of chromosomes using insect larvae revealed a pattern of dark- and light-colored bands on the chromosomes that was unique to every region.

Over the next century plus, studies in the model insect species <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were instrumental in defining structural features of animal chromatin.

While these classical studies offered extensive structural and molecular characterization of chromosomes in vivo, the question of what was responsible for organizing chromosome structure remained unanswered.</p><p>A critical clue came with the discovery of insulators, DNA elements initially identified based on their ability to block the activity of transcriptional enhancers when located between an enhancer and its targeted promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kellum and Schedl, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holdridge and Dorsett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geyer and Corces, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kellum and Schedl, 1992</xref>).

Through a combination of genetic screens and biochemical purification, a number of protein factors have been identified that bind to <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulators and modulate their function, including Su(Hw), BEAF-32, mod(mdg4), CP190, dCTCF, GAF, Zw5, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lindsley and Grell, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lewis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Parkhurst and Corces, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parkhurst and Corces, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Spana et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parkhurst et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gerasimova et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaszner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Scott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Büchner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Melnikova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moon et al., 2005</xref>).

Further, some, though not all, insulator protein mutants disrupt polytene chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these data implicate insulator proteins, and the elements they bind, in the organization of the three-dimensional structure of fly chromosomes.</p><p>Several high-throughput methods to probe three-dimensional structure of chromatin have been developed in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beagrie et al., 2017</xref>). Principle among these are derivatives of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>), including the genome-wide ‘Hi-C’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>). Several groups have performed Hi-C on <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues or cells and have shown that fly chromosomes, like those of other species, are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs), regions within which loci show enriched 3C linkages with each other but depleted linkages with loci outside the domain. Disruption of TAD structures by gene editing in mammalian cells has been shown to disrupt enhancer-promoter interactions and significantly alter transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lupiáñez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although TADs appear to be a common feature of animal genomes, the extent to which TAD structures are a general property of a genome or if they are regulated as a means to control genome function remains unclear, and the question of how TAD structures are established remains largely open. Previous studies have implicated a number of features in the formation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TAD boundaries, including transcriptional activity and gene density, and have reached differing conclusions about the role played by insulator protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Van Bortle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ulianov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Tantalizingly, Eagen et al., using 15 kb resolution Hi-C data from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have shown that there is a correspondence between the distribution of large TADs and polytene bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have been studying the formation of chromatin structure in the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo because of its potential impact on the establishment of patterned transcription during the initial stages of development. We have previously has shown that regions of ‘open’ chromatin are substantially remodeled at enhancers and promoters during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and were interested in the role three-dimensional chromatin structure plays in spatial patterning.</p><p>We therefore generated high-resolution Hi-C datasets derived from nuclear cycle 14 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>), and from the anterior and posterior halves of hand-dissected embryos at the same developmental stage. We show that high-resolution chromatin maps of anterior and posterior halves are nearly identical, suggesting that chromatin structure neither drives nor directly reflects spatially patterned transcriptional activity. However, we show that stable long-range contacts evident in our chromatin maps generally involve known patterning genes, implicating chromatin conformation in transcriptional regulation.</p><p>To investigate the origins of three-dimensional chromatin structure, we carefully map the locations of the boundaries between topological domains using a combination of manual and computational annotation. We demonstrate that these boundaries resemble classical insulators: short (500–2000 bp) genomic regions that are strongly bound by (usually multiple) insulator proteins and are sensitive to DNase digestion. Additionally, we find that boundaries share the molecular features of polytene interband regions. Finally, we show that for a region in which the fine polytene banding pattern has been mapped to genomic positions, boundaries show precise colocalization with interband regions that separate compacted bands corresponding to TADs. We propose that this relationship between insulators, TADs and polytene interbands extends across the genome, and suggest a model in which the decompaction of these regions drives the organization of interphase fly chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data quality and general features</title><p>We prepared and sequenced in situ Hi-C libraries from two biological replicates of hand-sorted cellular blastoderm (mitotic cycle 14; mid-stage 5) embryos using a modestly adapted version of the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>. To examine possible links between chromatin maps and transcription, we sectioned hand-sorted mitotic cycle 14 embryos along the anteroposterior midline, and generated Hi-C data from the anterior and posterior halves separately, also in duplicate. In total, we produced ~452 million informative read pairs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We assessed the quality of these data using metrics similar to those described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, the strand orientations of our reads were approximately equal in each sample (as expected from correct Hi-C libraries but not background genomic sequence; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the signal decay with genomic distance was similar across samples, and, critically, visual inspection of heat maps prepared at a variety of resolutions showed these samples to be very similar both to each other and to previously published data prepared using similar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). We conclude that these Hi-C are of high quality and reproducibility.</p><p>We next sought to ascertain the general features of the data at low resolution. We examined heatmaps for all <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> chromosomes together using 100 kb bins, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Several features of the data are immediately apparent. The prominent ‘X’ patterns for chromosomes 2 and 3, which indicate an enrichment of linkages between chromosome arms, reflects the known organization of fly chromosomes during early development known as the Rabl configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Csink and Henikoff, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilkie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duan et al., 2010</xref>): telomeres are located on one side of the nucleus, centromeres are located on the opposite side, and chromosome arms are arranged roughly linearly between them. Centromeres and the predominantly heterochromatic chromosome 4 cluster together, as, to a lesser extent, do telomeres, reflecting established cytological features that have been detected by prior Hi-C analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lowenstein et al., 2004</xref>). These features were evident in all replicates, further confirming both that these datasets are reproducible and that they capture known features of chromatin topology and nuclear arrangement.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29550.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hi-C map of the stage 5 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome at 100 kb resolution.</title><p>Data from all nc14 datasets was aggregated and normalized by the ‘vanilla coverage’ method.

Critically, these boundary calls were made from Hi-C data alone, and the human caller lacked any information about the regions being examined, including which region (or chromosome) was represented by a given panel. In total, we manually called 3122 boundaries in the genome for nc14 embryos. Taking into account the ambiguity associated with intrinsically noisy data, the difficulty of resolving small domains, and the invisibility of sections of the genome due to repeat content or a lack of MboI cut sites, we consider 4000–5500 to be a reasonable estimate for the number of boundaries in the genome.</p><p>To complement these manual calls, we developed a computational approach for calling boundaries that is similar to methods used by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crane et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, we assigned a directionality score to each genomic bin based on the number of Hi-C reads linking the bin to upstream versus downstream regions, and then used a set of heuristics to identify points of transition between regions of upstream and downstream bias. We adjusted the parameters of the directionality score and the boundary calling to account for features of the fly genome, specifically the relatively small size of many topological domains.</p><p>Attempts to exhaustively and definitively identify features within genomic data are necessarily variable due to differences in the choice of algorithm, parameters, cutoffs, and unavoidable tradeoffs between sensitivity and accuracy. We therefore sought a representative set of TAD boundaries with which to analyze features of these elements. Of our top 1000 computationally-identified domain boundaries, we found that 952 were matched by a manually-called boundary within 1 kb. This high level of agreement suggested that the computational approach robustly identified the domain features that are apparent by eye. By taking the union of our computational calls, applied with a stringent cutoff, and our manual calls, we developed a very conservative set of exceptionally high confidence boundaries. We emphasize that this set represents only a subset of the boundaries identified by manual and computational approaches, the complete lists of which are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Comparing these 952 boundaries to other genomic datasets confirms our initial observations and reveals a highly stereotyped pattern of associated genomic features.

CP190 and BEAF-32 show the strongest enrichment, and indeed, virtually all (95.1%) of the examined boundaries appear to be associated with CP190 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Domains of H3K27 trimethylation, a marker of polycomb silencing, showed a strong tendency to terminate at boundaries, and the enhancer mark H3K4me1 showed an interesting pattern of depletion at boundaries but enrichment immediately adjacent to boundary locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Boundaries also exhibit peaks of DNase accessibility and nucleosome depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as well as marks associated with promoters, including the general transcription factors TFIIB and the histone tail modification H3K4me3.

Of our representative set of boundaries, 95.1% are are enriched &gt;2 fold for CP190 binding within a 1.5 kb window. Conversely, of the strongest 1000 CP190 peaks, 75.2% are within 2 kb of a manual or computationally-called boundary (compared to 37.4% of the top 1000 RNAPII peaks). It is important to note that we do identify a small subset of boundaries that are not apparently associated with sites of insulator binding (~1–2% show no enrichment for CP190, BEAF-32, or dCTCF, depending on thresholds used), suggesting that there are multiple phenomena that can create topological boundaries in flies (e.g., see Figure 6). However, the overwhelming majority of topological boundaries identified in this study coincide with elements that match the properties of CP190-associated insulators.</p><p>An important confounding factor in sorting out the nature of topological boundaries is the strong tendency, observed by multiple authors, of insulator proteins to bind near promoters specifically between divergent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nègre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ramirez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, we find that boundary elements, as identified from Hi-C, are often found proximal to promoters and show a general enrichment of promoter-associated marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), raising the possibility that transcriptional activity at promoters may drive topological boundary formation. However, a number of features of the data argue against this possibility. First and most critically, many of the topological boundaries (54.9%) we identify are not associated with RNAPII binding in nc14 embryos. Similarly, there are many active promoters that do not appear to form topological boundaries (e.g., Figure 8 and supplements). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hug et al., 2017</xref> pharmacologically inhibited transcription in early embryos and observe that TADs remain intact. Finally, topological boundaries are invariant between anterior and posterior sections of embryos despite substantial differences in the transcriptional profiles of these regions (see below). We further examined the distributions of the same genomic features around the top 1000 peaks of H3K4me3, a marker of active promoters, in data from stage 5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2014</xref>). While these sites show enrichments for insulator proteins, these enrichments are substantially weaker than those observed at topological boundaries, while RNA polII enrichment is much stronger at promoters than boundaries. The tendency for polycomb domains to terminate at promoters is also much less pronounced at promoters than boundaries. Together, these data argue that boundaries constitute a distinct class of genetic elements that are not formed by promoter transcription, but are instead frequently located near promoters, possibly as a result of selective pressure to insulate these proximal promoters from distal regulatory elements. While we cannot rule out any role for promoter-bound transcription machinery in the formation of topological boundaries (notably, TFIIB is enriched at 69.1% of boundaries), we think it is unlikely that transcriptional activity plays a major role in establishing the topological domains of interphase fly chromosomes.</p><p>Finally, we examined the sequence composition of boundary elements by comparing the frequency of DNA words of up to seven base pairs in the set of high confidence boundaries to flanking sequence. The most enriched sequences correspond to the known binding site of BEAF-32 and to a CACA-rich motif previously identified as enriched in regions bound by CP190 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nègre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yang and Corces, 2012</xref>), both of which show strong association with the set of boundary sequences as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29550.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sequence features of TAD boundary elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histograms showing the frequency of enriched 7-mers in 5 kb windows around 952 high-confidence TAD boundaries.

Specifically, the evidence in our Hi-C data for the separation between the major band 10A1-2 and the minor band 10A3 is weak, though that may be partly explained by the absence of MboI cut sites obscuring much of this region. This minor band is barely detectable in polytene spreads, and the combination of this and weak support in Hi-C data may suggest that this band is not real or is perhaps only present in a minority of nuclei. Similarly, the Vatolina et al. report that they only rarely observe the interband between bands 10A6 and 10A7, and we indeed observe substantial contact between these two putative bands in Hi-C maps (the light orange region near the peak of the ‘pyramid’ formed by 10A6 and 10A7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), though each shows stronger intra- than inter-domain interactions. One possible explanation for this observation is that the interband separating these two domains is not constitutive but rather is formed in only a fraction of nuclei. The pattern exhibited by these two domains--adjacent domains that show a clear separation but also a substantial interaction signal--is one we observe frequently in our early embryonic Hi-C data, suggesting that variable boundaries may be common features of the fly genome.</p><p>Overall, the alignment between polytene band mapping and Hi-C data in this region supports a strong correspondence between these two types of data. For five interbands which were easily visible in polytene spreads (10A3/4-5, 10A4-5/10A6, 10A7/10A8-9, 10A8-9/10A10, 10A10-11/10B1), we observe strong domain boundaries in Hi-C data. For two interbands supported by weaker evidence in polytene analysis, we observe in Hi-C maps a weak or non-existent boundary (10A1-2/10A3) and a boundary with significant interaction across it, possibly representing heterogeneity between nuclei matching heterogeneity in polytenes (10A6/10A7).</p><p>The 5’ region of the <italic>Notch</italic> gene has also been carefully mapped. Rykowski et al. used high-resolution in situ hybridization to determine that the coding sequences of <italic>Notch</italic> lies within polytene band 3C7, while the sequences upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) lie in the 3C6-7 interband. Examining the <italic>Notch</italic> locus in our Hi-C data, we see that the gene body is located within an ~20 kb TAD, and the TSS directly abuts a TAD boundary that is strongly bound by CP190 and dCTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), an arrangement consistent with the correspondence of boundaries and interbands.</p><p>The chromodomain-containing protein Chriz has been suggested as the strongest diagnostic feature of polytene interbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhimulev et al., 2014</xref>). Using publicly available ChIP datasets from Kc167 cells (derived from late embryonic tissue), we observed a strong enrichment of Chriz binding at our representative boundaries (87.9% &gt;2 fold enriched within 1.5 kb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Further, Hi-C directionality around Chriz peaks shows the characteristic pattern of boundary formation, and Chriz profiles at representative loci show substantial correspondence between boundary regions and Chriz binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), offering further support for the association between boundaries and interbands.</p><p>Eagen et al. previously identified a broad correspondence between polytene interbands and inter-TAD regions from Hi-C data at 15 kb resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eagen et al., 2015</xref>). Our Hi-C data allows the detection of fine structure within these inter-TAD regions, down to individual boundary elements. Owing to the dearth of finely mapped polytene regions, the association between topological boundaries and interband regions is necessarily based on a limited number of example loci. However, the combination of data from these loci with the close agreement of the molecular composition of these regions, specifically the strong localization of the interband marker Chriz to topological boundaries, leads us to propose that the precise relationship between topological boundaries, insulator elements, and decompacted interband regions we observe is a general one, and that it extends across the genome.</p><p>The association between boundary elements and interbands suggests a simple model for insulator function. A key feature that distinguishes polytene interbands from bands is their low compaction ratio: they span a larger physical distance per base pair. The association between insulator binding and genomic regions with low compaction ratios suggests insulators may function by simply increasing the physical distance between adjacent domains via the unpacking and extension of intervening chromatin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (top) shows a representation of the conversion of genomic distance to physical distance for the 10A1-B1 region, as measured by Vatolina et al. Any model for insulator function must explain several features of insulator function, including the ability to organize chromatin into physical domains, block interactions between enhancers and promoters exclusively when inserted between them, protect transgenes from position effect variegation and block the spread of chromatin silencing states. This chromatin extension model for fly insulator function can potentially explain these defining characteristics via simple physical separation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hi-C data can elaborate fine polytene structures</title><p>We reasoned that if our Hi-C data is capable of resolving fine banding patterns such as that at the 10A1-B1 locus, we should be able to resolve the borders of major bands with precision.

First, the large TADs are bounded on both sides by gene-rich regions consisting of a number of smaller topological domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). The boundaries of large and small domains in this region nearly all share the common features of boundary elements: DNase hypersensitivity and binding of diagnostic insulator (e.g. CP190) and interband (CHRIZ) proteins. This region also contains a prominent example of an exception to this pattern: a loop is formed that appears to generate boundaries not associated with these characteristic protein binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, indicated by dotted yellow lines and loop). This example highlights a critical point: while the description we provide of the association between TAD boundaries, insulator elements, and decompacted interbands appears to describe the overwhelming majority of cases, there are counter-examples. Indeed given the extraordinary capacity of nature to innovate with respect to gene regulation and structures, we expect that animal genomes will provide no shortage novel chromosome topological and structural features for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Topological boundaries are nearly identical in anterior and posterior sections of the embryo</title><p>We next asked whether the boundaries we identified as boundary elements represent constitutive features of chromatin organization or whether their function might be regulated in a cell-type specific or developmental manner.

As a result, each study relied on distinct sets of boundaries for analyses of the molecular features of these structures. We explored several methods to identify topological domains and associated boundaries and found that no single approach was sufficient to exhaustively identify all of these features in the genome. Rather, by using a combination of visual inspection of Hi-C maps at a large number of loci, unbiased hand-calling, and computational searches, we consistently observed a very close, two-way association between sites of combinatorial insulator protein binding (insulators) and the boundaries between topological domains. This result supports prior studies which found enriched insulator protein binding at topological boundaries, and extends this finding by localizing boundaries to discrete insulator elements. Hi-C data are exceptionally complex and reveal many layers of genomic organization, and we suspect that many questions in this field will only be resolved by the combined work of multiple groups using distinct analysis strategies and techniques.</p><p>Our most intriguing finding is the association of TAD boundaries with polytene interbands. The implication that these elements are decompacted, extended chromatin regions provides an attractive model in which simple physical separation explains multiple activities associated with insulators, including the ability to block enhancer-promoter interactions, prevent the spread of silenced chromatin, and organize chromatin structure.</p><p>A number of prior observations are consistent with the identity of insulators/boundaries as interbands. First, estimates suggest that there are ~5000 interbands constituting 5% of genomic DNA, with an average length of 2 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhimulev, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vatolina et al., 2011a</xref>), numbers that are in line with our estimates of boundary element length and number. Second, interbands are associated with insulator proteins, with CP190 appearing to be a constitutive feature of all or nearly all interbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerasimova et al., 2007</xref>), which is precisely what we observe for boundary elements. Third, interbands and boundary elements are highly sensitive to DNase digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vatolina et al., 2011b</xref>). Fourth, interbands have been shown to contain the promoters and 5’ ends of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jamrich et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sass, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sass and Bautz, 1982a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rykowski et al., 1988</xref>), and we see a strong enrichment for promoters oriented to transcribe away from boundaries, which would place upstream regulatory elements within or near the interband. Finally, deletion of both isoforms of BEAF-32, the second-most highly enriched insulator protein at boundary elements, results in polytene X chromosomes that exhibit loss of banding and are wider and shorter than wild type, consistent with a loss of decompacted BEAF-32-bound regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that interbands in polytene chromosomes result from multiple underlying molecular phenomena, but we believe it is likely that decompacted insulator elements constitute a significant fraction of these structures.</p><p>While we and others have not observed frequent looping of insulators in Hi-C data from fly tissue, our model of chromatin compaction at insulators is not mutually exclusive with a role for looping in the function of some insulators. Indeed, we have observed a limited set of cases in which interactions between boundaries seem to organize special genome structures with, at least in the case of the <italic>Scr</italic> locus, clear functional implications. It is likely that additional boundary-associated distal interactions will be found in other tissues and stages of fly development. However, we emphasize that these interactions are rare and do not appear to be general features of the function of boundary elements.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data presented here offer a picture of the structure of the interphase chromatin of <italic>Drosophila</italic> that attempts to unify years of studies of polytene chromosomes with modern genomic methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In this picture, interphase chromatin consists of alternating stretches of compacted, folded chromatin domains separated by regions of decompacted, stretched regions. The compacted regions vary in size from a few to hundreds of kilobases and correspond to both polytene band regions and TADs in Hi-C data. Decompacted regions that separate these domains are short DNA elements that are defined by the strong binding of insulator proteins and correspond to polytene interbands and TAD boundaries (insulators). An intuitive view of this structure in a non-polytene context might resemble the well-worn ‘beads on a string’, in which insulator/interband regions are the string and bands/TADs form beads of various sizes. Future work, including experimental manipulation of the sequences underlying these structures, will focus on validating and refining this model, exploring how it fits into hierarchical levels of genome organization, and understanding its implications for genome function.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29550.033</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A chromatin extension model of insulator function.</title><p>We propose a model in which insulators achieve domain separation by lowering the compaction ratio of bound chromatin, thereby converting the short lengths of insulator DNA (measured in base pairs) into large relative physical distances.

Anterior and posterior halves were separately transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing ~200 µL PBS with 0.5% triton using an embryo pick (a tool of mysterious provenance that appears to be a clay sculpting tool). Successful transfer was confirmed visually by the presence of blue embryos which had absorbed bromophenol blue from the agarose block. Between transferring anterior and posterior halves, the pick was washed thoroughly with water and ethanol, and rubbed vigorously with kimwipes. We note that anterior and posterior half samples are precisely matched: samples HiC-13 and 14 contain the anterior and posterior halves (respectively) of the same embryos, and the same is true for HiC-15 and 16.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Hi-C</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>Hi-C experiments were conducted as described in Rao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>), with slight modifications. For completeness, we describe the detailed protocol: Embryos (or halves) were suspended in 1X NEB2 buffer (NEB B7002) and homogenized on ice by douncing for several minutes each with the loose and tight dounces. Insoluble material (including nuclei) was pelleted by spinning for 5 min at 4500 x g in microcentrifuge cooled to 4°C (all wash steps used these conditions for pelleting). Nuclei were washed twice with 500 µL of 1x NEB2 buffer and then suspended in 125 µL of the same. 42.5 µL of 2% SDS was added and tubes placed at 65°C for 10 min, then returned to ice, followed by addition of 275 µL of 1x NEB2 buffer and 22 µL of 20% Triton X-100, then incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Samples were digested overnight with 1500 units of MboI by shaking at 37°C. The next day, samples were washed twice with 1X NEB2, resuspended in 100 µL 1X NEB2, and 15 µL of fill-in mix (1.5 µL 10x NEB2, 0.4 µL each of 10 mM dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 9 µL 0.4 mM biotin-14-dCTP, 2.5 µL 5 U/µL Klenow (NEB M0210), 1 µL water) was added, followed by 1.5 hr at 37°C. Samples were then washed twice with 500 µL 1X ligation buffer (10X: 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH7.4, 0.1M MgCl2, 0.1M DTT), resuspended in 135 µL of the same, then supplemented with 250 µL of ligation mix (25 µL 10x ligation buffer, 25 µL 10% Triton X-100, 2.6 µL 10 mg/ml BSA, 2.6 µL 100 mM ATP, 196 µL water) and 2000 units of T4 DNA ligase (NEB M0202T) and incubated for 2 hr (or overnight) at room temperature. An additional 2000 units of ligase were added, followed by another 2 hr at room temperature. Cross-link reversal was carried out by adding 50 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K and incubating overnight at 65°C. An additional 50 µL proteinase K was then added followed by a 2 hr 65°C incubation. 0.1 volumes of 3M NaCl and 2 µL of glycoblue (Thermo Fisher AM9515) were added, then samples were extracted once with one volume of phenol pH 7.9, once with phenol-chloroform pH7.9, then precipitated with 3 volumes of EtOH. Washed pellets were resuspended in 130 µL water and treated with 1 µL of RNase A for 15 min at 37°C. DNA was fragmented using the Covaris instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA) with peak power 140.0, duty factor 10.0, cycles/burst 200 for 80 s. Samples are brought to 300 µL total volume with water.</p><p>75 µL of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher 65001) were washed twice with 400 µL of tween wash buffer (TWB) (2X binding buffer [BB]: 100 µL of 1M Tris-HCl pH8, 20 µL 0.5 M EDTA, 4 mL of 5M NaCl, 5.88 mL water; TWB: 5 ml 2X binding buffer, 50 µL 10% Tween, 4.95 µL water), resuspended in 300 µL 2X BB, then added to 300 µL DNA. Samples were rocked at room temperature for 15 min, then washed once with TWB, twice with 1X BB, reclaimed on magnetic stand and resuspended in 100 µL 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer. Samples were then supplemented with end-repair mix (78 µL water, 10 µL 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer with ATP, 2 µL 25 mM dNTPs, 1 µL 10 U/µL T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher EK0031), 2 µL 5 U/µL Klenow, 3 µL 3 U/µL T4 DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher EP0061)), incubated 30 min at room temp, washed as before, washed once with 100 µL 1X NEB2, and resuspended in 90 µL 1X NEB2. dA overhangs were added by adding 2 µL 10 mM dATP and 1 µL Klenow exo minus (NEB M0212S), incubating at 37°C for 30 min. Beads were washed as before, washed once with 100 µL 1X Quickligase (NEB M2200S) buffer, resuspended in 50 µL 1X Quickligase buffer, then supplemented with 3 µL Illumina adaptors and 1 µL Quickligase. Samples were incubated 15 min at room temperature, then washed twice with TWB, twice with 1X BB, twice with 200 µL TLE, and resuspend in 50 µL TLE. Beads are stable at 4°C, but were always amplified quickly. 100 µL (or more) of phusion PCR reaction was prepared (50 µL 2X Phusion master mix, 1 µL 100 µM forward primer [5-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAG-3], 1 µL 100 µM reverse primer [5-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAG-3], 10 µL of beads with Hi-C library attached, 38 µL water). Reaction was mixed well and split into separate 12 µL reactions. Thermocycler conditions were 16 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 63°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2 m. Reactions were pooled and loaded on a 2% agarose gel. Fragments corresponding to an insert size of ~300 bp (amplicon size of 421 bp) were excised from the gel, purified with the Zymo Gel DNA Recovery Kit (D4001T, Zymo), and submitted for sequencing at the Vincent J. Coates Genomic Sequencing Laboratory (Berkeley, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Read processing and mapping</title><p>Our analysis routine was adapted by examining the approaches of multiple groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crane et al., 2015</xref>) in addition to procedures we developed independently. All analysis was performed with custom Python, R, and Perl scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stadler, 2017</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Stadlerlab-hi-c">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Stadlerlab-hi-c</ext-link>) except where noted. Single-ends of demultiplexed reads were separately mapped using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) (parameters: -m1 --best --strata) to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome dm6 (R6.17). Due to the formation of chimeric reads intrinsic to the Hi-C procedure, reads can fail to properly map if the ligation junction lies within the 100 bp read. To address this, we used an iterative mapping procedure, in which we began by mapping the first 20 nt of the reads (using Bowtie’s --trim3 feature). Unique mappings were kept, reads that failed to map were stored, and the procedure was repeated on the multiply-mapping reads, incrementing the length of sequence to map by 7 nt each round (attempt to uniquely map using first 20, first 27, first 34...). We found that this method gave 5–10% increases in yield of mapped reads over a procedure in which we attempted to explicitly detect and trim ligation junctions from reads. Uniquely mapping reads from all iterations were collated as a single file.</p><p>Uniquely-mapping single-ends were paired based on read identity, and only pairs with two uniquely-mapping ends were retained. Duplicate reads that shared identical 5’ mapping positions were removed. Resulting paired, collapsed, uniquely mapping reads were then inspected for quality. Primary indicators of successful Hi-C libraries were the distance distribution of mapped pairs and the relative frequencies of reads in the four orientations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rao et al., 2014</xref>, in-in, in-out, out-in, and out-out. In all of our libraries, we detect some ~3–15% reads that appear to be simple genomic sequence, not the result of a Hi-C ligation event. These reads are readily detected by examining the size distributions of in-out reads (the orientation expected from standard genomic sequence) compared with the other three orientations. The in-out reads have a unique hump of reads showing a distance distribution of ~150–500 bp, varying slightly from sample to sample. In-out reads pairs spanning less than 500 bp were removed from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Computational topological boundary detection</title><p>We explored a number of ways of identifying boundaries from directionality data. In the end, the most robust was to use a simple heuristic that at a boundary, by definition, regions to the left show left-bias and regions to the right show right bias. While attempts to derive a boundary score from a comparison of directionality scores upstream and downstream showed susceptibility to noise and artifacts, requiring expected upstream and downstream behavior allowed robust detection of sets of boundary elements. We describe the complete procedure below.</p><p>Read counts were assigned to 500 bp bins for all genomic bin combinations within 500 kb of the diagonal. Local directionality scores were calculated for each bin by summing the counts linking the bin to regions in a window encompassing the genomic regions between 1 and 15 kb from the bin (skipping the two proximal 500 bp bins, summing the next 28) upstream and downstream, then taking the log (10) ratio of downstream to upstream. These parameters were determined by visually comparing local directionality scores from a range of inputs to Hi-C heat maps for a number of genomic regions, identifying parameters in which directionality transitions reflected boundaries evident in the heat maps. We observed high levels of noise in the directionality metric in regions of low read coverage. To suppress these noisy signals, we devised a weighted local directionality score to weight these scores based on the total number of reads used in the calculation. We experimented with a variety of scaling factors a such that w = [read count]^a and found that a weighting of a = 0.5 worked well to reduce signal from low-read regions. From these directional scores, sites were first selected for which the mean directionality score of the 5 adjacent upstream bins was less than −2, and the mean for the 5 adjacent downstream bins was greater than 2. Boundary scores were assigned to resulting bins by subtracting the sum of the directionality scores for the 5 adjacent upstream bins from the 5 adjacent downstream bins. An issue with this scoring system is that bins that lack MboI sites can cause inflated directionality scores in adjacent regions. To address this, we simply assigned a boundary score of 0 to any bin with more than one such bin in its radius. The resulting distribution of boundary scores is dominated by series of consecutive bins with large boundary score maximums, which is uninformative since these scores are essentially derived from the same data (window shifted by one bin). We therefore merged adjacent bins that passed the cutoff and selected only the bin with the maximum boundary score within a contiguous block. By sorting the resulting table on the boundary score, we were able to select sets of candidate boundaries of various strengths for analysis.</p><p>In additional to these computationally-identified boundary locations, we manually called boundaries for the entire genome. An R script serially displayed Hi-C heat maps of 250 kb genomic windows and recorded the genomic coordinates of mouse clicks made at visually-identified boundaries. The human caller was unaware of any features of the regions examined other than the Hi-C maps, and was unaware of the locations being displayed in a given plot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>We used simple custom Python scripts to count the occurrences of all words of length 4, 5, 6 and 7 in 500 bp windows from 10,000 bp upstream to 10,000 bp downstream of the 500 bp window identified as a boundary. We then computed a simple enrichment score for each unique word equal to the counts of that word and its reverse complement in the boundary divided by the mean counts for the word and its reverse complement in the remaining windows. We noticed that many of the words identified as enriched in this analysis were also enriched in the 500 bp bins immediately flanking the boundary. We therefore updated our enrichment score for each word to be the mean of the counts of the word and its reverse complement in the boundary and the 500 bp bins immediately adjacent to it (three bins in total) divided by the mean counts of the word and its reverse complement in the remaining 38 bins. Counts and scores for all words are provided in the supplemental materials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ATAC-seq</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>Early nc14 embryos were placed in ATAC-seq lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) without detergent, with 5% glycerol added.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Stadler et al. present a HiC analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin from nuclear cycle 12 and cycle 14 embryos in order to address a variety of questions, with an emphasis on how insulators are related to chromatin topological domains (TADs). They conclude that TAD boundary regions are enriched for insulator binding sites, contain promoters, and are marked by accessible chromatin. The TAD boundary regions are found to be constant despite differences in gene expression between the anterior and posterior of the embryo, and they are detectable prior to the onset of zygotic gene expression. By comparing TAD boundaries to sites of insulator protein binding, and to very limited available information on polytene interbands, the authors propose a model of insulator function and suggest that their work &quot;unifies years of polytene chromosome research.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Unfortunately, there are significant problems with the supporting data, requiring major revisions. The datasets upon which these conclusions are based (19 or 88 million contacts) appear to be significantly smaller than in recent publications (Hug et al.2017: – 400 million contacts; or even in older studies Corces 2012- 120 million contacts.) Barring some misunderstanding, neither 19 million or 88 million contacts would be adequate to achieve the claimed resolution of less than 1 kb. The questions addressed in the manuscript depend on achieving a high level of resolution, consequently, for this paper to be considered further, the authors need to address this problem. Additional sequencing of their libraries or combination of data with published datasets are possibilities to consider. If this problem can be resolved, and the resulting higher resolution analysis still supports the correlation between TAD boundaries and interbands, then a revised version of the paper will be considered for publication.</p><p>In a revised version, the claimed correspondence between TAD boundaries and polytene interbands needs to be solidified. The possible confounding effect of zones of active transcription should be addressed. They should acknowledge the highly tentative nature of a theory that has been tested at the very most in 5 out of &gt; 5,000 cases.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>First, the claim that the data achieves a resolution of 1kb or less needs to be better justified. If the authors' HiC data is so accurate, why were only 947 high confidence junctions defined? Since the most robust domain junctions are those associated with large bands, why did the authors not identify all the junctions of those bands? How could the very fine junctions between almost invisible bands in region 10A be defined, when so many domains in the genome as a whole were not?</p><p>Second, it is not clear from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and supplements, that one can robustly define regions whose function is to separate domains from simple uncertainty in the domain edges. The surprising uniformity in size (500-1000bp) of the authors elements might have been an artifact of the requirement for a major directionality change. The &quot;insulator&quot; proteins used in the definition of these junctions do not appear to be very specific, as the authors own and third party data shows that these proteins bind at multiple sites in the genome, most of which are not at domain boundaries. The paper should calculate the numerical enrichment of each of these proteins at domain junctions vs. other sites in the genome.</p><p>The data presented in cytogenetic region 10A-10B, which has been intensively studied in the Zhimulev laboratory, was quite interesting, although it falls a little short of the &quot;perfect&quot; correspondence claimed by the authors. In particular, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the junction between the heavy band 10A1-2 and 10A3 (a virtually invisible band in polytenes) was not actually detected in the hand or high confidence boundary calls, but was arbitrarily added to the figure as a dashed line so it would fit expectations. As a result, the next junction, the strongest in the region, is scored as the junction between 10A3 and 10A4, i.e. between an invisible band and a weak band. It seems more likely that this strong boundary is actually the end of 10A1-2, and that there are only 4 rather than 5 domains between the two major bands in this region. This would be consistent with the authors own detection of only 4 boundaries in their unbiased and in the high confidence datasets. The authors separate band 10A6 from 10A7 following Zhimulev, even though he states that this separation is almost never observed, nor did Bridges report separate bands in his revised map. There is no DNAase or convincing directionality data for this separation. Since HiC would average conformational differences between cells, the data should reflect the common configuration, not a rare configuration. The authors should clearly state in the text that they are not using their own boundary measurements but making a special interpretation specifically for this experiment, rather than hiding that admission at the end of the figure legend.</p><p>Finally, the authors should comment on the correspondence between the boundaries and polytene bands. It stands to reason that a method capable of resolving interbands would need to have superb resolution of bands. How well do the boundaries defined in this manuscript fit with previous cytological and HiC reports for major bands? It is an interesting question, not only for its relevance to the question of HiC reproducibility between labs, but because different tissue sources, including salivary glands, tissue culture cells and embryos have been used. Is it possible that different tissues have the same general organization into TADs, but the detailed boundaries of the TADs differ in some cases?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The data largely are clear and compelling except for a few issues:</p><p>1) The ChIP data for insulator binding sites are from 0-12 hour embryos, a much broader developmental window than the two time points examined for the TAD mapping.

Given that the insulator ChIP data are not from the same restricted developmental time as the TAD maps, it would be useful to discuss how the boundary elements mapped here compare to sites of localization of CHRIZ (Chromator), even though they have been determined in S2 and Kc cells.

The datasets upon which these conclusions are based (19 or 88 million contacts) appear to be significantly smaller than in recent publications (Hug et al.2017: – 400 million contacts; or even in older studies Corces 2012- 120 million contacts.) Barring some misunderstanding, neither 19 million or 88 million contacts would be adequate to achieve the claimed resolution of less than 1 kb. The questions addressed in the manuscript depend on achieving a high level of resolution, consequently, for this paper to be considered further, the authors need to address this problem. Additional sequencing of their libraries or combination of data with published datasets are possibilities to consider. If this problem can be resolved, and the resulting higher resolution analysis still supports the correlation between TAD boundaries and interbands, then a revised version of the paper will be considered for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>There does appear to be some misunderstanding. Our original manuscript was based on 263,868,080 Hi-C linkages from nc14 embryos. A complete description of the read totals for individual datasets, including a full accounting of reads removed at various processing steps, was supplied in Table S2 Sequencing Statistics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Further, the processing pipeline used was described in detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We appreciate the interest and efforts of reviewer 3 to analyze our raw data. We are unsure how they arrived at the total of 88 million nc14 contacts, but have simplified the naming of the original raw data files to make their relationships clearer in hopes that future users of the data will be able to work with them optimally.</p><p>Despite this confusion, we felt it was prudent to generate additional sequencing data from these libraries, and performed additional sequencing of four of our nc14 libraries and now have a total of 451,978,433 Hi-C contacts from nc14 embryos. The overall character of the data is unchanged, and none of our original observations are altered. We believe this is sufficient to achieve sufficient resolution to support the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a revised version, the claimed correspondence between TAD boundaries and polytene interbands needs to be solidified. The possible confounding effect of zones of active transcription should be addressed. They should acknowledge the highly tentative nature of a theory that has been tested at the very most in 5 out of &gt; 5,000 cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added additional discussion of the possible effects of active transcription on TAD boundary structure. The fact that TAD boundaries are invariant between anterior and posterior embryo sections, show only partial correlation with RNA polymerase occupancy (compared to exceptionally strong correspondence with insulator protein binding), and that TAD structures are not significantly altered in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors (Hug et al.) argue that transcriptional activity is not a strong driver of TAD boundary formation. With respect to the band/interband pattern of the 10A-B region, only a subset of the promoters near the identified TAD boundaries appear to be transcribed in nc14 embryos, based on RNAPII occupancy and RNAseq. We have added additional commentary on the tentative nature of the TAD boundary-interband association and the limited availability of high-resolution polytene mapping data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>First, the claim that the data achieves a resolution of 1kb or less needs to be better justified. If the authors' HiC data is so accurate, why were only 947 high confidence junctions defined? Since the most robust domain junctions are those associated with large bands, why did the authors not identify all the junctions of those bands? How could the very fine junctions between almost invisible bands in region 10A be defined, when so many domains in the genome as a whole were not?</p></disp-quote><p>In retrospect we agree that claims about the resolution of the data are fraught, especially because there is no clear standard for what it means to assign a numerical value to HiC resolution. We have therefore removed these specific claims about resolution from the manuscript and focus instead on what the data actually show.</p><p>The list of 947 high confidence junctions was not meant to be a comprehensive list of junctions. This set was chosen as a representative set to analyze the features of boundaries, not as a comprehensive list, and is a very conservative list generated from the union of the highest-scoring computationally-identified boundaries and hand calls. We have attempted to make this distinction clear in the text.</p><p>To the broader issue of calling boundaries: as with all genomic datasets it is difficult to define an exact number of features of a certain class, since one can identify them with various algorithms and choices must be made about cutoffs, parameters, etc. with different justifiable choices leading to wildly different numbers of identifiable features with differing degrees of overlap. We identified a much larger set (~3,200) of hand-called boundaries. The number of computationally-identified boundaries varies depending on the thresholds used, but is likely over ~2,500. We have included the full list of hand-called and computationally-identified boundaries in supplemental data, as well as supplying discussion about the complexities of boundary calling procedures and estimates of the total number of boundaries present in the genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it is not clear from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and supplements, that one can robustly define regions whose function is to separate domains from simple uncertainty in the domain edges. The surprising uniformity in size (500-1000bp) of the authors elements might have been an artifact of the requirement for a major directionality change. The &quot;insulator&quot; proteins used in the definition of these junctions do not appear to be very specific, as the authors own and third party data shows that these proteins bind at multiple sites in the genome, most of which are not at domain boundaries. The paper should calculate the numerical enrichment of each of these proteins at domain junctions vs. other sites in the genome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is uncertainty in our ability to define the precise location of individual boundaries, but believe that collectively the data strongly support our conclusions about the correspondence between these regions. We have, as suggested, calculated the numerical enrichment and have added this to the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data presented in cytogenetic region 10A-10B, which has been intensively studied in the Zhimulev laboratory, was quite interesting, although it falls a little short of the &quot;perfect&quot; correspondence claimed by the authors. In particular, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the junction between the heavy band 10A1-2 and 10A3 (a virtually invisible band in polytenes) was not actually detected in the hand or high confidence boundary calls, but was arbitrarily added to the figure as a dashed line so it would fit expectations. As a result, the next junction, the strongest in the region, is scored as the junction between 10A3 and 10A4, i.e. between an invisible band and a weak band. It seems more likely that this strong boundary is actually the end of 10A1-2, and that there are only 4 rather than 5 domains between the two major bands in this region. This would be consistent with the authors own detection of only 4 boundaries in their unbiased and in the high confidence datasets. The authors separate band 10A6 from 10A7 following Zhimulev, even though he states that this separation is almost never observed, nor did Bridges report separate bands in his revised map. There is no DNAase or convincing directionality data for this separation. Since HiC would average conformational differences between cells, the data should reflect the common configuration, not a rare configuration. The authors should clearly state in the text that they are not using their own boundary measurements but making a special interpretation specifically for this experiment, rather than hiding that admission at the end of the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her critical eye, and we agree that the correspondence between our Hi-C maps and Zhimulev’s banding analysis should be clarified. First, it is important to point out that the band/interband assignments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and their genomic locations, are assigned according to Vatolina et al., not from our measurements. As the reviewer points out, our data do not strongly support the existence of the minor band 10A-3, and combined with the fact that it is virtually invisible in polytenes, we agree that it is likely not real and have indicated this in the text.</p><p>The separation of 10A6 and 10A7 is also a fascinating case. Unfortunately, the exact junction between these domains is obscured by a lack of MboI cut sites, an unfortunate limitation of our Hi-C data. Nevertheless, we do seem to observe evidence for the existence of these bands (the stronger signal within them and weaker signal for contacts between them). Additionally, while there is not a strong signal of DNase digestion at this putative boundary, there is strong binding of CP190, BEAF-32, and dCTCF. However, the data also clearly show significant interactions between these two putative domains (the light orange regions near the top of the pyramid). Indeed, this situation resembles a pattern we observe frequently in the genome as a whole: adjacent domains that are clearly distinct, yet show significant interaction with each other. The fact that the 10A6-7 junction is observed infrequently in polytene band analysis suggests that this interband may be somewhat variable, present on some fraction of chromosomes and absent in others. This is a very interesting possibility that we discuss in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Overall, we feel that these issues are consistent with a correspondence between polytene banding patterns and our Hi-C data in this region. A band (10A3) that is virtually invisible in polytene banding analysis is not detected by Hi-C, and a region that is often seen as a single band, and occasionally as separate bands, shows a Hi-C signature that would be expected from a region that existed in both states within a population of nuclei. Meanwhile, all of the interbands that are clearly visible in polytene spreads are clearly visible in Hi-C data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors should comment on the correspondence between the boundaries and polytene bands. It stands to reason that a method capable of resolving interbands would need to have superb resolution of bands. How well do the boundaries defined in this manuscript fit with previous cytological and HiC reports for major bands? It is an interesting question, not only for its relevance to the question of HiC reproducibility between labs, but because different tissue sources, including salivary glands, tissue culture cells and embryos have been used. Is it possible that different tissues have the same general organization into TADs, but the detailed boundaries of the TADs differ in some cases?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and took a closer look several regions of associated polytene bands and TADs that were previously examined by Eagen et al. In the revised manuscript, we provide a detailed examination of the region of band 22A1-2, which appeared as a single large TAD in Eagen’s data, but which had occasionally been observed to contain an interband. Our data reveal this locus to have a more complex topology, with two large TADs surrounding a middle region containing smaller domains and a fascinating looped region, which together are likely responsible for the observed interband. This analysis is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The data largely are clear and compelling except for a few issues:</p><p>1) The ChIP data for insulator binding sites are from 0-12 hour embryos, a much broader developmental window than the two time points examined for the TAD mapping.

A number of pieces of evidence argued against this model, including the identification of gene bodies that reside in polytene bands, dry weight measurements that indicated that interbands represented an insufficient fraction of genomic sequence cover actively transcribed loci, and recently, fine mapping of interbands to smaller genomic regions that largely separate promoters. The Zhimulev 2014 PLoS One paper provides a fairly detailed review of much of this evidence.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are additional levels of complexity in Hi-C data. We observe strong compartment effects, as well as hierarchical interactions between domains of various sizes. These are interesting phenomena for future work, and we plan on pursuing many of them. We do not attempt to address all of these potential levels of organization in this manuscript. Rather, we feel that the strong correspondence between the domain boundaries that we have identified and both the molecular features of insulators and locations of mapped polytene interbands make a compelling case that these regions represent a significant contribution to the architecture of fly chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors cannot directly compare features of nc12 and nc14 embryos unless they have the same number of Hi-C contacts in both samples. I think it is critical to obtain more reads for the nc12 libraries.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these comparisons require deeper complexity nc12 libraries. We included nc12 in the original manuscript because we had the data and thought it would be of interest, but nc12 was not central to any of our conclusions and we have decided not to include it here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
