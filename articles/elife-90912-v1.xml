somatosensory attenuation. Support comes from psychophysical and neuroimaging studies showing that touch applied on a passive hand elicits attenuated perceptual and neural responses if it is actively generated by one’s other hand, compared to an identical touch from an external origin. However, recent experimental findings have challenged this view by providing psychophysical evidence that the perceived intensity of touch on the passive hand is enhanced if the active hand does not receive touch simultaneously with the passive hand (somatosensory enhancement) and by further attributing attenuation to the double tactile stimulation of the hands upon contact. Here, we directly contrasted the hypotheses of the attenuation and enhancement models regarding how action influences somatosensory perception by manipulating whether the active hand contacts the passive hand. We further assessed somatosensory perception in the absence of any predictive cues in a condition that turned out to be essential for interpreting the experimental findings. In three pre-registered experiments, we demonstrate that action does not enhance the predicted touch (Experiment 1), that the previously reported ‘enhancement’ effects are driven by the reference condition used (Experiment 2), and that self-generated touch is robustly attenuated regardless of whether the two hands make contact (Experiment 3). Our results provide conclusive evidence that action does not enhance but attenuates predicted touch and prompt a reappraisal of recent experimental findings upon which theoretical frameworks proposing a perceptual enhancement by action prediction are based.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>somatosensory attenuation</kwd><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>cancellation</kwd><kwd>sharpening</kwd><kwd>enhancement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019–01909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Job</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Kilteni</surname><given-names>Konstantina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101059348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Job</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A series of pre-registered psychophysical studies on self-touch tested two opposing models of somatosensory attenuation (cancelation) and enhancement (sharpening) regarding how action affects perception, and revealed that action prediction produces an attenuation, and not an enhancement, of the predicted touch.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dominant motor control theories propose that the brain uses an internal forward model in combination with a copy of the motor command (efference copy) to predict the sensory consequences of our movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McNamee and Wolpert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shadmehr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wolpert and Flanagan, 2001</xref>). For example, the brain predicts the upcoming touch as one reaches toward an object. These predictions allow for the correction of motor errors without relying on sensory feedback that suffers from intrinsic delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>), thereby improving the estimation of the current state of our body by combining the predicted touch with the actual sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Scott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shadmehr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>). These predictions <italic>attenuate</italic> the perception of the self-generated input (sensory reafference) compared to that of externally generated input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Davidson and Wolpert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Franklin and Wolpert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wolpert and Kawato, 1998</xref>) and allow to infer whether the cause of the sensory input is the self or the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corlett, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Idei et al., 2022</xref>). A classic example of this attenuation is that we are unable to tickle ourselves with our own touch, yet we are easily tickled by the touch of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakemore et al., 2000a</xref>). The attenuation of sensory reafference – also referred to as sensory cancelation – is thought to be necessary to compensate for the limited capacity of the sensory systems by optimally prioritizing the perception of more informative externally generated stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McNamee and Wolpert, 2019</xref>). Thus, the attenuation model proposes that we dampen perceptual representations of expected self-generated stimuli to reduce redundancy and to highlight behaviorally relevant unexpected externally generated stimuli.</p><p>In contrast, an alternative theoretical framework proposes that predictions, including those arising from our motor commands, should not attenuate but instead enhance sensory signals, thereby allowing for sharper (i.e<italic>.</italic> more accurate) representations of predicted compared to unpredicted sensory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Press et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Press and Yon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yon et al., 2021</xref>). This <italic>enhancement</italic> account – also referred to as the sharpening account – posits that predictions based on our motor commands are equivalent to expectations formed by statistical regularities in sensory input or from prior knowledge (e.g. at the North Pole, one expects to see a polar bear rather than an elephant) and that these predictions should bias our perception towards our expectations. The proposal mainly stems from experimental research outside the domain of action and argues that weak, noisy, or ambiguous sensory input that is in line with prior expectations should be enhanced to achieve, on average, more accurate representations. For example, we are more biased to report the presence of visual events that are statistically likely to occur rather than unlikely events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chalk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wyart et al., 2012</xref>), more sensitive to low-level visual features that are in line with prior expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stein and Peelen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Teufel et al., 2018</xref>), and show greater biases when perceiving visual events that are congruent with our expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hudson et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hudson et al., 2016b</xref>). Such effects are thought to result from mechanisms that increase the ‘gain’ of expected information by altering the weights of different sensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Summerfield and de Lange, 2014</xref>). Thus, the enhancement model proposes that we amplify the perceptual representations of expected compared to unexpected sensory input.</p><p>In the somatosensory domain, evidence supporting the attenuation model has repeatedly shown that touch delivered to one (passive) hand by the other (active) hand (i.e. self-generated touch) is perceived as weaker or less ticklish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kilteni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kilteni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kilteni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kilteni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Knoetsch and Zimmermann, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McNaughton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Weiskrantz et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wolpe et al., 2016</xref>) and evokes attenuated somatosensory cortical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hesse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shergill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shergill et al., 2013</xref>) compared to a touch of identical intensity applied on the passive hand that is externally generated. In contrast, evidence supporting the enhancement model has shown that the action of the active hand results in an increase in the perceived intensity of touch on the passive hand, provided that the active hand never receives touch simultaneously with the passive hand (i.e. hands do not make contact) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). This enhancement finding has been recently used to support the sharpening model and to argue that attenuation effects are due to unspecific gating processes caused by the simultaneous double tactile stimulation of the two hands rather than action prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Press et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The attenuation (or cancellation) and enhancement (or sharpening) models present strikingly different hypotheses regarding how action influences the perception of sensory input and are supported by contradictory experimental evidence, leading to debates between researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corlett, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fuehrer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Press et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Press et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). Clarifying how predictions about the sensory consequences of our movements affect our perception is fundamental to understanding the interaction between perception and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McNamee and Wolpert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shadmehr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wolpert and Flanagan, 2001</xref>) but also for clinical and neurobiological theories of psychosis spectrum disorders, such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blakemore et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corlett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frith, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frith, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shergill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shergill et al., 2005</xref>) and schizotypy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>), as well as functional movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pareés et al., 2014</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wolpe et al., 2018</xref>), and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wolpe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present study aimed to contribute to this debate by directly contrasting the enhancement and attenuation models within the same paradigm. To this end, the same force discrimination task employed in earlier studies reporting attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kilteni et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kilteni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kilteni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kilteni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Timar et al., 2023</xref>) and enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>) was used to determine (a) whether movement of the right hand enhances the perceived magnitude of touch applied on the left hand when the two hands do not make contact (Experiments 1 and 2) and (b) whether attenuation effects are due to double tactile stimulation caused by the contact of the two hands or action prediction (Experiment 3). Capitalizing on the fact that <italic>any</italic> conclusion about whether action prediction ‘attenuates’ or ‘enhances’ the perception of the somatosensory input needs to be made with a comparison to one’s somatosensory perception in the absence of action, we also included a condition in which participants passively received externally generated touch, with which we compared the participants’ perception in all experimental conditions. Consequently, if participants perceive a touch as less or more intense during action than in the absence of action, we can infer that the received touch was attenuated or enhanced, respectively. This is a critical methodological novelty compared to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>) because if such baseline conditions are missing, the same patterns of results can be incorrectly attributed to ‘attenuation’ or ‘enhancement’: for example, if one condition produces less attenuation than another, it may be interpreted as enhancement, and vice versa. Indeed, it was this baseline condition that turned out to be critical for distinguishing between attenuation and enhancement effects. All studies and analysis plans were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework prior to data collection (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1.

The forces were delivered to the pulp of the left index finger by a cylindrical probe attached to a lever driven by a DC electric motor. In each trial, participants reported which force they felt was stronger (the <italic>test</italic> or the <italic>comparison</italic>). The intensity of the <italic>test</italic> force was fixed at 2 N, while the intensity of the <italic>comparison</italic> force was systematically varied among seven force levels (1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, or 3 N). In the <italic>contact</italic> condition, participants moved their right index finger towards their left index finger after an auditory cue and actively tapped on a force sensor placed on top of, but not in direct contact with, the probe. The participant’s active tap on the force sensor triggered the <italic>test</italic> force on their left index finger, thereby producing simultaneous stimulation of both fingers in the <italic>contact</italic> condition and the sensation of pressing with the right index finger against the left index finger through a rigid object. Participants were told that they would always make contact between their fingers (through the probe) in this condition. In the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, following the same auditory cue, participants moved their right index finger towards their left index finger. At the beginning of the condition, the force sensor was removed and replaced with a distance sensor that detected the relative distance of their active finger as it approached their left index finger to trigger the <italic>test</italic> force, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>. The distance threshold was set such that the position of the right index finger when triggering the <italic>test</italic> force was equivalent to that in the <italic>contact</italic> condition.

Before the experiment, participants were trained to make similar movements with their right index finger in the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions. Finally, in the <italic>baseline</italic> condition (externally generated touch), participants were told to relax their right hand, and each trial began with the same auditory cue followed by the <italic>test</italic> force delivered to the participants’ left index finger 800 ms after the cue.

Consequently, a PSE in a movement condition (<italic>contact</italic> or <italic>no-contact</italic>) that is lower than the PSE of the <italic>baseline</italic> condition indicates attenuation, while a PSE that is higher than the PSE of the <italic>baseline</italic> condition indicates enhancement (<bold>Methods</bold>). According to the attenuation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), attenuation of the somatosensory input on the left hand in the <italic>contact</italic> condition compared to the <italic>baseline</italic> condition should be observed (i.e. lower PSEs) due to the <italic>test</italic> force being a predicted consequence of the action of the right hand. However, regarding the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, earlier studies have shown that the mere movement of one hand is not sufficient to produce predictions of somatosensory input simultaneously applied on the other hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kilteni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shergill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wolpe et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, a bimanual sensorimotor context is needed such as during bimanual object manipulation and bimanual contact of the hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blakemore et al., 1998b</xref>). In the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition<italic>,</italic> the efference copy and the sensory input are inconsistent with the sensorimotor context of touching oneself; in this case, the context of applying force on one’s finger with another finger. In other words, the attenuation model suggests that not every voluntary movement will attenuate upcoming sensory input but a naturalistic sensorimotor mapping between the movement and the sensory input is needed. Based on this, neither attenuation nor enhancement should be observed in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition (i.e. no change in PSEs from <italic>baseline</italic>). In contrast, according to the enhancement model, if action enhances the received sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>), then higher PSEs in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition compared to the <italic>baseline</italic> condition should be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, since the enhancement model proposes that attenuation effects are attributed to unspecific (nonpredictive) gating effects caused by the simultaneous tactile stimulation of the two hands, touch in the <italic>contact</italic> condition should also be perceived as weaker, albeit not due to action prediction. In summary, Experiment 1 explicitly assessed whether action enhances the received touch when the index fingers of the two hands do not make contact.</p><p>The results showed a robust attenuation of the perceived touch when the two fingers made contact (<italic>contact</italic> condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E and F</xref>): the PSEs were significantly lower in the <italic>contact</italic> condition than in the <italic>baseline</italic> condition (<italic>W</italic> = 422.00, p&lt;0.001, rrb = 0.82, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [0.08, 0.25]).

However, motor inhibition (i.e. planning the hand movement but not executing it) can lead to suppression of somatosensory input both on the hand that is planned to move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoshiyama and Sheean, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Voss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walsh and Haggard, 2007</xref>) and the hand that would receive touch if the movement was executed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kilteni et al., 2018</xref>); moreover, such conditions result in a competition for attentional resources to inhibit the motor response with processes that encode sensory stimuli into memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiu and Egner, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yebra et al., 2019</xref>) (e.g. the <italic>test</italic> force in this paradigm).

Action attenuates predicted touch, even without simultaneous stimulation of the active hand</title><p>Within the framework of internal forward models, the absence of attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions of Experiments 1 and 2 is expected, given the lack of a sensorimotor context conducive to perceiving the touch as self-generated: when contact is never made, the forces applied on the passive left hand are only arbitrarily, and not causally, associated with the movement of the active right hand. However, if there is an expectation of contact between the hands, regardless of whether the contact is eventually made, touch should be attenuated as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, it could be argued that the absence of attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions is caused by the lack of simultaneous tactile stimulation of the active hand rather than by predictive mechanisms.</p><p>In Experiment 3, this hypothesis was explicitly tested with thirty new naïve participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The force sensor the participants tapped in the <italic>contact</italic> trials was now attached to a platform that could be automatically retracted. In the <italic>contact</italic> trials, participants tapped the force sensor to trigger the <italic>test</italic> force identically to Experiments 1 and 2, but in the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials, the platform automatically retracted before trial onset, unbeknownst to the participants, leading them to unexpectedly miss the contact with the sensor but still trigger the <italic>test</italic> force only by the position of their right index finger.

In Experiment 3, participants were unaware that they would miss the force sensor in the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials, so with no force sensor to stop the movement, their right index finger continued further downwards.

To further control that the attenuation observed in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition of Experiment 3 but not in the <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions of Experiments 1 and 2 was not driven by timing differences in the participants’ movement between experiments, we calculated the time the <italic>test</italic> force was delivered in the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions with respect to their movement endpoint (i.e. the force sensor press in the <italic>contact</italic> condition and the lowest vertical position in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition).

Our findings demonstrate that action does not enhance (Experiments 1 and 2) but attenuates the predicted touch (Experiment 3) compared to identical touch in the absence of action. Before discussing the findings, it is important to emphasize that to draw conclusions about whether perception is attenuated or enhanced in an experimental condition including action, it is necessary to include a baseline condition without action. Only comparing conditions that include action prevents differentiating a genuine effect of enhancement (or attenuation) from an effect of reduced attenuation (or enhancement) in one of the two conditions. This also applies to experimental manipulations that contrast predicted with unpredicted somatosensory stimuli during action (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref> for such comparisons). To this end, a <italic>baseline</italic> condition of pure somatosensory exafference (i.e. externally generated touch) was included in all the present experiments that allowed us to distinguish the direction of the effects.</p><p>The results of Experiment 1 showed a robust attenuation of the touch applied to the passive left hand when the two hands made contact (<italic>contact</italic> condition), but neither attenuation nor enhancement was caused by the mere movement of the right hand (<italic>no-contact</italic> condition). In contrast, the perceived intensity of touch in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition was similar to that of the <italic>baseline</italic> (i.e. externally generated touch). These findings are in line with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref>, who found no change in the participants’ somatosensory perception when the two hands did not make contact, but do not replicate those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>, who observed enhancement of touch in a <italic>no-contact</italic> condition. Experiment 2 further investigated the source of the previously reported enhancement effects and showed that they are in fact driven by the reference condition used: enhancement was observed only relative to a condition in which the touch was applied rapidly following a cue to inhibit the movement (i.e. a ‘do not move’ cue), as in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>), but not relative to an externally generated touch condition (our baseline). In support of this claim, Experiment 2 showed that a cue to inhibit the movement results in a significant reduction in the perceived intensity of the imperative stimulus (i.e. touch on the passive hand) compared to baseline perception. This is in line with previous evidence showing reduced amplitudes of somatosensory evoked potentials for tactile stimuli presented shortly following a cue to inhibit a movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoshiyama and Sheean, 1998</xref>), reduced perceived amplitude for tactile stimuli under the mere expectation to move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Voss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Voss et al., 2006</xref>), and reduced encoding of sensory stimuli following motor inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chiu and Egner, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yebra et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, rather than participants’ perception being enhanced in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, it is a reduction of the perceived intensity following the cue to inhibit the movement that leads to an apparent enhancement. In contrast, by including a novel externally generated touch condition as a <italic>baseline</italic> that involved neither motor planning nor response inhibition, it became clear that there were no enhancement effects.</p><p>Experiment 3 demonstrated that action attenuates the predicted touch even if the active hand does not receive simultaneous tactile stimulation with the passive hand. When participants simply moved their right hand to trigger the touch on their left hand (<italic>no-contact</italic> trials in Experiments 1 and 2), no change in their somatosensory perception was found. This suggests that an arbitrary mapping between the movement of the right hand and the delivery of touch on the left hand is insufficient to elicit attenuation. In contrast, when participants expected that they would touch their own hand (Experiment 3), significant attenuation was observed, even when the active hand unexpectedly missed the contact (<italic>no-contact</italic> trials, 20%). This pattern of results can be explained by the attenuation model, which suggests that the self-generation of a stimulus is in itself not sufficient for predictive attenuation, but that the action and its predicted sensory feedback are consistent with touching one’s own body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and Wolpert, 2008</xref>). Thus, a sensorimotor context that closely resembles tapping directly on the left index finger with the right index finger (self-touch) was critical for predictive attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2006</xref>). The findings of Experiment 3 also contradict the suggestion that attenuation on a passive hand reflects a nonpredictive gating of tactile input during movement of the active hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Press et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, several earlier studies showed gating effects only on the moving limb (movement effector) and not on the passive limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen and Starr, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papakostopoulos et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pertovaara et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rushton et al., 1981</xref>), and we have also recently shown that experimental paradigms identical to the one used in the present study produce attenuation effects but not gating effects on the passive hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022</xref>). Overall, the results suggest that attenuation effects are driven by action prediction and not the simultaneous tactile stimulation of the two hands. From an ecological point of view, in every self-touch behavior, we necessarily receive somatosensory input on the active hand and the body part that passively receives touch (‘touchant-touché’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schütz-Bosbach et al., 2009</xref>]), and it is within these sensorimotor contexts that the brain forms predictions about the somatosensory consequences on multiple body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and Wolpert, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the magnitude of attenuation was greater in the <italic>contact</italic> compared to the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition by approximately 35% in Experiment 3. This could suggest that the attenuation effect observed in the <italic>contact</italic> condition arises from multiple sources, one being the motor-based prediction and another source being the simultaneous touch on the active hand. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the findings that somatosensory attenuation has been previously observed in the absence of simultaneous tactile stimulation, for example, when imagining but not executing the right hand movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kilteni et al., 2018</xref>) or just before the hands make contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, no somatosensory attenuation is observed in the absence of action prediction, even if the two hands receive simultaneous tactile stimulation; for example, the passive displacement of the right hand towards the left hand that is accompanied by a double touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kilteni et al., 2020</xref>) or the mere delivery of simultaneous tactile stimulation on both hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2005</xref>) does not produce attenuation. Instead, our finding that the magnitude of attenuation was greater in the <italic>contact</italic> than the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition in Experiment 3 may instead reflect a decrease of attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials, due to the unexpected omission of contact influencing the perceived magnitude of touch in a postdictive manner. Specifically, the unexpected omission of contact in the minority of trials (20%) could be seen as a form of stimulus omission akin to so-called ‘silent oddballs’ that are known to generate prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busse and Woldorff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karamürsel and Bullock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">SanMiguel et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">SanMiguel et al., 2013b</xref>). That is, although participants clearly attenuated the touch predicted by their movement in the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials, their expectation of contact was necessarily violated. In one of our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kilteni et al., 2019</xref>) using the same force discrimination task as in the present study we showed in three experiments that participants experienced the touch to be stronger (i.e<italic>.</italic> less attenuation) and more ticklish when triggering a prediction error (&lt;17% frequency). Similarly, research outside the domain of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kusnir et al., 2020</xref>) has found that perception is improved for tactile events delivered at unpredictable compared to predictable temporal onsets, also suggesting that tactile perception is facilitated in the presence of prediction error. In line with these previous results, the decreased attenuation we observed in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition could be attributed to the prediction error. Additionally, this violation could be considered a novel event given its infrequency. Novel events can have several consequences for cognition, including transient enhancements of perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schomaker and Meeter, 2012</xref>), facilitated encoding of information into working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mayer et al., 2011</xref>) as well as changes in the allocation of attentional resources in a postdictive manner (for a review of the effects of novelty on cognition see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schomaker and Meeter, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Some authors have criticized the comparison of perceived intensity of sensory stimuli in self-generated and externally generated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Press et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yon et al., 2021</xref>). A frequent criticism is that tactile input may be ‘predicted’ in self-generated conditions through action and ‘unpredicted’ in externally generated (passive) conditions that do not involve action. This concern can be ruled out since in all three experiments, the stimulus in the <italic>baseline (</italic>i.e<italic>.</italic> externally generated touch) condition was delivered at a fixed timepoint (800 ms after the cue); therefore, participants could predict it in the absence of motor-based predictions. Second, it has been argued that somatosensory attenuation findings may be driven by dual-task requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Press et al., 2020</xref>) present only in self-generated conditions that could increase the working memory load or result in a shift of attention towards the active hand. A similar criticism has been suggested in which the mere movement of the active hand in self-generated conditions can result in a nonpredictive gating of tactile input. However, these explanations can also be ruled out, given that dual-task requirements and movement of the active hand were present in the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions of all three experiments without concomitant attenuation effects. Indeed, if dual-task requirements, or the mere presence of movement during the perceptual task, were sufficient to cause attenuation effects, then attenuation would have been observed in the <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions of Experiments 1 and 2. Furthermore, if the mere simultaneous tactile stimulation on the active hand was responsible for the attenuation effect, we would not have observed attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition of Experiment 3. Finally, alternative explanations based on differences in other psychophysical parameters, movement kinematics, or timings between experiments can also be ruled out.</p><p>How can the findings that action prediction attenuates touch be reconciled with those showing that expectations outside the domain of action improve sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Press et al., 2020</xref>)? While it is difficult to directly compare these lines of research because of differences in the sensory modality investigated, the task designs used, and the perceptual measures employed, we speculate that there are numerous possible reasons why action prediction may not have the same effect on perception as prediction mechanisms outside the domain of action. First, research on action-based predictions concerns ubiquitous associations between actions and their sensory consequences that we are continually exposed to throughout the lifespan. For example, we are constantly exposed to associations between our motor behaviors and their tactile consequences during self-touch, even as early as 13 weeks in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kurjak et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, research on sensory expectations outside the domain of action primarily concerns arbitrary associations between stimuli that are typically learned only during the time course of a given task. It is, therefore, conceivable that separable mechanisms may operate to predict action effects versus stimulus-stimulus associations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dogge et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dogge et al., 2019b</xref> for discussion). Second, higher-level expectations, such as explicit prior knowledge that a specific sensory event is likely, might not operate in the same way as lower-level action predictions; for example, it has been proposed that action-based predictions inhibit expected stimuli, while sensory expectations potentiate the expected sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">de Lange et al., 2018</xref>). Most importantly, from a theoretical perspective, attenuating the predicted sensory consequences of actions does not necessarily mean that the brain forms inaccurate representations of the world but instead indicates a flexible strategy that prioritizes more informative externally generated events.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that this study investigated the perception of self-generated touch during an action directed toward one’s own body. Thus, perception was assessed on a passive body part that was the target of a movement of an active body part (i.e. moving the right hand to touch the static left hand). This focus was chosen because extensive previous research has shown deteriorated performance when detecting or discriminating touch (both self-generated and externally generated) delivered on a moving limb, a phenomenon referred to as movement-related <italic>gating</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chapman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Voudouris and Fiehler, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Voudouris and Fiehler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Williams et al., 1998</xref>). By assessing somatosensory perception on a static limb, we were able to isolate the effect of action prediction on somatosensory perception from other perceptual phenomena related to the movement per se including movement-related gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen and Starr, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Papakostopoulos et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pertovaara et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rushton et al., 1981</xref>). However, it is interesting to note that during the active exploration of objects through touch, referred to as <italic>active touch,</italic> self-generated touch also occurs, albeit only on the moving limb. Studies on active touch have observed improved perception of object features, such as texture or edge orientation when actively exploring an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morley et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>) compared to passive exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bensmaia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peters et al., 2015</xref>). At first, the improved perception observed during active touch might appear paradoxical to observations of movement-related gating and predictive attenuation effects: if anything, active touch should result in worse perception than passive touch. However, it has been shown that humans optimize their exploratory movements to minimize these effects and maximize the quality of their sensory feedback. For example, it is known that the degree of gating decreases as movement speed slows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angel and Malenka, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chapman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 1990</xref>) and it has been proposed that participants optimize the speed of movement during active touch to avoid high speeds associated with tactile gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, when exploring objects through active touch, weaker forces are typically applied (e.g. &lt;1 N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>]) that elicit less attenuation than stronger forces, as shown in the classic force-matching task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shergill et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, differences in the task context might primarily influence how one moves (e.g. the act of swatting a fly from one’s arm versus feeling for a bump on one’s skin), which can have disparate ensuing effects on perception depending on the movement kinematics.</p><p>Debates between researchers supporting attenuation or enhancement are useful and fruitful for scientific dialogue and advancement. The present study revisited recent findings on somatosensory enhancement during action and showed that when the requirement to inhibit the action is removed from the baseline, action predictions do not enhance but attenuate the received somatosensory input. Our results are in strong alignment with animal studies showing that action attenuates the predicted sensory consequences (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brooks and Cullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cullen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schneider and Mooney, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Straka et al., 2018</xref>]).

Following initial piloting, it was deemed appropriate to reduce the overall length of the task by including fewer trials (see <italic>Methods details</italic>). Three additional ANOVAs were also conducted to compare the results across the three experiments and the kinematics across experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experimental setup</title><p>Participants sat comfortably on a chair with their arms placed on a table. The left hand rested palm up, with the index finger placed on a molded support. On each trial, a motor (Maxon EC Motor EC 90 flat; Switzerland) delivered two forces (the <italic>test</italic> force and the <italic>comparison</italic> force) on the pulp of the left index finger through a cylindrical probe (25 mm height) with a flat aluminum surface (20 mm diameter) attached to a lever on the motor. A force sensor (FSG15N1A, Honeywell Inc; diameter, 5 mm; minimum resolution, 0.01 N; response time, 1 ms; measurement range, 0–15 N) within the probe recorded the forces applied on the left index finger. Following the presentation of the two forces, participants were asked to verbally report which of the two forces felt stronger – the first or the second. A second identical force sensor within an identical cylindrical probe (‘active force sensor’) was placed on top of, but not in contact with, the probe of the left index finger.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Force-discrimination task</title><p>Participants judged the intensity of a <italic>test</italic> force and a <italic>comparison</italic> force (100 ms duration each) separated by a random interval between 800 ms and 1200 ms in a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. The intensity of the test force was 2  N, while the intensity of the comparison force was systematically varied among seven force levels (1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, or 3  N). In all the conditions, the forces were delivered by the same motor, to precisely control their magnitude. However, the source of the force was manipulated across conditions such that the force was triggered by the participants’ contact with a force sensor (<italic>contact</italic> condition), their finger movement (<italic>no-contact</italic> condition), or automatically by the stimulus computer (<italic>baseline</italic> condition).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Experimental design and procedures</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>There were three conditions in Experiment 1 presented in three blocks separately: the <italic>baseline</italic> (i.e. externally generated touch) condition, the <italic>contact</italic> condition, and the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition.</p><p>In the <italic>baseline</italic> condition, participants did not move their limbs but passively received the <italic>test</italic> and the <italic>comparison</italic> force on the left index finger. This <italic>baseline</italic> condition was used to assess the participants’ somatosensory perception in the absence of any movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kilteni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kilteni et al., 2019</xref>). Each trial began with an auditory cue (100 ms duration, 997 Hz) followed by the <italic>test</italic> force delivered to the participant’s left index finger 800 ms after the cue by the motor. The <italic>comparison</italic> force was then delivered at a random interval between 800 ms and 1200 ms after the <italic>test</italic> force.</p><p>In the <italic>contact</italic> condition, participants started each trial by holding their right index finger approximately 10cm above their left index finger. The start position was marked with a visual marker placed next to their right index finger while the final position was the probe of the active force sensor. The same auditory cue was presented as in the <italic>baseline</italic> condition, but participants now moved their right index finger downwards toward their left index finger and actively tapped on the active force sensor placed on top of, but not in contact with, the probe. The participant’s active tap on the force sensor triggered the motor to apply the <italic>test</italic> force on their left index finger (threshold 0.2N). The tap of their right index finger triggered the test force on their left index finger with an intrinsic delay of 36 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The <italic>comparison</italic> force was then delivered at a random interval between 800 ms and 1200 ms after the <italic>test</italic> force. As in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asimakidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kilteni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022</xref>), participants were asked to tap, neither too weakly nor too strongly, with their right index finger, ‘as if tapping the screen of their smartphone’. This instruction was provided to ensure that the relationship between the force they applied with their right index finger on the force sensor and the force they received on their left index finger by the motor (2N) remained approximately constant throughout the experiment, thereby establishing perceived causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and Wolpert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kilteni, 2023</xref>). Indeed, across all three experiments, we observed low variability in the exerted forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D-F</xref> ) (± 0.13N SEM in Experiment 1, ± 0.12N SEM in Experiment 2 and ± 0.11N SEM in Experiment 3) establishing an approximately constant gain between the exerted and the applied forces. Critically, it has been previously shown that the magnitude of attenuation remains unaffected by halving or doubling the gain between the force applied by the active finger and the force delivered on the passive hand as long as the gain remains constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and Wolpert, 2008</xref>). This should not be surprising given that when one finger transmits a force through an object to another finger, the resulting force depends also on the object’s properties (e.g. shape, material, contact area) and the angle at which the finger contacts the object.</p><p>In the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, the participants started each trial by holding their right index finger 10cm above their left index finger, identically to the <italic>contact</italic> condition. For this block, the active force sensor was removed and replaced by a distance sensor that detected the position of the right index finger. The distance sensor was placed on top of, but not in contact with, the probe. Following the same auditory cue, participants moved their right index finger towards their left index finger. To restrict the participants’ right index finger movement within similar movement ranges as in the <italic>contact</italic> condition and avoid contact with the distance sensor placed underneath, a second visual marker indicated the final position of the right index finger above the distance sensor (5cm from the marker indicating the initial position). The distance sensor was connected to an Arduino microcontroller that controlled a servo motor. The servo motor and the force sensor were placed 2 meters away from the participants’ hands and hidden from view. Once the distance sensor detected that the position of the right index finger became smaller than a preset threshold, it triggered the servo motor that hit the force sensor and triggered the <italic>test</italic> force. We accounted for the additional delay of the distance sensor by setting the position threshold for the distance sensor slightly higher than the lowest position the participants were asked to reach with their right index finger. Therefore, the test force would be delivered at a similar timing to the participants’ right index finger endpoint between the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact conditions</italic>. This position threshold was set based on significant pilot testing prior to all experiments. Indeed, there was a minimal time difference between the two setups across experiments (17 ms average delay) with the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition leading, rather than lagging the <italic>contact</italic> one (see <bold>Results</bold>). The <italic>comparison</italic> force was delivered at a random interval between 800 ms and 1200 ms after the <italic>test</italic> force. Therefore, in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, there was no touch on the right index finger simultaneously with the <italic>test</italic> force on the left index finger.</p><p>Before the experiment, participants were trained to make similar movements with their right index finger in the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions, emphasis was placed on restricting their right index finger movements to between the two visual markers in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition. The 3D position of the right index finger was recorded using a Polhemus Liberty tracker (240Hz). Kinematic information was used to compare the movements between the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions and to reject any trials in which the participant did not trigger the test stimulus with their movement, or trials in which the participant did not move as instructed in the training (see below). Participants were administered white noise through headphones to mask any sounds made by the motor to serve as a cue for the task. The loudness of the white noise was adjusted such that participants could hear the auditory tones of the trial. In all conditions the participants’ left index finger as well as the motor that delivered the force to their left index finger, was occluded from vision. This was done to prevent participants using any visual cues to discriminate between the two forces.</p><p>Each block consisted of 70 trials resulting in 210 trials per participant. Thus, the proportion of <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> trials was the same (50–50%). The order of the conditions was fully counterbalanced across participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>The 2-AFC task was identical to that of Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, there were five conditions in total: the <italic>baseline</italic> condition, the <italic>contact</italic> condition, the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, and two additional NOGO conditions (<italic>NOGO contact</italic> and <italic>NOGO no-contact</italic>). Trials of the NOGO conditions were pseudo-randomly intermixed with trials of the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions, respectively (GO trials). The five conditions were presented in three separate blocks: the <italic>baseline</italic>, <italic>contact</italic> (GO and NOGO trials), and <italic>no-contact</italic> (GO and NOGO trials) blocks.</p><p>In the <italic>contact</italic> block, 50% of trials began with an auditory ‘GO’ cue (100 ms duration high tone of 2458Hz) instructing participants to tap the active force sensor to trigger the <italic>test</italic> force (identically to the <italic>contact</italic> condition of Experiment 1). On the remaining 50% of trials an auditory ‘NOGO’ cue (100 ms duration low tone of 222Hz) instructed participants to withhold their movement and the <italic>test</italic> force was then delivered 800 ms following the NOGO cue. The <italic>no-contact</italic> block was identical to the <italic>contact</italic> block, except that the <italic>test</italic> force was triggered by the position of the right index finger without contact with the force sensor (identically to the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition of Experiment 1). The cue tone in the <italic>baseline</italic> block was the same as the cue tone in the NOGO trials (100 ms duration low tone of 222Hz).</p><p>Therefore, this design replicated the experimental design of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref> with the additional inclusion of the <italic>baseline</italic> (i.e. externally generated touch) condition. As in Experiment 1, we recorded the 3D position of the right index finger, and the registered kinematic information was used to compare the movements between the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> conditions and reject any trials in which the participants did not trigger the <italic>test</italic> stimulus with their movement, trials in which the participants did not move as instructed in the training (see below), and trials in which the participants moved while instructed not to do so by the auditory cues (NOGO trials). As in Experiment 1, participants were administered white noise and the loudness of the white noise was adjusted such that participants could clearly hear the GO and NOGO auditory cues of the trial.</p><p>The <italic>baseline</italic> block consisted of 70 trials, and the <italic>contact</italic> and <italic>no-contact</italic> blocks consisted of 70 GO trials and 70 NOGO trials each, resulting in 350 trials in total per participant. The order of the blocks was fully counterbalanced across participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Experiment 3</title><p>The 2-AFC task and the experimental conditions (<italic>baseline</italic>, <italic>contact</italic>, and <italic>no-contact</italic>) were identical to those of Experiment 1, except for the following. <italic>Contact</italic> trials (80%) were now pseudo-randomly intermixed with <italic>no-contact</italic> trials (20%) within the same block. The force sensor was now attached to a plastic platform that could be automatically retracted by a servo motor, depending on the trial type. Upon retraction, a distance sensor placed underneath the platform was revealed. In the <italic>contact</italic> trials, participants tapped the force sensor to trigger the <italic>test</italic> force identically to Experiments 1 and 2. In the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials, the platform was automatically retracted before trial onset, unbeknownst to the participants. This led participants to unexpectedly miss the active force sensor and instead trigger the <italic>test</italic> force only by the position of their right index finger. In all conditions, the participants’ vision was occluded with a blindfold, and white noise was administered via headphones to prevent any visual or auditory cues indicating that the force sensor had been retracted in <italic>no-contact</italic> trials. Note that the blindfold was used for all conditions of Experiment 3 to control for any effects of lack of vision between conditions and allow comparisons between conditions (e.g. <italic>baseline</italic> minus <italic>no-contact</italic>, <italic>no-contact</italic> minus <italic>contact</italic>) with those of Experiments 1 and 2. The <italic>baseline</italic> block was identical to that of Experiments 1 and 2, except for the use of a blindfold.</p><p>In Experiment 3, the number of trials was reduced from 70 to 56 to shorten the total experiment time to less than 90 min, similar to Experiment 2. Thus, there were 56 <italic>no-contact</italic> trials (20%) and 224 contact trials (80%). Similarly, there were 56 trials in the <italic>baseline</italic> condition. This resulted in 336 trials per participant.

The present study rigorously probes these alternative hypotheses with three pre-registered experiments.

Address Thomas et al.'s Exp 2, where the results suggest additional factors influencing inhibition (as indicated by Reviewer 2).</p><p>3.

I imagine that there is a large error as the finger accelerated through where the sensor was expected to be. Therefore, it seems possible that the observed attenuation could be due to distraction by the error and unexpected movement. I don't disagree that prediction could play a role, but I would be cautious with that interpretation.</p><p>Please explain how the subjects' vision was occluded in Experiment 3.

The authors mention that attenuation evidence has been attributed to &quot;unspecific gating processes caused by the simultaneous double tactile stimulation of the two hands&quot; but this is not particularly informative. What did these proponents consider to be special about double tactile stimulation that it should result in the opposite effect on perception as single tactile stimulation? Of course, this is tangential to the present manuscript, but if there is more of a story to this, it may help the reader to know.</p><p>Line 143: I didn't immediately realize that the comparison force was always delivered without the involvement of the right hand.

The importance of the relative claims is also emphasized in Lines 112-125 of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Address Thomas et al.'s Exp 2, where the results suggest additional factors influencing inhibition (as indicated by Reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a detailed response to the point raised by Reviewer 2 regarding the enhancement effect for expected touch when contrasting two conditions, including action (Experiment 2 in Thomas et al., (2022)). In short, based on our findings and those of Bays et al. (2006), we first argue that the touch delivered in Experiment 2 more closely resembled externally generated touch than self-generated touch<italic>.</italic> In addition to the arbitrary mapping between movement and touch (<italic>no-contact</italic> trials), Thomas et al. (2022) also varied the gain between the movement of the active hand and the touch applied on the passive hand on every trial, which made it difficult to establish a causal relationship between movement and touch. Second, we would like to emphasize that in somatosensory research, there is no consensus about how expectations affect perception, even outside the domain of action. For example, Kusnir et al., (2019) recently showed that unexpected touch was perceptually facilitated, in contrast to the findings of Thomas et al., (2022) that expected touch is facilitated. Third, without any baseline condition included, it is hard to interpret the pattern of effects reported in Thomas et al., (2022); for example, are both conditions attenuated but one condition to a lesser extent or is one condition attenuated and one condition perceived accurately? Therefore, we argue that future studies are needed to replicate previous results regarding how expectations affect the perception of externally generated touch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Experiment 3 includes multiple features, such as lack of vision and surprise/distraction, that could also potentially influence perception and lead to attenuation. Please address these potential confounds, and how they may alter the current interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the lack of vision, we blindfolded the participants in Experiment 3 to prevent them from seeing the force sensor retract on the (unexpected) <italic>no-contact</italic> trials, which was necessary for building and maintaining the expectation that they would likely contact the force sensor. Importantly, blindfolding participants in Experiment 3 cannot explain any differences between conditions because participants were blindfolded in all conditions of Experiment 3 (<italic>contact</italic>, <italic>no-contact</italic> and <italic>baseline</italic>). Since in the analyses of Experiment 3 (Lines 355-376), we always compared between conditions, any putative effects from blindfolding were effectively removed. Importantly, this also applies to the comparisons that we made between Experiment 3 and Experiments 1 and 2, since all these analyses (Lines 362-376) compared the difference between two conditions (e.g., PSE values for <italic>contact</italic> versus <italic>no-contact</italic> trials or <italic>baseline</italic> versus <italic>no-contact</italic> trials) between the experiments. Once again, any putative effects from blindfolding were effectively removed. Thus, the blindfolding used in Experiment 3 did not alter the interpretation of any of our results.</p><p>Regarding the prediction error/surprise/distraction present in the (unexpected) <italic>no-contact</italic> trials of Experiment 3, this was a necessary byproduct of building and violating the expectation that contact would be made on <italic>no-contact</italic> trials. However, it is unlikely that prediction error or surprise <italic>per se</italic> produced attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition of Experiment 3 given the literature. First, in our previous study (Kilteni et al., 2019) that used the same force discrimination task and presented touch with or without prediction error using similar proportions of trials as in the present study, we found that participants experienced the more surprising touch to be stronger and more ticklish in the presence of this prediction error, rather than attenuated. Second, previous studies on the effects of surprise/novelty on cognition have shown transient enhancements of perception (Schomaker and Meeter, 2012), facilitated encoding of information into working memory (Mayer et al., 2011) and changes in the allocation of attentional resources in a postdictive manner (for a review of the effects of novelty on cognition, see Schomaker and Meeter, 2015). Interestingly, in the tactile domain, Kusnir et al. (2019) found that tactile stimuli delivered at an unexpected time were perceived with higher sensitivity than the same stimuli delivered at an expected time. Based on this literature, we propose that prediction errors/surprise may act to increase the perceived magnitude, in line with the decreased attenuation that we observed in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition relative to the <italic>contact</italic> condition of Experiment 3.</p><p>We have made changes to the manuscript to refer to these points (Lines 821-827 and 546-554).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

I imagine that there is a large error as the finger accelerated through where the sensor was expected to be. Therefore, it seems possible that the observed attenuation could be due to distraction by the error and unexpected movement. I don't disagree that prediction could play a role, but I would be cautious with that interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this. We agree that the unexpected <italic>no-contact</italic> trials in Experiment 3 likely induced some form of prediction error related to the omission of touch on the active hand. For this reason, we raised the possibility in the Discussion that the unexpected omission of touch on the active hand (in <italic>no-contact</italic> trials) could have <italic>postdictive</italic> effects on perception, such as reducing the attenuation of the predicted touch on the passive hand (Lines 526-560). We reasoned that the presence of prediction error is a plausible explanation for why less attenuation was observed for the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials than <italic>contact</italic> trials in that experiment. For example, in one of our previous studies (Kilteni et al., 2019) that used the same force discrimination task and presented touch with or without prediction error using a similar proportion of trials as in the present study, we found that participants experienced the touch to be stronger and more ticklish in the presence of a prediction error, rather than attenuated. Similarly, in the present study, we observed less attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> condition, which can be interpreted as the result of this distraction/prediction error effect. Similarly, research outside the domain of action (Kusnir et al. 2019) showed that perception is improved for tactile events delivered at unpredictable compared to predictable temporal onsets, also suggesting that tactile perception is facilitated in the presence of prediction error.</p><p>We have added text to the Discussion to refer to these previous results and explain why prediction error is the likely cause of reduced attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials of Experiment 3 (Lines 546-554).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain how the subjects' vision was occluded in Experiment 3.

As we wrote in Lines 112-125, we consider the relativity of these claims essential, as the same patterns of results can be incorrectly attributed to “attenuation” or “enhancement” without referring to the reference condition.</p><p>Regarding Thomas et al.’s (2022) findings in Experiment 2, we agree that without any (physical, simulated, or expected) contact between the fingers, attenuation is not expected to occur under the classic prediction-based attenuation model since the sensorimotor context necessary for experiencing the touch as self-generated is not present. Our experiments and those of Bays et al. (2006) strongly support this conclusion. We agree with the reviewer that it is interesting that Thomas et al. (2022) found a stronger perceived intensity of touch when it was delivered to the expected finger (i.e., validly cued) compared to the unexpected finger (i.e., invalidly cued). However, we believe that it is difficult to draw conclusions from Thomas et al.’s (2022) findings in Experiment 2 (and Experiment 3) for two reasons.</p><p>First, based on our findings, the stimuli delivered by Thomas et al. (2022) more closely resembled exafferent touch (externally generated) that is co-presented with another event (in this case, an action) than <italic>reafferent</italic> touch (self-generated touch)<italic>.</italic> Here, it should be emphasized that in addition to the arbitrary mapping between the movement and the touch (<italic>no-contact</italic> trials), Thomas et al. (2022) additionally varied the intensity of the <italic>test</italic> force (the force that accompanied the movement) on every trial while keeping the comparison force fixed. In other words, every time the participant made the same action (i.e., moved their right index/ring finger), they received a force on their left finger that varied randomly in its magnitude. In contrast, previous studies using force discrimination tasks (Asimakidou et al., 2022; Bays et al., 2006; Kilteni et al., 2021, 2020, 2019; Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2022; Timar et al., 2023) always kept the <italic>test</italic> force constant to establish a perceived causal relationship between the participant’s right index finger movement and touch on the left index finger; that is, every time participants moved their right index finger to press the sensor, they always received the same force on their left index finger. Although we were able to replicate Thomas et al.’s (2022) Experiment 1 findings while also keeping the <italic>test</italic> force fixed in our Experiment 2, it is important to keep in mind that having a variable gain on every trial should decrease attenuation and compromise the experience of the touch as self-generated. Moreover, since the physical magnitude of the tactile stimuli was not reported by Thomas et al. (2022) (i.e., we do not know the numbers of Newtons of the applied forces because they were not measured), it is difficult to assess the impact of a constantly changing gain from trial to trial. Additionally, without any assessment of the perceived intensity of the touch in the absence of action (i.e., a <italic>baseline</italic> condition), it is not possible to interpret the pattern of effects reported in Thomas et al. (2022): for example, are both conditions attenuated but one condition to a lesser extent, is one condition attenuated and one condition perceived accurately, or are both enhanced?</p><p>Second, it is also important to note that there is no consensus about how expectations affect somatosensory perception outside the domain of action. Notably, whereas Thomas et al. (2022) showed that expected touch is perceptually enhanced relative to unexpected touch, others have shown that unexpected touch is perceptually enhanced relative to expected touch (Kusnir et al., 2019). Thus, we argue that future studies are needed to test and replicate previous effects of expectations on the perception of externally generated touch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>How have proponents of the enhancement account explained the attenuation evidence? The authors mention that attenuation evidence has been attributed to &quot;unspecific gating processes caused by the simultaneous double tactile stimulation of the two hands&quot; but this is not particularly informative. What did these proponents consider to be special about double tactile stimulation that it should result in the opposite effect on perception as single tactile stimulation? Of course, this is tangential to the present manuscript, but if there is more of a story to this, it may help the reader to know.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Sensory gating or movement-related gating is a well-documented phenomenon in which <italic>all</italic> tactile inputs applied on a moving limb are suppressed (e.g., have higher detection thresholds) compared to when the limb is at rest (Chapman et al., 1996; Williams et al., 1998; Williams and Chapman, 2000). This mechanism is understood to be distinct from the predictive attenuation of reafferent (i.e., self-generated) tactile input, which operates to attenuate only the input predicted by the movement (for an extensive discussion on the differences between attenuation and gating, please see Kilteni and Ehrsson (2022)). Thomas et al. (2022) attributed previous attenuation effects to ‘unspecific’ or ‘generalized’ gating processes that transfer from the moving hand to the passive hand when the two hands make contact rather than to action prediction. However, to our knowledge, there is no neurophysiological evidence supporting the proposal that generalized gating from the movement of the active hand transfers to passive limbs. In contrast, there is previous experimental evidence demonstrating that gating effects do not transfer to a passive limb (Chapman et al., 1987; Cohen and Starr, 1987; Colino et al., 2014; Papakostopoulos et al., 1975; Pertovaara et al., 1992; Rushton et al., 1981), as discussed on Lines 514-519. Moreover, if attenuation was due to a putative transfer of gating from the active to the passive limb, we would not have observed attenuation in the <italic>no-contact</italic> trials of Experiment 3, where the hands did not make contact.</p><p>In our manuscript, we have clarified this point in Line 90 and extended our discussion of this point in Lines 578-580.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 143: I didn't immediately realize that the comparison force was always delivered without the involvement of the right hand. It might help others unfamiliar with this paradigm to spell that out.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.
