While extensive studies indicated roles of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) in sensing certain nutrients for controlling growth and metabolism, the roles of fatty acids and lipids in TOR-involved nutrient/food responses are obscure. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> halts postembryonic growth and development shortly after hatching in response to monomethyl branched-chain fatty acid (mmBCFA) deficiency. Here, we report that an mmBCFA-derived sphingolipid, d17iso-glucosylceramide, is a critical metabolite in regulating growth and development. Further analysis indicated that this lipid function is mediated by TORC1 and antagonized by the NPRL-2/3 complex in the intestine. Strikingly, the essential lipid function is bypassed by activating TORC1 or inhibiting NPRL-2/3. Our findings uncover a novel lipid-TORC1 signaling pathway that coordinates nutrient and metabolic status with growth and development, advancing our understanding of the physiological roles of mmBCFAs, ceramides, and TOR.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00429.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00429.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00429.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals require nutrients, including carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids, for development and growth, and to maintain the normal functioning of cells. However, in most natural environments, the availability of food tends to fluctuate. Some animals have therefore acquired the ability to dramatically reduce their metabolic activity, and thus their energy and nutrient needs to survive fasting conditions.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a transparent nematode worm that is used extensively as a model organism. When <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae hatch in a food-free environment, they enter a quiescent state in which they suspend growth and cell division to conserve energy. However, the mechanisms that underlie this ability are not fully understood.</p><p>Here, Zhu et al. reveal that a type of lipid called a sphingolipid is required for <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae to begin postembryonic development. When this lipid is absent in the environment and not synthesized internally, the larvae remain in a state of arrested development, which can be overcome by resupplying the lipid. Zhu et al. show that the lipid acts through a signaling pathway involving an enzyme complex called TORC1 and that the effect of the lipid can be blocked by another protein complex called NPRL-2/3. TORC1 is well known for its role in sensing amino acids and growth factors, but this is the first time that it has been shown to be involved in detecting lipids. Strikingly, Zhu et al. also show that, in the absence of the lipid, postembryonic growth and development can be initiated by activating TORC1 or inhibiting NPRL-2/3.</p><p>The work of Zhu et al. thus reveals a novel regulatory function of a specific fatty acid and sphingolipid variant that is used by <italic>C. elegans</italic> to coordinate its growth and development with its metabolic status or the availability of nutrients. Since all components of the pathway are conserved in mammals, the results could help to improve our understanding of how caloric restriction influences human health and aging.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00429.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00429.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>branched-chain fatty acid</kwd><kwd>growth arrest</kwd><kwd>nutrient sensing</kwd><kwd>NPRL</kwd><kwd>glucosylceramide</kwd><kwd>target of rapamycin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Huanhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A lipid acts to promote the development of nematode worm larvae through activation of an enzyme complex called TORC1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of animal growth and development in response to nutritional cues is an intensely studied problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hietakangas and Cohen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). In animals, nutrient signals are perceived in specialized tissues and are then communicated to all other tissues to coordinate growth and development. The target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes (TORC1 and TORC2) are known to function in sensing various nutrient signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma and Blenis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zoncu et al., 2012</xref>), and their roles are connected to growth, metabolism, stress responses, and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He and Klionsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howell and Manning, 2011</xref>). While amino acids, energy, and growth factors have been described as nutrient inputs to TOR complexes, roles of lipid molecules as signals to these systems in controlling postembryonic growth and development were not known. Clearly, it is also essential to use whole-animal models to investigate how different signaling systems in different tissues interact to specify decisions regarding postembryonic development and behaviors.</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the first larval stage has been established as a model system for the study of animal growth and development in response to food availability. When hatched in food-free surroundings, this nematode enters a quiescent state, termed L1 diapause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munoz and Riddle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh and Sternberg, 2006</xref>). An insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling (IIS) pathway plays a critical role in the induction of L1 diapause and survival of the developmentally arrested animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gems et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh and Sternberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kniazeva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Ashrafi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soukas et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, TOR complexes have also been indicated to play prominent roles in regulating postembryonic growth and lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vellai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Syntichaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honjoh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lucanic et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) are widely present in bacteria, plants, and animals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolaides and Ray, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ran-Ressler et al., 2008</xref>). In mammals, mmBCFAs are derived from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morii and Kaneda, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oku et al., 1994</xref>), although the remainder of the de novo pathway has not been delineated. The physiological roles of these FA variants are essentially unknown, even though they were found to be present at very high levels in certain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolaides and Ray, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ran-Ressler et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, readily detectable mmBCFAs C15ISO and C17ISO are synthesized from the BCAA leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kniazeva et al., 2004</xref>). The key enzymes in this de novo synthesis pathway, including the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), an FA elongase (ELO-5), and an acyl CoA synthetase (ACS-1), are evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kniazeva et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2008</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that newly hatched <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are deficient for mmBCFAs cannot initiate postembryonic growth and development, and instead enter L1 diapause. Further genetic analysis suggested that this developmental arrest is independent of the IIS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kniazeva et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2008</xref>). It was not clear whether the essential roles of mmBCFAs and their derived lipids were due to structural requirements for animal development, as was suggested by other studies, or due to regulatory functions specific to cellular signaling processes. Testing these hypotheses using model organisms is highly significant because roles of fatty acids and lipids function as nutrient signals for postembryonic development are in general poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we discovered that (1) an mmBCFA-derived glucosylceramide (d17iso-GlcCer) mediates the function of mmBCFAs in promoting postembryonic growth and development and (2) d17iso-GlcCer acts through a signaling system that includes the NPRL-2/NPRL-3 protein complex (negative factor) and TORC1 (positive factor) to promote postembryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A sphingolipid composed of a mmBCFA-derived long chain base mediates the essential role of mmBCFAs in the initiation of postembryonic growth and development</title><p><italic>elo-5</italic> loss-of-function mutants (termed <italic>elo-5(−)</italic> hereafter) are deficient for mmBCFAs and are developmentally arrested at the early L1 stage. This phenotype is completely rescued by dietary supplementation of mmBCFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kniazeva et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2008</xref>). We found that in mmBCFA-deficient <italic>elo-5(−)</italic> larvae, the amount of mmBCFA-containing sphingolipids were dramatically reduced and thus asked if this mmBCFA function is mediated by a sphingolipid.</p><p>Sphingolipids are a class of well-known bioactive lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>) that are composed of an aliphatic amino alcohol backbone called the sphingoid base or long chain base (LCB), and usually an N-acylated fatty acid (FA) side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, both the LCB and the FA side chain may derive from mmBCFAs, such as C15ISO and C17ISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chitwood et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerdt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this study, a sphingolipid with a mmBCFA-derived LCB is termed d17iso-sphingolipid, whereas a sphingolipid with a C17ISO-derived FA side chain and a straight LCB is termed c17iso-sphingolipid. The ‘d’ and ‘c’ refer to carbon atoms on the LCB and FA chain, respectively.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00429.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Iso-branched d17iso-sphinganine rescues elo-5(-) L1 arrest.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sphingolipid biogenesis pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including the catalytic enzymes (blue) and corresponding genes (red) used in this study.

Because the d17iso-LCB was not commercially available, we purified d17iso-sphinganine (d17iso-SPA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) from a d17iso-sphingolipid producing bacteria <italic>S. spiritivorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yabuuchi et al., 1983</xref>) using mass spectrometry analysis. This purified d17iso-SPA fraction, but not a chemically synthesized c17iso-sphingolipid with a straight-chain d18:1-LCB or a straight-chain LCB d16-SPA, was found to be sufficient to overcome <italic>elo-5(−)</italic> L1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplement-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Additionally, efficient rescue was also achieved with a custom synthesized d17iso-SPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, d17iso-sphingolipid is sufficient to promote the postembryonic growth and development of mmBCFA-deficient animals.</p><p>We then carried out further tests to confirm that this rescue effect of d17iso-SPA supplementation resulted from the function of this metabolite itself, but not from its catabolic conversion back to C15ISO or C17ISO. First, we fed <italic>elo-5(−)</italic> larvae with various quantities of C15ISO, C17ISO, or d17iso-SPA. We observed that d17iso-SPA suppressed the L1 arrest at a much lower concentration than C15ISO or C17ISO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Second, we observed that the low concentrations of d17iso-SPA suppressed the L1 arrest without restoring mmBCFA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, we found that supplementation with d17iso-SPA, but not mmBCFAs, also suppressed the L1 arrest phenotype caused by feeding RNAi of <italic>sptl-1</italic>, a gene encoding a serine palmitoyltransferase homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic> required for d17iso-SPA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seamen et al., 2009</xref>). We thus conclude that mmBCFAs promote postembryonic development through d17iso-SPA.</p><p>This growth-promoting function of d17iso-SPA may be mediated by a more complex sphingolipid derived from it. Because it is technically difficult to purify or synthesize sphingolipids of more complex structure (e.g., glucosylceramide [GlcCer]) and directly test their effect by dietary supplementation, we examined additional enzymes involved in sphingolipid synthesis. Specifically, <italic>fath-1(C25A1.5)</italic> encodes a homolog of mammalian fatty acid 2-hydrolase (FA2H) responsible for the synthesis of the FA side chain of ceramides, whereas <italic>cgt-1</italic> and <italic>cgt-3</italic> encode two ceramide glucosyltransferases that glucosylate ceramides to GlcCer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both <italic>fath-1(RNAi)-</italic>treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplement-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and the <italic>cgt-1(−);cgt-3(−)</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marza et al., 2009</xref>) cause larval arrest. We found the arrest under either condition could not be overcome by feeding d17iso-SPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplement-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Disrupting the function of glycosyltransferases that further modify GlcCer does not cause larval arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffitts et al., 2003</xref>). These results suggest that d17iso-glucosylceramide (d17iso-GlcCer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) may be the lipid molecule that mediates the role of mmBCFAs and d17iso-SPA in promoting postembryonic growth and development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutation <italic>ku540</italic> permits mmBCFA-depleted <italic>C. elegans</italic> to bypass L1 arrest and propagate continuously</title><p>d17iso-sphingolipid may play either a structural or regulatory role for the initiation of postembryonic development. If it is the latter, the requirement of d17iso-sphingolipid for postembryonic development might be bypassed by genetically activating the downstream regulatory pathway. To test this possibility and identify the mechanism, we performed a genetic screen, modified from a previous screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seamen et al., 2009</xref>), for mutations that could suppress the L1 arrest of <italic>elo-5(−)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This discovery reveals a specific link between lipids and the TORC1 signaling pathway. Both ceramide and TORC1 have been individually implicated for roles in stress response, apoptosis, cancers, and other cellular processes by studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He and Klionsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howell and Manning, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). It is conceivable that some of these functions are mediated by this GlcCer/TORC1 signaling pathway. Moreover, our data suggest that this GlcCer/TORC1 pathway may serve as a ‘check point’ to coordinate metabolic status in the intestine with postembryonic growth and development. d17iso-GlcCer is a sphingolipid metabolite rather than a nutrient directly absorbed from food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merrill et al., 1997</xref>); it is the product of a long biosynthetic pathway involving many enzymatic steps and thus may reflect the availability of many metabolites and enzymes.</p><p>Although leucine is a precursor molecule of mmBCFA biosynthesis, this long lipid synthesis pathway is unlikely part of a mechanism to specifically sense the level of essential amino acids. Furthermore, mmBCFA levels are stable in starved L1 larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kniazeva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>), suggesting that mmBCFA levels do not directly reflect the feeding status through a direct substrate–product relationship.

Our additional analysis also suggests that the GlcCer/TORC1 pathway is DAF-7/TGF-β pathway independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This independence may facilitate the role of such a pathway to promote specific developmental events under specific physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The GlcCer/TORC1 signaling pathway is likely conserved in mammals</title><p>There are several reasons for us to believe that such a GlcCer/TORC1 pathway is likely conserved in mammals. First, the components of TORC1 are conserved between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals. The NPRL-3 protein we identified in this pathway is conserved in all eukaryotes, and its negative regulatory role on TOR has been characterized in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>). Several proteins (such as NPR2 and IML1) that are reported to form a complex with NPR3 in budding yeast have orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as well as mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu and Tu, 2011</xref>). NPRL2 (human ortholog of NPR2) and DEPDC5 (human ortholog of IML1) have been reported to function as tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merrill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>). This property is consistent with the role of this complex in repressing TOR-mediated growth regulation that was identified in budding yeast and this study. Second, a role for GlcCer in nutrient sensing is consistent with studies showing that ceramide and sphingolipids play roles in cell signaling and growth control in both invertebrates and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuz et al., 2009</xref>). The finding that mouse mutants with blocked GlcCer biosynthesis die as early embryos suggests the essential role of these lipids in growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>). Third, the TOR pathway is down-regulated by inhibiting the abnormally high GlcCer biosynthesis in polycystic kidney disease in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Natoli et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting a possible conserved link between GlcCer and TOR activities.</p><p>It is currently unknown whether an iso-branched LCB is also required for the potential role of GlcCer in mammals, given that most LCBs in mammals are straight-chain LCBs. However, it is important to note that mmBCFAs (derived from branched-chain amino acids) are also present in mammals. For example, they are constituents of sphingolipids in skin cells and the intestinal tract of human newborns. They are also found to be incorporated into LCBs (to form an iso- or an anteiso-LCB similar to that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) in multiple mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aungst, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karlsson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oku et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ran-Ressler et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, their important physiological functions, including possible roles in ceramide-involved growth regulation, may be assumed, albeit not yet uncovered experimentally.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Activation of TORC1 by d17iso-GlcCer</title><p>How does d17iso-GlcCer regulate the activity of TORC1? Recent work in mammalian cells has indicated that TORC1, for its role in sensing amino acids, localizes at the surface of the lysosome, likely in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nada et al., 2009</xref>). If such a mechanism is conserved in all animals, conceptually, d17iso-GlcCer could act as a ligand that binds to a ‘receptor’ to either repress the NPRL-2/3 complex or activate the TOR complex at the surface of the lysosome. Alternatively, this lipid could be required for lysosome biogenesis or could be an essential constituent of the membrane microdomain that permits the proper localization or activity of TORC1 on the lysosome. By examining lysosomal markers LMP-1::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artal-Sanz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O’Rourke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rabbitts et al., 2008</xref>), GLO-1::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schroeder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and Neutral red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long et al., 2002</xref>), we did not observe obvious defects in lysosome formation in <italic>elo-5(−)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4 fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 4 and 5</xref>).

One possible mechanism is that d17iso-GlcCer acts through the V-ATPase pathway, since the lysosomal V-ATPase has been shown to be stimulated by GlcCer and to play an essential role in TORC1 activation in studies using tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van der Poel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>). Further biochemical and genetic analyses are needed to test this hypothesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>It may be important to point out again that activation of TORC1 bypasses the robust L1 arrest phenotype caused by either mmBCFA or d17iso-GlcCer deficiency. Remarkably, the <italic>elo-5(−); nprl-3(ku540)</italic> double mutants, still deficient for these lipids, propagate continuously. Therefore, the only essential biochemical role of d17iso-GlcCer might be to activate TORC1 or repress NPRL-3.

The <italic>tat-2(−)</italic> mutations were also found to partially and temporarily suppress the lethality associated with disrupting the function of the enzyme (SPTL-1) in the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, suggesting a potential link between sphingolipids and mmBCFAs. However, this observation may not be interpreted as the proof that mmBCFAs function through sphingolipids for the following reasons. (1) Unlike feeding d17iso-SPA or the downstream suppressor <italic>nprl-3(ku540)</italic> that fully suppresses mmBCFA deficiency [<italic>elo-5(−)</italic>]–induced L1 arrest (this study), <italic>tat-2(−)</italic>does not bypass the requirement of mmBCFAs for growth for more than one generation. (2) <italic>sptl-1(−)</italic> disrupts all sphingolipid biosynthesis and its phenotype is, in contrast to <italic>elo-5(−)</italic>, highly pleiotropic, as animals showed various morphological and growth defects and die at various larval stages. (3) <italic>tat-2</italic> does not exclusively function with mmBCFA-containing lipids; it is also a critical player in steroid metabolism as exemplified by a recent article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the link between mmBCFA and sphingolipids through their interactions with <italic>tat-2</italic> could be indirect and the partial suppression of <italic>sptl-1(−)</italic> by <italic>tat-2(−)</italic> could be due to suppression of mmBCFA-unrelated functions of sphingolipids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>SNP mapping of <italic>ku540</italic> and cloning of the <italic>nprl-3</italic> gene</title><p>For SNP mapping of <italic>ku540</italic>, we used a Hawaii strain based <italic>elo-5(gk208)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seamen et al., 2009</xref>) to cross with <italic>elo-5(gk208) ku540</italic> animals and determined the locus of <italic>ku540</italic> by linkage analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2005</xref>).
