K<sup>+</sup>-channels (SK) require calmodulin to gate in response to cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. A model for SK gating proposes that the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of calmodulin is required for activation, but an immobile C-terminal domain (C-lobe) has constitutive, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding. Although structures support a domain-driven hypothesis of SK gate activation by calmodulin, only a partial understanding is possible without measuring both channel activity and protein binding. We measured SK2 (KCa2.2) activity using inside-out patch recordings. Currents from calmodulin-disrupted SK2 channels can be restored with exogenously applied calmodulin. We find that SK2 activity only approaches full activation with full-length calmodulin with both an N- and a C-lobe. We measured calmodulin binding to a C-terminal SK peptide (SKp) using both composition-gradient multi-angle light-scattering and tryptophan emission spectra. Isolated lobes bind to SKp with high affinity, but isolated lobes do not rescue SK2 activity. Consistent with earlier models, N-lobe binding to SKp is stronger in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and C-lobe-binding affinity is strong independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, a native tryptophan in SKp is sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to both the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations that activate SK2, demonstrating that the C-lobe interaction with SKp changes with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our peptide-binding data and electrophysiology show that SK gating models need deeper scrutiny. We suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent associations of both lobes of calmodulin to SKp are crucial events during gating. Additional investigations are necessary to complete a mechanistic gating model consistent with binding, physiology, and structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HEK</kwd><kwd>ion channel gating</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>KCa2.1</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS077821-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aldrich</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM127332-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aldrich</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcium drives interactions for both calcium-binding domains of calmodulin in complex with KCa2.1 peptides and both domains are required for normal channel function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SK channels modulate cell membrane excitability and help to maintain cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Mutations in an SK gene can cause diseases including Zimmermann–Laband syndrome and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koot et al., 2016</xref>). Located on the plasma membrane, SKs open to release cellular K<sup>+</sup> in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to the cell after membrane depolarization. K<sup>+</sup> efflux helps to restore resting membrane potential, which can result in inactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett and Barret, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hugues et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moolenaar and Spector, 1979</xref>). Thus, SKs operate in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback cycle to fine tune intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals originating at the plasma membrane. Yet Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not interact physically with SK. Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates the channel via another protein modulator that tethers itself to diagonal subunits of a homotetrameric SK channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CaM as an SK Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the SK4 K<sup>+</sup> ion channel shown as cylindrical helices and molecular surface depictions of CaM (pdb 6CNN). For clarity, only two of four subunits and CaMs are shown. Subunit 1 is yellow and subunit 3 is green. The N-lobe surface of CaM is vermillion, and the C-lobe surface of CaM is blue. Transmembrane helices are shown as S1–S6, and SK C-domain helices are shown as HA–HC. The peptide used in the binding studies, SKp, includes HA, HB, and part of HC. Diagonal subunits of SK4 bind a CaM in EM structure. Intracellular helix 4–5 A between S4 and S5 of transmembrane segments bind in a pocket of the N-lobe of CaM. C-domain helices HA and HB of the cross-subunit bind the C-lobe of CaM. (<bold>B</bold>) Bottom views of SK4 showing all four subunits showing CaMs bound, left side, or with CaM models removed, right side. The colors are the same as in panel A. The subunits that are not depicted in A are gray. On the right side, the SK sites that bind CaM are colored the same as the CaM lobes they contact. Panels (<bold>C–F</bold>) demonstrate the lobes of CaM can reorient to form diverse conformation states. The lobes of CaM can when bound to SK4 (pdb 6CNN) form a W-shape in C, when not bound to protein (pdb 1CLL) form an S-shape in D, when bound to an SK2 peptide (pdb 1G4Y) form a C-shape in E, or when bound to an MLCK peptide (pdb 1CDL) form an O-shape in F. (<bold>G</bold>) The N-sensor hypothesis of SK activation by CaM claims the N-lobe of CaM to be the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. The N-lobe binds a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent site when Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to it. The C-lobe remains anchored to a site with no local change. In the NC-sensor hypothesis, both lobes of CaM are functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. At trace Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the C-lobe dominates the interaction. At high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a different binding mode is revealed that binds both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound lobes. The binding sites for each lobe of CaM need not be on the same subunit and the depiction is meant to emphasize that SK responds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to both lobes of CaM.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81303-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Calmodulin (CaM) directs the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in virtually all eukaryotic cells. It binds hundreds of targets that include ion channels. Different properties from each of its four unique Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halling et al., 2016</xref>) leading to dynamic ranges of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity that can vary depending on which target CaM is bound to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Persechini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Westerlund and Delemotte, 2018</xref>. The four Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites are arranged into two pairs, each pair comprising a domain or ‘lobe’ of CaM. The two globular lobes form a ‘dumbbell’ like appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites within each lobe may tune each lobe to respond differently to Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Each CaM target has evolved to use different properties of a versatile CaM architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). A common challenge encountered with mechanistic studies on CaM’s targets is knowing to what extent the lobes of CaM sense Ca<sup>2+</sup> independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tadross et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 2018</xref>) or together as intercommunicating units to carry out a function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mukherjea et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Persechini et al., 1996</xref>). Changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> alter how a tethered CaM binds to SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xia et al., 1998</xref>). For SK gating, a simple model that was based on structures, electrophysiology, and some binding data suggest that the C-terminal domain (C-lobe) of CaM is constitutively bound to SK independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>). The N-terminal domain (N-lobe) forms the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor of SK and only binds tightly in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We refer to domain-dependent mechanism as the ‘N-sensor hypothesis’ for SK gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Although the N-sensor hypothesis has an experimental basis, it has not been thoroughly tested.</p><p>Certain properties must hold to validate the N-sensor hypothesis for SK: (1) The C-lobe is insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> when bound to SK. (2) The N- and C-lobes act independently and carry out distinct functions, that is, the N-lobe is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, whereas the C-lobe is the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent glue to keep CaM bound to SK. (3) The N- and C-lobes bind at different sites so that their unique functions can be carried out. In contrast, many CaM-binding domains bind both lobes in proximity and interact with other either directly or through peptide contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meador et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Villarroel et al., 2014</xref>). Recent structures of SK4 with bound CaM show multiple conformations of the N-lobe at trace Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but a better resolved interaction at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>). At high Ca<sup>2+</sup> the N- and C-lobes of CaM bind to different domains of SK4 in a unique conformation for CaM that has not been observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Given the diversity of interactions in the structures, careful binding studies will be needed to sort out how each domain of CaM interacts with SK at low and at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Although CaM modulation of SK has been studied for decades, there are gaps in our fundamental understanding that still need to be worked out. Transduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to channel gating is a dynamic, multistep process. It includes Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM, CaM binding to SK, and the intrinsic motions of SK through different gating states.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>SK function can be studied by exchanging WT-CaM with mutant CaM</title><p>WT-CaM has a high affinity for SK2 at both high and trace Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xia et al., 1998</xref>). In a heterologous system, WT-CaM is always present, so we developed a method that allowed us to exchange WT-CaM for a mutant CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SK2 approaches maximal open probability in the presence of WT-CaM. To study how different CaM constructs can restore SK2 currents, we first coexpressed the SK channel with a mutant CaM (E1Q) that has a glutamate instead of a glutamine at the conserved position 12 in the N-lobe EF hand 1, which is residue 31 in the protein sequence. This mutation leads to only one functional EF hand in the N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maune et al., 1992</xref>). We demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2009</xref>) that coexpression of E1Q with SK2 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes leads to a rapid rundown of SK2 current. Current rundown can be recovered permanently upon application of exogenous WT-CaM, that is SK2 current no longer runs down once WT-CaM associates with the channel. We assume that exogenous CaM binds to empty CaM sites on SK from E1Q dissociation, or alternatively E1Q leaves the C-lobe bound and that exogenous CaM can displace the mutant. These findings gave us a tool to test whether SK channel activity could be recovered by various non-WT-CaMs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>WT-CaM recovers SK2 current in HEK293 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicts patch excision at time zero (<bold>a</bold>) and moving an electrode into the flow path from a fast solution exchanger (<bold>b–d</bold>).

Solution binding studies can be performed on protein domains of SK that bind CaM. A peptide of SK2 that comprises the CaM-binding domain is referred to as SKp (residues 396–487 of rat KCa2.2) has been used in multiple binding and structure studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Halling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).

Tryptophan (W) has the strongest fluorescent properties of all the amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lakowicz, 2006</xref>). Its fluorescence is also sensitive to its environment. Although tryptophan emission spectra are subject to several factors, the comparisons of gross changes in its amplitude and the location of its peak intensity can be a reporter for molecular binding. In general, a spectrum with a peak at longer wavelengths suggests a solvent exposed tryptophan, whereas a peak at shorter wavelengths describes a tryptophan in a more polar environment, such as being buried in a protein. We used SKp-W432 spectra to show that either lobe of CaM can bury this residue.</p><p>We use both electrophysiology and peptide-binding data to show some properties of CaM that are necessary for CaM to bind SKp, and how these findings relate to CaM-dependent SK function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WT-CaM can recover SK channel activity in HEK293 cells</title><p>We wanted to explore what components of mammalian wild-type calmodulin (WT-CaM) are necessary for SK channel activation.

In the absence of E1Q, endogenous WT-CaM is sufficient to form functional units with SK2.</p><p>Although we did not quantify the extent of SK channel run down after patch excision, like what was done in oocytes, we are confident that as in oocytes the increase in SK current with the application of exogenous WT-CaM was due to the recovery of SK channel activity that had been lost by the overexpression of E1Q.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SKp binds WT-CaM with different conformations at low and at saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The C-terminus of SK is required for CaM binding. We use a peptide to represent this site (SKp). Complex formation between SKp and CaM constructs in solution was measured using composition-gradient multi-angle light scattering (CG-MALS). CG-MALS measures the weight average molar mass of particles in solution as a function of molar ratio of the molecules of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attri and Minton, 2005</xref>). Light-scattering signals are directly converted into a weight average molar mass if protein concentrations and instrument parameters are precisely known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wyatt, 1993</xref>), thus quantifying higher-order stoichiometries is a designed capability of this approach. Our prior work shows that CaM and SKp form different stoichiometries that depend on the molar ratio concentrations of CaM to SKp in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Halling et al., 2014</xref>). In a ‘cross-over’ experiment, the sample applied to the flow cell in the light chamber varies using a series of injections to step from high molar concentrations of SKp relative to CaM crossing over to high molar ratios of CaM relative to SKp. Complex formation is measured at each step of varying protein ratios, thus capturing a wide range of possible stoichiometries in a single experiment. For simplicity, we refer to the stoichiometries as follows: (1) When the molar concentration of SKp exceeds WT-CaM, a complex with 2 SKp and 1 CaM (2SKp/1CaM) forms, which we call ‘P-C-P’. (2) At equimolar concentrations of SKp and WT-CaM it forms a 1SKp/1CaM complex, which we call ‘P-C’. (3) When WT-CaM molar concentrations exceed SKp, 1 SKp and 2 WT-CaMs (1SKp/2CaM) form a complex we call ‘C-P-C’.</p><p>SKp has a molar mass of 11.1 kDa.

At 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the characteristic appearance of the calculated weight-averaged molar masses shows an ‘M’ shape as a function of the molar ratio of WT-CaM protein to SKp. The ‘M’ shape is fortuitous in our studies because the features, that is, peaks and valleys, constrain models that determine what stoichiometries WT-CaM and SKp can form in solution. The light-scattering data are decomposed into molar fractions of free and bound protein that are present in solution giving rise to the features.

For binding measurements, we wanted to make sure 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is saturating. 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not change the spectra further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F</xref>), indicating that 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient for maximal effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with either or both lobes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>C-P-C only forms with full-length CaM</title><p>At high Ca<sup>2+</sup> SKp forms the C-P-C complex with WT-CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, F</xref>).

We used the high-affinity P-C complex of SKp and WT-CaM as a tool. Beginning with the preformed P-C and holding the P-C concentration at a constant value, we titrated increasing concentrations of WT-CaM. At low additions of WT-CaM there is a slight increase in the weight-averaged molar mass followed by a decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The increase in measured mass is due to the formation of C-P-C as WT-CaM binds to the preformed SKp/WT-CaM complex.

In a cross-over CG-MALS experiment a sample with equimolar concentrations of N-CaM and C-CaM is varied against SKp. The results again indicate high-affinity binding of exactly one domain of CaM, not both, to SKp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This experiment cannot distinguish how much of P-C is SKp bound to N-CaM vs. C-CaM.

We confirmed those results here, while showing that fractional recovery of current is at least 50% of that of WT-CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Due to variability in channel density and unknown occupancy by endogenous WT-CaM from the HEK cells, we are not able to confirm whether CaM (E34Q) rescues at a different rate or to a different saturation level than WT-CaM.

The profile for CaM (E34Q) looks different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The characteristic ‘M’ shape is gone. Instead, there is a stronger peak at equimolar ratios of CaM (E34Q):SKp, and the right hump is absent. This can best be explained by a change in stoichiometries that form when SKp binds WT-CaM compared to CaM (E34Q). Whereas there is support for a P-C-P complex, as seen for WT-CaM, differences are seen at increasing molar ratios of CaM (E34Q). At equimolar ratios of WT-CaM:SKp, A 1/1 complex of CaM/SKp is observed with 28 kDa. However, the weight average molar mass at equimolar concentrations of CaM (E34Q):SKp is about 34 kDa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The best solution to fit the data includes a small quantity of a 2/2 complex. We call this 2/2 complex the 2x-P-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). At higher molar ratios of CaM (E34Q):SKp, there is no evidence for C-P-C, and in fact the weight average molar mass falls off quickly with increasing CaM (E34Q) arguing against a C-P-C with CaM (E34Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>).

If Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the N-lobe is disrupted in E12Q as intended, the spectral overlap with WT-CaM strongly suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to C-lobe is at least partially responsible for the spectral shift observed with WT-CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the spectrum of W432 with CaM (E34Q) bound has weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

We observe that P-C-P may be present, but our confidence in higher-order complexes is low since multiple models for oligomers can produce a flatter shaped curve with weak binding.

The absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the C-lobe is an experimental result that depends on the conditions used to arrive at the data. A major challenge in crystallography is getting a protein to form a crystal, which requires high protein concentrations in a somewhat arbitrarily determined medium. CaM co-crystallizes with SKp in acidic solutions that range from pH 4.6 to 5.6 at high ionic strength (~1 M Li<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).

Even so, in one instance the C-lobe of CaM still is Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound under acidic conditions when the SK peptide contains an additional three residues as a splice variant, showing that there are conditions at extreme pH (pH ~4.7) when the C-lobe is still Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>). Interestingly, CaM was found with a C-shape in the original structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), but with an S-shape with the splice variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Recently, structures at low and at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> were determined for a full SK channel under different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>): (1) it used the full-length channel as a tetramer with four bound CaMs with W-shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), (2) it used a more distantly related SK family member, the SK4 channel, (3) the media is at more physiological ionic strength (0.15 M) and at pH 8, and (4) electron densities were from cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure obtained at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> shows that on CaM one C-lobe site is Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound and the other is Ca<sup>2+</sup> free.

The C-lobe was modeled with a putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion bound to one of its sites in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound cryo-EM structure. The similarity of the C-lobe structures at both trace and high Ca<sup>2+</sup> forms the basis for the N-sensor model. The basis for the N-sensor hypothesis is that the C-lobe is tethered independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast to C-lobe binding, the N-lobe of CaM in subsets of cryo-EM class averaged data was observed in multiple conformations at trace Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>). The flexibility of N-lobe binding could indicate different binding modes with SK in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Models from structures, however, are strongly biased toward what can be observed either in a crystal or through class averaging of thousands of molecules in cryo-EM. After particle image class averaging, a small percentage (~40%) of total observed molecules is included in the final, highest 3.5 Å resolution structure of SK. There is an opportunity to learn what information is contained in the rest of the datasets about CaM binding.</p><p>The N-sensor hypothesis argues that the C-lobe has a weak Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence, and therefore has weaker binding for Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

If the E to Q mutations only alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM, the CaM (E34Q) data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to N-lobe is required for SK gating, but not to the C-lobe. The assumption was that CaM (E34Q) activates SK2 the same as WT-CaM. However, our protein-binding data challenges that assumption. CaM (E34Q) and WT-CaM do not interact with SK in the same way and CaM (E34Q) clearly has a different binding mode.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>SK gating requires both lobes of CaM</title><p>How does Ca<sup>2+</sup> open SK channels?

A key finding was that only a closed state with long durations is unambiguously Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive; none of the open states or short duration closed states are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive. This observation sets a premise for SK gating: Ca<sup>2+</sup> must do work to prevent SK from visiting the closed state that has the longest dwell time.

(2) CaM must have both an N- and a C-lobe. (3) The N-lobe needs intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites.

We learn from the C-P-C configuration that Ca<sup>2+</sup> opens a site on SKp that is different than when there is no Ca<sup>2+</sup> present. In the context of a full channel, there might not be room for CaM molecules to associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>), but in terms of binding it means that at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM has more ways to interact with SK.</p><p>C-P-C binds strongest with WT-CaM and only in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The double-lobe mutants CC-CaM and NN-CaM show a suggestion of C-P-C, but with WT-CaM C-P-C is clearly stronger. With half-CaMs, neither N-CaM nor C-CaM form C-P-C, although either one binds SKp with high affinity. If the N- and C-lobes bind at different specialized sites, there would be an expectation that both the N-CaM and C-CaM can bind SKp together, but they do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, C-P-C requires both an N- and a C-lobe. One alternative that has not yet been tested is that the ‘linker’ between lobes contains the necessary requirements for C-P-C formation. N-CaM and C-CaM each possess part of the linker and overlap at residue positions 78–80 (DTD). The presence of part of the linker on each construct somewhat tests the hypothesis that the linker may need to be present to form C-P-C, although, because there is not a full and intact continuous linker present, half-CaM’s with variable linkers would be needed for testing whether the linker is required for C-P-C formation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Shematics showing different configurations of stoichiometries between WT-CaM and SKp.</title><p>SKp is represented as a black square; CaM is represented as a gray circle.

There are two possible arrangements that our data cannot distinguish that we present as scheme 1 and scheme 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In scheme 1, two CaMs bind directly to SKp and have no association with the other CaM. In Scheme 2, SKp binds to a CaM oligomer. We favor scheme 1 because our binding measurements have not detected any CaM dimers in our solution measurements.</p><p>Testing these constraints requires having probes that can measure the N- and C-lobe positions on the peptide and the conformation of the P-C complex. Our hypothesis predicts multiple conformations of the P-C complex to account for the binding behavior of WT-CaM. Data that show distributions of different conformations would support this conjecture. In contrast, CaM (E34Q) binding to SKp potentially can be explained with fewer states.</p><p>For P-C-P, we speculate that both lobes of a single CaM molecule participate with binding to both SKp peptides, possibly in a more globular form but not necessarily in a ‘bridging’ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Indeed, CaM binds many targets with an O-shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), except that the O-shape has not yet been observed in structures with SK. We do not detect dimers of SKp during our measurements using purified peptide, yet we note that impurities in the solution may cause the peptide to precipitate. Since we do not observe SKp dimers, we favor scheme 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to describe P-C-P.</p><p>Finally, at trace Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we only consider a strong P-C signature as convincing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Further investigation is needed to find out whether P-C-P exists at trace Ca<sup>2+</sup> and how the weaker binding would fit into a gating model. In our current model, both lobes of CaM interact with SK at trace Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the P-C state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Predictions of SK gating from CaM-binding data</title><p>A more general model is needed to describe how SK decodes Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to both lobes of CaM. The ‘NC-sensor hypothesis’ proposes that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to both lobes of CaM in complex with SKp are energetically coupled processes, that is, the entire CaM molecule works as a unit and <italic>not</italic> as a sum of its parts. Although both lobes have unique qualities as they do in the N-sensor hypothesis, binding data suggest that they work as a unit by communicating through SK. The NC-sensor hypothesis has testable predictions. Both WT-CaM and CaM (E34Q) activate SK, but since one lobe of CaM (E34Q) is less Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive, SK must have different dwell times in the opened or closed states. Single-channel recordings of SK current can probe different activation states of SK. A careful study of distributions of SK states would distinguish whether different opened and closed states are prevalent if CaM (E34Q) is bound instead of WT-CaM.</p><p>Single-channel recordings of SK2 show that in trace Ca<sup>2+</sup> the open probability is dominated by a long-lived closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). Rare bursts of activity show openings that are marked with flickers to closed states. At high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the channel is open about 80% of the time. The ‘open’ channel still has frequent flickers to a closed state. The increase in open probability seems to be entirely due to a drastic reduction in the long-lived closed state and not an increase in time spent in the open state, that is, there is not a decrease in ‘flickering’. Thus, at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SK2 shows extremely dynamic behavior. At equilibrium, a distribution of different states of SK2 should be expected. Whether CaM (E34Q) is bound is expected to modify this behavior.</p><p>More structures of SK with bound CaM captured in identifiable closed and open intermediates would help to interpret how CaM alters SK activity. We know of at least three closed and two open states for SK activity from physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). Our stoichiometry data show that SK has multiple ways to bind CaM, and there is ample structural support displaying how flexible CaM is when bound to targets. Our binding and functional work are only edge cases for concentrations and there is much more work to be done to solve what the protein experiences dynamically during gating.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>A generalized hypothesis for SK gating</title><p>CaM binding to peptide may be different from how it binds to a full-length protein such as a channel, especially if another domain such as the 3–4 linker interacts with a lobe of CaM. This is an extraordinarily difficult question to answer with just one binding study, yet incorrect aspects of models can quickly be eliminated. We observe that the C-lobe of CaM is calcium sensitive when binding to a peptide. How can the full-length channel binding to the C-lobe be Ca<sup>2+</sup> insensitive? It would require that the full-length channel blocks the Ca<sup>2+</sup> C-lobe configuration while preserving the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free configuration, but this has not been demonstrated. Considering that the channel has at least three closed states and two open states, C-lobe Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing is highly likely to be important during gating. From current structure analyses, we have at best an ensemble view of two out of five channel/CaM states.</p><p>Although the N-sensor hypothesis is elegant, the binding data show that a more complex model is likely necessary to truly represent the mechanism for SK gating by WT-CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Both lobes of CaM are energetically coupled through binding to SK. The complex of SK and CaM decodes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, with both lobes in complex with SK acting as sensors. The C-lobe of CaM is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor; we show that it is not insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> as described in the N-sensor hypothesis. We propose that the mechanism for the NC-sensor hypothesis requires solving energetic values for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to four ligand sites of CaM, multiple CaMs binding to SK, and SK open probability at different liganded states. The challenge of solving energetic states is far greater and more general in the NC-sensor hypothesis, but it provides a realistic starting point for solving the mechanism of SK activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials and constructs</title><p>The mammalian WT-CaM protein sequence (NCBI: NP_059022) expression clone from rat DNA (Rattus norvegicus calmodulin 2 (Calm2) NCBI: NM_017326.3) was provided by S.

Then, the exogenous CaM protein was perfused on using the SmartSquirt, which varied in the amount of time from patch to patch.

Stoichiometries are assumed to be comprised of known molar masses of SKp and CaM. Free and bound protein concentrations were modeled across molar ratios as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Halling et al., 2014</xref>). The concentrations of free protein and complexed protein were fitted to <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> by Levenberg–Marquardt fitting of the equilibrium association constants, <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub>, for each complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tryptophan emission spectra</title><p>SKp contains a single, native tryptophan at position 432, whereas CaM has no tryptophan. Between the two proteins, there are three tyrosines, but tryptophan fluorescence is dominant over tyrosine. W432 has been shown to contact the C-lobe of CaM in multiple structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and its spectra have been used to assess WT-CaM binding to SKp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keen et al., 1999</xref>). Because of its position and potential role in forming a CaM-binding site, W432 spectra could be used as a probe in assessing CaM binding under more conditions.</p><p>1 µM SKp (W432) plus/minus 1 µM CaM (no tryptophan) were dissolved in the same working solutions used for CG-MALS. Fluorescence spectra were collected in a 1-cm pathlength Spectrosil quartz cuvette (Starna, Atascadero, CA) on a QM-400 PTI spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific, Kyoto, Japan) containing a 75-W xenon arc lamp and an R928 side-on photomultiplier (PMT) detector (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan). The light path included an excitation monochromator, a 2-nm bandwidth excitation slit, a cuvette with sample, a 305-nm cut-on emission filter, a 1-nm bandwidth emission slit, emission monochromator, and PMT. Fluorescence was excited at 265 nm and its emission was scanned in 1 nm steps from 315 to 400 nm with 1-s signal integrations. All scans are buffer background subtracted. CaMs, including those with tyrosines, were measured for controls. Averaged spectra were subjected to binomial smoothing using Igor Version 5.0.5.7 (Wavemetrics Inc, Lake Oswego, OR).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jon T Sack as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please make it abundantly clear to readers (e.g., in the Abstract and Discussion) that while the results suggested that ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-lobe causes a conformational change, electrophysiological experiments did not conclusively show that ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-lobe of CaM impacts SK channel gating. In the Abstract and end of the Discussion, the wording seems to project conclusions from soluble SKp onto SK conductance activation without a disclaimer. It might help to expound on the limitations of projecting results with SKp onto gating of intact SK channels.</p><p>2) The conclusion that the X-C CaM – SKp complex changes conformation in ca<sup>2+</sup> is important, but difficult to see in Figure 4. Please, provide a quantitative comparison of the data in Figure 4 which leads to important conclusions, so that readers who may struggle to overlay emission spectra in their heads can benefit.</p><p>3) Please address each reviewer's concern with changes to the manuscript, or explain why not in the rebuttal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite trying hard to find flaws in the logic of interpretation, I've come up empty-handed.

The results are described in a somewhat nonlinear fashion which makes it challenging to understand the findings and their relevance to the overall model. For example, Figure 4D is described after parts of Figure 6. This makes it very difficult to follow the complex arguments. In part, this is because the figures are arranged according to the experimental technique. I wonder if it would be simpler to organize based on the specific question that is answered?</p><p>2. In Figure 5, the authors demonstrate that the addition of N-X at least partially activates the channel. Does the exogenous addition of X-C or X-X have any effect? These may be helpful to delineate any potential functional role for association of ca<sup>2+</sup> bound C-lobe as one may envision based on in vitro analysis</p><p>3. The requirement of one N- and one C- lobe for activation of SK channels is very interesting. Will shuffling the arrangement of N and C also support channel activation, i.e could C-N CaM also activate the channel as effectively as N-C, or is the arrangement of the lobes also important?</p><p>4. The MALS assays are quite impressive in terms of their ability to resolve distinct CaM lobe-peptide complexes. That said, the prevalence of the C-P-C complex is quite low, I am curious if one were to assume that such complexes do not form, how much worse would the fits be for the simulated Molar Mass curves in Figure 3?</p><p>5. Figure 7B shows P-N with N or P-C with C, but the description in Pg. 7 states that &quot;Using preformed P-C with WT-CaM, …&quot; Is the figure mislabeled, or was the complex formed with N or C lobe?</p><p>6. Pg 2. &quot;In includes ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM, …&quot; should be &quot;It includes&quot;</p><p>7. Pg. 12. &quot;One limitation of our study is that a peptide is free to bind CaM in configurations that are more constrained than it would be in a membrane-bound channel.&quot;</p><p>I am not sure about the intended meaning here particularly with &quot;constrained,&quot;: On the one hand if portions of the peptide are not exposed in the full-length channel then I'd imagine CaM can interact in conformations that are not otherwise available making it less constrained. On the other hand CaM additional sites beyond what is encoded in the peptide become available for CaM interaction. Is the sentence suggesting both?</p><p>8. As noted above, a major shortcoming is that the overall mechanism of channel activation is not clear, in particular how the new studies revise previous models. For example, although C-P-C complex can form in solution based on MALS and on titration of CaM to CaM-P preformed complexes, the authors note that it is unlikely in the context of the full-length channel.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors rely heavily on a stoichiometry assay, drawing multiple conclusions from the existence (or lack thereof) of the P-C-P complex. In fact, the summary figure is a model of entry into the 2:1 and 1:2 binding complexes. Yet there is no discussion of the relevance of this complex. Are the authors asserting that there is a change in the stoichiometry of the CaM/channel complex in response to ca<sup>2+</sup>?</p><p>2. The overall organization of the text and figures is unnecessarily onerous. The figure is not presented in order and I found I was constantly flipping from figure to figure as I read through the text.</p><p>3. The patch clamp data is a strong feature of this paper, yet it is presented at such a condensed scale that it is difficult to read. In particular, in Figure 2 where the data is first presented, the data is smaller than the cartoons describing the experiment which actually makes it difficult to decipher the experimental protocol.</p><p>4. No statistical tests are performed in the paper. Statistical significance should be added to figure 5 and table 2.</p><p>5. Table 2 describes the affinity measured for the CG-MALS experiments, but the text focuses almost exclusively on the stoichiometry results (which may or may not be functionally relevant in a holochannel). Is there a reason that affinity is not a more relevant result?</p><p>6. P2, 3rd line of the last paragraph. The word 'calcium' is missing after 10 µM.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in SK channel gating&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The revised version of this beautiful study is clearer and even more appropriately nuanced. We appreciate how findings with SKp are carefully distinguished from gating in the body of the manuscript, and the title could would benefit from similarly precise wording.</p><p>The title &quot;Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in SK channel gating&quot; seems oversimplified, as the data showing calcium dependence involved the SKp peptide, with no channel to gate. We ask that you to revise the title. One suggestion would be: &quot;Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in interactions with a domain of SK channels&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81303.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please make it abundantly clear to readers (e.g., in the Abstract and Discussion) that while the results suggested that ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-lobe causes a conformational change, electrophysiological experiments did not conclusively show that ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C-lobe of CaM impacts SK channel gating.

We appreciate their thoughtful reviews and for our chance to respond to them.</p><p>Peptide work lays the foundation for interpreting full-length protein data. Full length proteins have more binding sites, and therefore more parameters to be determined making it extraordinarily difficult to solve mechanistic problems without breaking the problems down into solvable parts. While it is true that binding energies may be different in a whole protein compared to its parts, it may be possible with multiple studies to figure out how smaller parts relate to the whole to make a universally consistent mechanistic model. Our work by itself cannot complete a full mechanistic model any more than any other single study. We can assert that the prevailing gating models of a full-length channel protein are at best incomplete.</p><p>The reviewer comments were helpful, and we clarified our position the abstract, introduction and in the discussion.</p><p>We reworded the abstract to clarify that we arrived at our conclusions from work using peptide binding studies, but electrophysiology on full-length channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that the X-C CaM – SKp complex changes conformation in ca<sup>2+</sup> is important, but difficult to see in Figure 4.

This was a very important comment, and we feel there is work one could do to improve on this technique in the future.</p><p>The combination of the instrument noise on top of the protein noise made it difficult to produce believable error bars for position using standard approaches. We decided to only compare the averaged spectra, but in doing so, we lose the ability to quantify the standard error of the spectral peak position. Our discussion of spectra is more qualitative, but it should be obvious when the spectra are fundamentally different.</p><p>Error analysis of peak location proved difficult with our data sets. The raw spectra had two kinds of noise that were difficult to treat equally across the different spectral appearances. Additionally, a decreased intensity at ‘bluer’ wavelengths indicated that the 310 nm cut-on filter distorted some of our results.</p><p>The greatest noise source was from protein across different batches of SKp. The smaller errors in panels B, E, and H were because the SKp were from the same batches. The concentration of SKp is always determined the same way using uv absorbance spectra; however, in the fluorimeter, nearly identical concentrations by uv absorbance did not produce identical tryptophan emission spectra intensity, although the behaviors in complexes are generally the same across experiments. Regardless, we provide our error ranges enabling us to more firmly generalize our findings.</p><p>The second noise source was from the instrument. Signal averaging the spectra over longer times would have certainly helped with error analysis, but we have strong enough reproducible data to show that our general conclusions are valid.</p><p>Cut-on filters are essential to block scattered excitation light to the detector. Cuton filters are not perfect and a 310 nm cut-on filter blocks fluorescent light nonlinearly from 310 to ~340. This blocking would increasingly distort intensity closest to 310 nm, so a blue shifted curve is affected more. If filtering distortions could be corrected, it is likely that greater spectral differences between EGTA and ca<sup>2+</sup> would be unmasked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6</p><p>&quot;N-CaM forms only a 1/1 complex forms… &quot;: delete 2nd &quot;forms&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this Max Headroom error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>page 6</p><p>&quot;At trace ca<sup>2+</sup>, the W432 spectra obtained with SKp bound to C-CaM is indistinguishable from when SKp is bound to WT-CaM (Figure 4D) … The spectra with SKp bound to N-CaM appears slightly more like the spectra of SKp bound to WT-CaM, but not enough to conclude that the N-lobe of CaM binds W432 when full-length WT-CaM binds SKp. &quot;</p><p>Difficult to make these comparisons in the figure.

For example, although C-P-C complex can form in solution based on MALS and on titration of CaM to CaM-P preformed complexes, the authors note that it is unlikely in the context of the full-length channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that we cannot elucidate a full-channel mechanism, even with all our electrophysiology and binding data from this work and prior. However, we claim the same argument applies equally to all studies without putting their work into context of the decades of research on this topic. We are cautious because we perceive gaps in our knowledge. More research in all fields is required to develop even the simplest model for how these channels work, especially in the closed state dwell times. We attempted to explain this in our first draft, but from these reviewer’s helpful comments we have attempted to attract more debate, and thus research, on calmodulin and ion channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors rely heavily on a stoichiometry assay, drawing multiple conclusions from the existence (or lack thereof) of the P-C-P complex. In fact, the summary figure is a model of entry into the 2:1 and 1:2 binding complexes. Yet there is no discussion of the relevance of this complex. Are the authors asserting that there is a change in the stoichiometry of the CaM/channel complex in response to ca<sup>2+</sup>?</p></disp-quote><p>We hope others in the field will ask this same crucial question. The key matter is that ca<sup>2+</sup> alters the binding of CaM to SKp, and this finding most likely applies to full-SK as well. The “rescue” experiments show the requirement for ‘full-length' CaM for SK function, but the peptide-binding experiments show that mutant CaMs have altered interactions with target proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The overall organization of the text and figures is unnecessarily onerous. The figure is not presented in order and I found I was constantly flipping from figure to figure as I read through the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for that the data were not perceived as the optimal order. There is simply a lot of data that needs to compared within single figures. That required us to refer to earlier figures in the paper. We prefer the order of logic starting with WT protein and proceeding through mutants at a later stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The patch clamp data is a strong feature of this paper, yet it is presented at such a condensed scale that it is difficult to read. In particular, in Figure 2 where the data is first presented, the data is smaller than the cartoons describing the experiment which actually makes it difficult to decipher the experimental protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the scales of the panels to emphasize the date more than the cartoon. We agree that this has a better appearance. We that the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. No statistical tests are performed in the paper. Statistical significance should be added to figure 5 and table 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We added t-test values for Figure 5. Also in the text, p-values were added where comparisons are made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Table 2 describes the affinity measured for the CG-MALS experiments, but the text focuses almost exclusively on the stoichiometry results (which may or may not be functionally relevant in a holochannel). Is there a reason that affinity is not a more relevant result?</p></disp-quote><p>The CG-MALS data are robust for stoichiometry and for guiding future binding assays. For certain stoichiometries, the measured affinities are simply bound by the limits of the instrument as we stated. We expect that future binding assays will validate our measurements, but we are not fully confident that all the values are accurate without deeper testing (hence the ‘italicized’ values in Table 2). The reviewer is correct that accurate and precise measures of affinity are needed, but it is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. P2, 3rd line of the last paragraph. The word 'calcium' is missing after 10 µM.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this, thank-you.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The revised version of this beautiful study is clearer and even more appropriately nuanced. We appreciate how findings with SKp are carefully distinguished from gating in the body of the manuscript, and the title could would benefit from similarly precise wording.</p><p>The title &quot;Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in SK channel gating&quot; seems oversimplified, as the data showing calcium dependence involved the SKp peptide, with no channel to gate. We ask that you to revise the title. One suggestion would be: &quot;Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in interactions with a domain of SK channels&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The request by the editors to make our title more precise is reasonable and we have changed our title. Our title now reads “Calcium dependence of both lobes of calmodulin is involved in binding to a cytoplasmic domain of SK channels.” We hope this addresses the concern.</p></body></sub-article></article>
