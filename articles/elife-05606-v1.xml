However, the molecular mechanism by which the G9a/GLP complex is targeted to the specific gene loci for H3K9 methylation is unclear. In this study, with unbiased protein affinity purification, we found ZNF644 and WIZ as two core subunits in the G9a/GLP complex. ZNF644 and WIZ interact with the transcription activation domain of G9a and GLP, respectively. Moreover, both ZNF644 and WIZ contain multiple zinc finger motifs that recognize consensus DNA sequences. ZNF644 and WIZ target G9a and GLP to the chromatin and mediate the G9a/GLP complex-dependent H3K9 methylation as well as gene repression. Thus, our studies reveal two key subunits in the G9a/GLP complex that regulate the function of this histone methyltransferase complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05606.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05606.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05606.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes encode instructions for processes within cells, but only a small subset of the genes within a cell will be switched on (or expressed) at any given time.

Different lysine residues of histones are methylated by different histone lysine-specific methyltransferases (HKMTs). Among HKMTs, G9 and GLP specifically catalyze H3K9 mono- (H3K9me1) and dimethylation (H3K9me2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tachibana et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kubicek et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>G9a and GLP are paralogs with similar domain architecture. Both contain a transcription activation domain (TAD), a glutamate-rich domain, a cysteine-rich domain, 7 tandem ankyrin repeats (ANKs), and a methyltransferase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Roopra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Purcell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittencourt et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, G9a and GLP form a heterodimer via the interaction between the C-terminal catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tachibana et al., 2005</xref>). The major function of the G9a/GLP complex is to catalyze H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 in euchromatin, which is associated with transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tachibana et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>). Accumulated evidence has shown that this methyltransferase complex regulates multiple biological processes, such as meiosis, embryonic development, immune response, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tachibana et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schaefer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, if one of these two methyltransferases is deleted, the other one alone has little enzymatic activity in vivo, suggesting that the heterodimer formation is important for the function of this enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tachibana et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>). Downstream functional partners of the G9a/GLP complex have been examined. Since HP1 recognizes H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nielsen et al., 2001</xref>), it is likely that the G9a/GLP complex mediates the recruitment of HP1 to specific gene loci for transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ogawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nishio and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the ANKs of G9a and GLP also recognize H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2008</xref>), which may facilitate the chromatin spreading of the G9a/GLP complex.</p><p>Recent study suggests that the G9a/GLP complex is associated with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mozzetta et al., 2014</xref>). EZH2, the catalytic subunit in the PRC2, regulates histone H3K27 methylation. Thus, it is likely that these methyltransferases function together to modulate histone codes during transcription. In addition to histone methylation, the G9a/GLP complex also regulates DNA methylation during early embryogenesis, which is independent of their methyltransferase activity. It has been reported that the G9a/GLP complex associates with DNMT1 through PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Esteve et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the ANKs of G9a interact with DNMT3A and 3B for the de novo DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Epsztejn-Litman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although the G9a/GLP complex plays an important role in epigenetic modification and gene transcription, the molecular mechanism by which the G9a/GLP complex is regulated in vivo remains elusive. Although several partners of G9a have been identified, it is unclear whether these partners form a stable complex with G9a and GLP, and directly control the G9a/GLP-dependent H3K9me1 and H3K9me2. In this study, we searched other possible subunit(s) in the G9a/GLP complex. With unbiased protein affinity purification, we found that ZNF644 and WIZ, two zinc finger proteins, interact with G9a and GLP, respectively. These two zinc finger proteins target G9a and GLP to genomic loci for the regulation of gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZNF644 and WIZ are binding partners of G9a</title><p>To explore the regulation mechanism of the G9a/GLP complex, we have searched the functional partner(s) of G9a using tandem protein affinity purification. Cell lysates of 293T cells stably expressing SFB-tagged G9a were subjected to two rounds of affinity purification. Since G9a and GLP form a heterodimer in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tachibana et al., 2005</xref>), we could easily detect GLP as a partner of G9a in this purification, which was served as a positive control. Interestingly, besides GLP, G9a also interacted with two other proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that these two proteins were ZNF644 and WIZ, two zinc finger proteins. Between these two proteins, WIZ has been known to regulate the stability of the G9a/GLP heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>), while the function of ZNF644 has not been characterized yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To validate our initial purification results, we performed reciprocal affinity purification using ZNF644 as the bait. Again, we identified G9a, GLP, and WIZ as binding partners of ZNF644, suggesting that ZNF644 and WIZ co-exist in the same complex with G9a and GLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05606.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ZNF644 and WIZ associate with G9a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Silver staining of affinity-purified G9a complex.

Based on the domain architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>), we generated four internal deletion mutants of G9a to delete the TAD, the Glu-rich and Cys-rich domains, the ANKs and the catalytic domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the D1 mutant of G9a abolished the interaction with ZNF644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since the D1 mutant of G9a lacks the TAD, it suggests that ZNF644 interacts with the TAD of G9a. Moreover, lacking the catalytic domain of G9a disrupted the interaction with WIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the catalytic domain of G9a also interacts with the catalytic domain of GLP for a heterodimer. Thus, it is possible that the association between G9a and WIZ is mediated by GLP. To confirm this hypothesis, we knocked down G9a by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Lacking G9a, WIZ still interacted with GLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that WIZ is likely to directly interact with GLP. To further elucidate the interactions between these subunits, we generated two internal deletion mutants of GLP to delete either the TAD or the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Only the TAD of GLP, but not the catalytic domain of GLP, is required for the interaction with WIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that WIZ recognizes the TAD of GLP. In contrast, the catalytic domain of GLP is required for the interaction with ZNF644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since the catalytic domains of G9a and GLP form a heterodimer, it is likely that ZNF644 directly recognizes the TAD of G9a and associates with GLP via the interactions between G9a and GLP.

Interestingly, after treating the insoluble pellets with Benzonase to digest the genomic DNA, both ZNF644 and WIZ were eluted into the soluble fraction, suggesting that ZNF644 and WIZ are chromatin-bound proteins. Usually, chromatin-bound proteins could be eluted from genomic DNA by 300 mM NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). With increased sodium concentration in the lysis buffer, ∼ 50% of ZNF644 was eluted out. However, only a small fraction of WIZ could be eluted from the chromatin, and the remaining WIZ was still tightly associated with genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that both ZNF644 and WIZ tightly bind to chromatin. It is also consistent with our affinity purification results that WIZ is slightly difficult to be identified in the mass spectrometry analyses.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05606.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ZNF644 and WIZ are important for the chromatin localization of G9a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Both ZNF644 and WIZ tightly bind to chromatin.

We identified 14,153 G9a enriched regions, 12,777 ZNF644 enriched regions, and 11,853 WIZ enriched regions, respectively. The ChIP-seq results were validated using ChIP-qPCR to examine 30 randomly picked loci that represent a broad range of ChIP-seq fragment counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To analyze genome-wide distribution of those enriched regions, the whole genome was partitioned into three regions: intragenic region, promoter region (5 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS), and distal intergenic region not encoding any genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Approximately, 40% of G9a peaks, 45% of ZNF644 peaks, and 43% of WIZ peaks were distributed in gene promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found around 54% of WIZ-enriched regions were bound by G9a, and around 58% of ZNF644 enriched regions were bound by G9a, while around 63% of G9a enriched regions were bound by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results indicate that most G9a-enriched regions are associated with ZNF644 and/or WIZ, which is in agreement with our results that the chromatin loading of G9a is dependent on the ZNF644 and/or WIZ. It has been shown that G9a regulates gene transcription via catalyzing H3K9me2 at promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Su et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kubicek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we analyzed G9a peaks in promoter regions and found that around 82% of G9a-enriched peaks in promoter region were bound by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Further analyses across G9a peaks in promoter regions show that ZNF644 and WIZ profiles are also associated with the G9a profiles in promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, accumulated evidence suggests that G9a is clearly associated with ZNF644 and WIZ, especially in promoter regions.

However, down-regulation of G9a did not affect the chromatin localization of ZNF644 and WIZ at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>), WIZ was found to interact with the catalytic domain of G9a. We obtained the similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the catalytic domain of G9a also interacts with the catalytic domain of GLP to form a heterodimer. Lacking G9a did not impair the interaction between WIZ and GLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between WIZ and G9a might be indirect and mediated by the catalytic domain heterodimer of G9a and GLP.</p><p>The G9a/GLP complex is known to associate with specific gene promoter and catalyze local H3K9 methylation for transcription repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tachibana et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>). However, both G9a and GLP lack the DNA recognition domains for targeting specific genes. Here, we show the evidence that ZNF644 and WIZ, two multi zinc finger motif-containing proteins, mediate the recruitment of G9a and GLP to the specific gene loci. ZNF644 has 8 zinc finger motifs, while WIZ contains 12 zinc finger motifs. It is likely that these zinc finger motifs function together to recognize specific DNA sequences. Based on our ChIP-seq analyses, we identified the DNA sequences recognized by ZNF644 and WIZ. Thus, ZNF644 and WIZ act as two hands to grab the genomic DNA and target enzymatic subunits G9 and GLP for H3K9 methylation. It is also interesting to notice that ZNF644 and WIZ bind the TADs of G9a and GLP, respectively. Thus, the complex may form a symmetric structure with ZNF644 and G9a on one side, and WIZ and GLP on the other side. These two parts are linked by the interaction between the catalytic domains of G9a and GLP in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2I and 3D</xref>). The double DNA recognition may reduce the flexibility of the complex on the chromatin and allow the G9a and GLP to precisely catalyze histone methylation at gene loci.</p><p>In the ChIP-seq analysis, we also notice that a fraction of G9a and GLP only associate with either ZNF644 or WIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Thus, it is possible that ZNF644 or WIZ alone is sufficient for targeting G9a and GLP to certain loci for H3K9 methylation and transcription repression. Since ZNF644 and WIZ bind different DNA sequences, in these cases, different DNA-binding subunits target G9a and GLP to different loci. With only one DNA-binding arm, the G9a/GLP complex may have more flexibility to methylate targets. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small amount of G9a or GLP only form homodimers. Since ZNF644 only recognizes the TAD of G9a, and WIZ interacts with the TAD of GLP, only ZNF644 or WIZ is sufficient to target the homodimer to the chromatin. Moreover, a small set of G9a associates with neither ZNF644 nor WIZ. Thus, it is possible that a small set of G9a may interact with other regulators. It has been shown that G9 associates with other zinc finger proteins, such as Blimp-1, which may also target G9a to the substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gyory et al., 2004</xref>). However, Blimp-1 is mainly expressed in plasma cells as the major function of Blimp-1 is to regulate plasma cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shaffer et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, Blimp-1 mainly regulates G9a's activity in plasma cells.</p><p>It has been shown that G9a regulates gene transcription via catalyzing H3K9me2 at promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Su et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kubicek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, we found that G9a associated with ZNF644 and WIZ, especially in the promoter regions, to regulate transcription. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al. 2009</xref> examined H3K9me2-enriched loci in the differentiated tissues and found that large chromatin regions associate with H3K9me2. These regions were named as large organized chromatin K9 modifications (LOCKs). However, the function of LOCKs remains unclear. Interestingly, LOCKs are dynamically regulated during development, and the size of LOCKs varies in different types of cells during differentiation, suggesting that LOCKs might be regulated by not only histone methyltransferases but also demethylases. It is possible that the G9a complex plays a key role for LOCKs formation. However, LOCKs do not exist in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al., 2009</xref>). Future analysis of the G9a complex during tissue development and differentiation may reveal the mechanism and function of LOCKs. It is possible that, besides ZNF644 and WIZ, other functional partners of G9a regulate LOCKs.</p><p>Nevertheless, in this study, we have demonstrated that ZNF644 and WIZ are two major functional partners of G9a and GLP. ZNF644 and WIZ target the G9a/GLP complex to genomic loci for H3K9 methylation and transcription repression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids, antibodies, and siRNAs</title><p>Full-length cDNA of G9a, GLP, and WIZ was cloned into pS-FLAG-SBP (SFB) vector, respectively, the full-length cDNA of ZNF644, G9a, and GLP was cloned into pCMV-Myc vector, and the full-length cDNA of WIZ was also cloned into pCMV-HA vector.

A single ‘A’ base was added to 3′ end with Klenow. Double-stranded adaptors (75 bp with a ‘T’ overhang) were ligated to the fragments with DNA ligase. Ligation products between 200 and 600 bp were gel purified to remove unligated adaptors and subjected to 20 PCR cycles. Completed libraries were quantified with PicoGreen. The DNA libraries were analyzed by Solexa/Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The read quality of each sample was determined by FastQC software. After prefiltering the raw data by removing sequence adaptors and low quality reads, the tags were mapped to the human genome (hg19) by Bowtie software. Parameters settings were listed as follows: -v, 3 (reported alignments with at most 3 mismatches), -5, 3 and -3, 7 (trim 3 bases from 5′ end and 7 from 3′ end to remove low-quality bases). Peak detection was performed using MACS software from Galaxy browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://galaxyproject.org/">http://galaxyproject.org/</ext-link>). Parameters settings were as follows: IgG ChIP-seq aligned reads were used as control file, tag size with 25 bp, band width with 300 bp. When comparing peaks from different samples, peaks were considered to be overlapping if they were within 2 kb of each other. The peaks obtained from ChIP-seq were matched to the annotated reference genome (human hg19) using Cisgenome 2.0. To view the peak density and position, Cisgenome 2.0 was used.

Your manuscript was reviewed by three experts in the field and by a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). After a full discussion of the study and the reviews, we are happy to report that the reviewers and the BRE member found the study of interest to the journal and therefore, we will be pleased to consider a revised manuscript addressing the following issues:</p><p>1) Provide statistical analyses and significance for the quantitative PCR studies and for the data on changes in gene expression when the G9a-GLP complex components are depleted.</p><p>2) Provide comprehensive genome-wide analysis including metagene, whole gene distributions, and average promoter analysis for the observations made in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Provide experimental evidence for direct interactions of ZNF644 and WIZ to the DNA sequence studied in the manuscript.</p><p>4) Provide a deeper discussion between the current analysis and the previous studies in terms of domains of interaction between WIZ and G9a-GLP. Also clarification on the difference between Feinberg's studies on the requirement of megabase size domains of histone H3K9me2 Vs the current study on the role of promoters in this process.</p><p>5) The manuscript needs to be read carefully for grammar and clarity.</p><p>Further details can be found in the comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>Significance: It was previously known that WIZ associates with and stabilizes the G9a-GLP heterodimer, but this paper identifies a new binding partner ZNF644. Furthermore, in a major breakthrough the paper demonstrates that WIZ and ZNF644 bind directly to specific DNA sequences and thereby target G9a to specific chromosomal locations. Previously, it was known that a few repressive DNA binding transcription factors can recruit G9a to specific chromosomal loci, but this paper describes a major new mechanism for targeting G9a and GLP to chromatin. The scientific quality of the data presented is generally quite good, but with a few exceptions noted below. There are significant English problems with the manuscript.</p><p>Major concerns: The quantitative PCR data for ChIP and for RNA expression throughout <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4–6</xref> (including the supplements) lack any statistical analysis. The meaning of the error bars is not indicated as well as whether they represent technical or biological replicates and how many. Reproducibility in multiple biological replicates is not discussed. In many cases in these figures the error bars suggest that the differences seen and described in the text may not be significant. In particular, the changes in target gene RNA levels caused by depleting components of the G9a-GLP complex are quite small and appear to be of questionable statistical significance.</p><p>Overall recommendation: This is an exciting paper because it reports a new mechanism for targeting of G9a-GLP to specific chromosomal locations. Statistical analyses need to be provided for the quantitative PCR data. Furthermore, the data on changes in gene expression when G9a-GLP complex components are depleted is weak and of questionable statistical significance. This data should either be improved (at least to statistical significance) or eliminated. While it would be nice to have an indication that G9a-GLP is having an effect on gene expression at the sites where they are recruited, the novel targeting mechanism would still, in my opinion, be important enough to merit publication. English needs to be improved throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>G9a-GLP is important for assembly of H3K9 dimethylated facultative heterochromatin. A major question is how does the complex localize to its sites of action? This is a key question in the field of chromatin biology. The authors show that the zinc finger TFs WIZ and ZN644 associate with G9a-GLP in vivo. They map interacting domains by co-IP with deletion mutants and present genome wide ChIP data on co-localization of the complex and locus-specific ChIP in various RNAi mutants. The interaction with WIZ was previously shown so the novelty here is the association with ZN644, the identification of binding motifs and validation of co-localization genome wide. These are important findings of broad interest in the field.</p><p>The major drawbacks are the lack of a comprehensive genome wide analysis (i.e., metagene, whole gene distributions, average promoter analysis and so on). Additionally, while the authors show strong evidence for targeting of G9a-GLP by WIZ and ZNF644, this is not linked globally with H3K9 dimethylation. There is an overemphasis on locus-specific ChIP studies that lacked measures of statistical significance. Moreover, the paper lacked a deeper discussion of and comparison with other discoveries in the field. For example, there is some disagreement between the authors' analysis and previous studies in terms of domains of interaction between WIZ and G9a-GLP. Additionally, Feinberg showed megabase size domains of histone H3K9me2, while the authors' studies focus on the promoters. Is WIZ-ZNF644-G9a-GLP binding inside as well as at gene promoters? Finally, there are a huge number of disappointing grammatical issues.</p><p>In general, I felt that the paper was a bit underdeveloped throughout but has the potential to make a significant contribution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>The manuscript from Bian and colleagues describes the interaction of G9A/GLP heterodimeric methyltransferase complex with two zinc finger containing proteins, Wiz and ZNF644. G9A/GLP activity results in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. Affinity purification of G9A and ZNF644 was used to determine that G9A/GLP, Wiz and ZNF644 form a core complex. Wiz was shown previously to associate with G9A/GLP and alter its stability (Udea et al.); however, ZNF644 is a new component identified by this manuscript. Using immunoprecipitations of deletion mutants the authors determine that the TAD Domain of GLP and G9A interact selectively with WIZ and ZNF644, respectively. The authors go on to identify the genomic location of WIZ and ZNF644 and that the sites occupied by these proteins accounts for the majority of G9A occupied sites in the genome. Recruitment of G9A and the downstream readers of H3K9 methylation are effected by suppressing WIZ expression. Overall, the data make a compelling case for an important role of WIZ and ZNF644 in recruiting G9A/GLP to their genomic locations. To fully support the proposed role of these proteins in recognition of select genes through a defined DNA sequence, the following points should be addressed:</p><p>1) This implication of the requirement of ZNF644 or WIZ for GLP/G9A recruitment is that the zinc-finger domains of these proteins mediate sequence specific DNA interactions. Although the authors identify motifs within genes that are bound by the GLP/G9A/WIZ/ZNF644 complex, the ability of ZNF644 and WIZ to directly bind these DNA sequences is not addressed. The authors should determine if WIZ or ZNF644 selectively and directly recognize the motifs identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by gel shift or similar assay.</p><p>2) The authors identify deletion mutants in ZNF644 and WIZ that fail to bind GLP and G9A. They go on to use these mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figure 3 and 6</xref> to suggest eliminating the ability of GLP or G9A to bind the zinc finger proteins results in an inability of the methyltransferases to stably associate with DNA and suppress transcription. However, for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figures 3 and 6</xref> to fully support the author's hypothesis the D1 and D8 mutants must be shown to stably interact with the DNA: 1) by selective extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and 2) by ChIP. The trivial explanation for the existing data is that these mutants themselves fail to be recruited to DNA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05606.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>After a full discussion of the study and the reviews, we are happy to report that the reviewers and the BRE member found the study of interest to the journal and therefore, we will be pleased to consider a revised manuscript addressing the following issues</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Provide statistical analyses and significance for the quantitative PCR studies and for the data on changes in gene expression when the G9a-GLP complex components are depleted</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed the statistical analyses for the quantitative PCR studies and for the data on changes in gene expression, including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 1–3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.

The description of statistical analysis was also included in the revised Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>2) Provide comprehensive genome-wide analysis including metagene, whole gene distributions, and average promoter analysis for the observations made in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we re-analyzed the ChIP-seq data. The whole genome was partitioned into three regions: intragenic region, promoter region (5kb upstream or downstream of the TSS), and distal intergenic region that does not encode any gene. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, a total of 14153 genomic regions are enriched with G9a. Around 40 % of peaks are in promoter region, 16 % are in intergenic region, and 44 % are in intragenic region (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found around 63 % of G9a peaks were occupied by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (Revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which is consistent with our biochemistry analyses of the G9a complex. By analyzing the genome-wide distribution of the co-localized regions, we found that around 82 % of G9a-enriched peaks in promoter region were bound by ZNF644 and/or WIZ (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Further analyses across G9a peaks in promoter regions show that ZNF644 and WIZ profiles are associated with the G9a profiles in promoter region (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results were further validated by individual gene analyses (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> E–G). Since both ZNF644 and WIZ are DNA-binding proteins, it suggests that ZNF644 and WIZ may target G9a to promoter regions. The revised text on the comprehensive genome-wide analyses in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was included (subsection headed “WIZ and ZNF644 associate with G9a at specific genomic loci”).</p><p><italic>3) Provide experimental evidence for direct interactions of ZNF644 and WIZ to the DNA sequence studied in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays and examined the interaction between the recombinant ZNF644 or WIZ proteins and oligonucleotides with consensus sequences. Oligos with non-consensus sequence were served as negative control. We also used GST proteins without zinc finger motifs as the pull-down control. ZNF644 and WIZ clearly bind to the specific DNA motif in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref>). The results were also included in the revised text (“both ZNF644 and WIZ-binding sequences… with full-length recombinant proteins”).</p><p><italic>4) Provide a deeper discussion between the current analysis and the previous studies in terms of domains of interaction between WIZ and G9a-GLP. Also clarification on the difference between Feinberg's studies on the requirement of megabase size domains of histone H3K9me2 Vs the current study on the role of promoters in this process</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ueda et al. 2006</xref>), WIZ was found to interact with the catalytic domain of G9a. We obtained the similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the catalytic domain of G9a also interacts with the catalytic domain of GLP to form a heterodimer. Moreover, lacking G9a did not impair the interaction between WIZ and GLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the interaction between WIZ and G9a might be indirect and mediated by the catalytic domain heterodimer of G9a and GLP. As suggested, we have included this part into the Discussion section. Future structure analysis will provide the details for the interactions in the G9 complex.</p><p>It has been shown that G9a regulates gene transcription via catalyzing H3K9me2 at promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Su et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barski et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kubicek et al. 2007</xref>). Consistently, we found that G9a associated with ZNF644 and WIZ, especially in the promoter regions, to regulate transcription (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Wen et al. examined H3K9me2-enriched loci in the differentiated tissues and found that large chromatin regions associate with H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al. 2009</xref>). These regions were named as large organized chromatin K9 modifications (LOCKs). Interestingly, LOCKs are dynamically regulated during development, and the size of LOCKs varies in different types of cells during tissue development and differentiation, suggesting that LOCKs might be regulated by not only histone methyltransferases but also demethylases. It is unclear whether LOCKs are exclusively dependent on the G9a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al. 2009</xref>). And the function of LOCKs is unclear. Moreover, LOCKs do not exist in human tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al. 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, LOCKs might be very important chromatin modifications. And we have discussed the possible link between LOCKs and the G9 complex (in the beginning of the Discussion section). It is possible that the G9a complex dynamically regulates LOCKs. However, due to current research setting using 293T cells (human tumor cells), we could not analyze LOCKs in our system. It is possible that both WIZ and ZNF644 regulate LOCKs during development. But we could not rule out other possibilities such as demethylases or other functional partners of G9 specifically expressed during development.</p><p><italic>5) The manuscript needs to be read carefully for grammar and clarity</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the reminder, the revised manuscript has been proofread by a native English speaker in our institution.</p></body></sub-article></article>
