Clinical use is primarily limited to prophylaxis due to delayed second-cycle parasite death at 1–3 µM serum concentrations. DOX concentrations &gt; 5 µM kill parasites with first-cycle activity but are thought to involve off-target mechanisms outside the apicoplast. We report that 10 µM DOX blocks apicoplast biogenesis in the first cycle and is rescued by isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential apicoplast product, confirming an apicoplast-specific mechanism. Exogenous iron rescues parasites and apicoplast biogenesis from first- but not second-cycle effects of 10 µM DOX, revealing that first-cycle activity involves a metal-dependent mechanism distinct from the delayed-death mechanism. These results critically expand the paradigm for understanding the fundamental antiparasitic mechanisms of DOX and suggest repurposing DOX as a faster acting antimalarial at higher dosing whose multiple mechanisms would be expected to limit parasite resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>drug mechanisms</kwd><kwd>metals</kwd><kwd>apicoplast</kwd><kwd>doxycycline</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK007115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okada</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000850</institution-id><institution>National Heart and Lung Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25HL108828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nalder</surname><given-names>Shai-anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54DK110858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1011969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Doxycycline used at a slightly higher concentration kills <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria parasites with faster, first-cycle activity through a novel organelle-specific mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria remains a serious global health problem, with hundreds of thousands of annual deaths due to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites. The absence of a potent, long-lasting vaccine and parasite tolerance to frontline artemisinin combination therapies continue to challenge malaria elimination efforts. Furthermore, there are strong concerns that the current COVID-19 pandemic will disrupt malaria prevention and treatment efforts in Africa and cause a surge in malaria deaths that unravels decades of progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weiss et al., 2020</xref>). Deeper understanding of basic parasite biology and the mechanisms of current drugs will guide their optimal use for malaria prevention and treatment and facilitate development of novel therapies to combat parasite drug resistance.</p><p>Tetracycline antibiotics like DOX are thought to kill eukaryotic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites by inhibiting prokaryotic-like 70S ribosomal translation inside the essential apicoplast organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). Although stable <italic>P. falciparum</italic> resistance to DOX has not been reported, clinical use is largely limited to prophylaxis due to delayed activity against intraerythrocytic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrad and Rosenthal, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaillard et al., 2015</xref>). Parasites treated with 1–3 µM DOX, the drug concentration sustained in human serum with current 100–200 mg dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newton et al., 2005</xref>), continue to grow for 72–96 hr and only die after the second 48 hr intraerythrocytic growth cycle when they fail to expand into a third cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). Slow antiparasitic activity is believed to be a fundamental limitation of DOX and other antibiotics that block apicoplast-maintenance pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaillard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007</xref>). First-cycle anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> activity has been reported for DOX and azithromycin concentrations &gt; 3 µM, but such activities have been ascribed to targets outside the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>). A more incisive understanding of the mechanisms and parameters that govern first versus second-cycle DOX activity can inform and improve clinical use of this valuable antibiotic for antimalarial treatment. We therefore set out to test and unravel the mechanisms and apicoplast specificity of first-cycle DOX activity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scheme of intraerythrocytic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite depicting doxycycline, its canonical delayed-death mechanism at 1 µM inhibiting apicoplast genome translation, the novel metal-dependent mechanism(s) in the apicoplast explored herein at 10 µM, and off-target activity outside the apicoplast at &gt;20 µM.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60246-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>First-cycle activity by 10 µM DOX has an apicoplast-specific mechanism</title><p>Prior studies have shown that 200 µM isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an essential apicoplast product, rescues parasites from the delayed-death activity of 1–3 µM DOX, confirming an apicoplast-specific target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). To provide a baseline for comparison, we first used continuous-growth and 48 hr growth-inhibition assays to confirm that IPP rescued parasites from 1 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and that DOX concentrations &gt; 5 µM killed parasites with first-cycle activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). To test the apicoplast specificity of first-cycle DOX activity, we next asked whether 200 µM IPP could rescue parasites from DOX concentrations &gt; 5 µM. We observed that IPP shifted the 48 hr EC<sub>50</sub> value of DOX from 5 ± 1 to 12 ± 2 µM (average ± SD of five independent assays, p=0.001 by two-tailed unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that first-cycle growth defects from 5 to 10 µM DOX reflect an apicoplast-specific mechanism but that DOX concentrations &gt; 10 µM cause off-target defects outside this organelle. We further tested this conclusion using continuous growth assays performed at constant DOX concentrations. We observed that IPP fully or nearly fully rescued parasites from first-cycle growth inhibition by 10 µM but not 20 or 40 µM Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We first considered the model that both 1 and 10 µM DOX inhibit apicoplast translation but that 10 µM DOX kills parasites faster due to more stringent translation inhibition at higher drug concentrations. This model predicts that treating parasites simultaneously with multiple distinct apicoplast-translation inhibitors, each added at a delayed death-inducing concentration, will produce additive, accelerated activity that kills parasites in the first cycle. To test this model, we treated synchronized D10 parasites with combinatorial doses of 2 µM DOX, 2 µM clindamycin, and 500 nM azithromycin and monitored growth over three intraerythrocytic cycles. Treatment with each antibiotic alone produced major growth defects at the end of the second cycle, as expected for delayed-death activity at these concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007</xref>). Two- and three-way drug combinations caused growth defects that were indistinguishable from individual treatments and provided no evidence for additive, first-cycle activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We failed to observe growth rescue by 10 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (toxicity limit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marvin et al., 2012</xref>]) or 500 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in continuous-growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or 48 hr growth-inhibition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, 500 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> (and to a lesser extent 500 µM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) fully or nearly fully rescued parasites from first-cycle growth inhibition by 10 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), although partial rescue was observed at FeCl<sub>3</sub> concentrations as low as 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, parasites treated with 10 µM DOX and 500 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> still succumbed to second-cycle, delayed death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as expected for distinct mechanisms of first- and second-cycle DOX activity.</p><p>We also observed that 500 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> but not CaCl<sub>2</sub> rescued first-cycle apicoplast-branching in 10 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations contrast with IPP, which rescued parasite viability in 10 µM DOX but did not restore apicoplast branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We further noted that FeCl<sub>3</sub> selectively rescued parasites from the apicoplast-specific, first-cycle growth effects of 10 µM DOX but did not rescue parasites from the second-cycle effects of 1 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) or the off-target effects of 20–40 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that 10 µM DOX kills parasites via a metal-dependent, first-cycle mechanism that blocks apicoplast biogenesis and is distinct from the second-cycle, delayed-death mechanism of 1 µM DOX.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Metal-dependent mechanisms of first-cycle activity by 10 µM DOX</title><p>What is the metal-dependent mechanism of 10 µM DOX, and why is there preferential rescue of parasite growth by FeCl<sub>3</sub>? Tetracyclines bind iron more tightly than other metals, with an equilibrium association constant of 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> for 1:1 chelation of Fe<sup>3+</sup> versus 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> for Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Rees, 1956</xref>). Although the 500 µM concentration of exogenous FeCl<sub>3</sub> required for maximal rescue of parasite growth in 10 µM DOX is large relative to the ~1 µM labile iron concentration estimated for the parasite cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scholl et al., 2005</xref>), the intracellular iron concentration achieved by exogenous addition of 500 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> remains unclear. Indeed, mechanisms of iron uptake and trafficking by blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remain sparsely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scholl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mabeza et al., 1999</xref>), especially uptake across the four membranes that surround the apicoplast.</p><p>We first considered whether exogenous FeCl<sub>3</sub> might selectively rescue parasites from 10 µM DOX by blocking or reducing its uptake into the parasite apicoplast, since metal chelation has been reported to influence the cellular uptake of tetracycline antibiotics in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nelson, 1998</xref>). However, 500 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> did not rescue second-cycle parasite death in continuous growth assays with 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or 1 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous iron resulted in only a small, 1.5 µM shift in EC<sub>50</sub> value from 0.5 to 2 µM in a 96 hr growth inhibition assay, in contrast to the 10.5 µM shift provided by IPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results strongly suggest that DOX uptake into the apicoplast is not substantially perturbed by exogenous iron. The inability of 500 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> to rescue parasites from first-cycle activity by ≥20 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) further suggests that general uptake of DOX into parasites is not substantially affected by exogenous iron.</p><p>We propose two distinct models to explain the metal-dependent effects of 10 µM DOX, both of which could contribute to apicoplast-specific activity. First, DOX could directly bind and sequester labile iron within the apicoplast, reducing its bioavailability for Fe-S cluster biogenesis and other essential iron-dependent processes in this organelle. Indeed, prior work has shown that apicoplast biogenesis requires Fe-S cluster synthesis apart from known essential roles in isoprenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>). In this first model, rescue by exogenous FeCl<sub>3</sub> would be due to restoration of iron bioavailability, while modest rescue by 500 µM MgCl<sub>2</sub> may reflect competitive displacement of DOX-bound iron to restore iron bioavailability. RPMI growth medium already contains ~400 µM Mg<sup>2+</sup> prior to supplementation with an addition 500 µM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and thus Mg<sup>2+</sup> availability is unlikely to be directly limited by 10 µM DOX. Consistent with a general mechanism that labile-iron chelation can block apicoplast biogenesis, we observed in preliminary studies that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> growth inhibited by the highly specific iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mabeza et al., 1999</xref>), could be partially rescued by IPP, fully rescued by exogenous FeCl<sub>3</sub>, and involved a first-cycle defect in apicoplast elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Development of targeted and incisive probes of labile iron within subcellular compartments remains an ongoing challenge in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breuer et al., 2008</xref>), especially in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> apicoplast where iron uptake, concentration, and utilization remain sparsely understood. To more broadly evaluate the impact of DOX on iron availability in the apicoplast, we are developing protein-based probes of lipoic acid and isoprenoid biosynthesis, as these two apicoplast-dependent processes require Fe/S-cluster biosynthesis for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In a second model, DOX could bind to additional macromolecular targets within the apicoplast (e.g. a metalloenzyme) via metal-dependent interactions that inhibit essential functions required for organelle biogenesis. Exogenous 500 µM Fe<sup>3+</sup> would then rescue parasites by disrupting these inhibitory interactions via competitive binding to DOX. This second model would be mechanistically akin to diketo acid inhibitors of HIV integrase like raltegravir that bind to active site Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to inhibit integrase activity but are displaced by exogenous metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grobler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2010</xref>). To test this model, we are developing a DOX-affinity reagent to identify apicoplast targets that interact with doxycycline and whose inhibition may contribute to first-cycle DOX activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions and implications</title><p>These results critically expand the paradigm for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of DOX activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasites. These mechanisms include a delayed, second-cycle defect at 1–3 µM DOX that likely reflects inhibition of 70S apicoplast ribosomes, a first-cycle iron-dependent defect within the apicoplast that uniquely operates at 8–10 µM DOX, and a first-cycle iron-independent mechanism outside the apicoplast at ≥20 µM DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that current 100–200 mg doses of DOX achieve peak human serum concentrations of 6–8 µM over the first six hours which then decrease to 1–2 µM over 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newton et al., 2005</xref>). Although current DOX treatment regimens result in delayed parasite clearance in vivo, both apicoplast-specific mechanisms of DOX likely operate over this concentration range and contribute to parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). These multiple mechanisms of DOX, together with limited antimalarial use of DOX in the field, may explain why parasites with stable DOX resistance have not emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrad and Rosenthal, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaillard et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There has been a prevailing view in the literature that delayed-death activity is a fundamental limitation of antibiotics like DOX that block apicoplast maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ramya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>). Our results emphasize that DOX is not an intrinsically slow-acting antimalarial drug and support the emerging paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher and Yeh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>) that inhibition of apicoplast biogenesis can defy the delayed-death phenotype to kill parasites on a faster time-scale. The first-cycle, iron-dependent impacts of 10 µM DOX or 15 µM DFO on apicoplast biogenesis also suggest that this organelle may be especially susceptible to therapeutic strategies that interfere with acquisition and utilization of iron, perhaps due to limited uptake of exogenous iron and/or limited iron storage mechanisms in the apicoplast.</p><p>Finally, this work suggests the possibility of repurposing DOX as a faster-acting antiparasitic treatment at higher dosing, whose multiple mechanisms would be expected to limit parasite resistance. Prior studies indicate that 500–600 mg doses in humans achieve sustained serum DOX concentrations ≥ 5 µM for 24–48 hr with little or no increase in adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marlin and Cheng, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adadevoh et al., 1976</xref>). DOX is currently contraindicated for long-term prophylaxis in pregnant women and young children, two of the major at-risk populations for malaria, due to concerns about impacts on fetal development and infant tooth discoloration, respectively, based on observed toxicities for other tetracyclines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaillard et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies suggest that these effects are not associated with short-term DOX use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaillard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Todd et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cross et al., 2016</xref>), and additional tests can define the safety parameters that would govern short-term use of DOX for treatment in these populations. Recent development of tetracycline derivatives with improved activities may provide another option to deploy this important class of antibiotics for antimalarial treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Draper et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Dd2</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1970614">1970614</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td valign="top">D10 <break/>ACP<sub>L</sub>-GFP</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10775264">10775264</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NF54-PfMev <break/>ACP<sub>L</sub>-GFP</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32059044">32059044</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism 8</td><td valign="top">GraphPad</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Doxycycline</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat.

DOX at 1-3 µM serum concentration dosing – the current standard – kills parasites in their second cycle while 8-10µM dosing kills parasites in their first cycle.

It is supported by two independent lines of evidence and helps to explain the absence of doxycycline resistance in the field. The role of metal ions in doxycycline function and bioavailability is complex. Dissecting the effects and proving specific activity requires multiple lines of evidence and robust data. Unfortunately, the data presented does not reach that level. Overall, the quality of the data presented throughout the paper (as outlined in detail below) is not of publishable standard in terms of replication and statistical analysis. The work has real potential but requires more robust data to support the claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiments are looking at differences in relatively narrow time frames, but the experimental description provided doesn't give sufficient information about the method of synchronization to assess the experiments. A single sorbitol synchronization produces parasites with an age range from 0 to ~18 hours post invasion, and the distribution of stages can vary between cultures. This large window of parasite age can strongly impact the effects of doxycycline (Dahl et al., 2007). Clarification of this procedure is essential to understanding the experimental results.</p><p>2) The absence of replication in the drug trials is not consistent with levels of data expected for publication. The minimal expectation is for three independent biological replicates in each drug trial which allows for statistical comparison. The drug assays presented were only done once (technical replicates…subsection “Parasite Growth Assays:”) which is not sufficient. The small differences seen in effective concentrations require robust statistical analysis. This is highlighted by the 2-fold difference in EC50 for two independent experiments for the Dd2 line (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C) which is similar in magnitude to the differences seen with IPP supplementation.</p><p>3) The data from the epi-fluorescence imaging requires clarification as to whether all images are from the same experiment and how the synchronization was done. Again, there should be data from multiple replicates, the phenotype needs to be quantified and the results statistically analyzed.</p><p>4) The presentation of data for the growth trials is confusing. 2-4 replicates were done but it seems that only one replicate is presented in the text and some others (but not all?) are presented in the supplementary figures. Is it possible to include a single figure with all the replicates and include a statistical analysis?</p><p>5) The arguments that the impact of iron chloride is not related to iron sequestering and/or oxidizing Doxycyline, or to a change in function related to altering the metals metals bound to the drug, would be improved by the inclusion of dose-response curves comparing effective concentrations with and without metal supplements. While not definitive they would go a long way to distinguishing between the various possibilities. The single experiment showing little change in growth of parasites under 1µM Doxycycline does not seem enough to address this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Doxycycline is an established antimalarial with a fairly well-defined, but complex mechanism of action. The authors carefully studied effects of intermediate concentrations of doxycycline to tease out apicoplast-specific and other effects of the compound. Their results are nicely demonstrated and well-described. The results mostly recapitulate what is already known, but they add the observation that iron rescues parasites from rapid killing by intermediate concentrations of doxycline. This offers what appears to be a valid, but incremental advance in our understanding of the antimalarial action of doxycycline. Some specific concerns are below.</p><p>1) Abstract. As mentioned in the text, but not noted in the Abstract, the first cycle activity of doxycycline has already been clearly described (e.g. Dahl et al., 2016; Yeh and DeRis, 2011; Wilson, et al., 2015). Readers of the Abstract will assume incorrectly that the authors are describing a novel result.</p><p>2) Abstract. The presentation of a &quot;new paradigm&quot; in the Abstract and Discussion section seems overstated. The MS offers only adds a potential explanation of antimalarial effects of intermediate concentrations of doxycycline; impacts of lower and higher concentrations have already been characterized. Also related to this sentence (and another in the discussion), lack of selection of stable resistance to doxycycline is probably explained by limited use for malaria, as seen with atovaquone/proguanil, another drug that selects readily for resistance in vitro, but has only been used for malaria prophylaxis, and for which resistance is uncommon. The suggestion that the lack of resistance selection is due to a unique mechanism of action is only conjecture, and should probably be omitted from the Abstract.</p><p>3) Results section. The sentence is confusing. &quot;…rescues the delayed-death activity…&quot; should be changed to &quot;…rescues parasites from the delayed-death activity…&quot;. A similar change is needed in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p><p>4) Figure 1 is attractive, but not very helpful for this manuscript, as it shows aspects of plasmodial biology not relevant for this discussion and doesn't clearly inform regarding doxycycline action.</p><p>5) Most of Figure 2 represents repeats (albeit nicely performed repeats) and variations of experiments that have been published by other groups.</p><p>6) Figure 3. The drug combination experiments are interesting, but interpretation is not as simple as implied. For example, clindamycin appears to lack the high dose rapid killing effects of doxycycline (Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007), so it is difficult to interpret rapid effects of combinations of doxycycline and clindamycin.</p><p>7) Discussion section. Mention of repurposing of doxycycline might also refer to studies of analogues, many with far-improved potency, as antimalarials (e.g. PMID: 23629719).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60246.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

In our view, the most important finding in our manuscript is that higher-dose DOX can kill parasites quickly (i.e., in the first intraerythrocytic cycle) by an apicoplast-specific mechanism that is distinct from the canonical second-cycle mechanism ascribed to apicoplast ribosome inhibition. The apicoplast-specific effects of DOX have been assumed to be intrinsically slow-acting due to a single mechanism. Our results critically expand this paradigm to clearly establish that higher-dose DOX can specifically block apicoplast biogenesis to kill parasites in the first cycle by a metal-dependent mechanism that is distinct from the canonical mechanism uniquely observed at lower DOX dose. This conclusion of a second, independent apicoplast-specific mechanism, which does not require knowing the specific metal-dependent mechanism, has important therapeutic implications for targeting apicoplast biogenesis and for guiding clinical use of DOX. The importance and timeliness of this conclusion are what drove our decision to submit this work to <italic>eLife</italic> as a short report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Under normal circumstances, I would expect more for an eLife paper – a clearer notion of mechanism, something less drastic than a super high metal concentration, and more guidance for future experiments.

While this amount of iron may seem high relative to the 1 µM labile iron estimated in the parasite cytoplasm, it is unclear what effective iron concentration inside the parasite, especially inside the apicoplast, is achieved by exogenous 500 µM iron. Indeed, iron uptake and trafficking mechanisms in bloodstage parasites are very sparsely studied or understood, and exogenous iron would have to traverse 7 membranes (RBC membrane, parasitophorous vacuole membrane, parasite membrane, and 4 apicoplast membranes) to reach the apicoplast matrix.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer on the importance and desire to elucidate the specific iron-dependent mechanism of higher-dose DOX in the apicoplast. We have expanded our discussion of possible iron-dependent mechanisms to include preliminary data for studies with the highly-specific iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), that support a general mechanism that labile-iron chelation can block apicoplast biogenesis (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). We have on-going studies of DFO and plan to publish a full analysis of these effects elsewhere. We also discuss experimental strategies we are currently using moving forward to test the impact of higher-dose DOX on labile iron availability in the apicoplast as well as to use DOX-affinity reagents to identify apicoplast-specific targets. We have tried to strike a balance on providing some guidance on what approaches we will take to resolve the first-cycle mechanism while not being overly speculative on what the outcomes may be, especially as the core conclusions of this manuscript do not depend critically on knowing the exact metal-dependent mechanism(s).</p><p>Although we agree on the importance of understanding mechanism, we also know that demonstration of specific mechanisms can be very challenging and slow. As a point of perspective, we note that apicoplast ribosomal translation inhibition by low-dose DOX has never been formally demonstrated as the specific mechanism of second-cycle parasite death. The observed phenotypes are consistent with this assumed mechanism and the known effects of DOX on bacterial ribosomes but have never been directly shown in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. Indeed, the Dahl et al., (2006) study, which is rightly regarded as one of the definitive studies of tetracycline effects on the apicoplast, studied apicoplast transcription, not translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The identification of a fast-acting, apicoplast-related mode of action for doxycycline is significant.

The effects of these short pulses are much more susceptible to variations in culture synchrony.</p><p>Our study used continuous drug exposure (i.e., drugs were added immediately after synchronization and maintained continuously) whose effects are expected to be less dependent on culture synchrony. Our initial experiments used a single treatment with 5% D-sorbitol to synchronize parasite, which results in a ~15-hour synchrony window. Culture synchrony and transition between stages were monitored by flow cytometry and blood smear (e.g., Figure 2B). To test the dependence of growth effects from continuous DOX treatment on culture synchrony, we repeated 48- and 96-hour dose-response assays with DOX, IPP, FeCl<sub>3</sub>, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> using a tighter 5-hour synchrony window obtained by magnet-purifying schizonts, incubating schizonts with fresh, uninfected erythrocytes for 5 hours, and then treating with 5% D-sorbitol (to kill remaining schizonts). The results obtained from synchronization with sorbitol alone versus magnet + sorbitol were indistinguishable within error (see 48-hour EC<sub>50</sub> curves for Dd2 sychronized by sorbitol alone and D10 synchronized by magnet + sorbitol).</p><p>We have revised the text and Materials and methods section to clearly indicate how parasites were synchronized in growth assays and microscopy experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The absence of replication in the drug trials is not consistent with levels of data expected for publication.

As we note below, the prevailing view in the literature (e.g., Ramya et al., 2007; Kennedy, Crisafulli and Ralph, 2019) is that DOX and other antibiotics that target apicoplast maintenance are fundamentally slow-acting drugs that cause delayed parasite death. The major contribution of our manuscript is our discovery that intermediate concentrations of DOX kill parasites quickly (i.e., in the first cycle) by apicoplast-specific effects that involve a novel iron-dependent mechanism, which has never been shown before. Our study thus critically expands the paradigm (see further explanation below) for understanding the fundamental antimalarial mechanisms of DOX. In our view, this new insight goes well beyond an “incremental advance in our understanding”. We feel strongly that this new understanding is exciting and important, can inform and impact clinical use of DOX and development of new therapeutic strategies that target apicoplast biogenesis, and will be of strong interest to the parasitology, microbial pathogenesis, and cell biology communities that read <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Abstract.

The manuscript offers only adds a potential explanation of antimalarial effects of intermediate concentrations of doxycycline; impacts of lower and higher concentrations have already been characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful perspective. We have revised the Abstract and Discussion section to state that our results “expand the paradigm for understanding the fundamental antiparasitic mechanisms of DOX.” The prevailing view in the literature (e.g., Ramya et al., 2007; Kennedy, Crisafulli and Ralph, 2019) is that DOX and other antibiotics that target apicoplast maintenance are fundamentally slow-acting drugs that cause delayed parasite death. Our results clarify that apicoplast-specific effects of 10 µM DOX are not intrinsically slow acting and that blocking apicoplast biogenesis can lead to first-cycle parasite death. We agree that the existing paradigm for understanding the action of 1 µM DOX on the apicoplast remains valid. However, our results indicate that this paradigm must be expanded to explain the apicoplast-specific action of 10 µM DOX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also related to this sentence (and another in the Discussion section), lack of selection of stable resistance to doxycycline is probably explained by limited use for malaria, as seen with atovaquone/proguanil, another drug that selects readily for resistance in vitro, but has only been used for malaria prophylaxis, and for which resistance is uncommon. The suggestion that the lack of resistance selection is due to a unique mechanism of action is only conjecture, and should probably be omitted from the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that limited use of DOX for treatment likely contributes substantially to the lack of parasite DOX resistance. We have removed this statement from the Abstract and have revised the subsection “Conclusions and implications” to state that “multiple mechanisms of DOX, together with limited antimalarial use of DOX in the field, may explain why parasites with stable DOX resistance have not emerged.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results section. The sentence is confusing. &quot;…rescues the delayed-death activity…&quot; should be changed to &quot;…rescues parasites from the delayed-death activity…&quot;. A similar change is needed in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we agree enhances clarity. We have revised these and other uses in the manuscript to refer to rescue of parasites or parasite growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1 is attractive, but not very helpful for this manuscript, as it shows aspects of plasmodial biology not relevant for this discussion and doesn't clearly inform regarding doxycycline action.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We have revised Figure 1 to only depict general features of blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> biology and to graphically summarize the distinct mechanisms of doxycycline elucidated in our study that operate in discrete concentration ranges. Colleagues who reviewed drafts of our manuscript consistently mentioned that a graphical summary of proposed mechanisms was helpful and clarifying. We anticipate that this figure will also be helpful to general readers who may be unfamiliar with blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the apicoplast, and the many membranes that separate the extracellular space from the apicoplast matrix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Most of Figure 2 represents repeats (albeit nicely performed repeats) and variations of experiments that have been published by other groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have reported second-cycle parasite death by 1 µM DOX, its rescue by IPP, and first-cycle death by DOX concentrations &gt;5 µM. We have clarified in the text that these results were already known. We have repeated these studies in Figure 2 to provide an experimental baseline from which to test the ability of IPP and metals to rescue parasite growth in 10 µM DOX and to show that iron does not rescue second-cycle growth inhibition by 1 or 10 µM DOX. IPP and iron rescue of first-cycle parasite growth in 10 µM DOX has never been shown before our study. We feel strongly that repeating the prior studies is an important control in order to conclude that IPP and iron can selectively rescue parasite growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3. The drug combination experiments are interesting, but interpretation is not as simple as implied. For example, clindamycin appears to lack the high dose rapid killing effects of doxycycline (Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007), so it is difficult to interpret rapid effects of combinations of doxycycline and clindamycin.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that the experimental test in Figure 3A does not require rapid killing by clindamycin in order to test the model that faster parasite death by higher dose DOX is due to more stringent translation inhibition at higher drug combination. These drugs are all proposed to bind to apicoplast ribosomes (CLI and AZM to the 50S subunit, DOX to the 30S subunit) and inhibit protein translation. All of the drug concentrations used in this experiment (2 µM DOX, 2 µM clindamycin, and 500 nM azithromycin) cause second-cycle parasite death when used individually. If delayed, second-cycle death by 1 µM DOX is due to incomplete inhibition of ribosomal translation (and faster action by 10 µM DOX due to more stringent ribosome inhibition), then combination with other ribosome inhibitors (all used at concentrations that cause slow death via presumed ribosome binding) would be predicted to increase the stringency of ribosome inhibition in an additive fashion (akin to increasing DOX concentration alone). Thus, if incomplete ribosome inhibition is the cause of delayed death, then increasing the stringency of inhibition would be predicted to accelerate activity into the first cycle.</p><p>Our observation that combination of all three inhibitors at these concentrations does not lead to first-cycle parasite death strongly suggests that increased ribosome inhibition at higher DOX concentration is not the mechanism of faster, first-cycle activity at 10 µM DOX. The additional observations in Figure 3 that iron rescues parasites from first- but not second-cycle death in 1 or 10 µM DOX strongly support our conclusion that first-cycle activity by 10 µM reflects a distinct mechanism from ribosomal inhibition ascribed to 1 µM DOX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion section. Mention of repurposing of doxycycline might also refer to studies of analogues, many with far-improved potency, as antimalarials (e.g. PMID: 23629719).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this study to our attention. We now cite this paper at the end of the subsection “Conclusions and Implications”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
