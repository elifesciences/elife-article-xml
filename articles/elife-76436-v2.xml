In the absence of TRIM-21, CED-1 accumulated post-translationally and drove cell corpse degradation defects, as evidenced by direct binding to VHA-10.

When <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> cells undergo apoptosis, the activation of CED-8 by CED-3 produces phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface, acting as an ‘eat-me’ signal that is recognized by phagocytes to activate two parallel, redundant genetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>ced-2/5/12</italic> pathway mediates the activation of the small GTPase CED-10/Rac1, leading to rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton for cell corpse engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). In the <italic>ced-1/6/7</italic> pathway, TTR-52 binds to both exposed PS and the extracellular domain of CED-1, acting as a bridging molecule to cross-link PS with CED-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). CED-7, a homolog of the mammalian ABC transporter, functions in both dying and engulfing cells, is required for the enrichment of CED-1 around cell corpses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mapes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu and Horvitz, 1998</xref>). After the phagocytic receptor CED-1 recognizes PS, the adaptor protein CED-6 (GULP) interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of CED-1 through its phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) to transduce engulfment signals to downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Hengartner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Su et al., 2002</xref>), including the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), clathrin, and clarithin adaptors AP2 or epsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), to promote actin rearrangement for the internalization of ACs. The <italic>ced-1/6/7</italic> and <italic>ced-2/5/12</italic> pathways lead to the internalization of ACs and formation of phagosomes. The phagosomes then fuse with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes that digest corpses using lysosomal acid hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kinchen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>CED-1 shares a sequence similarity with several cell surface proteins, including multiple EGF-like domains 10 (MEGF10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kay et al., 2012</xref>) and Jedi in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) and Draper in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>), all of which have been implicated in the recognition of ACs. Our previous work showed that the CED-1 receptor is recycled from the phagosome back to the cell membrane by the retromer complex. The recycling of CED-1 by the retromer complex is critical for AC clearance as the loss of function of the retromer results in the lysosomal degradation of CED-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> glial cells, Draper intracellular domain promotes phagocytosis through an ITAM-domain-SFK-Syk-mediated signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>). And the transcriptional factor STAT92e promotes the clearance of degenerating axonal debris by directly activating the transcriptional expression of Draper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Musashe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Purice et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the transcriptional factor Serpent, a GATA factor homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Waltzer et al., 2016</xref>), was observed to be required for sufficient phagocytosis of ACs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic macrophages through the Draper regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shlyakhover et al., 2018</xref>). Our recent study also showed that Bfc serves as a Serpent co-factor to upregulate transcription of the engulfment receptor Croquemort, and thus boosts macrophage efferocytosis in response to excessive apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). These studies indicate that specific levels of engulfment receptors, including CED-1/Draper, are required for this engulfment function. Whether CED-1 is regulated by other pathway to maintain appropriate levels for executing engulfment function remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we report the identification of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, tripartite motif containing-21 (TRIM-21), as a novel regulator of cell corpse clearance. We observed that TRIM-21 acts in conjunction with UBC-21, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, to catalyze K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of CED-1, thus promoting CED-1 degradation. In addition, we found that tyrosine kinase SRC-1 phosphorylated Y1019 in the YXXL motif of CED-1, which was subsequently bound by the adaptor protein NCK-1. The binding of CED-1 to CED-6 or NCK-1 is required for the ubiquitination of CED-1 by TRIM-21. Moreover, we discovered that failure by TRIM-21 to degrade CED-1 led to excessive CED-1, which was sufficient to affect phagosomal acidification by binding to vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunit (VHA-10), resulting in cell corpse degradation defects. Our results reveal a novel ubiquitin-mediated regulatory mechanism that regulates the amount of CED-1 to facilitate cell corpse clearance. The expression of human TRIM21 can substitute for <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRIM-21 function in removing cell corpses, indicating the conserved roles of human TRIM21 in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway participates in the degradation of CED-1</title><p>Based on our previous work, which showed that the CED-1 receptor is recycled to the cell membrane by the Retromer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), we sought to better understand which pathways participate in CED-1-mediated phagocytosis. To this end, we blocked the lysosome binding with chloroquine (CQ); this prevented the formation of acidic conditions required for lysosomal enzymatic function. We found that pretreatment of wild-type (WT) <italic>C. elegans</italic> with CQ led to a marked increase in the endogenous levels of CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results suggest that although CED-1 is recycled to the cell membrane during phagocytosis of the cell corpse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), the remaining CED-1 still undergoes lysosome-mediated degradation.</p><p>Given that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the other major protein degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Varshavsky, 2017</xref>), we next blocked this pathway, either through chemical inhibition or RNAi silencing, to test whether CED-1 homeostasis is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In WT worms pre-treated with different concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, we observed that endogenous CED-1 accumulated to higher levels with increasing doses of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then generated <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNAi knocked down for either the sole E1 enzyme gene <italic>uba-1</italic> or the single-copy ubiquitin gene <italic>ubq-2</italic> and found that endogenous levels of CED-1 were significantly increased compared to WT controls in both of these transient suppression lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that the proteasomal pathway was involved in CED-1 degradation. The endogenous levels of CED-1 following treatment with MG132 were significantly higher than those after treatment with <italic>uba-1</italic> or <italic>ubq-2</italic> knockdown, likely because MG132 caused loss of proteasome function, whereas <italic>uba-1</italic> and <italic>ubq-2</italic> knockdown only decreased the ubiquitination modification. To examine the relationship between lysosome- and proteasome-dependent CED-1 degradation, we treated <italic>C. elegans</italic> with CQ and MG132 overlay and found that endogenous levels of CED-1 were significantly increased compared to those after CQ or MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is possible that proteasomal degradation independently affects the stability of another protein that influences lysosomal degradation of CED-1. To determine whether CED-1 could be ubiquitylated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we generated an integrated transgenic strain, <italic>xwhIs27(P<sub>ced-1</sub>ced-1::flag),</italic> that overexpressed CED-1-FLAG under the control of its native promoter. We also used CRISPR-Cas9 to insert a FLAG tag into the C-terminus of the endogenous <italic>ced-1</italic> gene locus, resulting in strain <italic>xwh18(ced-1::flag</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with antibodies against ubiquitin (Ub) revealed several poly-ubiquitinated forms of CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that CED-1 was indeed poly-ubiquitinated in the worms. These observations confirmed that CED-1 acted as a substrate for poly-ubiquitylation and was degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRIM-21 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the degradation of CED-1.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, D</bold>) The endogenous CED-1 was examined by immunoblot analysis in N2 treated with different concentrations of MG-132 (<bold>A</bold>), control RNAi, <italic>uba-1</italic> RNAi, and <italic>ubq-2</italic> RNAi (<bold>B</bold>), control RNAi, <italic>b0281.8</italic> RNAi<italic>, k01g5.1</italic> RNAi<italic>,</italic> and <italic>f43c11.7</italic> RNAi (<bold>D</bold>).

down by GST-TRIM-21 but not by GST, indicating that TRIM-21 could directly interact with CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To further determine whether TRIM-21 also interacts with CED-1 in vivo, we generated an integrated transgenic strain <italic>xwhIs28(P<sub>hsp-16</sub>trim-21::flag</italic>) that expressed a TRIM-21-FLAG fusion protein under the control of a heat shock promoter and found that CED-1 was immunoprecipitated from heat shock-treated worm lysates using FLAG antibodies, but not from untreated control lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results confirmed that TRIM-21 interacts with CED-1 in vivo.</p><p>To identify which regions of CED-1 and TRIM-21 were required for binding interactions, we generated a series of truncation constructs for both CED-1 and TRIM-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), and then used Y2H and GST pull-down assays to check for the loss of interaction or binding. The results showed that the amino acid region between residues 931–1007 in the intracellular, but not extracellular, domain of CED-1 was sufficient to bind TRIM-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and the coiled-coil domain of TRIM-21 was required for its interaction with CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using an integrated <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain <italic>smIs34</italic> expressing a full-length CED-1::GFP fusion protein under the native CED-1 promoter and a second integrated transgenic line, <italic>smIs110,</italic> which expressed a GFP-fused CED-1 with the C-terminal region deleted (CED-1ΔC::GFP), also driven by the native promoter, revealed that TRIM-21 interacted with the full-length CED-1, but not with the CED-1 variant harboring a C-terminal deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These data demonstrated that CED-1-TRIM-21 binding was mediated by the interaction between the CED-1 intracellular domain and the TRIM-21 coiled-coil domain. Interestingly, we found that hTRIM21 interacted with MEGF10-CT and CED-1-CT, whereas TRIM-21 interacted with CED-1-CT and MEGF10-CT, suggesting that TRIM-21 is an ancient E3 ligase in which the coiled-coil domain recognizes its substrate CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the structural basis of TRIM-21 binding, we used CRISPR-Cas-9 to generate a mutant allele of <italic>trim-21</italic> (<italic>xwh12</italic>) with a nonsynonymous mutation that led to a premature stop codon at the N-terminus in WT worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). WB analysis indicated that CED-1 protein accumulated to significantly higher levels in worms carrying the <italic>trim-21</italic>(<italic>xwh12</italic>) allele than in those carrying the WT allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), but the transcription level of CED-1 was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), which further suggested that TRIM-21 was required for CED-1 degradation. We then crossed the <italic>trim-21-</italic>bearing strain <italic>xwh12</italic> with <italic>smIs34</italic> (expressing CED-1::GFP driven by the native promoter), <italic>bcIs39</italic> (expressing sheath cell-specific CED-1::GFP under the <italic>lim-7</italic> promoter), and <italic>smIs110</italic> (expressing CED-1ΔC::GFP). We observed that full-length CED-1::GFP in <italic>smIs34</italic> and <italic>bcIs39</italic>, but not CED-1ΔC::GFP in <italic>smIs110</italic>, were higher in the progeny carrying <italic>trim-21</italic>(<italic>xwh12</italic>) than in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), which demonstrated that the CED-1 intracellular domain was required for its binding and degradation by TRIM-21. Additionally, the endogenous levels of CED-1 were higher in <italic>trim-21; smIs34</italic> and slightly higher in <italic>trim-21; bcIs39</italic> but unchanged in <italic>trim-21; smls110</italic> as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). This may be because <italic>smIs34</italic>, <italic>smIs110</italic>, and <italic>bcIs39</italic> are three transgenic integrated strains containing different copy numbers of extrachromosomal arrays integrated into the chromosome. This may lead to differences in the levels of CED-1 overexpression in <italic>smIs34</italic> and <italic>bcIs39</italic>. In <italic>bcIs39</italic>, exogenous CED-1 may be expressed at a higher level than that in <italic>smIs34</italic>, possibly masking the ability of TRIM-21 to degrade endogenous CED-1. In <italic>smIs110,</italic> CED-1ΔC::GFP (a GFP-fused CED-1 with the C-terminal region deleted) was still capable of recognizing neighboring ACs, suggesting that it competes with endogenous CED-1 for signal transduction, including recruiting TRIM-21 for its degradation. We next examined whether lysosomal pathway degradation of CED-1 was affected by <italic>trim-21</italic>. Following knockdown of VPS-37, which blocks lysosomal degradation of CED-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), in WT worms and the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant, the endogenous levels of CED-1 were significantly higher than those in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M and N</xref>). Thus, TRIM-21 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacted with CED-1 to mediate its degradation independently of lysosome-dependent degradation of CED-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>UBC-21 and TRIM-21 together mediate CED-1 poly-ubiquitination</title><p>To identify which E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme(s) could mediate CED-1 degradation, we elucidated the endogenous level of CED-1 by WB screening (in triplicate) of <italic>C. elegans</italic> treated with 22 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kipreos, 2005</xref>).

TRIM-21. Notably, poly-ubiquitination of CED-1-CT was completely abolished by the removal of either UBC-21 or TRIM-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that UBC-21 and TRIM-21 mediated the poly-ubiquitination of CED-1-CT in vitro.</p><p>To determine whether CED-1 was ubiquitinated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in vivo, we inserted <italic>flag</italic> and <italic>ha</italic> tags into the endogenous <italic>ced-1</italic> and <italic>ubq-2</italic> loci using CRISPR-Cas9 to obtain the <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains <italic>xwh18(ced-1::flag</italic>) and <italic>xwh20(ha::ubq-2</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We then crossed the <italic>xwh18</italic> and <italic>xwh20</italic> strains to obtain progeny carrying tagged forms of these proteins and performed anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation to test whether CED-1 was modified with UBQ-2. Antibody detection of HA in immunoprecipitation lysates obtained from the recombinant progeny revealed a smear of high<italic>-</italic>molecular mass species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that CED-1 was poly-ubiquitinated in the worms.

In addition, we generated strains carrying individual, non-synonymous K48R or K63R conversion mutations in UBQ-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). WB assays to detect ubiquitination of CED-1 by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation showed that K48R-, but not K63R-, ubiquitin abolished CED-1 poly-ubiquitination in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), indicating that CED-1 was modified by K48-linked, but not K63-linked poly-ubiquitination.

Therefore, we determined that CED-6 directly interacted with TRIM-21 in vivo. To identify the region(s) of TRIM-21 and CED-6 participating in their binding interactions, we used Y2H and GST pull-down assays to examine CED-6 interactions with various TRIM-21 truncation variants. These experiments showed that the PTB domain of CED-6 was sufficient to bind TRIM-21, whereas the coiled-coil domain of TRIM-21 was required for its interaction with CED-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

Next, we addressed whether N962A mutations in the NPXY domain of CED-1 affected its protein levels. We found that the CED-1 levels were higher in the N962A mutants than in the WT CED-1 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Moreover, we found that the poly-ubiquitination of CED-1 was also reduced in <italic>ced-6(xwh25</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>).

Subsequent Y2H assays indicated that both the SH2 and SH3 domains of SRC-1 were required for interaction with the CED-1 intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The phosphorylation of YXXL motif in CED-1 by SRC-1 is required for CED-1 degradation.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) The interaction between CED-1-CT 1617 and SRC-1 was examined by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analyses (<bold>A</bold>), GST pull-down assays (<bold>B</bold>), co-IP by 0.5 mM biotin in 293T cells (<bold>C</bold>), and the CED-1-SRC-1 interaction occurs through the SH3 and SH2 domain of SRC-1 in Y2H (<bold>D</bold>).

phagocytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether SRC-1 indeed mediated CED-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we performed in vitro kinase assays by incubating CED-1-CT-FLAG with SRC-1 in a reaction mixture containing ATP. Using the Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain, we detected the phosphorylation signal when CED-1-CT-FLAG was incubated with SRC-1, but not in control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then used an anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-P-TYR-100) antibody to confirm that the tyrosine phosphorylation site in CED-1-CT was phosphorylated by SRC-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the transcriptional factor STAT92e promotes clearance of degenerating axonal debris in the glia by directly activating the transcriptional expression of Draper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Musashe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Purice et al., 2016</xref>). We found that knockdown of <italic>sta-2</italic>, a homolog of <italic>STAT92e</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, led to accumulation of cell corpses in the germline and decreased expression of CED-1 at the transcriptional and translational levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), indicating that conserved STAT92e in <italic>Drosophila</italic> promotes transcriptional expression of Draper. In light of these results, we next investigated whether SRC-1 was required for CED-1 degradation. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a mutant allele of <italic>src-1(xwh26</italic>), in which a premature stop codon was introduced at the N-terminus in WT worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We found that endogenous levels of CED-1 were higher in the <italic>src-1(xwh26</italic>) knockout worms than those in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, we found that poly-ubiquitination of CED-1 was attenuated in <italic>src-1-</italic>silenced worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results confirmed that SRC-1 was required for CED-1 degradation via the proteasome pathway. Moreover, we observed that <italic>src-1</italic> knockdown led to increased cell corpse numbers in both <italic>ced-2(n1994</italic>) and <italic>ced-1(e1735</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>), suggesting that <italic>src-1</italic> did not act specifically within either pathway to regulate cell corpse removal.</p><p>To identify the specific sites in the CED-1 intracellular domain (CED-1-CT) phosphorylated by SRC-1, we performed in vitro kinase assays, excising the CED-1-CT bands from the SDS-PAGE gel and purifying them for analysis by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This assay revealed that one amino acid had substantially greater phosphorylation than the other sites: Tyr-1019 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Notably, this residue was the same as the predicted tyrosine phosphorylation site in the YXXL motif (residues 1019–1022) of the CED-1 intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). To test the effects of abolishing this site, we generated a non-synonymous mutation that converted the conserved YXXL tyrosine residue (Y1019) to phenylalanine and found that the Y1019F variant did not rescue the engulfment defects observed in <italic>ced-1(e1735</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). These results indicated that this residue was necessary for the engulfment activity mediated by CED-1, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). We then asked whether the Y1019F mutation affected CED-1 phosphorylation by SRC-1. We found less Pro-Q Diamond staining and decreased phosphorylation of CED-1, assessed by anti-PY antibody, when the CED-1(Y1019F) variant was incubated with SRC-1, thus confirming that SRC-1 phosphorylated CED-1 at the Y1019 tyrosine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>We then sought to determine whether the Y1019F mutation in CED-1 also affected its binding to CED-6 or TRIM-21. Y2H and GST pull-down assays showed that the CED-1(Y1019F) variant could still bind to CED-6 or TRIM-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>), which suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation was not required for YXXL-mediated binding to CED-6 or TRIM-21. Next, to address whether mutations in the N962 and Y1019 residues affected CED-1 protein stability, we introduced N962A(<italic>xwh21</italic>) and Y1019F(<italic>xwh22</italic>) mutations individually into the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome at the <italic>ced-1</italic> locus in the <italic>ced-1::flag(xwh18</italic>) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We found that the degradation rates of the N962A and Y1019F CED-1 mutants were lower than those of WT CED-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J and K</xref>). Moreover, we found that poly-ubiquitination of CED-1 was also reduced in the N962A and Y1019F mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L and M</xref>). These results confirmed that SRC-1 phosphorylated the tyrosine residue of the CED-1 YXXL motif, which is required for CED-1 degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein NCK-1 is required for CED-1 degradation</title><p>Previous studies have proposed that the tyrosine sites in the YXXL motif (residues 1019–1022) of the CED-1 intracellular domain are phosphorylated and subsequently bound by an adaptor protein containing the SH2 domain, which shares a partially redundant function with another PTB domain protein in CED-1-mediated cell corpse clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, we found that SRC-1 function was partially redundant with that of CED-6 in CED-1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To identify the adaptor protein containing an SH2 domain that could bind to the YXXL motif of CED-1, we generated RNAi knockdowns of 60 SH2 domain proteins and screened for germline cell death in three replicate experiments. This screen revealed that the inactivation of <italic>nck-1</italic> increased the number of germline corpses in all three experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). We also found that NCK-1 interacted with CED-1-CT in Y2H assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and that recombinant NCK-1 protein was efficiently pulled down by GST-CED-1-CT and GST-TRIM-21, but not by GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that NCK-1 could directly interact with the CED-1 intracellular domain and TRIM-21. These results confirmed co-IP with CED-1-CT or TRIM-21 tagged with TurboID ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

We observed that TRIM-21::mCherry was ubiquitously expressed in the worms and appeared to be localized in the cytoplasm. In early larvae, TRIM-21::mCherry was mainly observed in pharyngeal muscle cells and body wall muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). A previous study showed that overexpression of CED-1 reduces cell corpses in <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants that impair CED-1 recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). However, we found that overexpression of CED-1 enhanced the cell corpse phenotype in the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). To test whether TRIM-21 could reverse the engulfment defects in a <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutant, we observed the extra-chromosomal expression of TRIM-21::GFP driven by its native promoter (<italic>P<sub>trim-21</sub>trim-21::gfp</italic>) and found complete rescue of cell corpse clearance in <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). We found a high level of conservation between TRIM-21 from <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its homolog, hTRIM21, in humans.

These data indicated that TRIM-21 and UBC-21 acted together to promote AC clearance. In addition, the loss of <italic>trim-21</italic> or <italic>ubc-21</italic> function did not further increase the accumulation of corpses in <italic>ced-1(e1735</italic>) germline cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L</xref>), suggesting that <italic>trim-21</italic>, <italic>ubc-21,</italic> and <italic>ced-1</italic> probably function in the same genetic pathway. Fluorescence microscopic observation of the <italic>ubc-21(xwh16</italic>) and <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) germline cells and embryos indicated that cell corpses were surrounded by CED-1::GFP phagocytic receptor–reporter fusion protein, just as in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F, and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1M and N</xref>), which suggested that recognition and initiation of engulfment were unaffected by the knockout of either gene. Next, we individually integrated a panel of GFP- or mCHERRY-tagged phagosomal markers into the <italic>ubc-21(xwh16</italic>) and <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutants, respectively, and found that phagosome association with LAAT-1, a lysosomal membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), was significantly reduced in both the <italic>ubc-21(xwh16</italic>) and <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1M and N</xref>). Moreover, the signal from NUC-1, a lysosomal DNase, and CPL-1, a lysosomal cathepsin protease, was also significantly decreased on phagosomes in the <italic>ubc-21(xwh16</italic>) and <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1M and N</xref>).

We found that AO staining was greatly reduced in <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutants compared with the WT worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), suggesting that the loss of <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) affected the acidification of cell corpse-containing phagosomes. To directly monitor the degradation process of cell corpses, we introduced a germline-specific transgenic marker for chromatin, H2B::mCHERRY, into <italic>trim-21(xwh16</italic>) mutants. We found that in the wild-type the chromatin in early germ cell corpses was condensed and disappeared within 60 min (54.6 ± 4.44 min; n = 5). In contrast, although the chromatin in early germ cell corpses of <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutants was also condensed, it diffused throughout the corpse in the later stages of phagosome maturation, and the mCHERRY signal persisted for 90 min (90.2 ± 8.10 min, n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1O</xref>), indicating that chromatin degradation was greatly delayed in the cell corpses of the mutant strain. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that the accumulation of cell corpses caused by the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutation was due to defects in cell corpse digestion in engulfing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Excessive CED-1 binding to the V-ATPase subunit VHA-10 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant worms negatively affects the maturation and acidification of cell corpse-containing phagosomes</title><p>Since endogenous CED-1 was increased by the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutation, we therefore proposed that excessive CED-1 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant worms negatively affected the maturation and acidification of cell corpse-containing phagosomes.

For this purpose, we established an integrated line that expressed Flag-tagged CED-1-CT (CED-1-CT Flag) under the control of a heat shock promoter in WT animals. Next, we immunoprecipitated CED-1-CT Flag with an anti-Flag antibody and used LC-MS/MS to identify proteins bound to CED-1-CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In total, 15 proteins were identified as interaction partners of CED-1-CT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>), with endosome system proteins representing the most attractive candidates.

This VHA subunit performs the same function across a multitude of essential cellular processes, such as acidification of lysosomes and intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins and Forgac, 2020</xref>). V-ATPase-mediated acidification of lysosomes is required for the activation of lysosomal hydrolases and ultimately leads to the enzymatic degradation of the cell corpse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ernstrom et al., 2012</xref>). We found that <italic>vha-10</italic> knockdown by RNAi resulted in the increased germ cell corpse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) due to delayed clearance of dying or dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We next examined the effects of VHA-10 on TRIM-21-mediated corpse clearance and found that <italic>vha-10</italic> knockdown did not affect corpse clearance defects in the <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutant strain, suggesting that <italic>trim-21</italic> and <italic>vha-10</italic> likely function in the same genetic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In addition, the knockdown of <italic>vha-10</italic> impaired phagosome maturation at a late stage as well as the acidification of phagosomes containing cell corpses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>), which was similar to the phenotype of <italic>trim-21</italic> loss-of-function mutants.</p><p>To address whether the dysfunction of <italic>vha-10</italic> was responsible for the defects in cell corpse degradation in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants, we overexpressed VHA-10 by placing it under the control of the <italic>ced-1</italic> promoter (<italic>P<sub>ced-1</sub>vha-10::mcherry</italic>) in <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutant animals. Interestingly, VHA-10 overexpression fully attenuated the increased cell corpse phenotype and completely restored the acidification of phagosome defects in <italic>trim-21(xwh13</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I and J</xref>), indicating that VHA-10 dysfunction in engulfing cells caused defects in cell corpse degradation exhibited by <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants.</p><p>CED-1 is recycled from phagosome membranes to plasma membranes via the retromer complex, and a failure in recycling results in lysosomal degradation of CED-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). We next investigated CED-1 recycling in the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant. Recruitment and release of CED-1::GFP to cell corpses in <italic>trim-21</italic> (8.29 ± 0.48 min, n = 5) was similar to that in the WT (8.31 ± 0.25 min, n = 5) but not to that in <italic>snx-1</italic> (&gt;30 min, n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Previous studies suggested that CED-1 specifically initiates engulfment and controls phagosome maturation during cell corpse clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). To confirm whether CED-1 was indeed degraded by proteasomes in addition to lysosomal degradation during phagosome maturation, we examined CED-1::GFP levels on the plasma membranes, phagosomal membranes, and phagolysosomal membranes in <italic>trim-21</italic> and <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants and in double mutants lacking both TRIM-21 and SNX-1. The CED-1::GFP levels in the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants were comparable to those on the N2 in plasma membranes, phagosomal membranes, and phagolysosomal membranes, whereas <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants and <italic>trim-21; snx-1</italic> double mutants exhibited lower CED-1::GFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).</p><p>In addition, co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on phagosomes was dramatically increased in <italic>trim-21</italic> and <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants compared to in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). To further verify whether the interaction between CED-1 and VHA-10 varied in the <italic>trim-21</italic> or <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants, we inserted an HA tag into the endogenous <italic>vha-10</italic> loci using CRISPR-Cas9 to generate <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains <italic>xwh52(ha::vha-10</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). A similar CED-1-VHA-10 interaction was observed in <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants and the WT; this interaction was greatly enhanced in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>), suggesting that excessive CED-1 in the <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants bound VHA-10, unlike in the <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants. Based on our findings, we proposed the ubiquitination of CED-1 by TRIM-21 occurs on forming phagosomes. Therefore, the transmembrane receptor CED-1 is presumably accumulated on the phagosomal surface due to the loss of function of TRIM-21. While we found that the level of CED-1 on phagosomes and phagolysosomes was not altered in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants, whereas the co-localization and interaction of CED-1-VHA-10 were enhanced. A possible explanation for this might be that the level of excessive CED-1 is localized on the individual phagosomal surface in each phagocyte and goes through the dynamic phagosome maturation process. As a result, a substantial difference of CED-1 localized to the phagosomes and phagolysosomes between <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants and WT worms cannot be captured by the fluorescent image quantification method. Although levels of CED-1 and interaction of CED-1-VHA-10 were increased in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants lysis than in WT controls by the WB detection method, this reflects the change of a large number of phagosomes from massive amounts of phagocytes. Another possible explanation is that the excessive CED-1 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants accumulated on the phagosomal surface affects multiple stages of phagosome maturation process, which slows down the whole maturation process rather than a specific step, undetectable at the stage that we captured. As the mechanism determining which portions of CED-1 are ubiquitinated by TRIM-21 is unknown, we cannot distinguish portion of CED-1 regulated by TRIM-21 from the portion of CED-1 regulated by other mechanisms in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants, making it difficult to follow where the excessive CED-1 is localized in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants.</p><p>A crucial step in phagosome maturation is the gradual acidification of the phagosomal lumen because an acidic environment promotes the activity of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade phagosomal contents. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, cell corpse-containing phagosome acidification begins fairly early, with Rab5 positive early phagosomes staining weakly with AO, indicating that there are multiple modes of acidification depending on the stage of maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kinchen et al., 2008</xref>). Later study revealed that RAB-2 and RAB-14 act partially redundantly to promote phagosome acidification and recruit lysosomes for phagolysosome formation for cell corpse degradation, whereas RAB-7 mediates fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes but is largely dispensable for the acidification of phagosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, indicating that acidification of cell corpse-containing phagosomes does not appear to be dependent on efficient phagosome–lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu and Zhou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Yang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanism by which V-type ATPases regulate acidification of phagosomes containing ACs or AC degradation has not been thoroughly investigated. We discovered that excessive CED-1 binding to the V-ATPase in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant worms reduces acidification of cell corpse-containing phagosomes. However, future research is needed to determine the precise stage at which phagosome acidification is affected, as well as how excessive CED-1 binding to VHA-10 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants affects cell corpse degradation. Taken together, excess CED-1, which accumulated in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants, bound to the VHA-10 subunit of V-ATPase, negatively affected the acidification of phagosomes, and consequently blocked cell corpse degradation. Additionally, TRIM-21-mediated proteasome degradation of CED-1 occurs independently of lysosomal degradation of CED-1 through loss of function of the retromer complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies indicate that a sufficient amount of CED-1/Draper is critical for its engulfment function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hilu-Dadia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manaka et al., 2004</xref>). Whether appropriate levels of CED-1 are maintained for executing engulfment function remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we identified TRIM-21 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as an important negative regulator of the engulfment receptor CED-1 and as a previously unrecognized component of the CED-1 pathway for AC clearance. In the absence of TRIM-21, the CED-1 protein accumulated to excess levels. We found that TRIM-21 ubiquitinates CED-1 directly, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. The TRIM-21-mediated degradation of CED-1 appears to be activated by CED-1 NPXY motif binding to the CED-6 adaptor protein or after phosphorylation of the CED-1 YXXL motif by the tyrosine kinase, SRC-1, and subsequent binding by the adaptor protein, NCK-1. ITAM of Draper is phosphorylated by Src42a and binds to Shark, a tyrosine kinase homologous to Syk, to promote phagocytic signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ziegenfuss et al., 2008</xref>). This signaling pathway of Draper is conserved among the mammalian phagocytic receptors Jedi-1 and MEGF10, which can independently interact with Syk through ITAMs and promote phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheib et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, <italic>C. elegans</italic> CED-1 lacks ITAM and contains only a single YXXL at its intracellular terminus. Our data indicate that SRC-1 phosphorylates YXXL of CED-1, and that phosphorylated CED-1 binds NCK-1, which has not been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. Our results show that SRC-1 does not act within a single specific engulfment pathway, which differs from the findings of previous studies that reported that SRC-1 acts as a bridging molecule to link CED-2 and INA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsu and Wu, 2010</xref>). Since the strong loss-of-function allele of <italic>src-1</italic> exhibits embryonic lethality, one possible explanation for this discrepancy may be differences in the efficiency of <italic>src-1</italic> knockdown. In <italic>trim-21</italic> knockout worms, CED-1 degradation mediated by TRIM-21 was essential for AC clearance because the accumulation of excess CED-1 protein blocked cell corpse degradation via binding with VHA-10 subunit of the proton pump for phagosomal acidification. Therefore, after CED-1 mediates signal transduction by interacting with cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, some amount of CED-1 should be rapidly ‘cleared’ to facilitate cell corpse degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of TRIM-21-mediated CED-1 degradation through the proteasome pathway.</title><p>After phagocytic receptors (CED-1) recognize apoptotic cells and cell corpse engulfment, TRIM-21 is recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes through two parallel pathways and ubiquitinates part of CED-1 for proteasomal degradation. One pathway occurs after the NPXY motif of CED-1 binds to the adaptor protein CED-6, and TRIM-21 released from CED-6 and ubiquitinates CED-1. The other occurs when a tyrosine residue in the YXXL motif of CED-1 is phosphorylated by tyrosine kinase SRC-1, and the phosphorylated CED-1 YXXL motif recruits an adaptor protein NCK-1 (containing the SH2 domain), followed by TRIM-21 being released from NCK-1 and ubiquitinating CED-1. In the absence of TRIM-21, part of CED-1 fails to be ubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation and accumulates in phagosomes to bind to VHA-10 and affect phagosomal acidification and maturation, thus resulting in cell corpse degradation defects. It is currently unknown how the excess CED-1 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants specifically binds to VHA-10.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76436-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Previous studies have suggested that CED-1 acts specifically in initiating engulfment and controls phagosome maturation during cell corpse clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Our previous work revealed that loss of function of the retromer results in lysosomal degradation of CED-1. Here, we found that TRIM-21 mediated proteasome degradation of CED-1 independently of lysosomal degradation of CED-1 through loss of function of the retromer complex. We also found enhanced co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on the phagosomal surface in both <italic>trim-21</italic> and <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>); however, the CED-1 levels on the phagosomal surface are reduced in snx-1 and unaltered in trim-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Given that V-type ATPases are trafficked to the phagosome and function to acidify its contents during the phagosome maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2008</xref>), one possible explanation for these results is that CED-1 failed to recycle from phagosomes and cytosol back to the plasma membrane in <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants, resulting in the enhanced co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on the phagosomal surface despite no increased interaction between CED-1 and VHA-10. Unlike in <italic>snx-1</italic> mutants, the enhanced co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on the phagosomal surface is at least partially due to increased interaction between CED-1 and VHA-10 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants. Another possible explanation is that the amount of excessive CED-1 degraded by TRIM-21 might be less than the amount of CED-1 recycled by retromer as <italic>trim-21; snx-1</italic> double mutants exhibited lower CED-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), which requires further investigation. Therefore, we propose that TRIM-21 functions downstream of CED-6 and NCK-1 to mediate CED-1 degradation, preventing excessive CED-1 from affecting phagosome acidification and maturation, whereas retromer-mediated effective recycling of CED-1 contributes to efficient engulfment of cell corpses. Our findings establish the function of TRIM-21 in AC clearance by mediating the degradation of the engulfment receptor CED-1, representing the first identification of CED1-TRIM-21 signaling in invertebrates. Moreover, this finding suggests that CED-1 family engulfment receptors may be similarly regulated in other organisms.</p><p>In mammals, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 mediates a wide range of processes, including innate and adaptive immunity, through its interactions with numerous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McEwan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). A critical molecular feature of TRIM21 is its binding to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) of antibodies for recognition of numerous pathogens via its PRYSPRY domain, which results in the ubiquitination and degradation of these pathogens through the proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">James et al., 2007</xref>). The TRIM-21 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks the PRYSPRY domain for pathogen antibody binding, which is in line with the complete reliance of <italic>C. elegans</italic> on its innate immune system for defense against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim and Ewbank, 2018</xref>). Given that the regulation of response to unfolded proteins by CED-1 is essential for innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haskins et al., 2008</xref>), further studies are necessary to determine the contribution of <italic>trim-21</italic> in innate immunity. Our work suggests that TRIM-21 is an ancient E3 ligase in which the coiled-coil domain recognizes its substrate CED-1. hTRIM21 was originally discovered as an ‘autoantigen’ (RO52 or SS-A) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Chetrit et al., 1988</xref>), and its increased expression was also found in Sjögren’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Chetrit et al., 1990</xref>). Interestingly, we found that hTRIM21 interacts with MEGF10-CT and CED-1-CT, and TRIM-21 too interacted with CED-1-CT and MEGF10-CT. MEGF10, the mammalian homolog of CED-1, has also been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the identification of TRIM-21 as a negative regulator of CED-1 will have important implications for understanding its role in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, in addition to the mechanistic insights into its role in AC clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and directly loaded onto a lab-made reversed-phase analytical column (15 cm length, 75 µm i.d.). The gradient comprised an increase from 7% to 25% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) over 18 min, 25% to 38% over 6 min, and climbing to 80% in 3 min, then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant flow rate of 450 nl/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system. The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in OrbitrapFusion (Thermo) coupled online to the UPLC. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.0 kV. The m/z scan range was 350–1550 for a full scan, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. Peptides were then selected for MS/MS using an NCE setting of 35, and the fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15,000 following a data-dependent procedure that alternated between one MS scan followed by 20 MS/MS scans with a 15.0 s dynamic exclusion. Automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 5E4. The resulting MS/MS data were processed using the Proteome Discoverer 1.3. Tandem mass spectra were searched against selected databases. Trypsin/P (or other enzymes, if any) was specified as a cleavage enzyme, allowing up to two missing cleavages. The mass error was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and 0.02 Da for fragment ions. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was specified as a fixed modification, and oxidation on Met and modification were specified as variable modifications. Peptide confidence was set at a high value, and the peptide ion score was set at &gt;20.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment and protein degradation in vivo</title><p>Mix-staged worms were grown on NGM plates, and then transferred to liquid culture containing 100 ml S-Basal Medium (5.9 g NaCl, 50 ml 1 M KPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.0, 1 ml 5 mg/ml cholesterol, ddH<sub>2</sub>O to 1 l), 300 µl 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 300 µl 1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 ml 100× trace metal solution (0.346 g FeSO<sub>4</sub>•7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.93 g Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 0.098 g MnCl<sub>2</sub>•4H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.012 g CuSO<sub>4</sub>•5H<sub>2</sub>O, ddH<sub>2</sub>O to 500 ml), and 1 ml 1 M potassium citrate (pH 6.0).

Half of the plates were subjected to heat shock, and the rest were maintained at control conditions. Worms were harvested from the plates and washed three times with M9 buffer three times. Worms were then mixed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail, homogenized completely with tissue grinders, and centrifuged at 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 20 min to remove debris.

The gel was fixed in a formaldehyde fixing solution (40% methanol and 0.0185% formaldehyde) for 30 min.

The gel was first incubated with 0.2 g/l Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> for 10 min, then incubated with 0.1% silver nitrate for 45 min. Then, the gel was soaked in thiosulfate developing solution (3% sodium carbonate, 0.0004% sodium thiosulfate, and 0.0185% formaldehyde). The process was terminated using 0.115 M citric acid.</p><p>Protein digestion (250 µg per sample) was performed according to the FASP procedure. Next, 100 µl 0.05 M iodoacetamide in UA buffer (8 M urea, 150 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0) was added to block reduced cysteine residues, and the samples were incubated for 20 min in the dark. The filter was washed with 100 µl UA buffer three times, and then twice with 100 µl 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Finally, the protein suspension was digested with 3 µg trypsin (Promega) in 40 µl 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> overnight at 37°C, and the resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate. The peptide of each sample was desalted on C18 Cartridges (Empore SPE Cartridges C18 [standard density], bed I.D. 7 mm, volume 3 ml, Sigma), then concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 40 µl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. MS experiments were performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer coupled to an EASY nLC (Proxeon Biosystems, now Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide (5 µg) was loaded onto a C18-reversed phase column (Thermo Scientific EASY Column, 10 cm long, 75 µm inner diameter, 3 μm resin) in buffer A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and separated with a linear gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 250 nl/min controlled by IntelliFlow technology over 60 min. MS data were acquired using a data-dependent top 10 method, dynamically choosing the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (300–1800 m/z) for HCD fragmentation. The determination of the target value was based on predictive automatic gain control (pAGC). The dynamic exclusion duration was 25 s. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200, and the resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17,500 at m/z 200. The normalized collision energy was 30 eV, and the underfill ratio, which specifies the minimum percentage of the target value likely to be reached at the maximum fill time, was defined as 0.1%. The instrument was run with peptide recognition mode enabled. MS experiments were performed in triplicate for each sample. The MS data were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.5.5.1. MS data were searched against the UniProt <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> database (27,767 entries). An initial search was performed using a precursor mass window of 6 ppm. The search followed an enzymatic cleavage rule of Trypsin/P and allowed a maximum of two missed cleavage sites and a mass tolerance of 20 ppm for fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was defined as a fixed modification, whereas methionine oxidation was defined as a variable modification for database searching. The cutoff of the global false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Quantitative data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor asks you to please respond to the reviewers comments with a revised manuscript that addresses the points raised by the reviewers. As you can see, the reviewers request some additional documentation and analysis. Reviewer #2 finds it to be particularly important show co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on phagosomes in wild type, trim-21, and retromer/snx mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Yuan and co-authors reported in this manuscript that the phagocytic receptor CED-1 undergoes proteasomal degradation mediated by TRIM-21 and UBC-21, which is important for proper degradation of cell corpses. The authors provided evidence that CED-1 is polyubiquitinated and undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation. The polyubiquitination of CED-1 requires TRIM-21 and UBC-21 functions, while CED-1 degradation also requires CED-6, SRC-1, and NCK-1 that mediate TRIM-21 binding to CED-1. The authors further identified VHA-10 as an interacting protein of CED-1 and concluded that excess CED-1 interferes with lysosome acidification by binding VHA-10. However, this conclusion is not supported by their data. The overall imaging quality needs to be improved and multiple assays lack quantification analyses.</p><p>1. It has been shown previously that CED-1 is recycled from phagosome membranes to plasma membranes via retromer complex, and failure in recycling leads to lysosomal degradation of CED-1 (Chen et al., Science 2010). Here, the authors proposed that CED-1 is degraded via proteasome after engulfment is initiated, presumably on forming phagosomes (Figure 8). What is the relationship of retromer-dependent recycling, lysosome-dependent and proteosome-dependent degradation of CED-1? If the non-recycled CED-1 can be degraded by lysosomes, how its persistence interferes with V-ATPase as proposed by the authors? This point should be clearly addressed to demonstrate the role of proteosome-dependent degradation of CED-1 in apoptotic cell clearance.</p><p>2. The authors concluded that &quot;excess CED-1 which accumulated in trim-21 mutants, bound to VHA-10 subunit, negatively affects the acidification of lysosomes and consequently blocked cell corpse degradation&quot;. However, their data cannot support this conclusion.</p><p>i) vha-10 RNAi causes very mild cell corpse clearance defects (Figure 7). Thus, it is not surprising that vha-10 RNAi did not affect cell corpse phenotype of trim-21 (which is even milder).</p><p>ii) Given the extremely weak phenotype in both trim-21 and vha-10 RNAi worms, the bypass or rescue experiments, which is indicated by differences of 2-3 cell corpses in average and has no other controls, are not convincing.</p><p>iii) To support the conclusion, the authors should show co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on phagosomes in wild type, trim-21, and retromer/snx mutants.</p><p>iv) There is no data to support CED-1-VHA-10 binding negatively affects acidification of lysosomes.</p><p>3. Both trim-21(xwh13) and ubc-21(xwh16) mutants show very mild cell corpse phenotypes (Figure 6A-C, Figure 6-supplement 1A-F, H-M), which questions the importance of their role in cell corpse clearance.</p><p>4. The phagosome maturation data, especially images in Figure 6D and E are unclear. It is very difficult to see cell corpse labeling by phagosomal reporters in either wild type or trim-21 mutants and therefore not possible to comment on the conclusions. Images that show clear cell corpse labeling by phagosomal markers should be provided.</p><p>The authors showed that treatment of CQ or MG132 led to increased protein levels of CED-1. Are these two effects additive, or affect each other? Is lysosomal degradation of CED-1 affected by trim-21? Is polyubiquitination of CED-1 by TRIM-21 involved in lysosomal degradation of CED-1, for example, promoting CED-1 sorting into ILVs followed by degradation in lysosomes? On the other hand, does loss of ESCRT, such as in vps-37 RNAi, which is shown to block lysosomal degradation of CED-1 (Chen et al., Science 2010), affect polyubiquitination of CED-1 or the CED-1 degradation via proteasomes? To demonstrate that CED-1 is indeed degraded by proteasomes in addition to lysosomal degradation during phagosome maturation, the authors should examine CED-1::GFP levels on plasma membranes, phagosomal and phagolysosomal membranes in trim-21, retromer or snx mutant and in the double mutants that lack both TRIM-21 and retromer/SNX.</p><p>Overexpression of CED-1 reduces cell corpses in snx-1 mutants that affect CED-1 recycling (Chen et al., Science 2010). Does overexpression of CED-1 enhance the cell corpse phenotype in trim-21 mutant if it disrupts CED-1 degradation by proteasome?</p><p>In Figure 6-supplement 1A, ubc-21 appears to have significantly more germ cell corpses than trim-21, especially at 48 h and 60 h post L4, which suggests that additional E3 may be involved or that UBC-21 has additional roles than acting with TRIM-21. The authors should clarify this.</p><p>In Figure 2E, multiple bands were observed in lane 2-4 when CED-1-CT, TRIM-21, or UBC-21 is absent, which is inconsistent with the statement that &quot;polyubiquitination of CED-1-CT was completely abolished by the removal of either UBC-21 or TRIM-21&quot;. In fact, similar bands, albeit with lower intensity, were also seen in the lane which did not contain CED-1-CT-FLAG. The authors should clarify these results.</p><p>Other points</p><p>1. Molecular weight should be indicted in western blot analyses.</p><p>2. The data quality in Figure 2F, G is insufficient, especially the anti-FLAG blot, and these data lack quantification analyses. The K48 and K63 issue should also be tested in vitro.</p><p>3. Quantification analysis should be provided for western blot assays that examine CED-1 levels in different genetic backgrounds or treatments (quantification analyses are missing in multiple figures).</p><p>4. To demonstrate that CED-6 mediates TRIM-21 recruitment to apoptotic cell surface, the authors should examine and quantify recruitment of TRIM-21 to apoptotic cells in ced-6 mutants and compare it with the wild type.</p><p>5. Does Y1019F affect NCK-1 binding to CED-1? It is difficult to understand if NCK-1 only binds phosphorylated CED-1 (supposedly at YXXL motif), while loss of NCK-1, but not Y1019F of CED-1 (failed to be phosphorylated), affects TRIM-21 binding.</p><p>How do N962A and Y1019F affect CED-1 polyubiquitination/degradation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Yuan et al., identify ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation as an important mechanism for maintaining proper levels of the phagocytic receptor, Ced-1. They use a combination of genetics and molecular analyses to reveal multiple components of this pathway including the relevant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and E3 ubiquitin ligase, domains on Ced-1 and the E3 ligase (Trim-21) that interact, and signaling components required for their interaction. They additionally find that Ced-1 physically interacts with the V-ATPase, and propose that a lack of Ced-1 protein turnover inhibits V-ATPase function, leading to a block in phagosome maturation and persistence of cell corpses. This is an ambitious paper with screens for E2 and E3 enzymes, kinases, SH2 domain proteins and Ced-1 interactors, and generation of multiple new alleles by CRISPR/Cas9. Overall it provides new insight into Ced-1 regulation that is critical for its proper function, although some of the data could be improved to fully support the conclusions.</p><p>This paper will be of broad interest to researchers working on phagocytosis. It provides new links between phagocytic receptors and phagosome maturation, and the authors demonstrate conservation of this pathway between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>– The data are extensive and quantification and statistical analysis of much of the data presented.</p><p>– There is strong evidence for many of the conclusions, such as Ced-1 being regulated by proteasomal degradation, Ced-1 and Ced-6 interacting physically with Trim-21, multiple ced mutants leading to increased levels of Ced-1, defects in phagosome maturation in Trim-21 mutants and Ced-1/V-ATPase interactions.</p><p>– The identification of new Ced-1 interactors, particularly Trim21 and Vha-10, is very important to the field.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>– Some of the data are not convincing as presented, and further analysis and controls should be provided. Specific examples:</p><p>– Some of the ubiquitin blots are over-exposed (e.g. Figure 3K) and the conclusions are not clearly supported. Providing molecular size markers or arrows would be helpful (e.g. Figure 1C).</p><p>– It does not appear that endogenous Ced-1 is increasing in the trim-21; smls110 lane of the CED-1 blot (Figure 1L). Levels also do not appear to change in the bcls39 strain so an explanation is necessary. (Molecular markers or arrows indicating endogenous Ced-1 would help visualize the changes).</p><p>– In Figure 3B, levels in Ced-6 alone should be provided for comparison. It is possible that the effects are additive.</p><p>– Figure 3F – the colocalization is not convincing at the subcellular level. Higher resolution microscopy should be performed and individual cell types should be indicated. It should be stated if these cells are performing phagocytosis.</p><p>– It should be clearly stated if alleles used are null alleles (Figure 4 G,H, 5A, J, 6C and others) as this is important for conclusions based on double mutant analysis.</p><p>– Some of the findings with Src-1 have been previously demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Ziegenfuss et al. 2008) and mammals (Scheib et al. 2012) and the authors should clearly state what is consistent with those findings and what is new or different.</p><p>Below are some specific suggestions in addition to those provided above.</p><p>– Starting the results off with the findings on STAT does not fit well with the focus of the paper. It could be mentioned later when the kinase screen is described.</p><p>– The effects in Figure 1A (MG132) are much stronger than 1B (uba-1, ubq-2) – some interpretation should be provided.</p><p>– Figure 1C – it should be explained why the two versions of Ced-1::Flag are different sizes.</p><p>– The bands in supplemental figure 3D are highly variable so it is difficult to assess the levels. Consider repeating and quantifying this experiment.</p><p>– Figure 3F- it would also be interesting to determine if the colocalization of Ced-1 and Trim21 fluorescence was dependent on Ced6.</p><p>– Some discussion of how else src-1 and nck-1 might function in parallel to the two ced pathways would be of interest.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>trim-21</italic> Promotes Proteasomal Degradation of CED-1 for Apoptotic Cell Clearance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Suzanne Pfeffer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues, raised by Reviewer 2, that need to be addressed. None of the suggested experiments are required but textual changes that address these points are requested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript has been improved substantially. The authors provided much more clear imaging and quantification analyses. They have addressed most of my concerns except for the following points that need to be further clarified.</p><p>The authors showed that:</p><p>1. &quot;Recruitment and release of CED-1::GFP to (and from?) cell corpses in trim-21(8.29 ± 0.48 min) was similar to that in the WT (8.31 ± 0.25 min), but not to that of snx-1(&gt;30 min) (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A). Moreover, &quot;The CED-1::GFP levels in the trim-21 mutants were comparable to those on N2 in plasma membranes, phagosomal membranes, and phagolysosomal membranes, whereas snx-1 mutants and trim-21;snx-1 double mutants exhibited lower CED-1::GFP levels (Figure 7—figure supplemental 1B-E)&quot;</p><p>These results and the interpretations need to be clarified or explained. Based on the provided data and the model presented in Figure 8, the ubiquitination of CED-1 by TRIM-21 occurs on forming phagosomes. If it fails, the transmembrane receptor CED-1 is presumably accumulated on the phagosomal surface. However, the authors showed that the release of CED-1 from cell corpse-containing phagosomes and the level of CED-1 on phagosomes and phagolysosomes were not altered in trim-21 mutants, which is probably due to the normal function of retromer-mediated recycling in trim-21 mutants. If this is the case, where does the excessive CED-1, which is a transmembrane receptor, localize in trim-21 mutants? The author showed that both CED-1-VHA-10 co-localization and interaction were increased in trim-21 mutants. Where does the enhanced interaction occur given that CED-1 levels on phagosomal and phagolysosomal membranes are unaltered? Moreover, as shown in Figure 7-supplement 2A and B, CED-1::GFP and VHA-10::mCherry co-localized on the phagosomal surface at a high level in both trim-21 and snx-1 mutants. What is the explanation for enhanced co-localization of them on the phagosomal surface where CED-1 levels are reduced in snx-1 and unaltered in trim-21?</p><p>2.

How did excessive CED-1 in trim-21 access to VHA-10 on lysosomes as indicated in the model (Figure 8)?

In the discussion part, the authors state that &quot;we proposed that TRIM-21-mediated degradation of CED-1 could be effective in promoting the early stages of phagosome maturation, whereas retromer-mediated recycling of CED-1 from the phagosome surface back to the plasma membrane could be effective in the late stages.&quot;</p><p>This statement is also confusing. What is the early stage of phagosome maturation promoted by CED-1 degradation as the authors observed a late effect on phagolysosomal formation in trim-21 mutants?

The authors provided evidence that CED-1 is polyubiquitinated and undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation. The polyubiquitination of CED-1 requires TRIM-21 and UBC-21 functions, while CED-1 degradation also requires CED-6, SRC-1, and NCK-1 that mediate TRIM-21 binding to CED-1. The authors further identified VHA-10 as an interacting protein of CED-1 and concluded that excess CED-1 interferes with lysosome acidification by binding VHA-10. However, this conclusion is not supported by their data. The overall imaging quality needs to be improved and multiple assays lack quantification analyses.</p><p>1. It has been shown previously that CED-1 is recycled from phagosome membranes to plasma membranes via retromer complex, and failure in recycling leads to lysosomal degradation of CED-1 (Chen et al., Science 2010). Here, the authors proposed that CED-1 is degraded via proteasome after engulfment is initiated, presumably on forming phagosomes (Figure 8). What is the relationship of retromer-dependent recycling, lysosome-dependent and proteosome-dependent degradation of CED-1? If the non-recycled CED-1 can be degraded by lysosomes, how its persistence interferes with V-ATPase as proposed by the authors? This point should be clearly addressed to demonstrate the role of proteosome-dependent degradation of CED-1 in apoptotic cell clearance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these very insightful suggestions. To investigate the relationship between retromer-dependent recycling and lysosome- and proteosome-dependent degradation of CED-1, we treated N2 with MG-132 and CQ, and found that the effects were additive (please see, page 7; line 139-146; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).

They additionally find that Ced-1 physically interacts with the V-ATPase, and propose that a lack of Ced-1 protein turnover inhibits V-ATPase function, leading to a block in phagosome maturation and persistence of cell corpses. This is an ambitious paper with screens for E2 and E3 enzymes, kinases, SH2 domain proteins and Ced-1 interactors, and generation of multiple new alleles by CRISPR/Cas9.

However, the authors showed that the release of CED-1 from cell corpse-containing phagosomes and the level of CED-1 on phagosomes and phagolysosomes were not altered in trim-21 mutants, which is probably due to the normal function of retromer-mediated recycling in trim-21 mutants. If this is the case, where does the excessive CED-1, which is a transmembrane receptor, localize in trim-21 mutants? The author showed that both CED-1-VHA-10 co-localization and interaction were increased in trim-21 mutants. Where does the enhanced interaction occur given that CED-1 levels on phagosomal and phagolysosomal membranes are unaltered? Moreover, as shown in Figure 7-supplement 2A and B, CED-1::GFP and VHA-10::mCherry co-localized on the phagosomal surface at a high level in both trim-21 and snx-1 mutants. What is the explanation for enhanced co-localization of them on the phagosomal surface where CED-1 levels are reduced in snx-1 and unaltered in trim-21?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these very insightful thoughts. A major concern is that the level of CED-1 on phagosomes and phagolysosomes were not altered in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants, whereas the co-localization and interaction of CED-1-VHA-10 were enhanced. A possible explanation for this might be that the level of excessive CED-1, which is localized on the individual phagosomal surface in each phagocyte and goes through the dynamic phagosome maturation process. As a result, a substantial difference of CED-1 localized to the phagosomes and phagolysosomes between <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants and WT worms cannot be captured by the fluorescent image quantification method. Although levels of CED-1 and interaction of CED-1-VHA-10 were increased in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants lysis than in WT controls by the western blotting detection method, this reflects the change of a large number of phagosomes from massive amounts of phagocytes. Another possible explanation is that the excessive CED-1 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants accumulated on the phagosomal surface affects multiple stages of phagosome maturation process, which slows down the whole maturation process rather than a specific step, undetectable at the stage that we captured. As the mechanism determining which portions of CED-1 are ubiquitinated by TRIM-21 is unknown, we cannot distinguish portion of CED-1 regulated by TRIM-21 from the portion of CED-1 regulated by other mechanisms in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants, making it difficult to follow where the excessive CED-1 is localized in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants (please see, page 34-35; line 740-766).</p><p>We also found enhanced co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on the phagosomal surface in both trim-21 and snx-1 mutants (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C); however, the CED-1 levels on the phagosomal surface are reduced in snx-1 and unaltered in trim-21 (Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–E). Given that V-type ATPases are trafficked to the phagosome and function to acidify its contents during the phagosome maturation process (Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2008), one possible explanation for these results is that CED-1 failed to recycle from phagosomes and cytosol back to the plasma membrane in snx-1 mutants, resulting in the enhanced co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on the phagosomal surface despite no increased interaction between CED-1 and VHA-10. Unlike in snx-1 mutants, the enhanced co-localization of CED-1 and VHA-10 on the phagosomal surface is at least partially due to increased interaction between CED-1 and VHA-10 in trim-21 mutants. Another possible explanation is that the amount of excessive CED-1 degraded by TRIM-21 might be less than the amount of CED-1 recycled by retromer, as trim-21; snx-1 double mutants exhibited lower CED-1 levels (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–E), which requires further investigation (please see, page 39-40; line 847-867; Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors state that &quot;Thus, excess CED-1, which accumulated in trim-21 mutants, bound to the VHA-10 subunit of V-ATPase, negatively affected the acidification of lysosomes, and consequently blocked cell corpse degradation.&quot;</p><p>By AO staining, the authors showed that phagosomal acidification is affected in trim-21 mutants and vha-10 RNAi worms, but they did not examine the acidification of lysosomes in either case. How is the conclusion of &quot;negatively affected the acidification of lysosomes&quot; supported? How did excessive CED-1 in trim-21 access to VHA-10 on lysosomes as indicated in the model (Figure 8)? This is also in contrast to the subcellular localization of the two proteins shown in Figure 7-supplement 2A, which is clearly not on the lysosome.</p><p>These points should be clarified. If the authors claim that &quot;excess CED-1, which accumulated in trim-21 mutants, bound to the VHA-10 subunit of V-ATPase, negatively affected the acidification of lysosomes, and consequently blocked cell corpse degradation.&quot; They should provide direct evidence that lysosomal acidification is affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very helpful suggestion. A crucial step in phagosome maturation is the gradual acidification of the phagosomal lumen because an acidic environment promotes the activity of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade phagosomal contents. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, cell corpse–containing phagosome acidification begins fairly early, with Rab5 positive early phagosomes staining weakly with acridine orange (AO), indicating that there are multiple modes of acidification depending on the stage of maturation (Kinchen et al., 2008). Later study revealed that RAB-2 and RAB-14 act partially redundantly to promote phagosome acidification and recruit lysosomes for phagolysosome formation for cell corpse degradation, whereas RAB-7 mediates fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes but is largely dispensable for the acidification of phagosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, indicating that acidification of cell corpse–containing phagosomes does not appear to be dependent on efficient phagosome–lysosome fusion (Guo, Hu, Zhang, Jiang, and Wang, 2010; Lu and Zhou, 2012; Wang and Yang, 2016; Yu, Lu, and Zhou, 2008). However, the mechanism by which V-type ATPases regulate acidification of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells or apoptotic cell degradation has not been thoroughly investigated. We discovered that excessive CED-1 binding to the V-ATPase in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutant worms reduces acidification of cell corpse–containing phagosomes. However, future research is needed to determine the precise stage at which phagosome acidification is affected, as well as how excessive CED-1 binding to VHA-10 in <italic>trim-21</italic> mutants affects cell corpse degradation. We completely agree with the reviewer that we did not provide direct evidence that lysosomal acidification is affected. We revised this sentence in accordance with the reviewer's suggestion (please see, page 35-36; line 767-792; Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the discussion part, the authors state that &quot;we proposed that TRIM-21-mediated degradation of CED-1 could be effective in promoting the early stages of phagosome maturation, whereas retromer-mediated recycling of CED-1 from the phagosome surface back to the plasma membrane could be effective in the late stages.&quot;</p><p>This statement is also confusing. What is the early stage of phagosome maturation promoted by CED-1 degradation as the authors observed a late effect on phagolysosomal formation in trim-21 mutants? What are the late stages that are promoted by retromer-mediated recycling as effective recycling of the CED-1 receptor contributes to efficient engulfment of cell corpses upstream of phagosome maturation?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We rewrote the statement. We propose that TRIM-21 functions downstream of CED-6 and NCK-1 to mediate CED-1 degradation, preventing excessive CED-1 from affecting phagosome acidification and maturation, whereas retromer-mediated effective recycling of CED-1 contributes to efficient engulfment of cell corpses (please see, page 40; line 867-872).</p><p>References</p><p>Guo, P., Hu, T., Zhang, J., Jiang, S., and Wang, X.
