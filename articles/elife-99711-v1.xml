co-released from the same synaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, we show that the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit differences between glutamate and GABA release properties in paired-pulse ratio, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-vesicle coupling configuration. Moreover, uniquantal synaptic responses show independent glutamatergic and GABAergic responses. Morphological analysis reveals that most SuM terminals form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in proximity, each characterized by GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 labeling, respectively. Notably, glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticities, with frequency-dependent depression of glutamate and frequency-independent stable depression of GABA. Our findings suggest that glutamate and GABA are co-released from different synaptic vesicles within the SuM terminals, and reveal that distinct transmission modes of glutamate/GABA co-release serve as frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>co-release</kwd><kwd>supramammillary nucleus</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>short-term

While this co-release is thought to contribute to several brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nusbaum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trudeau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Sabatini, 2022</xref>), little is known about the functional implications of the co-release of two or more neurotransmitters into neural circuits and the molecular mechanisms of how multiple neurotransmitters are co-transmitted. Here, we define co-release as the release of multiple neurotransmitters from a single neuron, regardless of whether the neurotransmitters are packaged in the same or different synaptic vesicles, and co-transmission as synaptic transmission occurring by multiple neurotransmitters and detected by distinct postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wallace and Sabatini, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The cellular and molecular mechanisms of co-release are diverse across brain areas. In particular, the transmission modes of co-release, whether two neurotransmitters are released from the same vesicles or separate vesicles, and whether they are released from the same release sites or spatially segregated release sites, depend on the cell type in a given circuit. Co-packaging of GABA/glycine or glutamate/acetylcholine is found in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonas et al., 1998</xref>) and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nabekura et al., 2004</xref>), and in the axon terminals of the medial habenula in the interpeduncular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frahm et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. In contrast, the co-release of GABA and acetylcholine from different synaptic vesicles has been reported in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>), and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takács et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the spatially segregated co-release of glutamate/glycine or glutamate/dopamine has been reported in a subset of retinal amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in the axon terminals from a subset of midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fortin et al., 2019</xref>), respectively. Importantly, dual-transmitter co-release from distinct vesicle populations or release sites can result in different release properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takács et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zych and Ford, 2022</xref>) and induce diverse effects to spatially different postsynaptic target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Granger et al., 2020</xref>). These divergent transmission properties of co-release can regulate the circuit functions underlying distinct physiological and behavioral roles.</p><p>The co-release of glutamate and GABA, both fast-acting and functionally opposing neurotransmitters, has recently been identified in several brain regions of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trudeau and El Mestikawy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Sabatini, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wallace and Sabatini, 2023</xref>). In particular, the lateral habenula and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus have been extensively studied for the co-release of glutamate and GABA. The lateral habenula neurons receive glutamate/GABA co-releasing synaptic inputs from the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>). Hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) neurons projecting to the DG also co-release glutamate and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajibola et al., 2021</xref>). To understand how synaptic inputs mediated by the co-release of the excitatory action of glutamate and the inhibitory action of GABA are integrated and impact postsynaptic cells, it is necessary to elucidate how glutamate and GABA are co-released from the synaptic terminals. Mechanistically, if glutamate and GABA are co-released from distinct vesicle populations, each release could be differently regulated by distinct release mechanisms. Such distinct co-release modes of glutamate and GABA are expected to implement different presynaptic plasticity, which will have diverse effects on postsynaptic neurons in response to different activity patterns. By contrast, if two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same synaptic vesicles, both glutamate and GABA release are expected to be under the same regulation.</p><p>Whether glutamate and GABA are packaged in the same or separate vesicles remains controversial. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated the co-packaging of glutamate and GABA in the same synaptic vesicles at EP-lateral habenular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, an immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) study demonstrated that glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicle populations are segregated in the axon terminals of the EP and VTA projections in the lateral habenula, and that single terminals form both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>). The same study also reported that glutamate and GABA are segregated into distinct vesicle populations within the axon terminals of the SuM projections in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mode of co-release of glutamate and GABA from the SuM terminals has never been functionally addressed.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission at SuM-dentate granule cell (GC) synapses. We demonstrate that glutamate/GABA co-transmission shows independent synaptic responses and differential short-term plasticity and that their postsynaptic targets are segregated. Our results suggest that the segregation of two different populations of transmitters makes it possible to exert short-term dynamic changes in the co-transmission balance of glutamate and GABA and modulate GC activity in a frequency-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glutamate/GABA co-transmission shows different release probabilities and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivities</title><p>To optogenetically stimulate SuM inputs in the DG, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in SuM neurons by injecting a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding ChR2-eYFP (AAV-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP) into the lateral SuM of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tabuchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajibola et al., 2021</xref>), the vast majority of ChR2-eYFP-expressing SuM boutons in the DG co-expressed VGluT2 and vesicular GABA transporter (vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter, VIAAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GCs in acute hippocampal slices and recorded optically evoked excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs or IPSCs) at SuM-GC synapses in the presence of picrotoxin or NBQX/D-AP5, respectively. To examine whether the co-release of glutamate and GABA exhibits the same or different release properties, we first monitored the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), an index of the change in presynaptic transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>), of glutamate/GABA co-transmission by paired stimulation (inter-stimulus interval: 100 ms). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tabuchi et al., 2022</xref>), both EPSCs and IPSCs at SuM-GC synapses exhibited paired-pulse depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, we found that PPR was significantly different between EPSCs and IPSCs; EPSCs were more depressed than IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; EPSC: 0.46 ± 0.03, n=8; IPSC: 0.6 ± 0.03, n=8, p&lt;0.01, unpaired t test). It is possible that direct illumination of presynaptic terminals could increase transmitter release due to the broadening of the presynaptic waveform or direct influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rost et al., 2022</xref>). To avoid this possibility, we stimulated SuM axons instead of SuM terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and obtained similar results to terminal illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). ChR2 desensitization could depress the second synaptic responses evoked by the paired-pulse stimulation due to the participation of fewer SuM fibers in mediating synaptic transmission. To test this possibility, the fiber volley evoked by light illumination was extracellularly recorded from supragranular layer. We found that the amplitudes of the second fiber volley was comparable to that of the first fiber volley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that ChR2-expressing SuM fibers were activated to the same extent by paired-pulse light illumination.

We therefore examined how glutamate/GABA co-transmission is regulated by presynaptic GPCRs. We previously demonstrated that the co-transmission of glutamate and GABA at SuM-GC synapses is presynaptically suppressed by group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement with this, application of the group II mGluR agonist DCG-IV suppressed both EPSCs and IPSCs at SuM-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, DCG-IV inhibited EPSCs (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.11 μM) to a greater extent than it did IPSCs (IC<sub>50</sub>=0.27 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; two-way ANOVA, F<sub>1,51</sub> = 8.1, p&lt;0.01).

These differential inhibitory effects of GPCRs on glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission are contrary to the expected idea of identical vesicle pools for glutamate and GABA but favor the hypothesis of separate vesicles for glutamate and GABA.</p><p>Spatial coupling between presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors of exocytosis is an essential feature in determining the properties of neurotransmitter release, and tight or loose coupling is distinguished by using two different binding rate Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators BAPTA and EGTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>).

For this purpose, we next performed minimal light stimulation to detect stochastic synaptic responses of independent EPSCs and IPSCs, or compound EPSC/IPSC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). In this experiment, optical stimulation (over-bouton illumination) was delivered in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to exclude SuM inputs-mediated polysynaptic responses, together with D-AP5 to block NMDA receptors. We also decreased the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 1 mM to reduce the release probability. At intermediate holding membrane potentials (–20 to –30 mV), maximum light power illumination elicited biphasic responses (EPSC-IPSC sequence), enabling simultaneous recordings of glutamate/GABA co-transmission in GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left). After confirming the existence of biphasic PSCs, the light power intensity was decreased to detect small synaptic events, that were stochastically observed among the 100 times stimulations (success rate=~15%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this method, we analyzed 1700 trials from 17 cells and detected 86 EPSC-only, 67 IPSC-only, and 19 biphasic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). These results indicate that independent EPSCs and IPSCs are the majority of synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; EPSC: 5.1 ± 0.5% probability; IPSC: 3.9 ± 0.4% probability; biphasic: 1.1 ± 0.3% probability, n=17, EPSC vs biphasic, p&lt;0.001; IPSC vs biphasic, p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test). To exclude the possibility that the independent EPSCs and IPSCs detected by minimal light stimulation might have masked the putative tiny synaptic responses of their counterpart currents mediated by the associated transmitters, the amplitudes and kinetics of minimal stimulation-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were compared with or without blockers of their counterpart receptors. We found that the amplitudes and decay of minimal light stimulation-evoked EPSCs were not changed by the application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker picrotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The formation of asymmetric and symmetric synapses by a single SuM terminal was further confirmed by pre-embedding immunogold EM for eYFP, which was expressed in the SuM neurons by injection of AAV-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP into the SuM of VGluT2-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). It has been reported that VTA neurons also project to the GC layer of the DG and co-release glutamate and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ntamati and Lüscher, 2016</xref>). However, our retrograde tracing with fluorescent microspheres injected into the dorsal DG did not reveal any retrogradely labeled neurons in the VTA, while labeled neurons were successfully observed in the SuM and entorhinal cortex (EC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that most of the VGluT2-positive terminals (co-expressed with VIAAT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) in the GC layer most likely originated from the SuM. To examine the spatial association of SuM terminals with glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic sites, we performed triple immunofluorescence for VGluT2, the NMDA receptor subunit GluN1, and GABAergic postsynaptic sites by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit GABA<sub>A</sub>α1. In the GC layer, almost all VGluT2-positive terminals were associated with GluN1 and/or GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Specifically, the majority of VGluT2-positive terminals were associated with both GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (52.5%), and the remainder were associated with GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (22.1%) alone or GluN1 (25.4%) alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). To investigate the spatial relationship between glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, we quantified the distance between GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 cluster adjacent to the same VGluT2-positive terminal. On average, the distance was 397.5 ± 8.75 nm, and most VGluT2-positive terminals (79.2%, 191 out of 241) form glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses within 500 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

Due to the different release properties of glutamate and GABA in the SuM terminals, glutamate/GABA co-transmission could exhibit different patterns of short-term plasticity at SuM-GC synapses. To test this possibility, we delivered a train of 10 light stimuli at 5–20 Hz, physiologically relevant frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirk and McNaughton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>), to ChR2-expressing SuM inputs, and compared the short-term depression of EPSCs with that of IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To exclude the putative involvement of pre- and/or postsynaptic modulations by mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors during a train of stimulation, pharmacologically isolated EPSCs or IPSCs were recorded in the presence of the broad-spectrum mGluR antagonist LY341495 (100 μM) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP55845 (3 μM). We found that trains of 10 light stimuli at 5, 10, and 20 Hz elicited pronounced short-term synaptic depression of EPSCs during train with stronger depression at higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). We further performed the same experiments under recording conditions with a low release probability by reducing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2.5 to 1 mM. While train stimulation elicited a weaker depression than 2.5 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, frequency-dependent depression was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In marked contrast to EPSCs, while IPSCs also exhibited short-term synaptic depression across all tested frequencies, GABAergic co-transmission showed a similar magnitude of depression across all frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Similarly, short-term depression of IPSCs did not show a frequency-dependent depression with 1 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), leading to a sustained inhibitory effect at any frequency. Given that EPSCs show strong frequency-dependent depression, whereas IPSCs exhibit frequency-independent sustained depression, it is likely that the EPSC/IPSC ratio can decrease during high-frequency train stimulation. Indeed, comparing the amplitudes of the 10th EPSCs with those of the 10th IPSCs indicated that the depression of EPSCs was stronger than that of IPSCs at 10 Hz and 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We further addressed whether short-term dynamic changes in the EPSC/IPSC ratio could be observed in the same cell by recording the biphasic synaptic responses at intermediate membrane potentials that enabled simultaneous monitoring of the compound EPSC/IPSC. We found that 10 Hz train light illumination induced a stronger depression of EPSCs than of IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby decreasing the EPSC/IPSC ratio during the high-frequency train stimulation.

Our previous study investigated the single association of synaptic inputs, but did not examine repetitive stimulation of synaptic inputs. We investigated how the repetitive activation of SuM inputs, which implement frequency-dependent filtering of glutamatergic responses with sustained synaptic inhibition by GABAergic co-transmission, affects GC excitability. To mimic excitatory EC synaptic inputs onto GCs, a sinusoidal current was injected into the soma of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajibola et al., 2021</xref>), which can bypass direct synaptic stimulation of the perforant path (main excitatory inputs originating from EC) and, consequently, circumvent the recruitment of inhibitory circuitry. We found that a sinusoidal current at 5 Hz generated action potentials at the peak of the depolarizing phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The injected current was adjusted to generate action potentials with fewer than five spikes in each trial (10 cycles), and the optogenetically activated SuM inputs were paired at the depolarizing phase of each cycle. Paired light illumination significantly enhanced GC firing compared to sinusoidal current injections without light stimulation throughout the trial (10 stimuli; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). Notably, the probability of spikes further increased when GABAergic transmission was blocked by picrotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). These results suggest that SuM inputs enhance GC firing and that GABAergic co-transmission negatively regulates the net excitatory effect of SuM inputs at 5 Hz, similar to the effects of a single associational activation of SuM and EC inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>). In striking contrast, at higher frequencies (10 Hz and 20 Hz), the enhancement of spike probability by SuM activation was attenuated and disappeared in the last few stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C, E and F</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of picrotoxin, SuM activation by light stimulation enhanced GC firing, even in the last few stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C, E and F</xref>), suggesting that SuM glutamatergic co-transmission still exerted excitatory effects in the later cycle, even during the short-term depression of glutamate release. Thus, the excitatory action of SuM inputs was filtered by the co-released GABA during repetitive high-frequency stimulation due to frequency-independent sustained depression. These results indicate that SuM inputs modulate GC output in a frequency-dependent manner due to the different short-term plasticities of glutamate/GABA co-transmission.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Frequency-dependent modulation of GC firing by SuM inputs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) (left) Representative traces showing GC spikes in response to sinusoidal current injections without (top) and with (middle) paired light stimulation of SuM inputs at 5 Hz (<bold>A</bold>), 10 Hz (<bold>B</bold>), and 20 Hz (<bold>C</bold>).

Based on their molecular composition, glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are established independently, achieving the distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99711-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Different release properties of dual-neurotransmitter neurons have been reported in other synaptic circuits.

Different reliance on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for distinct neurotransmitters have been reported in the retina (acetylcholine and GABA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), striatum (dopamine and glutamate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>), and hippocampus (acetylcholine and GABA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takács et al., 2018</xref>). These differential release properties of the two neurotransmitters indicate a separate release from distinct vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takács et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>). Our study also demonstrated that glutamate and GABA co-release from SuM terminals shows differences in PPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity. Glutamatergic transmission exhibited a stronger depression than GABAergic transmission, suggesting that release probability of glutamate is higher than that of GABA. A higher reduction in IPSCs than EPSCs by decreasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2.5 to 1 mM indicates that GABA release requires higher extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> than glutamate release. Furthermore, using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators BAPTA and EGTA, we found that the spatial coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles of GABA is tighter than that of glutamate. These differences in release properties can be attributed to the different compositions of the release machinery and different spatial organizations between the release machinery and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for glutamate and GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Given that GABAergic co-transmission exhibits a lower release probability and a higher requirement for extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, together with tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicles, synaptic vesicles for GABA release could be surrounded by a few Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in close proximity. In contrast, the synaptic vesicles for glutamate release could be surrounded by a large number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at longer distances than those for GABA release. As with other possible mechanisms, the different expression of transporters in the vesicles with their interacting proteins may contribute to different release probabilities. Given that VGluT1 and endophilin interaction exhibits different release probabilities compared to VGluT2-expressing synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weston et al., 2011</xref>), it is postulated that different interactions of VGluT2 and VIAAT with their different binding proteins could determine distinct release probabilities.</p><p>How are VGluT2 and VIAAT sorted into the distinct synaptic vesicles, and how are glutamate vesicles and GABA vesicles sorted to different places within the same SuM terminal? With synaptic vesicles containing 410 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>), even slight differences in molecular composition or incorporation of specific molecules on the vesicles could influence their functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamberland and Tóth, 2016</xref>). These differences may determine the selective sorting of neurotransmitter transporters into vesicles and the precise arrangement of glutamate and GABA vesicles at the distinct active zones within the same terminal. Especially, VGluT2 and VIAAT contain sorting motifs in their C-terminus, which interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins (APs). Several studies demonstrated that the interaction between neurotransmitter transporters and APs is important for endocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakatsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>). Distinct APs-dependent recycling pathway may contribute to formation of precise spatial localization of glutamate and GABA vesicles in the same SuM terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asmerian et al., 2024</xref>). Our immuno-EM analysis showed that VGluT2 and VIAAT appear to be randomly distributed in the terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). However, it is important to acknowledge that due to low labeling efficiency, our immuno-EM images may not capture the full spectrum of synaptic vesicles for glutamate and GABA. It is known that synaptic vesicles are divided into three categories: the readily releasable pool (RRP), recycling pool, and resting pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miki et al., 2022</xref>). Among them, the vast majority of synaptic vesicles (~85% of the total vesicles) belongs to the resting pool. Therefore, it is likely that most of the VGluT2 and VIAAT labeling corresponds to the synaptic vesicles in the resting pool. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether VGluT2-containing vesicles and VIAAT-containing vesicles in the RRP and recycling pools, both of which are closely linked to exocytosis, are clearly segregated near their respective active zones.</p><p>Our data showed that both glutamate and GABA release rely on P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at SuM-GC synapses. Interestingly, the excitatory transmission of SuM-CA2 pyramidal neuron synapses, an exclusive glutamatergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), is also mediated by P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robert et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, neurotransmitter release from SuM neurons depends on P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, irrespective of the target neurons. We found that the activation of group II mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors inhibited glutamatergic co-transmission more strongly than GABAergic co-transmission. Given that these GPCRs suppress presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels via G<sub>i/o</sub>-protein, and that both transmitter releases are mediated by the same type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, the different extents of inhibition of the co-release of glutamate/GABA by group II mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors may be attributed to differential expression levels of receptors or signaling efficacy between glutamate and GABA release. Additionally, the spatial coupling between GPCRs and active zones for glutamate and GABA in the same SuM terminals may be different, which may give rise to differential modulation of glutamate and GABA release.</p><p>Consistent with previous EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>), we found that a single SuM terminal forms symmetric and asymmetric synapses in the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). However, confirming whether these synapses function as glutamatergic or GABAergic relies on the identification of their postsynaptic receptors, which remains unresolved. In our study, we demonstrated that both GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 were associated with common SuM terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>), suggesting that these synapses represent distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Furthermore, our analysis showed that approximately 50% of SuM terminals was associated with both GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). It should be noted, however, this percentage can be an underestimate due to the utilization of 100-nm-thick ultrathin sections, which limits the detection of co-localization events within this confined spatial range. Consequently, the actual percentage is expected to be significantly higher. Hence, the predominant synapse type of SuM terminals consists of dual glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, with additional individual glutamatergic or GABAergic synapses.</p><p>Previous electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that both glutamate and GABA are co-packaged in the same synaptic vesicles in the lateral habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Minimal optogenetic stimulation of EP terminals evoked a high proportion of biphasic PSCs over independent EPSCs and IPSCs in lateral habenular neurons, suggesting the co-release of glutamate and GABA from the same synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). While these findings appear to contradict anatomical data showing distinct populations of glutamate- and GABA-containing synaptic vesicles in the lateral habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>), technical limitations of immuno-EM may affect the ability to accurately assess the spatial distributions of proteins within the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Sabatini, 2022</xref>). Such limitations include antibody interference on small vesicles, restricted access to target molecules, and the stochastic nature of labeling two molecules in a single vesicle. In addition, the existence of VTA terminals, other glutamate/GABA co-release inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Root et al., 2018</xref>), may complicate the interpretation of the co-release mechanisms in the lateral habenula. In contrast, in the DG, we found that the majority of synaptic responses evoked by both minimal light stimulation and asynchronous release at SuM-GC synapses showed independent EPSCs and IPSCs. A previous biochemical study detected VGluT2 and VIAAT in distinct purified synaptic vesicles from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, differences in transport mechanisms between glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicles have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farsi et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this evidence, our results most likely support the hypothesis that glutamate and GABA are packaged in distinct synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, glutamate/GABA co-transmission is diverse, in that both transmitters are co-released from the same or different synaptic vesicles, depending on brain regions and synapse types. It is important to note that transmitter release is detected by postsynaptic receptors; therefore, even if two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same vesicles, they will not be detected unless the postsynaptic targets express receptors for both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dugué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Granger et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, while our results strongly suggest that glutamate/GABA co-transmission occurs independently at segregated excitatory and inhibitory SuM-GC synapses, it remains possible that glutamate and GABA are co-released from the same vesicles, with one transmitter undetected due to the absence of its postsynaptic receptor. Further study will be necessary to determine the packaging mechanisms of glutamate and GABA within SuM terminals.</p><p>The distinct co-transmission modes of the two transmitters have the ability to exert independent synaptic regulation compared with their co-release from identical vesicles. At SuM-GC synapses, we demonstrated that glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission exhibited different short-term plasticities. While glutamatergic co-transmission showed strong frequency-dependent depression, GABAergic co-transmission exhibited stable frequency-independent depression. By this frequency-specific dynamic change of the glutamate/GABA co-transmission balance, at low-frequency burst SuM inputs, they operated as excitatory inputs, whereas at high frequency, the excitatory effects of SuM inputs on GCs were inhibited by co-transmitted GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Accordingly, GCs respond differently to SuM inputs in a frequency-dependent manner, due to the low-pass filtering of SuM-GC synapses. The fact that the theta-rhythm in the hippocampus is associated with synchronized SuM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirk and McNaughton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>) has important implications for the low-pass filtering of this synapse. As SuM inputs act as excitatory at 5 Hz (theta) train stimulation, but not at higher frequencies, SuM inputs may transfer their train information exclusively at the theta frequency, which could contribute to theta-mediated information processing in SuM-hippocampal circuits and their relevant brain functions, including cognitive, sleep, and navigation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kesner et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to SuM inputs, GCs receive EC inputs as the main excitatory inputs for discharge, and other excitatory inputs from hilar mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hashimotodani et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, low-pass filtering of SuM inputs could prevent the over-excitation of GCs, leading to anti-seizure effects. In contrast to the presynaptic origin of short-term plasticity at SuM-GC synapses, we previously demonstrated the postsynaptically induced long-term potentiation at SuM-GC synapses, which selectively occurs of glutamatergic co-transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tabuchi et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings suggest that SuM inputs play diverse roles in modulating GC output via short- and long-term plasticity with pre- and postsynaptic distinct mechanisms, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 and VGluT2-Cre mice (Jackson Labs, Slc17a6<sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup>/J, stock #016963) of either sex aged 6–7 weeks were used for electrophysiological experiments and male C57BL/6 mice at 2–3 months of age were used for anatomical experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The data were filtered at 2.9 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. For voltage-clamp recordings, we used patch pipettes (3–6 MΩ) filled with an intracellular solution with the following composition (in mM): 131 Cs-gluconate, 4 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH (the calculated E<sub>Cl-</sub> = −90 mV; 292–300 mOsm).

For recordings of synaptic currents at intermediate membrane potentials, 5 mM QX314 was included in the intracellular solution. ChR2-expresing SuM fibers were activated at 0.05 Hz by a pulse of 470 nm blue light (1–5ms duration, 5.0–10.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) delivered through a 40× objective attached to a microscope using an LED (Mightex or ThorLabs).

IPSC-only responses were determined as the synaptic current with the onset of an upward deflection within 6 ms of light illumination, without an inward current immediately after light illumination. Biphasic responses were defined as an EPSC-IPSC sequence, only if an outward peak current following an inward current appeared within 20 ms of light illumination.

The reduction in PSCs by a decrease in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was determined by comparing 10 min baseline responses (2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) with responses 20–25 min after replacement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM). The inhibition of PSCs by DCG-IV, baclofen, ω-CgTx, ω-Aga-IVA, BAPTA-AM, and EGTA-AM was determined by comparing the 10 min baseline responses with responses at 15–20 min (or 25–30 min for BAPTA-AM, and EGTA-AM) after each drug application. The PSCs probability was calculated as the percentage of the number of synaptic responses among 100 sweeps. Train stimulation-induced depression was calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the second to 10th PSCs to the amplitude of the first PSCs. Each stimulus point had an averaged of 10–20 sweeps. Spike probability was calculated as the percentage of the number of spikes among 10 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro software (OriginLab, USA). Normality of the distributions was assessed using the Shapiro−Wilk test. For samples with normal distributions, Student’s unpaired and paired two-tailed t tests were used to assess the between-group and within-group differences, respectively. For samples that were not normally distributed, a non-parametric paired sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. The Kolmogorov−Smirnov test was used for cumulative distributions. Differences among two or multiple samples were assessed by using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05 (***, **, and * indicates p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively).

At present, several studies reported that a variety of combinations of two transmitters are co-released from different synaptic vesicles in the central nervous system. In this regard, we think the cotransmission of glutamate/GABA from different synaptic vesicles is not surprising. To better explain to the reader how much we know about co-release of dual transmitters in the brain, we have now added new sentences describing segregated co-release of two neurotransmitters in other synapses in the Introduction (line 63-80).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Accepting the conclusion, one is now left with another conundrum, not addressed even in the discussion: how can a single bouton sort out VGLUTs and VIAATs to different vesicles, position them in distinct locations with nm precision, and recycle them without mixing? And why do it this way instead of with single vesicles having mixed chemical content? For example, could a quantitative argument be made that separate vesicles allow for higher transmitter concentrations? I feel the paper needs to address these problems with some coherent discussion, at minimum.</p></disp-quote><p>Although these questions are very important and interesting to address, little is known about molecular mechanisms how VGluT2 and VIAAT are sorted to different vesicles and each synaptic vesicle is segregated. That is why we had not mentioned the sorting mechanisms in the original manuscript. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added new sentences describing possible mechanisms for the sorting and segregation of VGluT2 and VIAAT in the Discussion (line 439-462).</p><p>As for the question regarding why glutamate and GABA are released from different synaptic vesicles, we mentioned the functional roles of separate release of two transmitters over release from single vesicles several times in the Introduction (line 94100), Results (line 300-302), and Discussion (line 406-408, 521-522). Although it seems to be an interesting point to think about transmitter concentrations in the vesicles, we think this issue is beyond the scope of the present study. Given that manipulation of vesicular transmitter contents is technically possible (Hori and Takamori, 2021), this issue awaits further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) Throughout the paper, the authors use repetitive optogenetic stimulation to activate SuM fibers and co-release glutamate and GABA. There are several issues here: first, can the authors definitively assure the reader that all the short-term plasticity is presynaptic and not due to ChR2 desensitization? This has not been addressed. Second, can the authors also say that all the activated fibers release both transmitters? If for example 20% of the fibers retained a onetransmitter identity and had distinct physiological properties, could that account for some of the physiological findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. To examine whether repetitive light illumination induces ChR2 desensitization, the fiber volley was extracellularly recorded. We found that paired-pulse or 10 stimuli at 5, 10, and 20 Hz reliably evoked similar amplitudes of fiber volley during light stimulation. These results clearly indicate that repetitive light stimulation can reliably activate ChR2 and elicit action potentials in the SuM axons. These new findings are now included in Figure 1-figure supplement 2 and Figure 5-figure supplement 2. We also previously demonstrated that by direct patch-clamp recordings from ChR2-expressing hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, 125 times light stimulation at 25 Hz reliably elicited action potentials (Fig. S1: Fukaya et al., 2023). Therefore, we believe that if expression level of ChR2 is high, activation of ChR2 induces action potentials in response to repetitive light stimulation and mediates synaptic transmission with high efficiency.</p><p>We found that most of the SuM terminals (95%) have both VGluT2 and VIAAT (Figure 1E). This anatomical evidence strongly indicates that most of the SuM terminals have the ability to release both glutamate and GABA, and the SuM fibers having one transmitter identity should be minor populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) PPR differences in Figures 1F-I are statistically significant but still quite small. You could say they are more similar than different in fact, and residual differences are accounted for by secondary factors like differential receptor saturation.</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment, the light intensity was adjusted to yield less than 80% of the maximum response as described in the method section of original and revised manuscript, minimizing the possibility of receptor saturation. We also excluded the possibility that PPR differences could be attributed to differential receptor saturation and desensitization by using a low-affinity AMPA receptor antagonist and a low-affinity GABAA receptor antagonist (Figure 5-figure supplement 3). These results indicate that PPR differences are mediated by the presynaptic origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The logic of the GPCR experiments needs a better setup. I could imagine different fibers released different transmitters and had different numbers of mGluRs, so that one would get different modulations. On the assumption that all the release is from a single population of boutons, then either the mGluRs are differentially segregated within the bouton, or the vesicles have differential responsiveness to the same modulatory signal (presumably a reduced Ca current). This is not developed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our minimal stimulation results and anatomical analysis, we believe that many SuM terminals contain both glutamate and GABA. Therefore, both transmissions are able to be modulated by mGluRs and GABAB receptors within the same terminals. As the reviewer pointed out, differential responsiveness of glutamate-containing and GABA-containing vesicles to the GPCR signal could be one of the molecular mechanisms for differential effects of GPCRs on EPSCs and IPSCs. In addition, the spatial coupling between GPCRs and active zones for glutamate and GABA in the same SuM terminals may be different, which may give rise to differential modulation of glutamate and GABA release. These possible mechanisms are now described in the Discussion (line 469-476).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The biphasic events of Figures 3 and S3: I find these (unaveraged) events a bit ambiguous. Another way to look at them is that they are not biphasic per se but rather are not categorizable. Moreover, these events are really tiny, perhaps generated by only a few receptors whose open probability is variable, thus introducing noise into the small currents.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that some events are tiny and some small currents could be masked by background noise. We understand that detecting the biphasic events by minimal stimulation has technical limitations. Because we automatically detected biphasic events, which were defined as an EPSC-IPSC sequence, only if an outward peak current following an inward current appeared within 20 ms of light illumination as described in the method section, we cannot exclude the possibility that the biphasic events we detected might include false biphasic responses. To compensate these technical issues, we also performed strontium-induced asynchronous release as another approach and found similar results as minimal stimulation experiments (Figures 3E and 3F). Furthermore, we confirmed that the amplitudes and kinetics of minimal light stimulation-evoked EPSCs or IPSCs were not altered by blockade of their counterpart currents (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). Even if false biphasic responses were accidentally included in the analysis, eventually biphasic events are a minor population and we successfully detected discernible independent EPSCs and IPSCs, which were the major population of uniquantal release-mediated synaptic responses. Thus, multiple pieces of evidence support distinct release of glutamate and GABA from SuM terminals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 4 indicates that the immunohistochemical analysis is done on SuM terminals, but I do not see how the authors know that these terminals come from SuM vs other inputs that converge in DG.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising an important point. As shown in Figure 4A, B, almost all VGluT2-positive terminals in the GC layer co-expressed with VIAAT. We are aware that VTA neurons reportedly project to the GC layer of the DG and co-release glutamate and GABA (Ntamati and Luscher, 2016). Contrary to this report, our retrograde tracing analysis did not reveal direct projections from the VTA to the DG. This new data is now included in Figure 4-figure supplement 1. We also added pre-embedding immunogold EM analysis, in which SuM terminals were virally labeled with eYFP, confirming that they form both asymmetric and symmetric synapses (revised Figure 4F). Together with these new data, our results clearly demonstrate that SuM terminals in the GC layer form both asymmetric and symmetric synapses. While our results strongly suggest that VGluT2positive terminals and SuM terminals in the GC layer are nearly identical, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that other inputs originating from unidentified brain regions may co-express VGluT2 and VIAAT in the GC layer. Therefore, in Figure 4 of the revised manuscript, we described “VGluT2-positive terminals” instead of “SuM terminals”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 4E also shows many GluN1 terminals not associated with anything, not even Vglut, and the apparent numbers do not mesh with the statistics. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>In triple immunofluorescence for VGluT2, VIAAT, and GluN1, free GluN1 puncta were predominantly observed in the molecular layer. Given that VGluT2-positive terminals are sparse in the molecular layer, these GluN1 puncta are primarily associated with VGluT1, the dominant subtype. In this study, we focused the analysis of GluN1 puncta specifically on the GC layer, excluding the molecular layer. To avoid miscommunication, we changed the original Figure 4E to the new Figure 4G, which focuses on the GC layer and aligns with the quantitative analysis. Additionally, we used ultrathin sections (100-nm-thick) to enhance spatial resolution, which limits the detection of co-localization events within this confined spatial range, as noted in the Discussion (line 485-488).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Do the conclusions based on the fluorescence immuno mesh with the apparent dimensions of the EM active zones and the apparent intermixing of labeled vesicles in immuno EM?</p></disp-quote><p>To further support our immunofluorescence results, we performed EM study and found that a single SuM terminal formed both asymmetric and symmetric synapses on a GC soma (revised Figures 4E and 4F). These new data and our immunofluorescence results clearly indicate that a single SuM terminal forms both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a GC and co-release glutamate and GABA.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, our immuno EM shows that VGluT2 and VIAAT labeled vesicles appear to intermix in asymmetric and symmetric synapses. Accordingly, in the revised manuscript, Figure 7 has been modified to show the intermixing of glutamate and GABA-containing vesicles in the SuM terminal. It should be noted that because of low labeling efficiency, our immuno-EM images don’t represent the whole picture of synaptic vesicles for glutamate and GABA. There could be biased distribution of vesicles close to their release site (more VGluT2-containing vesicles close to asymmetric synapses and more VIAAT-containing vesicles close to symmetric synapses) as reported previously (Root et al., 2018). Additionally, our results could be explained by other mechanisms: co-release of glutamate and GABA from the same vesicles, with one transmitter undetected due to the absence of its postsynaptic receptor. This possibility is now mentioned in the Discussion (line 512-520). More detailed vesicle configuration in a single SuM terminal will have to be investigated in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 6 is not so interesting to me and could be removed. It seems to test the obvious: EPSPs promote firing and IPSPs oppose it.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe these results are necessary for the following two reasons. First, we showed that glutamate/GABA co-transmission balance is dynamically changed in a frequency-dependent manner (Figure 5). In terms of physiological significance, it is important to demonstrate how these frequency-dependent dynamic changes affect GC firing. Therefore, we believe that figure 6, which shows how SuM inputs modulate GC firing by repetitive SuM stimulation, is necessary for this paper. Second, we previously reported the excitatory effects of the SuM inputs on GC firing, suggesting the important roles of glutamatergic transmission of the SuM inputs in synaptic plasticity (Hashimotodani et al., 2018; Hirai et al., 2022; Tabuchi et al., 2022). In contrast, how GABAergic cotransmission contributes to SuM-GC synaptic plasticity and DG information processing was not well understood. Our results in figure 6, which demonstrate the inhibitory effects of GABAergic co-transmission on GC firing by high frequency repetitive SuM input activity, clearly show the contribution of GABAergic co-transmission to short-term plasticity at SuM-GC synapses. For these reasons, we would like to keep Figure 6. We hope that our explanations convince the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors investigated the release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission at the supramammillary nucleus (SuM)-granule cell (GC) synapses using in vitro electrophysiology and anatomical approaches at the light and electron microscopy level.

We have now provided a new experimental setup image (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) showing a single GC, the distribution of SuM fibers in the GC layer, and the illumination area at each location. As SuM inputs make synapses onto the GC soma and dendrite close to the GC cell body, SuM-GC synapses in the recording GCs exist in a very limited area. This characteristic synaptic localization allowed us to control the illumination area without applying light to the SuM terminals in the recording GCs. Delayed onsets of EPSCs/IPSCs by over-axon stimulation (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, D) also support that SuM terminals in the recording GCs were out of illumination area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors should clarify the discrepancy between the antibody mentioned in the list of primary antibodies, which recognizes the gamma2 subunit of the GABAA receptor, and the alpha1 subunit of the GABAA receptor mentioned in the results and Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake.

In response to the reviewer’s comment, we performed the effects of higher concentration of baclofen on EPSCs and IPSCs. As shown in the figure below, 50 µM baclofen inhibited EPSCs and IPSCs to the similar extent. Therefore, by comparing inhibitory effect of two different concentrations of baclofen (5 and 50 µM), we believe that baclofen also has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both EPSCs and IPSCs similar to the DCGIV.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99711-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2E, statistical labels, such as &quot;*&quot; or &quot;n.s.&quot; (not significant), should be provided on the plots to facilitate the reading of figures.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have provided statistical labels in the Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 3A, the latency of the evoked EPSC for the lower light stimulation groups seems to be much slower than the one shown on the left or other figures in the paper, such as Figure 1F.</p></disp-quote><p>Please double-check if the blue light stimulation label is placed in the right location.</p><p>Corrected, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The use of minimal light stimulation in optogenetic experiments is not appropriately justified or described.

To effectively detect stochastic synaptic responses, the light stimulation was applied on the terminals of the SuM. We have now stated this information (line 212).
