Here, we sought to understand a poorly understood aspect of cleavage furrow positioning. Early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos deficient in the cytokinetic regulator centralspindlin form furrows, due to an inhibitory activity that depends on aster positioning relative to the polar cortices. Here, we show polar relaxation is associated with depletion of cortical ECT-2, a RhoGEF, specifically at the posterior cortex. Asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation requires intact centrosomes, Aurora A (AIR-1), and myosin-dependent cortical flows. Within a localization competent ECT-2 fragment, we identified three putative phospho-acceptor sites in the PH domain of ECT-2 that render ECT-2 responsive to inhibition by AIR-1. During both polarization and cytokinesis, our results suggest that centrosomal AIR-1 breaks symmetry via ECT-2 phosphorylation; this local inhibition of ECT-2 is amplified by myosin-driven flows that generate regional ECT-2 asymmetry. Together, these mechanisms cooperate to induce polarized assembly of cortical myosin, contributing to both embryo polarization and cytokinesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>polarization</kwd><kwd><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Rho GTPase</kwd><kwd>RhoGEF</kwd><kwd>Aurora A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM127091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longhini</surname><given-names>Katrina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Centrosomal Aurora A (AIR-1), together with cortical actomyosin flows, induces polarization of ECT-2, the activator of RHO-1, during polarization and cytokinesis, in order to promote furrow formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The division of a single animal cell into two daughter cells is facilitated by an actomyosin-based contractile ring that generates the force that constricts the cell membrane and generates the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basant and Glotzer, 2018</xref>). Furrow positioning is dictated by the position of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rappaport, 1985</xref>). Work in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has shown that distinct parts of the spindle, namely the spindle midzone and the asters, are each sufficient to induce furrowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dechant and Glotzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bringmann and Hyman, 2005</xref>). The active form of the small GTPase RhoA (C.e. RHO-1) is necessary for cleavage furrow induction in these and other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kishi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jantsch-Plunger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou and Zheng, 2013</xref>). An experimentally induced equatorial zone of active RhoA suffices to induce a furrow in cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner and Glotzer, 2016</xref>). Despite progress in our understanding of cytokinesis, gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanism by which asters spatially regulate actomyosin contractility.</p><p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Ect2 (C.e. ECT-2) is the primary activator of RhoA during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tatsumoto et al., 1999</xref>). This Dbl-homology family member is regulated by numerous factors. Prominent among these is the centralspindlin complex which, despite containing a subunit with a RhoGAP domain, plays a significant role in RhoA activation during cytokinesis. Centralspindlin both induces relief of ECT-2 auto-inhibition and promotes Ect2 recruitment to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yüce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Glotzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Niiya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao and Fang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Su et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Anti-parallel, bundled microtubule plus ends, localized kinases, and a phosphatase conspire to promote centralspindlin-dependent RhoA activation at the cell equator, midway between the two spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wolfe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yüce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nishimura and Yonemura, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite the established role of the spindle midzone in cytokinesis in diverse metazoa, furrow formation can occur in its absence in some cell types. This is well characterized in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos where the centralspindlin-dependent and -independent furrows have been separated genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dechant and Glotzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>). Analogous phenomena operate in cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ramkumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>). In early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, centralspindlin functions in parallel with NOP-1 to promote ECT-2-dependent RHO-1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fievet et al., 2012</xref>). Though it is non-essential, NOP-1 can promote formation of an incomplete furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). In certain circumstances, NOP-1 suffices to induce complete furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loria et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Glotzer, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to being genetically separable, the centralspindlin- and NOP-1-dependent pathways can be spatially separated. Whereas the position of the centralspindlin-dependent furrow correlates with the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>), the position of the NOP-1 dependent furrow anti-correlates with the position of the spindle asters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hird and White, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dechant and Glotzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, spindle asters are associated with inhibition of contractility. This inhibitory activity has generally been ascribed to the astral microtubules and is often referred to as polar relaxation/astral relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wolpert, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">White and Borisy, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dechant and Glotzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mangal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapa-Y-Lazo et al., 2020</xref>). In unperturbed cells, centralspindlin-dependent and -independent furrows align during cytokinesis.</p><p>Regional suppression of cortical contractility also occurs during polarization of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote. After fertilization, the sperm-derived centrosome serves as a symmetry-breaking cue that inhibits cortical contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldstein and Hird, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>). This reduction in cortical contractility induces cortical flows that advect PAR proteins, such as PAR-3 and PAR-6, to the nascent anterior of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Munro et al., 2004</xref>). Centrosomes locally concentrate Aurora A kinase (C.e. AIR-1), which is required for centrosome-directed displacement of the RhoGEF ECT-2 from the posterior cortex during polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klinkert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism of action of Aurora A is not known, in particular it is not known whether Aurora A regulates ECT-2 during cytokinesis.</p><p>To address these questions we quantitatively examined ECT-2 distribution during polarization and cytokinesis in early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. We show that ECT-2 becomes asymmetrically localized coincident with the early stages of polarity establishment, as it becomes depleted posteriorly and enriched anteriorly. The degree of ECT-2 asymmetry attenuates somewhat as the embryo progresses through mitosis and then increases again during anaphase, under the influence of the asymmetric spindle. As during polarization, ECT-2 asymmetry during anaphase requires intact centrosomes and AIR-1. A C-terminal fragment of ECT-2 largely recapitulates the dynamic localization of ECT-2 during early embryogenesis. A set of putative Aurora A sites have been identified in this fragment that are required for its displacement by centrosomes and Aurora A. While phosphorylation of ECT-2 by Aurora A serves as a symmetry breaking cue, ECT-2 asymmetry also requires myosin-dependent cortical flows. Our results suggest that Aurora A-triggered phosphorylation of ECT-2 initiates cortical flows which redistribute actomyosin and associated factors, including ECT-2, thereby regulating polarization and cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cortex-associated ECT-2 is asymmetric during cytokinesis</title><p>To dissect the mechanism by which spindle asters regulate contractility, we first examined the distribution of endogenous ECT-2 during early embryogenesis. Displacement of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex during polarization has been previously described in studies utilizing an ECT-2:GFP transgene. Collectively, these works revealed that centrosomes and/or their associated microtubules induce displacement of ECT-2 during polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>). To further investigate the dynamics of ECT-2 localization, we engineered a mNeonGreen (mNG) tag at the C-terminus of endogenous ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>). ECT-2::mNG is well tolerated (&gt;99% embryos hatch).</p><p>During both polarization and cytokinesis, we quantified the levels of cortical ECT-2 along the entire perimeter of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each time point, we averaged cortical ECT-2 levels in the anterior and posterior 20% of the embryo, and calculated the ratio of these values as a measure of ECT-2 asymmetry. In the early zygote, the cortical pool of ECT-2 increases and it becomes progressively more asymmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> i–iii). Images acquired during polarity establishment reveal displacement of ECT-2 from a large domain in posterior cortex and a progressive increase in the anterior cortex resulting in highly asymmetric cortical ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, –480 s [relative to anaphase onset], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi, ii,vi</xref>). The size of the posterior domain where ECT-2 is displaced, that is, boundary length, represents ~35% of the embryo, measured at the time point of maximal ECT-2 asymmetry. ECT-2 accumulation on the anterior cortex is accompanied by an increase in cortical myosin accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), cortical contractility and pseudocleavage furrow formation, and transient elongation of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> ii, v). The pseudocleavage furrow forms at the boundary between the myosin-enriched anterior and the myosin-depleted posterior of the embryo; myosin does not solely accumulate at the furrow.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cortical ECT-2 becomes asymmetric during polarization and cytokinesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ECT-2 accumulation is asymmetric during polarization.

To determine whether microtubules are required, embryos were depleted of both alpha- and beta-tubulin and treated with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules to the greatest extent possible. Despite significant depletion of tubulin and near-complete depolymerization of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, insets), we observed strong displacement of ECT-2 from a broad region of the posterior cortex and the initiation of cortical contractility following mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In these embryos, the centrosomes could be identified by the residual signal from mCherry-tubulin, and the posterior displacement was centered around the position of the centrosome. ECT-2 becomes hyper-asymmetric in these embryos as compared to control embryos and the depleted zone comprises a larger region of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as is also observed in embryos with a diminished, posteriorly positioned spindle (see below).</p><p>To further examine the role of the centrosome in ECT-2 asymmetry, we depleted the centrosomal scaffold protein SPD-5. Embryos depleted of SPD-5 lack organized arrays of microtubules, though some microtubules assemble in a poorly organized manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamill et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pelletier et al., 2004</xref>). ECT-2 asymmetry is reduced in these embryos both during polarization, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>), and during cytokinesis; in particular, significant ECT-2 remains on the posterior cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> iii). Collectively, these studies suggest that ECT-2 asymmetry during anaphase is centrosome-directed.</p><p>The evidence presented thus far indicates that centrosomes are the primary source of an activity that induces ECT-2 displacement during anaphase. Although the embryo contains two centrosomes at the time of the first cell division, one in the anterior, the other in the posterior, ECT-2 is preferentially displaced from the posterior cortex. Two, non-mutually exclusive explanations could underlie these differential responses. First, the centrosomes could be functionally distinct as a consequence of the disparate ages and maturity of the embedded centrioles – and assuming that the centrosomes undergo age-dependent stereotyped anterior-posterior positioning in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the two centrosomes may be functionally equivalent, but, due to the underlying polarity of the embryo, the posterior centrosome is more closely opposed to the posterior cortex. To test the second model, we depleted embryos of PAR-3, to disrupt PAR protein polarity, allowing the centrosomes to be situated equidistant to the cortices on the anterior and posterior regions of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Etemad-Moghadam et al., 1995</xref>). Upon anaphase onset, embryos depleted of PAR-3 exhibit displacement of ECT-2 from both the anterior and posterior domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that both centrosomes are competent to inhibit ECT-2 accumulation. Likewise, ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis is reduced in embryos depleted of PAR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To modulate spindle positioning without disrupting polarity, we depleted the Gα proteins that function redundantly to promote anaphase spindle elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gotta and Ahringer, 2001</xref>). In Gα-depleted embryos, ECT-2 accumulation is asymmetric during M-phase, but upon mitotic exit, ECT-2 dissociates slowly from the anterior cortex, as in the wild-type, yet its dissociation from the posterior cortex is significantly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), due to the reduced spindle elongation toward the posterior cortex. As a consequence, rather than ECT-2 accumulation becoming more asymmetric as anaphase progresses as in the wild-type, it becomes nearly symmetric. Collectively, these data indicate that, during cytokinesis, displacement of ECT-2 from the cortex is highly sensitive to centrosome-cortex separation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cortical flows contribute to asymmetric ECT-2 during polarization and cytokinesis</title><p>During polarization, the sperm-derived centrosomes that trigger asymmetric accumulation of ECT-2 are small, while ECT-2 is broadly displaced from the posterior region of the cortex, comprising ~35% of the embryo cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, –480 s). Likewise, during cytokinesis, the zone of ECT-2 depletion is nearly as broad, and further increased when microtubules are depolymerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In embryos with reduced myosin-dependent flows, ECT-2:mNG asymmetry is highly attenuated, though a local inhibitory effect on ECT-2:mNG accumulation in the immediate vicinity of the centrosome is detectable; these results are consistent with an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that cortical flows amplify the local, centrosome-induced reduction in cortical ECT-2 accumulation.</p><p>During cytokinesis, ECT-2 activation requires two factors that function in parallel to promote RHO-1 activation, the centralspindlin subunit CYK-4 and NOP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). Redistribution of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex could reflect the displacement of ECT-2 in complex with either one or both of these activators. To test each of these possibilities, we examined the distribution of ECT-2 during cytokinesis in embryos in which the functions of NOP-1 and CYK-4 are reduced, either alone or in combination. ECT-2 displacement and asymmetric accumulation was not abolished by these perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, basal levels of RHO-1 activation suffice to promote displacement of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex during anaphase.</p><p>Enhanced cortical flows have been reported during cytokinesis in embryos with attenuated astral microtubules, such as nocodazole-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hird and White, 1993</xref>), embryos with posteriorly positioning spindles due to persistent katanin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>) or depletion of ZYG-9. These perturbations result in suppression of cortical contractility in the posterior cortex and enhancement of contractility in the anterior cortex. These changes induce enhanced cortical flows of myosin toward the anterior that drive formation of an ectopic furrow in the anterior at the boundary between regions of high and low myosin accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Posteriorly positioned spindles also induce a centralspindlin-dependent furrow coincident with the spindle midzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>). To quantitatively characterize these flows, we assayed the movement of myosin (NMY-2) punctate in wild-type and ZYG-9-depleted embryos. As compared to control embryos, ZYG-9-depleted embryos contain more cortical myosin foci which travel more than 1 µm, and these foci also move faster and travel further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). To test whether enhanced cortical flows influence ECT-2 localization, we examined ECT-2::mNG in <italic>zyg-9(b244ts</italic>) embryos. Under these conditions, during anaphase, ECT-2 becomes hyper-asymmetric with a stronger reduction in the posterior cortical pool of ECT-2, an increase in the anterior cortical pool, and an expansion of the posterior domain depleted of ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, the two poles of the small spindle appear to suppress ECT-2 accumulation equally. We conclude that cortical flows contribute to ECT-2 asymmetry.</p><p>Polar relaxation was proposed to result from dynein-mediated stripping of cortical myosin that generates defects in the cortical network, resulting in anterior-directed flows, contributing to polar relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapa-Y-Lazo et al., 2020</xref>). However, asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation is not abrogated by depletion the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein, DHC-1. To the contrary, DHC-1 depletion, which would be predicted to compromise dynein-mediated stripping of cortical myosin, causes enhanced ECT-2 asymmetry, akin to the situation in embryos in which microtubule assembly is strongly suppressed, presumably due to the close association of the centrosomes with the posterior cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, not only are cortical flows required for asymmetric ECT-2, increases or decreases in cortical flows enhance or attenuate the extent of ECT-2 asymmetry, respectively.</p><p>To understand how cortical flows promote the asymmetric accumulation of ECT-2, we sought to determine whether ECT-2 itself undergoes long range flows or if ECT-2 dynamically interacts with components that undergo such flows. To that end, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays on ECT-2:mNG to measure the dynamics of its cortical association. Following bleaching, ECT-2:mNG rapidly recovers with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of ~3 s; with no obvious difference detected between polarization and cytokinesis. We conclude that ECT-2 asymmetry is likely to reflect the dynamic association of ECT-2 with more stably associated cortical component(s) that undergo cortical flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Although much of ECT-2 is highly dynamic, we found one context in which ECT-2 associates more stably with the cortex.

FRAP analysis of the posterior and anterior furrows indicates that in both cases the mobile fraction of ECT-2 recovers quickly, but only ~50% of ECT-2 on the posterior furrow recovers, whereas the anterior furrow more fully recovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AIR-1, an Aurora A kinase, regulates ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis</title><p>To further examine the origin of ECT-2 asymmetry, we examined the impact of Aurora A kinase (AIR-1) on ECT-2 distribution during cytokinesis.

Rather, in most such embryos, due the existence of a parallel, pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Motegi et al., 2011</xref>), posterior PAR proteins become enriched at both the anterior and the posterior cortex, and cortical flows emanate from both poles toward the equator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klinkert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reich et al., 2019</xref>).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we depleted AIR-1 in embryos defective for ZYG-9 function. Although the spindle assembles close to the posterior pole, it does not induce the pronounced ECT-2 asymmetry observed in the presence of AIR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Treatment of embryos with MLN8237 at metaphase resulted in a rapid enhancement in cortical ECT-2 accumulation during cytokinesis, indicating that AIR-1 functions during anaphase to promote ECT-2 displacement from the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Some, but not all, of AIR-1 functions involve its binding partner, TPXL-1, an ortholog of Tpx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozlü et al., 2005</xref>).

Furthermore, TPXL-1 prominently decorates astral microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozlü et al., 2005</xref>), which are positioned where they could conceivably modulate cortical ECT-2 accumulation. Indeed, TPXL-1 has been proposed to promote the displacement of contractile proteins from the anterior cortex of the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mangal et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate whether an AIR-1/TPXL-1 complex plays a role in ECT-2 displacement during cytokinesis, we depleted TPXL-1 in embryos expressing ECT-2::mNG. Overall cortical ECT-2 accumulation is enhanced by TPXL-1 depletion, though the degree of ECT-2 asymmetry is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). TPXL-1 depletion results in a number of phenotypes, including reduced spindle length during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewellyn et al., 2010</xref>), which, like AIR-1 depletion, might indirectly impact ECT-2 accumulation by increasing the distance between spindle pole and the cortex. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined ECT-2 localization in embryos deficient in both ZYG-9 and TPXL-1 so that the attenuated spindle assembles close to the embryo posterior.

To that end, we depleted PPH-6 or SAPS-1, the two major subunits of the protein phosphatase 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2010</xref>). PPH-6 interacts with AIR-1 and is implicated in dephosphorylation of the activation loop of AIR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotak et al., 2016</xref>). Prior work revealed that depletion of either PPH-6 or SAPS-1 blocks pseudocleavage, reduces the accumulation of cortical myosin, and attenuates the forces that drive spindle elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2010</xref>) and more recent work demonstrates that AIR-1 is epistatic to PPH-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotak et al., 2016</xref>). As expected for a negative regulator of AIR-1, SAPS-1 depletion results in an overall reduction in cortical ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Nevertheless, the cortical pool of ECT-2 remains somewhat asymmetric in SAPS-1-depleted embryos.

As previously shown, a C-terminal fragment of ECT-2 that extends from the N-terminus of the DH domain to the C-terminus exhibits cortical accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Nance, 2013</xref>). Further deletion analysis indicates that cortical accumulation is independent of the majority of the DH domain, but required both the PH domain and a portion of the region C-terminal to the PH domain, but not its entirety (ECT-2<sup>C</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This fragment can localize to the cortex of embryos depleted of endogenous ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>); although it does not accumulate asymmetrically under these conditions. The accumulation pattern of ECT-2<sup>C</sup> is similar to that of endogenous ECT-2 during both polarization and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). This ECT-2 fragment is also recruited to the posterior, centralspindlin-dependent furrow that forms in ZYG-9-depleted embryos (not shown).

To that end, we generated a strain in which one of the putative phospho-acceptor residues in ECT-2, T634, was mutated to a glutamic acid. This strain could be readily maintained as a homozygote (&gt;98% hatch rate), indicating that this allele retains significant function, although cortical accumulation of ECT-2<sup>T634E</sup> is reduced and less asymmetric. To test whether the T634E substitution impacts ECT-2 activity, we used RNAi to partially deplete ECT-2:mNG and ECT-2<sup>T634E</sup>:mNG. Reduction of ECT-2:mNG levels to ~20% of wild-type results in cytokinesis failure in only ~11% of embryos. Thus, in the wild-type, ECT-2 accumulates to levels in excess of that required for completion of cytokinesis. In contrast, a similar reduction of ECT-2<sup>T634E</sup>:mNG results in cytokinesis failure in ~50% of embryos, suggesting that phosphorylation of ECT-2 on T634 attenuates ECT-2 function. Importantly, whereas ECT-2<sup>T634E</sup>:mNG slows the rate of furrow ingression as compared to wild-type, furrow initiation is not delayed. In contrast, partial depletion of ECT-2 does not affect the rate of furrow ingression, but it delays furrow initiation. These results suggest that the defects resulting from the T634E substitution are distinct from those resulting from an overall reduction in ECT-2 function. To test whether this substitution affects centralspindlin-dependent furrowing, we depleted NOP-1 in embryos expressing ECT-2:mNG and ECT-2<sup>T634E</sup>:mNG. Whereas ECT-2:mNG embryos depleted of NOP-1 complete cytokinesis with only a slight delay, embryos expressing ECT-2<sup>T634E</sup> and depleted of NOP-1 exhibit highly variable furrowing behavior. While a minority of such embryos complete the first division (5/12), many embryos form furrows that ingress at variable rates and to variable extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bv</xref>). We conclude that the introduction of a single phosphomimetic residue at a putative AIR-1 site in a flexible loop in the PH domain of ECT-2 impairs centralspindlin-dependent furrowing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During cytokinesis, cleavage furrow formation is directed by a combination of a positive signal that spatially correlates with the position of the spindle midzone, and a negative signal associated with spindle poles. The positive cue is centralspindlin-dependent and is fairly well understood; far less is known about the inhibitory cue(s) associated with spindle poles. Here, we show that an inhibitory cue associated with centrosomes triggers a local, Aurora A kinase-dependent inhibition of cortical ECT-2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Our studies suggest that the posteriorly shifted spindle triggers preferential displacement of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex by Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation of the ECT-2 PH domain, though the evidence for this phosphorylation event is indirect. This local inhibition of cortical ECT-2 recruitment triggers anterior-directed, myosin-dependent cortical flows that amplify ECT-2 asymmetric accumulation, likely generating positive feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Inhibition of cortical accumulation of ECT-2 by Aurora A influences both centralspindlin-independent and -dependent furrowing.

(<bold>B</bold>) During both polarization and cytokinesis, centrosome-derived AIR-1 locally inhibits cortical ECT-2 accumulation, triggering symmetry breaking and generation of cortical flows directed away from the site of symmetry breaking. ECT-2 dynamically associates with components that undergo cortical flow, leading to its further depletion from the posterior cortex and its anterior accumulation. During polarity establishment, the centrosomes are small and closely apposed to the cortex, whereas during anaphase the centrosomes are large and accumulate significant AIR-1 that modulate cortical association of ECT-2. During polarization, the pseudocleavage furrow forms at the boundary between low and high ECT-2 and myosin levels; in cytokinesis, this site correlates with the centralspindlin-dependent furrow that correlates with the spindle midzone.

Following an initial period of uniform cortical association, as the paternally contributed centrosome approaches the cortex, ECT-2 accumulation at the nascent posterior cortex is reduced, coupled with an accompanying increase of ECT-2 in the nascent anterior cortex leading to the asymmetric distribution of ECT-2 and establishment of the primary body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>). The centrosome-induced reduction of posterior ECT-2 involves AIR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klinkert et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A C-terminal fragment of ECT-2, lacking the regulatory BRCT domains and the catalytic GEF domain, largely recapitulates the asymmetric distribution of endogenous ECT-2 throughout the early divisions. The PH domain contained in this fragment contains a sequence, predicted to form a loop, that contains several putative sites for phosphorylation by AIR-1. Mutation of these sites to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues enhances ECT-2 cortical association and renders it resistant to the inhibitory action of AIR-1; conversely, phosphomimetic mutations reduce its cortical association. We hypothesize that AIR-1 phosphorylates these sites thereby inhibiting ECT-2 cortical association. The flexible loop containing these putative sites is predicted to lie adjacent to the surface where phosphoinositides bind in structurally characterized PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reckel et al., 2017</xref>). The strong effect of phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutations on ECT-2 accumulation is striking, given the predicted flexibility of this loop, lending additional support to their relevance.</p><p>Our results implicating AIR-1 in polarity establishment are largely in concordance with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>, with the exception that these authors did not observe an effect of AIR-1 depletion on ECT-2 localization during polarity establishment. In that regard, our results align with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>. Multiple lines of evidence implicate AIR-1 in inhibiting ECT-2 cortical localization. These include (i) changes in cortical accumulation of ECT-2 upon depletion of SAPS-1 and AIR-1 (ECT-2<sup>C</sup> is also enhanced upon AIR-1 depletion); (ii) increased cortical accumulation of GFP:ECT-2<sup>C_3A</sup> as compared to GFP:ECT-2<sup>C</sup>; (iii) susceptibility of GFP:ECT-2<sup>C</sup>, but not GFP:ECT-2<sup>C_3A</sup> to GBP:mCherry:AIR-1; (iv) a phosphomimetic substitution of a predicted AIR-1 site in ECT-2, T634, attenuates its cortical accumulation and function.</p><p>During both polarization and cytokinesis, centrosomes, by virtue of their role in concentrating and activating AIR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamill et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joukov et al., 2010</xref>), appear to act as cues for ECT-2 displacement. This assertion is based on several earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Kotak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klinkert et al., 2019</xref>) and the observations shown here. Specifically, during both processes, ECT-2 displacement requires the core centrosomal component SPD-5, which is required to recruit AIR-1 to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamill et al., 2002</xref>), but ECT-2 displacement is not inhibited by depolymerization of microtubules and it does not require the AIR-1 activator TPXL-1 (see below). During cytokinesis, centrosomes preferentially inhibit ECT-2 cortical association in the posterior of the embryo. This difference results from the asymmetric position of the spindle that arises as a consequence of embryo polarization.</p><p>To summarize our results related to cytokinesis, we plotted cortical ECT-2 accumulation as a function of centrosome-cortical distance in representative embryos from a variety of experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These data demonstrate that, during cytokinesis, ECT-2 accumulation and centrosome proximity inversely correlate over a range of distances up to ~20 µm (40% of embryo length). The inhibitory effect of centrosomes on ECT-2 accumulation decays rapidly in the range of 10–18 µm from the cortex, which correspond to the positions of the posterior and anterior centrosomes in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>), respectively. These findings are consistent with our earlier work demonstrating that spindle elongation regulates furrowing during cytokinesis, although we previously inferred that the inhibition was due to astral microtubules, which are proximal to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dechant and Glotzer, 2003</xref>), rather than centrosomes which are not.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cortical flows amplify ECT-2 asymmetry</title><p>Centrosomes and AIR-1 kinase promote ECT-2 asymmetry during both polarity establishment and cytokinesis. During polarity establishment in myosin-depleted embryos which lack cortical flows, the zone of inhibition of ECT-2 accumulation in the posterior shrinks considerably; similar observations have reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>). During cytokinesis, perturbations, such as microtubule disassembly and ZYG-9 depletion, enhance cortical flows creating a larger posterior zone of inhibition and enhance the accumulation of ECT-2 in the anterior. The enhancement of these flows is likely the result of a combination of a reduction in the distance between the posterior centrosome to the cortex and the removal of a centrosome in the anterior domain which would otherwise suppress contractility in that region. The ability of ECT-2<sup>C_3A</sup> to polarize in the presence, but not the absence of myosin, further establishes the role of flows in amplifying ECT-2 asymmetry. These results suggest that in wild-type embryos, Aurora A-dependent symmetry breaking is amplified by anterior-directed cortical flows that enhance ECT-2 asymmetry. Further, we speculate that centrosomal AIR-1 not only breaks symmetry, but that this regulation of ECT-2 by centrosomal AIR-1 continues throughout anaphase. These findings extend our understanding of the mechanistic basis for the requirement for myosin in polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo and Kemphues, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, asymmetric ECT-2 is predicted to enhance asymmetric assembly of cortical myosin, which is predicted to accentuate cortical flows, further amplifying ECT-2 asymmetry.</p><p>Long-range flows result from the viscosity of the cortical actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). It is unlikely that ECT-2 is concentrated by these flows itself, as it exchanges rapidly, on the order of seconds. Rather, we favor a model in which the association of ECT-2 with the cortex involves interactions with cortical component(s) that are concentrated by cortical flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>). This would explain the anterior accumulation of ECT-2 as polarization proceeds and the enhanced ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in embryos with exaggerated flows. The PH domain of ECT-2 has been shown to bind the actomyosin-binding protein anillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frenette et al., 2012</xref>), making it a candidate contributor to ECT-2 cortical anchoring. Anterior PAR proteins may also contribute to ECT-2 accumulation. Interestingly, anterior PAR proteins are known to promote cortical flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Munro et al., 2004</xref>). Further analysis of the interactions required for ECT-2 association will be a focus of future studies.</p><p>Although RhoGEF activators accelerate cortical flows, basal levels of myosin appear sufficient to drive the cortical flows that polarize ECT-2. For example, inactivation of NOP-1 slows cortical flows and delays the polarization of anterior PAR proteins, but it does not preclude asymmetric accumulation of ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rose et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tse et al., 2012</xref>) and this study. Cortical flow-mediated concentration of ECT-2 may be central to polarization of the embryo, analogous to flow-induced re-orientation of PAR protein polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittasch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>During anaphase, asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation is also myosin-dependent, presumably due to its role in generating cortical flows. During cytokinesis, basal myosin levels appear to be sufficient to promote asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation, as ECT-2 asymmetry increases during anaphase even when both NOP-1 and CYK-4 are attenuated. We infer that bulk, cortical ECT-2 has a low level of RhoGEF activity.</p><p>In summary, during both polarization and cytokinesis, the cortex undergoes large, furrow-inducing, flows of contractile cortical material due to the influence of the centrosomes on ECT-2 localization. During polarization the two centrosomes are tiny and they interact with the male pronucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malone et al., 2003</xref>). These immature centrosomes are usually closely associated with the posterior cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delattre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>). By contrast, during the first cytokinesis, the two centrosomes are large, they contain dramatically more AIR-1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hannak et al., 2001</xref>), and they are separated from each other by the length of the spindle and they lie at least 10 µm from the nearest cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Despite the wide differences in size, components, and positions of the immature and mature centrosomes, roughly similar patterns of ECT-2 accumulation and contractility are induced during polarization and cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell cycle regulation of ECT-2 cortical localization</title><p>The temporal pattern of ECT-2 cortical accumulation is dynamic. ECT-2 is initially uniformly distributed on the cortex and becomes progressively asymmetric through the first interphase. Cortical ECT-2 accumulation then declines throughout maintenance phase, though asymmetry remains. During cytokinesis, ECT-2 levels on the cortex decline, though it is preferentially displaced from the posterior cortex, coincident with spindle elongation.</p><p>While many of these changes in cortical localization reflect changes controlled by AIR-1 and centrosome position, other factors appear to influence cortical accumulation of ECT-2. For example, cell cycle regulated, global changes in ECT-2 accumulation are apparent in AIR-1-depleted embryos. Furthermore, the ability of GBP::mCherry::AIR-1 to induce GFP-ECT-2C displacement fluctuates with the cell cycle, suggesting the susceptibility of ECT-2 to AIR-1 may be cell cycle regulated. For example, Cdk1 phosphorylation of ECT-2 might inhibit its phosphorylation by AIR-1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TPXL-1 is not required for ECT-2 asymmetry</title><p>In addition to examining the role of AIR-1 in regulating cortical association of ECT-2, we also examined the role of one of its activators, TPXL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozlü et al., 2005</xref>). TPXL-1 targets AIR-1 to astral microtubules, which are well positioned to modulate cortical ECT-2. However, TPXL-1 makes a more modest contribution to ECT-2 asymmetry than does AIR-1. Additionally, the effect observed upon TPXL-1 depletion might be, at least in part, an indirect consequence of the role of TPXL-1 in regulating spindle assembly and positioning. Indeed, TPXL-1 is dispensable for ECT-2 asymmetry when spindle poles are close to the cortex. This finding is consistent with earlier work that revealed that several AIR-1 functions, particularly those at the centrosome, are TPXL-1 independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozlü et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that TPXL-1 is involved in polar relaxation during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mangal et al., 2018</xref>). There are several differences between that study and the present one. Here, we assayed ECT-2 accumulation, whereas the previous study assayed accumulation of the RHO-1 effector anillin in embryos that were depleted of both myosin II and the principle RhoGAPs that inhibit RHO-1, RGA-3/4. In that context, TPXL-1 appears to inhibit accumulation of anillin specifically at the anterior cortex; anillin does not strongly accumulate on the posterior cortex of either wild-type or TPXL-1-depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mangal et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, AIR-1 appears to regulate Rho-mediated contractility at multiple steps, which are differentially dependent on both TPXL-1 and NMY-2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Centralspindlin can facilitate ECT-2 cortical association</title><p>Despite the inhibition of ECT-2 accumulation at the posterior cortex, which is further potentiated when the spindle is displaced to the posterior, a furrow can form at a site adjacent to the spindle midzone in the embryo posterior. Formation of this furrow requires centralspindlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werner et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the overall inhibition of ECT-2 cortical association in the posterior, our results suggest an initial centralspindlin accumulation recruits and activates ECT-2 to induce furrowing at this site.</p><p>These results indicate that cortical recruitment of ECT-2 can occur by two distinct modes. One mode is independent of centralspindlin, and is inhibited by AIR-1. The other mode is dependent on centralspindlin and is less sensitive to AIR-1 activity. The centralspindlin-dependent mode of ECT-2 accumulation correlates with a reduced mobile fraction of ECT-2 as compared to the ECT-2 that accumulates on the cortex more broadly. Centralspindlin-dependent accumulation of cortical ECT-2 is reminiscent of its regulation in cultured human cells. In HeLa cells, Ect2 does not constitutively associate with the cortex, due to Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of a basic region C-terminal to the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Su et al., 2011</xref>). During anaphase in these cells, equatorial accumulation of ECT-2 requires centralspindlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Su et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in both systems, phosphorylation of the C-terminus of ECT-2 attenuates its cortical association. However, the kinases are distinct (Cdk1 in human cells vs. AIR-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) whereas the phosphoregulation appears global in human cells and spatially regulated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> blastomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Polar relaxation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian cells</title><p>The results shown here indicate that inhibition of ECT-2 accumulation by centrosomal Aurora A at spindle poles can induce furrow formation.

This estimate is plotted as a function of relative position along the cortex of the embryo with 0 as the anterior and 0.5 as the posterior.</p><p>For the <italic>ect-2</italic>(RNAi) partial depletion experiments, embryo intensity was measured as the average pixel intensity of the embryo after subtracting the background at NEBD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Furrow kinetics</title><p>The positions of the furrow tips in NMY-2:GFP, NMY-2:mKate, or ECT-2:mNG embryos were measured at 10 s intervals starting at NEBD or anaphase.

A key factor controlling actomyosin ring function is a protein called ECT2, which is a regulator of the signalling protein RhoA GTPase. How ECT2 gets to the correct cellular location and how it executes its functions remain a mystery, despite extensive work. This work through a set of beautiful and thorough experiments establishes the mechanism of ECT2 intracellular distribution, which involves integration of spatial and biochemical signals all contributing to the fidelity of cell division.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83992.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Mohan K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01a77tt86</institution-id><institution>University of Warwick</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Aurora A and cortical flows promote polarization and cytokinesis by inducing asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers at Review Commons and an <italic>eLife</italic> referee, and the evaluation at <italic>eLife</italic> has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Mohan Balasubramanian) and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Based on the previous reviews and the revisions, the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The <italic>eLife</italic> expert raised some points which are transmitted verbatim below. I have read them carefully. I think the vast majority of points can be addressed by rewriting and providing explanations or toning down some of the conclusions. Also, the referee has asked that you provide some more experimental details, statistical methods, and additional citations.</p><p>Points arising from your response letter and revision:</p><p>1. In a revised manuscript, I am not convinced with their interpretation of the phenotype of air-1(RNAi);par-2(RNAi) zygotes. Given that either single par-2(RNAi) or single air-1(RNAi) abolished the anterior-enriched distribution of ECT-2::mNG (Figure 4 supplement 2), this data simply indicates the indispensable roles of both PAR-2 and AIR-1 in ECT-2 asymmetry, but they cannot conclude that ECT-2 asymmetry in air-1(RNAi) condition is due to PAR-2-dependent weaker cortical flows. Indeed, the anterior/the posterior ratio of ECT-2::mNG in air-1(RNAi) zygotes shown in Figure 4 supplement 2 is very close to 1.0 throughout mitosis, which is quite different from that in Figure 4A. This discrepancy should be addressed in the final manuscript.</p><p>2. The authors' response &quot;While cytokinesis generally involves an equatorial contractile ring, furrow formation can be driven by an asymmetric – i.e. non-equatorial – accumulation of actomyosin. This behavior is exemplified during pseudocleavage during which the entire anterior cortex is enriched for actomyosin and the posterior is depleted of myosin (Figure 1 Supplement 2). Several published studies provide evidence that the asymmetric pattern of myosin accumulation contributes to cytokinesis (PMID 22918944, 17669650).&quot;</p><p>The role of switching off the cortical flow from the P-to-A alone mode to the bidirectional mode in cytokinetic furrow formation has been reported in many papers (PMID: 27719759, 29963981, 32497213, etc.) as mentioned above. A simple unidirectional asymmetry is not sufficient in discussing the spatial regulation of cytokinesis.</p><p>3. The authors' response &quot;However, as seen in e.g. ZYG-9 depleted embryos, ECT-2 is recruited to the posterior cortex in a centralspindlin-dependent manner&quot;. I don't understand the logic here. Has this been directly tested by, for example, depletion of ZEN-4 or CYK-4 in zyg-9(b244) mutant embryos? In Figure 3C (zyg-9(b244)), no particular enrichment of ECT-2 was observed at the posterior furrow, which is formed by centralspindlin.</p><p>4. &quot;In contrast, the Gomez-Cavasos paper (PMID 32619481) shows in figure S2 that the PH domain is required for cortical localization of ECT-2; this paper does not focus extensively on the cortical accumulation of ECT-2&quot;. I think Gomez-Cavasos should also be cited as these provide complementary information as to the role of the PH domain.</p><p>5. In addition to the above, please answer either by rewriting or with experiments the points raised by the <italic>eLife</italic> referee below. As I read it, some experiments on Ect2 localization are required to firmly test your models. All other points raised might involve a balanced discussion of various observations and raising the limitations of the work.</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> referee comments verbatim:Asymmetric actomyosin contractility plays key roles in various cellular activities. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, both the post-fertilization polarity establishment and cytokinesis depend on this process, which is known to be under the control of Rho GTPase. In this manuscript, the authors studied the molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking, focusing on ECT-2 RhoGEF, the crucial upstream activator of Rho, and its regulation by AIR-1, Aurora A kinase. Although the roles of these molecules both in polarity establishment and cytokinesis have already been reported, it remains unclear whether and how AIR-1 might regulate the activity of ECT-2.</p><p>By a combination of genetic manipulation and high-quality quantitive microscopy, the authors compared various perturbations and concluded that centrosomes and the cortical flow driven by actomyosin network play roles in the asymmetric cortical localization of ECT-2 while astral microtubules and TPXL-1, a conserved Aurora A regulator that recruits AIR-1 to the astral microtubules, are not essential for the ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in contrary to the previous reports. Then, the authors tested the hypothesis that AIR-1 induces cortical asymmetry by directly phosphorylating ECT-2 and presented the in vivo phenotypes of the ECT-2 constructs with mutations at the putative phosphorylation sites, which were consistent with their hypothesis.</p><p>(Influence of the cortical asymmetry at the mitotic entry)</p><p>There is a flaw in their interpretation of the results of various perturbations. Their model in Figure 7B cytokinesis depicts that NMY-2 is absent at the cell cortex during earlier stages of mitosis (pro~meta). This is not precise and misleading. In normal embryos, even after the pseudo-furrowing settles, NMY-2 doesn't disappear from the cell cortex and, importantly, is kept anteriorly enriched though at slightly lower intensity in smaller patches than in the earlier phase (eg. Tse et al. 2012 PMID:22918944, Figure 3). Actin filaments also remain more enriched in the anterior cortex than in the posterior cortex. This is a clear difference from the post-fertilization polarity establishment, in which uniform distribution of the actomyosin network is maintained until the entry of sperm breaks the symmetry.</p><p>During the early stages of mitosis, the cortical flow is suspended due to the inhibitory activity of CDK1. The onset of anaphase cancels this inhibition and triggers the contraction of the actomyosin network. If the symmetry of cortical actomyosin is already broken as in the normal embryos, even uniform activation of actomyosin throughout the cell will result in a cortical flow towards the region with a denser actomyosin network (= the anterior cap). If the cortical symmetry is not broken for some reason, it needs to be broken to cause the cortical flow. In theory, the target of symmetry breakage can be any component of the contractile actomyosin network.</p><p>The authors observed attenuated ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in the embryos depleted of SPD-5 (Figure 2C), PAR-3 (Figure 2D), PAR-2 (Figure 2 Supplement 1), NMY-2 (Figure 2 Supplement 1), and AIR-1 (Figure 4A, Figure 4 Supplement 2). In all these cases, the cortical ECT-2 at NEB was found more symmetric (A:P ratio at NEB =1.3, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.1, respectively) than the normal embryos (1.4~1.6). In almost all the cases where ECT-2 was asymmetric at NEB (or metaphase), with Galpha(RNAi) as an exception, ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis was normal or enhanced (Tubulin(RNAi)+nocodazole, <italic>nop-1</italic>(it142), zyg-9(b244), dhc-1(RNAi), tpxl-1(RNAi), tpxl-1(RNAi);zyg-9(b244), and saps<sup>-1</sup>(RNAi)). There is a simple and strong correlation between the ECT-2 asymmetry upon mitotic entry and the ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis.</p><p>The authors challenge the roles of astral microtubules and dynein in the polar relaxation during cytokinesis based on the observations of the cortical flow in the embryos in which microtubules and spindles are drastically messed up (Tubulin(RNAi)+nocodazole, zyg-9(b244), dhc-1(RNAi)). However, starting with the asymmetric actomyosin network that was successfully established after the fertilization, the anterior-directed cortical flow should occur spontaneously upon reactivation of the contractility following the anaphase onset even without any additional cue. The ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in these embryos can just be reflecting the fact that these treatments didn't completely disrupt the post-fertilization cortical polarity. Indeed, the ECT-2 asymmetry at the mitotic entry in embryos in Tub(RNAi)+noc and dhc-1(RNAi) embryos was more intense than in the normal embryos (A:P ratio at NEB = 1.9 and 1.8, respectively).</p><p>The role of switching of the cortical flow from the P-to-A alone mode to the bidirectional mode in cytokinetic furrow formation has been reported in many papers (PMID: 27719759, 29963981, 32497213, etc.). In this sense, the influence of the anterior centrosome/aster on the anterior cortex is crucial for the spatial control of cytokinesis. This must be a rationale for Mangal 2018 (PMID:29311228) to focus on the role of TPXL-1 in the clearing of anillin from the anterior cortex. Acceleration of furrow formation in correlation with the anterior shift of the anterior centrosome/aster has also been reported (PMID: 32497213). No such test has been performed for ECT-2 localization in this manuscript.</p><p>(Phosphorylation of ECT-2 by AIR-1)</p><p>Although the authors claim the role of centrosomes based on the spatial correlation, no direct evidence has been provided for the positive role of centrosomes in these embryos. For example, if the ECT-2 asymmetry during anaphase is regulated by centrosomes, disruption of the centrosomes after anaphase onset should disrupt the cortical ECT-2 asymmetry, which is turning over in seconds. In this sense, treatment with MLN8237 (Figure 4-Supplement 1) at metaphase is highly interesting. A caveat here is that MLN8237 is not really specific to Aurora A. It also inhibits Aurora B-INCENP at Ki = 27 nM (just 5~27-fold larger than the Ki for Aurora A) (de Groot et al. 2015). The concentration of MLN8237 used (20 uM) is 700x higher than the Ki for Aurora B-INCENP. The phenotype might be due to the inhibition of Aurora B. Indeed, the ECT-2 signal at the midzone, which is likely to depend on centralspindlin and Aurora B, was lost by the MLN8237 treatment. A mild delay in the removal of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex might have been caused by the inhibition of Aurora B/AIR-2 in addition to or instead of AIR-1.</p><p>Point mutations at the phosphorylation sites on ECT-2 are expected to compensate for the above issue of specificity and strengthen the author's theory of direct regulation of ECT-2 by AIR-1. However, as the authors admit in the &quot;Limitations of this study&quot; section, evidence for the in vivo phosphorylation of the putative sites is missing. In addition, it has not been tested whether AIR-1 can phosphorylate these sites. The Glotzer group has revealed key phospho-regulatory mechanisms in cytokinesis (PMID: 15282614, 15854913, 17488623, 19468300). In these works, they showed both the in vivo phosphorylation of the putative phospho-acceptor sites and the in vitro phosphorylation by a protein kinase as well as the in vivo phenotypes of the point mutants of the phosphorylation sites. Currently, what we can conclude from the data in Figures 5 and 6B is that some mutations in a loop in the ECT-2 PH domain mildly affect the cortical association of ECT-2. The gap between this and the phosphorylation of these sites by AIR-1 is huge.</p><p>Figure 6 tests AIR-1 depletion in <italic>nop-1</italic>(it142) mutant embryos (A) and the phenotype of the endogenous T634E mutation of ect-2 (B). Is 'Figure 6. AIR-1 is involved in central-spindle-dependent furrowing' (page 42) or 'AIR-1 affects centralspindlin-dependent furrowing' (page 56) an appropriate title for this figure? The dependency on centralspindlin or the central spindle has not been directly tested. Although synthetic defects in <italic>NOP-1</italic> and centralspindlin suppress furrow formation, this doesn't necessarily mean that all the residual cortical activity in <italic>nop-1</italic>(it142) embryos relies on centralspindlin or the central spindle. In <italic>nop-1</italic>(it142) embryos, the NMY-2 cortical accumulation is globally weakened in comparison with the wild-type embryos. Additional depletion of AIR-1 might promote furrowing by facilitating the cortical recruitment of ECT-2 or prevent cytokinesis by suppressing the aster/centrosome-dependent pathway, which may or may not be dependent on centralspindlin. By the way, how does ECT-2 behave in these embryos?</p><p>Recommendation for authors:</p><p>The feedback loop from myosin to the biochemically upstream regulator RhoGEF is highly intriguing. Focusing on the mechanisms for this phenomenon might be more fruitful than spending time trying to obtain evidence for the phosphorylation on the sites that are not conserved during evolution and only weakly match with the consensus for the Aurora phosphorylation.</p><p>(page 17) &quot;As during polarization, basal myosin levels appear to suffice, as ECT-2 asymmetry still increases during anaphase when both <italic>NOP-1</italic> and CYK-4 are inactivated, indicating that bulk, cortical ECT-2 has a low level of RhoGEF activity.&quot; Difficult to understand the logical structure due to repeated &quot;as&quot;.</p><p>Other points</p><p>(page 3) &quot;Despite progress in our understanding of cytokinesis, gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanism by which asters spatially regulate RhoA activation.&quot; This is correct.

The point of regulation of the cortical contraction could be anywhere in the loop (RhoGEF, RhoGAP, Rho, formin, Rho-kinase, myosin phosphatase, myosin-II, actin, actin-bundling proteins, …).</p><p>(page 25 method of measuring Boundary Length) &quot;ECT-2:mNG accumulation across all positions along the perimeter of the embryo was fitted to a regression model by GAM (Prediction Accumulation) in R Studio.&quot; It is not clear what the 'regression model' was and what the &quot;GAM (Prediction Accumulation) in R Studio&quot;.

General Statements</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and helpful comments. In general, the reviews were highly positive, although their reviews indicated parts of the manuscript that needed further clarification. We have made extensive changes that improve the clarity and rigor of this submission. We have performed several additional experiments which have extended our analysis in several ways detailed below. None of the conclusions have changed.</p><p>The following is a list of eight major changes implemented during the revisions. Point-by-point responses to the reviewers comments follow on subsequent pages.</p><p>1. The reviews made clear that we needed to more explicitly discuss the AIR-1 depletion phenotype. This phenotype is complex, it does not result in a complete loss of asymmetry, unlike, for example, depletion of the centrosome component SPD-5. This is because, in AIR-1 depleted embryos, a PAR-2 and cortical flow-dependent pathway induces PAR-2 accumulation at both anterior and posterior poles that induces flows from each pole to the lateral region (Reich 2019, Kapoor 2019, Zhao 2019, Klinkert 2019; PMIDs 31155349, 31636075, 30861375, 30801250). These flows also modulate ECT-2 localization. To clarify this point which came up in multiple reviews, we now include an explanation of the complexity of the AIR-1 phenotype and we present an analysis of ECT-2 localization in embryos depleted of both AIR-1 and PAR-2.</p><p>2. In addition to the 95% confidence intervals that were present on our graphs, we now include indications of the results of statistical tests of significance to the results of different treatments.</p><p>3. We have revised the analysis ECT-2 accumulation in two ways. First, in the previous draft, we assessed the anterior accumulation over the anterior 40% and the posterior 15% of the embryo. We have revised this analysis comparing the anterior and posterior 20% of the cortex, respectively. This is simpler and more logical in contexts where embryos are symmetric. In addition, we altered the measurements of the length of the posterior boundary. Previously we used a common threshold value, below which we counted pixels to assess boundary length. During the revisions, we noticed that this value was not appropriate for our mutant transgenes which accumulated to higher levels. Therefore, we revised our analysis pipeline such that, for each embryo, we measure the average intensity of the cortex in the anterior 60% of the embryo. We set a threshold of 0.85* this average anterior intensity value. As before, cortical positions below this threshold contribute to the boundary length. This is a more robust and simpler means of evaluating the size of the posterior domain. Neither of these changes affect any of our conclusions, but they are simpler and more rigorous.</p><p>4. Most of our figures include quantification of the degree of ECT-2 asymmetry as well as the average anterior and posterior accumulation of ECT-2 as a function of time. While the images show the intensity profiles across the embryo, previously, we did not explicitly show a quantification of the average intensity of ECT-2 as a function of position along the embryo. A new graph, Figure 2Bv, shows this for control embryos and embryos in which tubulin is depleted and depolymerized. This shows that the MT depolymerization results in lower accumulation at the posterior of the embryo and higher accumulation at the anterior.</p><p>5. We provide documentary and quantitative evidence that ZYG-9 depletion induces potent cortical flows (Figure 3c and Figure 3, supplement 3), further bolstering the central role of cortical flows in inducing ECT-2 asymmetry.</p><p>6. As requested by reviewer 2 (R2b), we have included the analysis of ECT-2 distribution in Gα depleted embryos. As expected due to the lack of spindle elongation, the displacement of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex is greatly attenuated.</p><p>7. As requested by reviewer 2 (R2d), we now show that ECT-2C fragments accumulate on the cortex in embryos depleted of ECT-2.</p><p>8. One other important point raised by several reviewers concerns the behavior of the ECT-2 T634E allele. This allele, due to the substitution of a phosphomimetic residue, accumulates on the cortex at about 50% the level of the wild-type version. To investigate the possibility that this quantitative difference was the cause of the phenotype, we depleted both the wildtype and mutant ECT-2 constructs by RNAi (these are the sole sources of ECT-2 in the animals). First, we find that wild-type ECT-2 can be depleted to 20% of wild type levels with only a 13% rate of cytokinesis failure (when T634E is depleted to 20%, embryos fail more than 50% of the time). Thus the two-fold reduction in cortical ECT-2 seen in T634E not likely highly significant (ECT-2 is not haploinsufficient). In addition, embryos with ECT-2 T634E initiate ingression in a timely manner, but the furrows ingress more slowly than wildtype. In contrast, depletion of ECT-2 to 20% results in a delay in furrow initiation, but once these furrows form, they ingress at rates similar rates to wild-type. Thus, the T634E variant exhibits a behavior that is quite distinct from that resulting from a (strong) reduction in the levels of wild-type ECT-2.</p><p>2. Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary</p><p>R1a In this study the authors addressed how Ect2 localization is controlled during polarization and cytokinesis in the one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. Ect2 is a central regulator of cortical contractility and its spatial and temporal regulation is of uttermost importance. After fertilization, the centrosome induces removal of Ect2 from the posterior plasma membrane. During cytokinesis Ect2 activity is expected to be high at the cell equator and low at the cell poles. Similarly to polarization, the centrosome provides an inhibitory signal during cytokinesis that clears contractile ring components from the cell poles. Whether and how the centrosomes regulate Ect2 localization is not know and investigated in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an accurate summary of the goals of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1b The authors start by filming endogenously-tagged Ect2 and find that Ect2 localizes asymmetrically, with high anterior and low posterior membrane levels during polarization and cytokinesis. They reveal that the centrosome together with myosin-dependent flows results in asymmetric Ect2 localization. Previous studies had suggested that Air1, clears Ect2 from the posterior during polarization and the authors expand those finding by showing that Air1 function is also required to displace Ect2 from the posterior membrane during cytokinesis.</p><p>To elucidate if Ect2 displacement is induced by phosphorylation of Ect2 by Air1, the authors investigate the localization of a C-terminal Ect2 fragment containing the membrane binding PH domain. When the predicted Air1 phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanine, the Ect2 fragment still localizes asymmetrically but exhibits increased membrane accumulation.</p><p>Finally, they investigate the functional role of Air-1 during furrow ingression. They demonstrate that embryos deficient of Air1 and NOP1 have impaired furrow ingression. Lastly, the authors sought to confirm that there is a direct effect of Air1 on Ect2 function by generating a phosphomimetic point mutation of Ect2 using Crispr. They find that the membrane localization of phosphomimetic Ect2 is reduced and consequently furrow ingression is impaired.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an accurate summary of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>R1c It is not convincing that the six putative phosphorylation sites are targeted by the Air1. If Air1 phosphorylation displaces Ect2 from the membrane, a reduction in Ant/Post Ect2 ratio is expected in the phosphodeficient mutants, like after air1 RNAi. However this is not observed for cytokinesis or polarization (Figure 5D(i); E). This suggests that phosphorylation of those sites is not essential for the asymmetric Ect2 localization.</p></disp-quote><p>In otherwise wild-type embryos, phosphorylation of these sites is not required for asymmetric ECT-2 localization. Non-phosphorylatable ECT-2 variants exhibit asymmetric localization because these proteins relocalize due to myosin-directed flows. To test the role of phosphorylation, we examine the distribution of ECT-2 and ECT-2C fragments in myosin-depleted embryos in which the flows are blocked, under these conditions, transient local depletion is observed with the phosphorylatable variants, Figure 5E.</p><p>While AIR-1 promotes normal polarity establishment, as shown in several recent papers, cortical changes nevertheless occur in the absence of AIR-1. Specifically, a parallel PAR-2 dependent pathway induces weaker flows from both poles toward the equator. To further substantiate the effect of PAR-2 accumulation on ECT-2 accumulation in AIR-1 depleted embryos, we assayed ECT-2 accumulation in air-1(RNAi); par-2(RNAi) embryos (Figure 4, supplement 2). These results show that ECT-2 is nearly symmetric in these double depleted embryos. In addition we have edited the text to describe the unusual bi-polar PAR-2 accumulation that occurs in AIR-1 depleted embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1d The authors aim to demonstrate that phosphorylation of the identified sites is important for cytokinesis. For this they investigate contractile ring ingression in the phosphomimetic point mutation. Since ring ingression is slower and fails in nop1 mutant they authors conclude that this demonstrates a functional importance of this site. I am not surprised that embryos ingress slower in this mutant since Ect2 localization to the membrane is reduced. This however does not show that this phosphorylation site is the target of the centrosome signal. Importantly, authors would need to demonstrate that Rho signaling and thus Ect2 activity, is increased at the poles, when phosphodeficient Ect2 is the only Ect2 in the embryo.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that a phosphomimetic residue at this site leads to reduced membrane localization is highly relevant, as we suggest that phosphorylation of this site contributes to the mechanism by which AIR-1 generates asymmetric ECT-2. Given the role of AIR-1 in regulating polarity, a version of ECT-2 that can not be phosphorylated would be predicted to be dominant lethal, necessitating a conditional expression strategy which does not currently exist in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo system (indeed we were unable to recover a T-&gt; A allele at this site, despite extensive efforts). To avoid this issue, we used a viable, fertile, hypomorphic allele that is predicted to be less responsive to AIR-1 activity. The goal of this experiment was to evaluate whether the putative AIR-1 sites affect not only the <italic>NOP-1</italic> pathway for furrow ingression, but also impact furrowing that is centralspindlin-dependent.</p><p>To complement this finding have performed experiments in which ECT-2 was partially depleted We used RNAi to partially deplete ECT-2 and ECT-2 T634E and measured the total embryo fluorescence of each ECT-2 variant and the kinetics of furrow ingression. Partial depletion of wt ECT-2, to ~ 20% of control levels leads to delay in furrow formation and all but 2/18 (11%) of embryos complete cell division. In contrast, a similar depletion of ECT-2T634E depletion results in a failure of furrow ingression in ~52 % of embryos. Furthermore, while ECT-2T634E embryos initiate furrowing with normal kinetics, they exhibit a slower rate of furrow ingression, in contrast, partial depletion of WT ECT-2 results in a delay in furrow initiation, but once initiated, the rate of furrow ingression is not significantly affected. These results demonstrate that ECT-2T634E behavior can not simply be explained by a modest reduction in membrane binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1e The authors use the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237: It was shown prior (De Groot et al., 2015) that this inhibitor is not highly specific for Aurora A, and that it also inhibits Aurora B. Thus experiments need to be repeated with MK5108 or MK8745. They should also be conducted during polarization. Why does Aurora A inhibition not abolish asymmetry? That would be expected?</p></disp-quote><p>The role of AIR-1 in symmetry breaking during polarization is previously published, including with chemical inhibitors (Reich 2019, Kapoor 2019, Zhao 2019, Klinkert 2019, PMID 31155349, 31636075, 30861375, 30801250). ECT-2 localization depends on both the spatial regulation of AIR-1 activity and the distribution of cortical factors that contribute to ECT-2 cortical association, as a result of cortical flows. During acute, chemical perturbation of AIR-1 it is likely that these factors, which were polarized prior to drug treatment, remain polarized, allowing the residual cortical ECT-2 to remain asymmetric. The reviewer is correct about the specificity of MLN8237 and we do not rely on it alone to demonstrate the role of AIR-1. Rather this experiment is a complement to our AIR-1 depletion studies, which are sufficient to establish specificity. We present this experiment merely to show that AIR-1 acutely regulates ECT-2 during cytokinesis in embryos that were entirely unperturbed during polarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1f There is no statistical analysis of the results in the entire study. For all claims stating a change in Ant/Post Ect2 ratio or Ect2 membrane localization selected time points should be statistically compared: for example the main point of Figure 1 is that Ect2 becomes more asymmetric during anaphase. Thus a statistical analysis of the Ect2 ratio at anaphase onset (t=0s) and eg. t=90 s after anaphase onset should be performed; or Figure 3A nop-1 mutant Ant/Post Ect2 ratio during polarization: again statistical analysis of control and nop-1 mutant embryos is needed at a particular time point.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the graphs were presented with the mean of ~10 embryos per condition and included the 95% confidence intervals. In the revised manuscript, we have included tests of statistical significance, at each time point. While non-overlapping confidence intervals generally suggest statistical significance, we include these analyses on the graphs as it can be difficult to assess statistical significance when the confidence intervals overlap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1g The aim of Figure 2B is to demonstrate that Ect2 localization is independent of microtubules, however they still observe some microtubules with the Cherry-tubulin marker and those are even very close to the membrane and therefore could very well influence Ect2 on the membrane. Therefore I am not convinced that this experiment rules out that microtubules have no role in regulating Ect2 localization.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not exclude that microtubules play a contributing role in ECT-2 phosphoregulation, but rather we conclude that the primary cue is the centrosome. Indeed, microtubules can play an important role in controlling spindle positioning which affects the proximity of the centrosome to the cortex.</p><p>The manuscript states, “Despite significant depletion of tubulin and near complete depolymerization of microtubules (Figure 2B, insets), we observed strong displacement of ECT-2 from a broad region of the posterior cortex during anaphase (Figure 2B).” Thus, despite dramatic reductions in microtubules, not only does ECT-2 become polarized, it becomes hyperpolarized. In contrast, were microtubules directly involved in ECT-2 displacement, one would expect a reduction in polarization as a result microtubule depolymerization. Conversely, though SPD-5 depleted embryos contain far more microtubules than embryos in which microtubule assembly is suppressed, ECT-2 is not polarized in SPD-5 depleted embryos. Thus in the manuscript, we conclude, “Collectively, these studies suggest that ECT-2 asymmetry during anaphase is centrosome-directed.” This conclusion is well supported by the results shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1h Throughout the paper the authors should tone down their statement that Air1 breaks symmetry by phosphorylating Ect2, since phosphorylation of Ect2 by Air2 is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and will make the necessary edits to the text. Indeed, this is the reason why we had included the final section in our original draft, “Limitations of this study” which makes this point explicitly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1i I understand that the establishment of Ect2 asymmetry is important for polarization. However, how does asymmetric Ect2 localization result in more active Ect2 at the cell equator, which is required for the formation of the active RhoA zone? Would we not expect an accumulation of Ect2 at the cell equator, or if that is not the case more active Ect2 at the equator versus the poles?</p></disp-quote><p>The pseudocleavage furrow forms as a result of the anterior enrichment of active RHO-1 and its downstream effectors. There is no evidence for a local accumulation of active RHO-1 specifically at the site of the pseudocleavage furrow. Rather, this furrow forms at the boundary between the portion of the embryo where RHO-1 is active and the posterior of the embryo where RHO-1 is far less active (Figure 1 Supplement 2). We suggest that aster-directed furrowing during cytokinesis likewise results from asymmetric accumulation of the same components, without them necessarily being specifically enriched solely at the furrow.</p><p>While cytokinesis generally involves an equatorial contractile ring, furrow formation can be driven by an asymmetric – i.e. non-equatorial – accumulation of actomyosin. This behavior is exemplified during pseudocleavage during which the entire anterior cortex is enriched for actomyosin and the posterior is depleted of myosin (Figure 1 Supplement 2). Several published studies provide evidence that the asymmetric pattern of myosin accumulation contributes to cytokinesis (PMID 22918944, 17669650).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>R1j Can the authors explain why the quantification of Ant/Post Ect2 ratio in control embryos differs in different figures? For example: in Figure 1D (i) a slight increase of Ect2 asymmetry ratio is seen at around 80 s after anaphase onset. In comparison, in Figure 2C (i) this increase is not obvious.

The main phenotype they observe is that Ect2 levels on the membrane increase (Figure 4 ii and iii). They go on testing the function of tpxl1 by depleting tpxl1 in the zyg9 mutant, where the centrosomes are close to the posterior cortex. Here they see no effect on Ect2 asymmetry. Based on that they conclude that tpxl1 has no role in this process. To me this finding is not surprising since the centrosome is close the cortex in zyg9 mutant embryos. Therefore sufficient amounts of active Air1 could reach the membrane and displace Ect2. Thus an amplification of the inhibitory signal by tpxl1 on astral microtubules might not be required. The authors need to mention this possibility and tone down their statment (also in the discussion) that tpxl1 is not required for this process.</p></disp-quote><p>In the text, we state, “Cortical ECT-2 accumulation is enhanced by TPXL-1 depletion, though the degree of ECT-2 asymmetry is unaffected (Figure 4B).… we observed robust depletion of ECT-2 at the posterior pole in zyg-9 embryos depleted of TPXL-1, but not AIR-1 (Figure 4C). We conclude that while AIR-1 is a major regulator of the asymmetric accumulation of ECT-2, the TPXL-1/AIR-1 complex does not play a central role in this process.” We consider this to be an accurate description of the results. In sum, we have found no evidence that TPXL-1 contributes to generating ECT-2 asymmetry, beyond its well established role in regulating spindle length and position. The are several other processes that are known to be AIR-1 dependent and TPXL-1 independent; these primarily involve the centrosome (Ozlu, PMID 16054030).

For these reasons we feel that our data makes a strong, albeit indirect, case that AIR-1 regulates ECT-2, even though we clearly acknowledge that we do not directly show that AIR-1 directly phosphorylates ECT-2. Direct proof would require the demonstration that AIR-1 phosphorylates ECT-2 in vivo.

We speculate that there are cell cycle regulated changes in ECT-2 accumulation, in addition to its regulation by AIR-1. For example, in figure 1, a strong reduction in both anterior and posterior cortical ECT-2 is evident beginning at approximately -350 sec, which may reflect the initial stages of Cdk1 activation. This may result from cell cycle regulated modulation of ECT-2, as there is evidence that mammalian ECT-2 is subject to a very potent inhibition membrane association by Cdk1 (PMID 22172673). Alternatively, there could be cell cycle modulation of the cortical factor that serves as the “co-anchor” of ECT-2. The ability of GBP-AIR-1 to induce GFP-ECT-2C dissociation also appears cell cycle regulated.</p><p>Consistent with a cell cycle regulated component, note that NEBD is delayed in AIR-1 depleted embryos (PMID 17669650, 17419991, 30861375).

During cytokinesis, ECT-2C does show a modest change in localization at the poles; the extent of the polar reduction is limited and the changes are symmetric as ECT-2 displacement causes spindles to be symmetrically positioned and limits their elongation during anaphase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2e.

The differential positioning of the actomyosin network in AIR-1 depleted embryos is likely responsible for the interesting difference that the reviewer points out. This section of the results states. “Nevertheless, these variants accumulated in an asymmetric manner.

The authors predict that the AIR-1 mediated phosphorylation delocalizes ECT-2 from the polar region of the cell cortex.

Given that centrosomal AIR-1 (as compared to astral AIR-1) is the primary pool of AIR-1 responsible for modulating cortical ECT-2 levels, it is a not clear that the GBPfused form of AIR-1 is as active as the centrosomal pool of AIR-1; indeed we suspect it is significantly less active, similar to the manner in which TPXL-1/AIR-1 appears less active towards ECT-2 than centrosomal AIR-1. Indeed as the reviewer suggests, were this pool of AIR-1 highly active, we would expect that its cortical recruitment would preclude embryo polarization, and this transgene would cause lethality when expressed with a GFP-tagged cortical protein. These concerns notwithstanding, we do observe a specific reduction in the anterior accumulation of ECT-2C as compared to ECT-2C3A, suggesting that this form of the kinase has some ability to modulate ECT-2C.</p><p>Co-expression of GFP-ECT-2C with GBP-mCherry-AIR-1 induces the centrosomal/astral accumulation of GFP-ECT-2C, which is highly visible in the figure and not seen in the absence of GBP-mCherry-AIR-1.

These redistributions indicate formation of the complex between GFPECT-2C and GBP-mCherry-AIR-1.

Interestingly, the authors showed that AIR-1 acts in the centralspindlin-directed furrowing pathway (Figure 6A). I wonder if the authors can combine NOP-1 depletion with TPXL-1 depletion? I guess this will further help to exclude the function of TPXL-1 in the centralspindlin-directed furrowing pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that our data indicates that AIR-1 acts on both the centralspindlin-independent furrowing (e.g. the anterior furrow in 4C), as well as centralspindlin-dependent furrowing (Figure 6). While the experiment the reviewer proposes appears simple in theory, the interpretation is potentially a bit more complex, due to the role of TPXL-1 in spindle elongation, which can affect centralspindl-indirected furrowing. That said, there are two published experiments and one experiment in the manuscript that indicate that centralspindlin dependent furrowing can occur in TPXL-1 depleted embryos. First, Lewellyn et al. showed that while tpxl-1(RNAi) embryos furrow, tpxl-1(RNAi); zen-4(RNAi) embryos do not, suggesting centralspindlin can function in the absence of TPXL-1. Second, the same paper shows that embryos doubly depleted of TPXL-1 and GPR-1/2 exhibit multiple furrows. Our previous work has shown that furrowing in Galpha-depleted embryos is centralspindlin dependent (Dechant and Glotzer). Furthermore, in the current manuscript we found that embryos depleted of both TPXL-1 and ZYG-9 form posterior furrows (8/8 embryos, 6/8 furrows were strong furrows) although the appearance of these furrows is delayed, presumably due to the reduction in spindle elongation due to TPXL-1-depletion. As described in the manuscript, these posterior furrows have been previously shown to be centralspindlin dependent and <italic>NOP-1</italic> independent.</p><p>In accordance with these results, and in direct response to the reviewer’s specific suggestion, we do observe furrowing in <italic>nop-1</italic>(it142); TPXL-1(RNAi) embryos (10/10 embryos furrow, 9/10 complete cytokinesis). Thus, all of the available results indicate that TPXL-1 is largely dispensable for centralspindlin dependent furrowing. However, the role of TPXL-1 in centralspindlin-dependent furrowing is not a focus of the manuscript, thus we do not favor including this result, as it distracts from the primary focus of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2i (f).

Furthermore, spindles in AIR-1 depleted embryos exhibit somewhat variable positioning. While we were unable to correlate these sources of variability with furrow formation, these results demonstrate that AIR-1 depletion impairs furrowing directed by centralspindlin, which was not entirely expected, given that (i) AIR-1 depletion potently suppresses <italic>NOP-1</italic> dependent flows of cortical myosin, as evidenced by the loss of an anterior furrow in AIR-1(RNAi); <italic>nop-1</italic>(it142) embryos and (ii) centralspindlin directed furrowing can occur in the posterior in ZYG-9 depleted embryos both in the presence or absence of AIR-1 (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2j (g). The authors report that phosphomimetic mutation at the phospho-acceptor residue in ECT-2 impacts its cortical accumulation. This strain, together with NOP-1 depletion, affects furrow ingression. One explanation for this phenotype is that phosphomimetic mutant weakly accumulates at the membrane. However, one interesting observation is that ECT-2T634E enriches at the central spindle (Figure 6B, panel 120 sec), which somehow I could not find in the text. Could this additional localization of ECT2 at the central spindle contribute to the cytokinesis defects that the authors have observed? The microscopy images the authors have included show that ECT-2T634E significantly localizes at the equator at the time of furrow initiation. Can the authors add the localization of ECT2 wildtype and ECT-2T634E in NOP-1 depleted conditions where they see an apparent impact on the cytokinesis? Similarly, if the authors include the localization of NMY-2 in these conditions-it will further add more weightage to the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We regularly detect trace amounts of ECT-2 on the central spindle and this is slightly enhanced at in the ECT-2T634E mutant.

Many biological systems, such as the body axes establishment and cell divisions in embryos, undergo symmetry breaking to pattern cellular interior design. <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote has been a classic model system to study the molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking. Previous studies demonstrated critical roles of centrosomes and microtubules in breaking symmetry in the actin cytoskeleton during anterior-posterior polarization and cytokinesis. It, however, remains elusive how centrosomes and/or microtubules regulate the assembly and contractility of the actin cytoskeleton. Recent reports identified Aurora-A AIR-1 as the key centrosomal kinase that suppresses the function of the actin cytoskeleton, but little is known about a substrate of the kinase during symmetry breaking events.</p><p>Longhini and Glotzer proposed in this manuscript that RhoGEF ECT-2 plays a critical role in symmetry breaking of the actin cytoskeleton under the control of AIR-1 kinase. Kapoor and Kotak (2019) previously proposed the same GEF as a downstream effector of centrosomes, but this work did not provide direct evidence for ECT-2 as the AIR-1 effector. This manuscript identified three putative phospho-acceptor sites in the PH domain of ECT-2 that render ECT-2 responsive to inhibition by AIR-1. Although this manuscript lacks direct in vivo and in vitro evidence for phosphorylation of ECT-2 by AIR-1 kinase, the above findings reasonably support a model where in AIR-1 promotes the local inhibition of ECT-2 on the cortex. Design of the experiments, the quality of images, and data analysis are reasonable, and the main text was written very well.

In a revised manuscript, I am not convinced with their interpretation of the phenotype of air-1(RNAi);par-2(RNAi) zygotes. Given that either single par-2(RNAi) or single air-1(RNAi) abolished the anterior-enriched distribution of ECT-2::mNG (Figure 4 supplement 2), this data simply indicates the indispensable roles of both PAR-2 and AIR-1 in ECT-2 asymmetry, but they cannot conclude that ECT-2 asymmetry in air-1(RNAi) condition is due to PAR-2-dependent weaker cortical flows. Indeed, the anterior/the posterior ratio of ECT-2::mNG in air-1(RNAi) zygotes shown in Figure 4 supplement 2 is very close to 1.0 throughout mitosis, which is quite different from that in Figure 4A. This discrepancy should be addressed in the final manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>These PAR-2 related experiments were not included in the first version of the manuscript, but they were added in response to the Review Commons referees. As is well documented in several papers (PMIDs 30801250, 30861375, 31636075, 31155349), AIR-1 depletion does not eliminate cortical reorganization, and PAR-2 accumulates, aberrantly, to the cortex in when AIR-1 is depleted. A reproducible accumulation of lateral ECT-2 is observed during mitosis in AIR-1 depleted embryos; which is associated with ectopic furrowing (see point 11, below). While this increase in ECT-2 is visible in the images, it is not surfaced by our standard quantification method which focuses on the anterior and posterior domains. Given this and the established interplay between AIR-1 and PAR-2, we felt it appropriate to include an analysis of ECT-2 localization in embryos deficient in both AIR-1 and PAR-2.</p><p>The referee states, “they cannot conclude that ECT-2 asymmetry in air-1(RNAi) condition is due to PAR-2-dependent weaker cortical flows.” We do not discuss PAR-2 in the context of cortical flows in the manuscript. The only sentences in the manuscript that explicitly discuss PAR-2 state ”Likewise, ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis is reduced in embryos depleted of PAR-2.” and “The residual asymmetry in ECT-2 accumulation in AIR-1 depleted embryos is further reduced by co-depletion of PAR-2.”</p><p>While there are differences in these datasets, we consider them minor; when the ratios are plotted together only 4/35 timepoints show any degree of statistically significant difference. The pattern of anterior accumulation is virtually identical in the two experiments, but the experiment in the supplemental figure shows a slightly stronger ECT-2 accumulation in the posterior. While the images were processed in the same manner, the two figures were generated with strains with distinct markers: while both figures contain the same ECT-2:mNG allele, in Figure 4A it is paired with with mCh:Tub while Figure 4 supp 2 is paired with NMY-2:mKate, as the two figures were addressing different aspects of the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors' response &quot;While cytokinesis generally involves an equatorial contractile ring, furrow formation can be driven by an asymmetric – i.e. non-equatorial – accumulation of actomyosin. This behavior is exemplified during pseudocleavage during which the entire anterior cortex is enriched for actomyosin and the posterior is depleted of myosin (Figure 1 Supplement 2). Several published studies provide evidence that the asymmetric pattern of myosin accumulation contributes to cytokinesis (PMID 22918944, 17669650).&quot;</p><p>The role of switching off the cortical flow from the P-to-A alone mode to the bidirectional mode in cytokinetic furrow formation has been reported in many papers (PMID: 27719759, 29963981, 32497213, etc.) as mentioned above. A simple unidirectional asymmetry is not sufficient in discussing the spatial regulation of cytokinesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that the context of our answer was apparently not sufficiently clear. The original referee asked “However, how does asymmetric Ect2 localization result in more active Ect2 at the cell equator, which is required for the formation of the active RhoA zone? Would we not expect an accumulation of Ect2 at the cell equator, or if that is not the case more active Ect2 at the equator versus the poles?”</p><p>Our initial response was narrowly targeted to this question: “while cytokinesis generally involves an equatorial contractile ring, furrow formation can be driven by an asymmetric – i.e. non-equatorial – accumulation of actomyosin.” Our response implies that while bidirectional mode is the norm, there are cases in which a unilateral mode is sufficient (see bolded words in the response). The pseudocleavage furrow is a prime example of this behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors' response &quot;However, as seen in e.g. ZYG-9 depleted embryos, ECT-2 is recruited to the posterior cortex in a centralspindlin-dependent manner&quot;. I don't understand the logic here. Has this been directly tested by, for example, depletion of ZEN-4 or CYK-4 in zyg-9(b244) mutant embryos? In Figure 3C (zyg-9(b244)), no particular enrichment of ECT-2 was observed at the posterior furrow, which is formed by centralspindlin.</p></disp-quote><p>The underlying logic is that the posteriorly positioned, bipolar spindle induces the cortical accumulation of centralspindlin on the adjacent cortex. This pool of centralspindlin apparently recruits ECT-2 from the cytoplasm, despite the strong inhibitory activity of AIR-1 in this region. We infer that this binding may reflect a distinct mode of ECT-2 accumulation, as it appears impervious to AIR-1 activity. Indeed, FRAP experiments indicate this pool of ECT-2 has a larger immobile fraction than the cortical pool of ECT-2 elsewhere in the embryo.</p><p>In figure 3D of Werner et al., 2007, we demonstrated that the posterior furrow that forms in embryos with posterior furrows requires centralspindlin. In that particular experiment, MEL-26 depletion was used to induce the spindle to assemble in the posterior. In subsequent unpublished work, we have found that the posterior furrow similarly requires centralspindlin when ZYG-9 depletion is used to reposition the spindle (both MEL-26 and ZYG-9 enhance spindle assembly, albeit via distinct molecular mechanisms).</p><p>Additionally, in Tse et al., 2012, we showed that the posterior furrow is largely independent of <italic>NOP-1</italic> and that embryos depleted of both <italic>NOP-1</italic> and CYK-4 fail to furrow altogether.</p><p>ECT-2 is readily detected on the posterior furrow once they ingress further than the time point shown in Figure 3C, as shown in Figure 3 Supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;In contrast, the Gomez-Cavasos paper (PMID 32619481) shows in figure S2 that the PH domain is required for cortical localization of ECT-2; this paper does not focus extensively on the cortical accumulation of ECT-2&quot;. I think Gomez-Cavasos should also be cited as these provide complementary information as to the role of the PH domain.</p></disp-quote><p>In this case, the focus of this section is which parts of ECT-2 are sufficient for membrane recruitment of ECT-2. That PH domains contribute to membrane accumulation of GEFs has been extensively documented (eg PMID 17007612 from 2006). For example, the PH and the C terminal regions of HsEct2 are required for its membrane accumulation (PMID 27926870). It would not be appropriate to cite Gomez-Cavasos, without citing these papers. The requirement for a PH domain in cortical association does not seem significant enough to warrant a summary of the literature, particularly since membrane binding is the canonical function of PH domains. The somewhat surprising result was that the PH domain was not sufficient, as previously shown by Chan and Nance, which is cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In addition to the above, please answer either by rewriting or with experiments the points raised by the eLife referee below.

In <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, both the post-fertilization polarity establishment and cytokinesis depend on this process, which is known to be under the control of Rho GTPase. In this manuscript, the authors studied the molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking, focusing on ECT-2 RhoGEF, the crucial upstream activator of Rho, and its regulation by AIR-1, Aurora A kinase. Although the roles of these molecules both in polarity establishment and cytokinesis have already been reported, it remains unclear whether and how AIR-1 might regulate the activity of ECT-2.</p><p>By a combination of genetic manipulation and high-quality quantitive microscopy, the authors compared various perturbations and concluded that centrosomes and the cortical flow driven by actomyosin network play roles in the asymmetric cortical localization of ECT-2 while astral microtubules and TPXL-1, a conserved Aurora A regulator that recruits AIR-1 to the astral microtubules, are not essential for the ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in contrary to the previous reports. Then, the authors tested the hypothesis that AIR-1 induces cortical asymmetry by directly phosphorylating ECT-2 and presented the in vivo phenotypes of the ECT-2 constructs with mutations at the putative phosphorylation sites, which were consistent with their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This referee does not mention that we unambiguously demonstrate that AIR-1 plays an important role in generating cortical asymmetry during cytokinesis. In particular, we show that the ability of centrosomes to inhibit cortical contractility during anaphase depends on AIR-1. Furthermore, we show that AIR-1 is specifically required to induce the displacement of ECT-2 from the cortex during both polarization and cytokinesis. We identify sites on ECT-2 that when mutated to non-phosphorylatable residues increase ECT-2 membrane accumulation one of which, which when mutated to a phosphomimetic residue is sufficient to reduce the cortical accumulation of ECT-2. Further we show that a non-phosphorylatable substitution of these sites impacts the response of ECT-2 C-terminal fragments to an AIR-1:GBP fusion protein. Finally, although AIR-1 clearly regulates the bulk flow of cortical myosin during anaphase, this pool of myosin is largely dependent on a non-essential protein called <italic>NOP-1</italic>. Given the evolutionary novelty of <italic>NOP-1</italic> we further showed that a putative AIR-1 phosphosite also regulates the ability of the conserved cytokinetic regulator centralspindlin to induce cytokinesis.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Depletion of MRCK-1 does not affect the distribution of cortical ECT-2 during anaphase.</title><p>MRCK-1 depletion was confirmed by observing the loss of the cortical cap of co-expressed NMY-2:mKate during metaphase.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83992-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(Influence of the cortical asymmetry at the mitotic entry)</p><p>There is a flaw in their interpretation of the results of various perturbations. Their model in Figure 7B cytokinesis depicts that NMY-2 is absent at the cell cortex during earlier stages of mitosis (pro~meta). This is not precise and misleading. In normal embryos, even after the pseudo-furrowing settles, NMY-2 doesn't disappear from the cell cortex and, importantly, is kept anteriorly enriched though at slightly lower intensity in smaller patches than in the earlier phase (eg. Tse et al. 2012 PMID:22918944, Figure 3). Actin filaments also remain more enriched in the anterior cortex than in the posterior cortex. This is a clear difference from the post-fertilization polarity establishment, in which uniform distribution of the actomyosin network is maintained until the entry of sperm breaks the symmetry.</p><p>During the early stages of mitosis, the cortical flow is suspended due to the inhibitory activity of CDK1. The onset of anaphase cancels this inhibition and triggers the contraction of the actomyosin network. If the symmetry of cortical actomyosin is already broken as in the normal embryos, even uniform activation of actomyosin throughout the cell will result in a cortical flow towards the region with a denser actomyosin network (= the anterior cap). If the cortical symmetry is not broken for some reason, it needs to be broken to cause the cortical flow. In theory, the target of symmetry breakage can be any component of the contractile actomyosin network.</p></disp-quote><p>While we dispute that there is a flaw in our interpretations, we do not dispute that NMY-2 does not disappear from the cortex during polarity maintenance, and have revised the model schematic in Figure 7B accordingly. However, our results indicate that this pool of myosin does not play a role in the organization of myosin upon anaphase onset and we have seen no evidence that this anterior cap is sufficient to direct anterior-directed cortical flows. As previously shown (PMID 21737681), polarized myosin clusters assemble normally during anaphase in MRCK-1 depleted embryos. MRCK-1 is known to be required for cortical myosin accumulation during the establishment phase (Figure 6, PMID 19923324).</p><p>Notably, the anterior cap of myosin during polarity maintenance (i.e. during mitosis) is qualitatively different from that during interphase. Myosin clusters during maintenance phase are far smaller and less clustered than those present during establishment phase or anaphase. Likewise the organization of actin filaments are quite different during these stages. During maintenance phase Arp-2/3 branched filaments predominate whereas a significant pool of unbranched Formin nucleated filaments assemble during establishment phase and anaphase. These distinct pools of myosin and actin appear to exhibit distinctly different abilities to induce contractions. To substantiate this assertion, we examined the asymmetry of ECT-2 distribution during cytokinesis in control and MRCK-1 depleted embryos. As indicated in the accompanying figure, MRCK-1 depletion has no significant impact on the distribution of ECT-2 during cytokinesis.</p><p>This result was predictable. As shown in Figure 2 Supplement 2, although Gα-depleted embryos enter anaphase with asymmetric ECT-2 (and there is no evidence to suggest that Gα-depletion perturbs the myosin cap during mitosis). Despite this preexisting asymmetry, as anaphase initiates, these embryos do not exhibit potent anterior-directed flows that lead to increasingly asymmetric ECT-2, rather ECT-2 becomes progressively more symmetric as anaphase proceeds. The progressive symmetrization of these embryos likely results from the symmetric position of the spindle and its reduced elongation during anaphase. These changes to spindle length and position result in the anterior and posterior centrosomes lying equidistant – and rather distal from the anterior and posterior cortices.</p><p>The referees comment “In theory, the target of symmetry breakage can be any component of the contractile actomyosin network” seems to suggest that symmetry breaking is a one time event and that the strength and duration of this symmetry breaking is immaterial. However, as the results of our study shows, dramatically exemplified in Figure 3C and summarized in Figure 7A, the nature of the symmetry breaking events during anaphase have dramatically different consequences on cortical ECT-2 and myosin depending upon the position of centrosomes relative to the cortex. Indeed, figure 2A provides an example of how cortical ECT-2 changes acutely in response to the position of the posterior aster as the spindle rocks. To emphasize this point, we added this sentence to the section of the discussion that focuses on cortical flows, “Further, we speculate that centrosomal AIR-1 not only breaks symmetry, but that this regulation of ECT-2 by centrosomal AIR-1 continues throughout anaphase.”</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Summary figure comparing the average degree of ECT-2 asymmetry at NEBD/Anaphase Onset vs the maximal asymmetry of ECT-2 during anaphase.</title><p>These values are not correlated.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83992-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observed attenuated ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in the embryos depleted of SPD-5 (Figure 2C), PAR-3 (Figure 2D), PAR-2 (Figure 2 Supplement 1), NMY-2 (Figure 2 Supplement 1), and AIR-1 (Figure 4A, Figure 4 Supplement 2). In all these cases, the cortical ECT-2 at NEB was found more symmetric (A:P ratio at NEB =1.3, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.1, respectively) than the normal embryos (1.4~1.6). In almost all the cases where ECT-2 was asymmetric at NEB (or metaphase), with Galpha(RNAi) as an exception, ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis was normal or enhanced (Tubulin(RNAi)+nocodazole, nop-1(it142), zyg-9(b244), dhc-1(RNAi), tpxl-1(RNAi), tpxl-1(RNAi);zyg-9(b244), and saps<sup>-1</sup>(RNAi)). There is a simple and strong correlation between the ECT-2 asymmetry upon mitotic entry and the ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Partial overlap in the requirements for polarization and asymmetric cytokinesis is expected, as these processes rely on a shared machinery. Additionally the degree of asymmetric accumulation of ECT-2 during anaphase depends on the asymmetric positioning of centrosomes, which depend on embryo polarization. In addition, there are exceptions to the correlation the referee cites, and they are highly informative. Gα – depleted embryos polarize normally and enter anaphase with control levels of ECT-2 asymmetry but, upon anaphase onset the degree of the asymmetry of ECT-2 declines. Conversely, the extent of ECT-2 asymmetry prior to anaphase onset in ZYG-9 depleted embryos is similar to wild-type yet during anaphase, ZYG-9-depleted embryos exhibit radically more highly asymmetric ECT-2 during anaphase than control embryos. Contrary to the assertion of the referee, ECT-2 asymmetry during mitosis and its asymmetry during cytokinesis are not well correlated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors challenge the roles of astral microtubules and dynein in the polar relaxation during cytokinesis based on the observations of the cortical flow in the embryos in which microtubules and spindles are drastically messed up (Tubulin(RNAi)+nocodazole, zyg-9(b244), dhc-1(RNAi)). However, starting with the asymmetric actomyosin network that was successfully established after the fertilization, the anterior-directed cortical flow should occur spontaneously upon reactivation of the contractility following the anaphase onset even without any additional cue. The ECT-2 asymmetry during cytokinesis in these embryos can just be reflecting the fact that these treatments didn't completely disrupt the post-fertilization cortical polarity. Indeed, the ECT-2 asymmetry at the mitotic entry in embryos in Tub(RNAi)+noc and dhc-1(RNAi) embryos was more intense than in the normal embryos (A:P ratio at NEB = 1.9 and 1.8, respectively).</p></disp-quote><p>See the responses to points 6 and 8 above. Furthermore, “drastically messed up” it is not an accurate description of the spindles in ZYG-9 depleted embryos. These spindles exhibit normal bipolarity and morphology and they segregate chromosomes normally. These spindles are small and, due to a combination of the position of sperm entry and the bias in cortical forces, they assemble close to the posterior cortex.</p><p>Were dynein (or microtubules) required for polar relaxation during anaphase, it is reasonable to expect that dynein depletion (or MT disassembly) would result in a reduction in polar relaxation during anaphase, whereas the results show that dynein depletion results in a dramatic increase in polar relaxation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of switching of the cortical flow from the P-to-A alone mode to the bidirectional mode in cytokinetic furrow formation has been reported in many papers (PMID: 27719759, 29963981, 32497213, etc.). In this sense, the influence of the anterior centrosome/aster on the anterior cortex is crucial for the spatial control of cytokinesis. This must be a rationale for Mangal 2018 (PMID:29311228) to focus on the role of TPXL-1 in the clearing of anillin from the anterior cortex. Acceleration of furrow formation in correlation with the anterior shift of the anterior centrosome/aster has also been reported (PMID: 32497213). No such test has been performed for ECT-2 localization in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur that the anterior centrosome regulates cortical behavior, including controlling ECT-2 localization. However, because the posterior centrosome is closer to the posterior cortex than their anterior counterparts, the equatorial directed myosin-dependent cortical flows are more pronounced in the posterior domain than in the anterior domain (e.g. Figure 3C). Indeed, the dramatic differences in ECT-2 and NMY-2 localization in ZYG-9 depleted embryos (Figure 3C) is likely to result from the combination of the close proximity of both centrosomes to the posterior cortex and the absence of the anterior centrosome from the anterior domain.</p><p>It is important, furthermore, to not only consider the flows of myosin foci that appear, but also the rate at which such foci assemble in the anterior and posterior domains. Two domains can exhibit similar rate of flows, but if the foci are smaller and less numerous in one domain than the other, the net accumulation of myosin in the two domains can differ dramatically.</p><p>Importantly, this manuscript focuses on the mechanisms that regulate both the assembly of myosin foci downstream of RHO-1 activation and the subsequent flows (centrosomal AIR-1 inhibiting ECT-2 accumulation), the finding that ECT-2 localization depends upon these flows, and the proposal that asymmetric ECT-2 could function to sustain these flows.

For example, if the ECT-2 asymmetry during anaphase is regulated by centrosomes, disruption of the centrosomes after anaphase onset should disrupt the cortical ECT-2 asymmetry, which is turning over in seconds. In this sense, treatment with MLN8237 (Figure 4-Supplement 1) at metaphase is highly interesting. A caveat here is that MLN8237 is not really specific to Aurora A. It also inhibits Aurora B-INCENP at Ki = 27 nM (just 5~27-fold larger than the Ki for Aurora A) (de Groot et al. 2015). The concentration of MLN8237 used (20 uM) is 700x higher than the Ki for Aurora B-INCENP. The phenotype might be due to the inhibition of Aurora B. Indeed, the ECT-2 signal at the midzone, which is likely to depend on centralspindlin and Aurora B, was lost by the MLN8237 treatment. A mild delay in the removal of ECT-2 from the posterior cortex might have been caused by the inhibition of Aurora B/AIR-2 in addition to or instead of AIR-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrate that ECT-2 polarization during cytokinesis depends upon the core centrosomal component SPD-5, though it does not require the astral MTs that emanate from centrosomes.</p><p>We have shown the involvement of AIR-1 in ECT-2 regulation by both depletion of AIR-1 and its regulator SAPS<sup>-1</sup> and a gain of function approach using GBP-AIR-1.</p><p>The dramatic difference in ECT-2 localization in embryos deficient in ZYG-9 and AIR-1 as compared to embryos deficient in ZYG-9 and TPXL-1 further supports models in which the centrosomal, I.e. not the astral, pool of AIR-1 is relevant (TPXL-1 is required for AIR-1 to associate with astral microtubules).</p><p>The experiments with MLN8237 were merely included to complement the AIR-1 depletion studies and to show that acute inhibition can impact ECT-2 accumulation in otherwise unperturbed embryos.

However, as the authors admit in the &quot;Limitations of this study&quot; section, evidence for the in vivo phosphorylation of the putative sites is missing. In addition, it has not been tested whether AIR-1 can phosphorylate these sites. The Glotzer group has revealed key phospho-regulatory mechanisms in cytokinesis (PMID: 15282614, 15854913, 17488623, 19468300). In these works, they showed both the in vivo phosphorylation of the putative phospho-acceptor sites and the in vitro phosphorylation by a protein kinase as well as the in vivo phenotypes of the point mutants of the phosphorylation sites. Currently, what we can conclude from the data in Figures 5 and 6B is that some mutations in a loop in the ECT-2 PH domain mildly affect the cortical association of ECT-2.

Furthermore, these residues affect the response of an GFP-ECT-2 fusion protein to a GBP-AIR-1 fusion protein). While we would very much like to study the dynamic phosphorylation of ECT-2 in vivo (it is likely highly regulated in space and time) at this moment there are no tools available suitable to do so. The majority of the in vivo phosphorylation studies the referee mentions were performed in bulk lysates from human cells which can be synchronized; this is not possible with <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. Further, in the singular case where in vivo phosphorylation was shown in nematode embryos, a phospho-specific antibody was used to label a localized pool of ZEN-4; in this case, ECT-2 phosphorylation by AIR-1 triggers its delocalization. Demonstration of ECT-2 phosphorylation by AIR-1 in vitro would be nice, but neither a positive result nor a negative result would be particularly informative as kinases can be promiscuous in vitro and we can not rule out a requirement for other factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 tests AIR-1 depletion in nop-1(it142) mutant embryos (A) and the phenotype of the endogenous T634E mutation of ect-2 (B). Is 'Figure 6. AIR-1 is involved in central-spindle-dependent furrowing' (page 42) or 'AIR-1 affects centralspindlin-dependent furrowing' (page 56) an appropriate title for this figure? The dependency on centralspindlin or the central spindle has not been directly tested. Although synthetic defects in NOP-1 and centralspindlin suppress furrow formation, this doesn't necessarily mean that all the residual cortical activity in nop-1(it142) embryos relies on centralspindlin or the central spindle. In nop-1(it142) embryos, the NMY-2 cortical accumulation is globally weakened in comparison with the wild-type embryos. Additional depletion of AIR-1 might promote furrowing by facilitating the cortical recruitment of ECT-2 or prevent cytokinesis by suppressing the aster/centrosome-dependent pathway, which may or may not be dependent on centralspindlin. By the way, how does ECT-2 behave in these embryos?</p></disp-quote><p>Furrow formation in wild-type embryos involves both <italic>NOP-1</italic> and centralspindlin. Whereas depletion of <italic>NOP-1</italic> has a dramatic effect on global cortical myosin, it has a limited effect on formation of the contractile ring, which ingresses to completion with near normal kinetics. Conversely, embryos deficient in centralspindlin subunits (CYK-4 or ZEN-4) form slowly ingressing furrows that only partially ingress. Embryos deficient in both <italic>NOP-1</italic> and CYK-4 fail to form furrows. Thus, these two genes function in parallel pathways upstream of ECT-2. These findings are well established in the literature and also shown in figure 3B (PMID 22918944, 26252513, 32619481).</p><p>That said, as the referee indicates, depletion of AIR-1 increases cortical ECT-2 and induces a modest degree of hyper-contractility. For example, as shown in Figure 4A, AIR-1 depleted one-cell embryos form multiple furrows during anaphase. Formally, AIR-1 depletion could result in bypass suppression in embryos deficient in either CYK-4 and/or <italic>NOP-1</italic>. However, this hypercontractility depends upon <italic>NOP-1</italic> during pseudocleavage (Figure 5E PMID 31636075) and during cytokinesis as embryos deficient in both AIR-1 and <italic>NOP-1</italic> form a single furrow which is positioned at approximate midplane of the spindle (Figure 6A), suggesting it is centralspindlin directed. Indeed, it was precisely because AIR-1 depletion primarily enhances <italic>NOP-1</italic> dependent contractility, we thought it would be relevant to examine whether AIR-1 has some impact of centralspindlin-directed furrowing. This was the underlying logic for the experiments shown in figure 7.</p><p>Nevertheless, to formally rule out the possibility of bypass suppression, we examined furrowing in embryos deficient in AIR-1, <italic>NOP-1</italic>, and CYK-4. Embryos deficient in all three factors (<italic>nop-1</italic>(it142); air-1(RNAi); cyk-4(RNAi)) fail to form furrows during anaphase (and pseudocleavage) (100% of embryos, n=8). The pattern of ECT-2 accumulation…Such embryos exhibit the membrane invaginations characteristic of embryos with weakened cortex (PMID 20808841). There were no significant differences in ECT-2 accumulation in (<italic>nop-1</italic>(it142); air-1(RNAi); cyk-4(RNAi)) embryos as compared to air-1(RNAi) embryos. This sentence was added to the results to reflect these findings, “To test whether AIR-1 depletion does not bypass the requirement for CYK-4 and <italic>NOP-1</italic> in ECT-2 activation, we depleted both AIR-1 and CYK-4 in <italic>nop-1(it142)</italic> embryos. These triply deficient embryos fail to furrow during anaphase (100%, n=8).”</p><p>Given the facts above, the finding that AIR-1 depletion and a phosphomimetic substitution of T634 in ECT-2 affects furrowing behavior in <italic>NOP-1</italic> deficient embryos is consistent with AIR-1 involvement in centralspindlin-dependent furrowing and ‘AIR-1 affecting central-spindlindependent furrowing’.</p><p>We thank the referee for pointing out the title on page 42, it has been revised to “AIR-1 is involved in centralspindlin-dependent furrowing.”</p><p>Regarding the inactivation of <italic>NOP-1</italic> having only a very modest effect on cortical ECT-2 (figure 3B); depletion of AIR-1 results in a significant increase in the accumulation of ECT-2 on the posterior cortex (Figure 4B), and the phosphomimetic substitution of T634 in ECT-2 reduces its cortical accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation for authors:</p><p>The feedback loop from myosin to the biochemically upstream regulator RhoGEF is highly intriguing.
