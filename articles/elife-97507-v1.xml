Here, we found that maternal obesity disrupted the genomic methylation of oocytes using a high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse model, at least a part of which was transmitted to the F2 oocytes and livers via females. We further examined the metabolome of serum and found that the serum concentration of melatonin was reduced. Exogenous melatonin treatment significantly reduced the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes, and the increased expression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 in HFD oocytes was also decreased. These suggest that melatonin may play a key role in the disrupted genomic methylation in the oocytes of obese mice. To address how melatonin regulates the expression of DNMTs, the function of melatonin was inhibited or activated upon oocytes. Results revealed that melatonin may regulate the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. These results suggest that maternal obesity induces genomic methylation alterations in oocytes, which can be partly transmitted to F2 in females, and that melatonin is involved in regulating the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>melatonin</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Zhao-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2703500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Qing-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020764</institution-id><institution>Breeding Plan of Shandong Provincial Qingchuang Research Team</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>012-1622001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ming-Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012900</institution-id><institution>Doctor Foundation of Qingdao Agricultural University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6631116008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Zhao-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maternal obesity mouse model reveal that melatonin deficiency causes the genomic hyper-methylation of oocytes via increasing the expression of DNA methyltransferases.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity has become a global health problem, affecting approximately 13% of the world’s adult population, and over 340 million children and adolescents (WHO). This epidemic has profound implications not only for reproductive health but also for the well-being of subsequent generations. Previous studies have demonstrated that maternal obesity reduces the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2022b</xref>), deteriorates oocyte cytoplasmic quality and nuclear maturation, and disrupts genome methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broughton and Moley, 2017</xref>). Reduced expression of <italic>Stella</italic> in oocytes induced by obesity results in global hypo-methylation in zygotes, which has an important contribution to the defective embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, progeny of obese females has a higher risk of non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Godfrey et al., 2017</xref>). Leptin is secreted from fat cells and associated with energy metabolism and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Obradovic et al., 2021</xref>). Our previous study indicated that obesity altered the methylation status of <italic>Leptin</italic>, which might play a role in the metabolic disorders of female offspring. However, these methylation changes are not detected in the first-generation (F1) oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). The influence of maternal obesity on the genomic methylation of oocytes is still obscure. Thus, more studies are necessary to explore the role of DNA methylation in mediating the transgenerational transmission of metabolic syndrome induced by female obesity.</p><p>Obesity also perturbs glucose and lipid metabolism, which has negative effects on oocyte maturation and embryo development. Elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids in obese females contribute to oocyte lipotoxicity, while concomitantly diminishing mitochondrial function within oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broughton and Moley, 2017</xref>). The decreased melatonin levels are also reported in animals and humans by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Overberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Virto et al., 2018</xref>). Melatonin has contributions to metabolism and DNA methylation in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davoodvandi et al., 2022</xref>). These findings indicate that the disturbed metabolism induced by obesity is closely linked to the compromised oocyte quality and aberrant methylation patterns. This study aims to elucidate the effects of obesity-induced metabolic changes on oocyte genomic methylation and its inhereditary implications in a murine model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Obesity alters the genomic methylation in oocytes</title><p>The obese mouse model was induced via a HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2018</xref>), and mice fed with a standard diet were used as a control (CD). The HFD group exhibited a significantly higher average body weight compared to the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, B). Re-methylation in oocytes occurs in follicular development and is nearly complete at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. The 5mC (5-methylcytosine) and 5hmC (5-hydroxymethylcytosine) levels in the GV oocytes of HFD mice were significantly higher than that in the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). To further explore the effects of maternal obesity on the oocyte methylation, we examined the genomic methylation of metaphase II (MII) oocytes using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing for small samples (WGBS, Novogene, Beijing, China). The information on reads count, mapping rate, conversion rate, and sequencing depth was presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We found that global methylation in MII oocytes of the HFD group was higher than that in the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Methylated cytosine (C) can be classed into three types according to the context in the genome including CG, CHG, and CHH (H=A, T, or C). The methylated CG have more contributions to regulate gene expression. We found that the CG methylation level in MII oocytes of HFD was significantly higher than that in the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Differentially methylated CG is distributed across all chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To further analyze the distribution of methylation, each functional region of genes was equally divided into 20 bins, and then the average methylation levels in the functional regions were calculated, respectively. CGIs (CG islands) and CGI shores were predicted using cpgIslandExt and repeat sequences were predicted using RepeatMasker. Results showed that the hyper-methylation was distributed in the promoter, exon, upstream 2 k, and downstream 2 k regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) of genes in HFD oocytes.

These DMRs were defined by the following criteria: the number of CGs ≥4 and the absolute methylation difference ≥0.2. Among these, 2013 were hyper-DMRs (46.38%), and 2327 were hypo-DMRs (53.62%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These DMRs were distributed across all chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We then annotated DMRs into different genomic regions including promoter, exon, intron, CGI, CGI shore, repeat, TSS (transcription start site), TES (transcription end site), UTR3 (3’ end untranslated region), and UTR5 (5’ end untranslated region) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and the average methylation levels of DMRs in these regions were similar between HFD and CD oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, the hypo-DMRs were enriched in the UTR3, repeat, and intron regions compared with hyper-DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Methylation level at promoters strongly contributes to the regulation of gene expression. We then analyzed the enrichment of genes with DMRs at promoters in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways using KOBAS online. Results indicated that the genes with DMRs at promoters were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways including amino acid metabolism pathways, carbohydrate metabolism pathways, lipid metabolism pathways, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A total of 35 genes with DMRs at promoters were included in metabolism pathways, 19 of these genes were with hyper-DMRs and 16 of these genes were with hypo-DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results suggest that the altered methylation in oocytes induced by maternal obesity may play a role in the metabolic disorders in offspring.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The disturbed methylation may be associated with the transgenerational inheritance of the metabolic disorders through females</title><p>Our recent study demonstrated that disturbed methylation in oocytes caused by uterine undernourishment can be partly transmitted to F2 oocytes via females, which may play a key role in the transgenerational inheritance of metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we investigated the inheritance of altered methylation in HFD oocytes. F1 and F2 generations were produced as shown in the schedule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>: HF1 and CF1, female HFD and CD, respectively, were mated with control males; HF2 and CF2, female HF1 and CF1, respectively, were mated with control males. We examined the glucose and insulin tolerance (GTT and ITT), and found that the GTTs and ITTs of F0, F1, and F2 females were impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The inheritance of disrupted metabolism in females might be associated with the altered DNA methylation of oocytes. To address this question, we first examined the DNA methylation status of DMRs located at the promoters of <italic>Bhlha15</italic> (also known as <italic>Mist1</italic>, basic helix-loop-helix, a transcription factor), <italic>Mgat1</italic> (mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1), <italic>Taok3</italic> (serine/threonine-protein kinase 3), <italic>Tkt</italic> (transketolase), <italic>Pik3cd</italic> (phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta), and <italic>Pld1</italic> (phospholipase D1) in the HFD and CD oocytes. We found that the methylation levels of hyper-DMRs including <italic>Bhlha15</italic>-DMR, <italic>Mgat1</italic>-DMR, and <italic>Taok3</italic>-DMR in HFD oocytes were significantly higher than in the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The methylation level of hypo-DMRs, <italic>Pik3cd-DMR</italic> in HFD oocytes was significantly lower than that in the CD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results coincide with the genomic sequencing results.

In oocytes, DNA re-methylation is regulated by DNMTs including DNMT3A, DNMT3L, and DNMT1. Therefore, we next investigated whether melatonin regulates DNMTs expression via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in oocytes. We examined the expression of CREB1, CREM (cAMP responsive element modulator), CREB3l2 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 2), and ATF1 (activating transcription factor 1) in oocytes. Results showed that ADCYs activator forskolin treatment significantly increased the mRNA expression of CREB1 and CREM, and that the expression of CREB3l2 and ATF1 was slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, the ADCYs inhibitor SQ22536 significantly reduced the expression of CREB1 and CREB3l2, although the expression of CREM and ATF1 was slightly decreased in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Nevertheless, epigenetic modifications can be affected by environmental factors such as metabolic diseases and diet. The intergenerational inheritance of phenotypes and epigenetic changes induced by maternal environmental factors have been confirmed by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2014</xref>), but there are still many debates about the transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic changes induced by the environment. Rats from stressed mothers are more likely to be stressed, and that can be transmitted across generations, but this transgenerational inheritance is not mediated by gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). Females cannot mediate the transgenerational inheritance of hyper-methylation induced by diet in <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waterland et al., 2007</xref>), but another study reported that if the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is from the father, the hyper-methylation induced by diet during pregnancy can be retained in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cropley et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anway et al., 2005</xref> reported that the abnormal spermatogenesis induced by the exposure to vinclozolin during pregnancy can be transmitted across four generations via sperm. We previously reported that maternal obesity disturbed the DNA methylation status of imprinted genes in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2014</xref>), but the transgenerational inheritance was not observed. We also demonstrated that disturbed methylation in oocytes induced by undernourishment in utero could be inherited, at least partly, by F2 oocytes via females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takahashi et al., 2023</xref> edited DNA methylation of promoter-associated CGIs, and found that the edited DNA methylation, associated with disrupted metabolism, was stably inherited by multiple generations. In the present study, we found that maternal obesity-induced genomic hyper-methylation in oocytes, and that a part of the abnormal methylation was transmitted to F2 via female gametes. Moreover, the transmission of metabolic disorders has also been observed across two generations. These results suggest that the transgenerational inheritance of abnormal methylation induced by maternal obesity, at least in part, can be mediated by oocytes, which may be a reason for the inheritance of metabolic disorders.</p><p>During the methylation process, the methyl group is donated by SAM which is generated from homocysteine, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5mTHF), and methionine. 5mTHF is an intermediate of one-carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mentch and Locasale, 2016</xref>). One-carbon units such as folate and vitamin B12 are crucial for the establishment of methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mentch and Locasale, 2016</xref>). Disturbed glucose and lipid metabolism also have a negative influence on DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2014</xref>). These indicate that abnormal metabolism induced by maternal obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King, 2006</xref>) may play a key role in the genomic hyper-methylation in oocytes. In the present study, we found that the metabolomics of serum from HFD mice was distinguishable from that of serum from CD mice. Although the concentrations of vitamin B6 and methionine were higher in HFD serum than that in CD, this may not be an important reason for the genomic hyper-methylation in oocytes because the concentrations of SAM, SAH, and HCY in the livers and oocytes were similar between CD and HFD mice. In humans, obesity reduces the melatonin level in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Overberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Virto et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we also found that maternal obesity induced by a high-fat diet reduced the concentration of melatonin in the serum. Melatonin not only can decrease body weight, but also regulates DNA methylation of somatic cells and germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davoodvandi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lan et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which melatonin regulates DNA methylation in oocytes is still unclear. Melatonin has two receptors, MT1 and MT2, both of which have been identified in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Melatonin receptors interact with the inhibitor G-protein and can regulate gene expression via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wongprayoon and Govitrapong, 2021</xref>). CREM and cAMP mediate DNA methylation in somatic cells by regulating the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hedrich et al., 2014</xref>). In neurons, CREB interacts with the promoter of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> to regulate its expression and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we found that melatonin regulates methylation in oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a, which is mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Similar results were also observed in HFD oocytes. Hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes can be reduced by exogenous melatonin and PKA inhibitors. These suggest that decreased melatonin levels are involved in regulating the genomic hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMTs, which is mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.</p><p>During follicular development, re-methylation in oocytes is catalyzed mainly by DNMT3A and DNMT3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kibe et al., 2021</xref>). DNMT1 is usually responsible for maintaining DNA methylation, but DNMT1 also contributes to CG methylation in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shirane et al., 2013</xref>). During normal oocyte development, DNMT1 is mainly prevented from the nuclei by <italic>Stella</italic>. When the <italic>Stella</italic> level is knocked out, <italic>Uhrf1</italic> (Ubiquitin-like containing PHD Ring Finger 1) moves to the nucleus from the cytoplasm and recruits DNMT1 to chromatin, resulting in hyper-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Maternal obesity significantly decreases the expression of <italic>Stella</italic> in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2018</xref>). These suggest that maternal obesity may induce hyper-methylation in oocytes. In the present study, we found that maternal obesity increased the genomic DNA methylation in GV and MII oocytes, the expression of DNMT1, and its localization at chromatin in GV oocytes. These suggest that reduced <italic>Stella</italic> in HFD oocytes may recruit more DNMT1 into chromatin resulting in hyper-methylation. Nevertheless, Han LS et al. reported that maternal obesity has no significant influence on whole genome methylation of GV oocytes and Hou YJ et al. reported that maternal obesity reduces whole genome methylation of NSN (no Hoechst-positive rim surrounding the nucleolus) GV oocytes. This contradiction may be associated with the methods used to examine the methylation level and the sample size.</p><p>In summary, we found that maternal obesity-induced genomic hyper-methylation in oocytes and that at least a part of the altered methylation can be transmitted to F2 oocytes, which may be a reason for the inheritance of metabolic disorders. Furthermore, reduced melatonin in HFD mice was involved in regulating the genomic hyper-methylation of oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMTs, and this process was mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. However, there are some limitations for the present study: there is not enough evidence to confirm the role of altered DNA methylation in metabolic disorders in the offspring of obese mothers The molecular mechanisms by which DNA methylation escapes reprogramming in oogenesis have not been elucidated. There are may be other mechanisms involved in regulating genomic hyper-methylation in HFD oocytes. Therefore, more studies are needed in the short future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jinan Pengyue Company (Jinan, China).

Chao and colleagues demonstrated the potential mechanisms behind the DNA methylation changes. The major observations of the work include transgenerational DNA methylation changes in offspring of maternal obesity and metabolites such as methionine and melatonin which correlated with the epigenetic changes. Exogenous melatonin treatment could reverse the effects of obesity. The authors further hypothesized that the linkage may be mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to regulate the expression of DNMTs.

including transgenerational breeding experiments, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and metabolomics analysis, and provides the convincing data.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The results of this work are

development, more and more people are obese which is an important reason for sub-fertility and infertility. Maternal obesity reduces oocyte quality which may be a reason for the high risk of metabolic diseases for offspring in adulthood. Yet the underlying mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here the authors examined the effects of maternal obesity on oocyte methylation. Hyper-methylation in oocytes was reported by the authors, and the altered methylation in oocytes may be partially transmitted to F2. The authors further explored the association between the metabolome of serum and the altered methylation in oocytes. The authors identified decreased melatonin. Melatonin is involved in regulating the hyper-methylation of high-fat diet (HFD) oocytes, via increasing the expression of DNMTs which is mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is interesting and should have significant implications for the understanding of the transgenerational inheritance of GDM in humans.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The link between altered DNA methylation and offspring metabolic disorders is not well elucidated; how the altered DNA methylation in oocytes escapes reprogramming in transgenerational inheritance is also unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. These are very good questions. There is a long way to completely elucidate the relationship between methylation and offspring metabolic disorders, and the underlying mechanisms of obtained methylation escaping the reprogramming during development. We would like to explore these in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript offers significant insights into the impact of maternal obesity on oocyte methylation and its transgenerational effects. The study employs comprehensive methodologies, including transgenerational breeding experiments, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and metabolomics analysis, to explore how high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity alters genomic methylation in oocytes and how these changes are inherited by subsequent generations. The findings suggest that maternal obesity induces hyper-methylation in oocytes, which is partly transmitted to F1 and F2 oocytes and livers, potentially contributing to metabolic disorders in offspring. Notably, the study identifies melatonin as a key regulator of this hyper-methylation process, mediated through the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study employs comprehensive methodologies, including transgenerational breeding experiments, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and metabolomics analysis, and provides convincing data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The description in the results section is somewhat verbose. This section (lines 126~227) utilized transgenerational breeding experiments and methylation analysis to demonstrate that maternal obesity-induced alterations in oocyte methylation (including hyper-DMRs and hypo-DMRs) can be partially transmitted to F1 and F2 oocytes and livers. The authors should consider condensing and revising this section for clarity and brevity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We have re-written this parts in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a contradiction with Reference 3, but the discrepancy is not discussed. In this study, the authors observed an increase in global methylation in oocytes from HFD mice, whereas Reference 3 indicates Stella insufficiency in oocytes from HFD mice. This Stella insufficiency should lead to decreased methylation (Reference 33). There should be a discussion of how this discrepancy can be reconciled with the authors' findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. As reported by Reference 33, STELLA prevents hypermethylation in oocytes by sequestering UHRF1 from the nuclei which recruits DNMT1 into nuclei. Han <italic>et al.</italic> reported that obesity induced by high-fat diet reduces STELLA level in oocytes. These indicate that STELLA insufficiency might induce hypermethylation in oocytes, although significant hypermethylation in obese oocytes is not reported by Han <italic>et al.</italic> using immunofluorescence. This contradiction may be caused by the limited sample sizes (n=14) used by Han <italic>et al.</italic> We have added a brief discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Maternal obesity is a health problem for both pregnant women and their offspring. Previous works including work from this group have shown significant DNA methylation changes for offspring of obese pregnancies in mice. In this manuscript, Chao et al digested the potential mechanisms behind the DNA methylation changes. The major observations of the work include transgenerational DNA methylation changes in offspring of maternal obesity, and metabolites such as methionine and melatonin correlated with the above epigenetic changes. Exogenous melatonin treatment could reverse the effects of obesity. The authors further hypothesized that the linkage may be mediated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to regulate the expression of DNMTs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The transgenerational change of DNA methylation following HFD is of great interest for future research to follow. The metabolic treatment that could change the DNA methylation in oocytes is also interesting and has potential relevance to future clinical practice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The HFD oocytes have more 5mC signal based on staining and sequencing (Fig 1A-1F). However, the authors also identified almost equal numbers of hyper- and hypo-DMRs, which raises questions regarding where these hypo-DMRs were located and how to interpret their behaviors and functions. These questions are also critical to address in the following mechanistic dissections as the metabolic treatments may also induce bi-directional changes of DNA methylation. The authors should carefully assess these conflicts to make the conclusions solid.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the helpful comments and suggestions. As presented in Fig. 1F, there is an increase of methylation level in promoter and exon regions and there is a decrease in intron, utr3 and repeat regions. According to the suggestions, we further analyzed the distribution of DMRs, and found that hypo-DMRs were mainly distributed at utr3, intron, repeat, and tes regions compared with hyper-DMRs (Fig. S3). These suggest that the distribution of DMRs in genome is not random.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The transgenerational epigenetic modifications are controversial. Even for F0 offspring under maternal obesity, there were different observations compared to this work (Hou, YJ., et al. Sci Rep, 2016). The authors should discuss the inconsistencies with previous works.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. There are contradictions on the whole genome DNA methylation of oocytes in obese mice. Hou YJ <italic>et al.</italic> in 2016 reported that obesity reduces the whole genome DNA methylation of NSN GV oocytes using immunofluorescence. In 2018, Han LS <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the whole genome 5mC of oocytes is not significantly influenced by obesity using immunofluorescence, but they find the <italic>Stella</italic> level is reduced in oocytes by obesity. <italic>Stella</italic> locates in the cytoplasm and nuclei of oocytes and sequesters <italic>Uhrf1</italic> from the nuclei. <italic>Stella</italic> knockout in oocytes results in about twofold increase of global methylation in MII oocytes via recruiting more DNMT1 into nuclei. These suggest that the global methylation of oocytes in obese mice should be increased, but the similar methylation in oocytes between obese and non-obese mice is reported by Han LS <italic>et al</italic>. Thus, the contradiction may be induced by the different sample size in our manuscript and previous studies, and Hou YJ and colleagues just examined the methylation of NSN GV oocytes. As present in Stella+/- oocytes, the global methylation of oocytes is normal, which suggest that the insufficiency of <italic>Stella</italic> may be not the main reason for the increased methylation of oocytes in obese mice. We have added a brief discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the above inconsistencies, the DNA methylation analysis in this work was not carefully evaluated. Several previous works were evaluating the DNA methylation in mice oocytes, which showed global methylation levels of around 50% (Shirane K, et al. PLoS Genet, 2013; Wang L., et al, Cell, 2014). In Figure 1E, the overall methylation level is about 23% in control, which is significantly different from previous works. The authors should provide more details regarding the WGBS procedure, including but not limited to sequencing coverage, bisulfite conversion rate, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the good questions. Smallwood <italic>et al.</italic> reported the the CG methylation of MII oocyte is about 33.1% (Smallwood et al. Nature Methods, 2014) using single-cell genome-wide bisulfite sequencing. Shirane K <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the average methylation level of GV oocytes is 37.9%. Kobayashi H <italic>et al.</italic> Reported that the CG methylation in GV oocytes is about 40% (Kobayashi H et al. Plos Genet. 2012). CG methylation in fully grown oocytes is about 38.7% (Maenohara S et al. Plos Genet. 2017). The variation of methylation in oocytes is associated with sequencing methods, sequencing depth, and mapping rates. In the present study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for small sample and methylation analysis were performed by NovoGene. The reads are 31613641 to 37359643, unique mapping rate is ≥32.88%, conversation rate is &gt; 99.44%, and sequencing depth is 2.45 to 2.75. Relative information is presented in Table S1. The sequencing depth might be a reason for the inconsistence. But we further confirmed our sequencing results using bisulfite sequencing (BS), and the result is similar between BS and WGBS results. These findings suggest that our results are reliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Since the results show that melatonin may play a role in hyper-methylation, the authors need to give some basic information in the Introduction section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We added more information in the section of Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There are many differential metabolites identified. Besides melatonin, other differential metabolites are involved in the altered methylation in oocytes</p></disp-quote><p>These is a good question. We firstly filtered the differential metabolites which may be involved in methylation, and then further filtered these metabolites according to the relative DNA methylation pathways and published papers. After that, we confirmed the concentrations of relative metabolites in the serum using ELISA. Certainly, we can not completely exclude all the metabolites which might involved in regulating DNA methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The altered methylation would be found in the F1 tissues.

We agree that the altered methylation should be observed in the other tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Did the authors try or guess how many generations the maternal obesity-induced genomic methylation alterations can be transmitted?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. This is a good question. Takahashi Y and colleagues reported that obtained DNA methylation at CpG island can be transmitted across multiple generations using DNA methylation-edited mouse (Takahashi Y et al. 2023, cell). Similar inheritance is also reported by other studies using different models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The F2 is indirectly affected by maternal obesity, so the evidence is not enough to prove the transgenerational inheritance of the altered methylation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We find the altered DNA methylation in F2 tissue and oocytes is similar to that in F1 oocytes. These suggest the altered DNA methylation in F2 oocytes should be at least partly transmitted to F3. Previous paper (Takahashi Y et al. 2023, cell) confirms that obtain DNA methylation in CpG island can be transmitted across several generations through paternal and maternal germ lines. Certainly, it’s better if it is examined in F3 tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure Font Size: The font sizes in the figures are quite inconsistent.

Sorry for that we didn’t describe the methods clearly. We have added more information about the methods in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The metabolomic analysis revealed a highly significant increase in dibutylphthalate, genistein, and daidzein in the control mice. The presence of these exogenous metabolites suggests that the diets differed in many aspects, not just fat content, so it would be very difficult to interpret the results as related to a high-fat diet alone. Both daidzein and genistein are phytoestrogens and dibutylphthalate is a plasticizer, suggesting differences in the diet and/or in the materials used to collect the samples for analysis from the mice. The Methods define the high-fat diet adequately, as the formulation can be found online using the catalog number. However, the control diet is just listed as &quot;normal diet&quot;, so one has no idea what is in it</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your good questions. The daidzein and genistein may be from the diets and the dibutylthalate may be from the materials used to collect samples. If so, these should be similar between groups. Thus, we added the formulation of normal diet in the revised manuscript. The raw materials of normal diet include corn, bean pulp, fish meal, flour, yeast powder, plant oil, salt, vitamins, and mineral elements. According to the suggestions, we re-checked the data about these metabolites, and found that the abundance of these metabolites was low. And the result of these metabolites was at a low confidence level because the iron of these metabolites was only mapped to ChemSpider(HMDB,KEGG,LIPID MAPS). To further confirm these results, we examined these metabolites in serum using ELISA, and results revealed that the concentrations of genistein and dibutylthalate were similar between groups. These results suggest that these metabolites may be not involved in the altered methylation of oocytes induced by obesity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
