RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, has been shown to play a central role in the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, even after short-term exposure. While this paradigm is well established for DNA-damaging antibiotics, it remains unclear whether β-lactams elicit similar resistance dynamics or depend on RecA and SOS-mediated mechanisms. In this study, we observed a rapid and stable evolution of β-lactam resistance (20-fold MIC increase within 8 hr) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> lacking RecA after a single exposure to ampicillin. Contrary to expectation, this resistance emerged through an SOS-independent mechanism involving two distinct evolutionary forces: increased mutational supply and antibiotic-driven selection. Specifically, we found that RecA deletion impaired DNA repair and downregulated base excision repair pathways, while concurrently repressing the transcription of antioxidative defence genes. This dual impairment led to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn promoted the emergence of resistance-conferring mutations. While ampicillin treatment did not alter survival, it selectively enriched for rare mutants arising in the RecA-deficient and ROS-elevated background. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that this oxidative environment, together with compromised DNA repair capacity, increases genetic instability and creates a selective landscape favouring the expansion of resistant clones. These results highlight the repair-redox axis as a key determinant of bacterial evolvability under antimicrobial stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1165135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dayong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACSRF658277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dayong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and technology innovation commission of shen zhen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KQTD20170810110913065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dayong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australia China Science and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SQ2017YFGH001190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dayong</given-names></name><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Qian Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1177374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Qian Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single β-lactam exposure rapidly drives stable multidrug resistance in RecA-deficient bacteria through an SOS-independent mechanism involving oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis and antibiotic-driven selection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Addressing bacterial infections caused by emerging and drug-resistant pathogens represents a major global health priority. Bactericidal antibiotics can exert their effects on cells by directly or indirectly causing DNA damage or triggering the production of highly destructive hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rebecca, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baquero and Levin, 2021</xref>). This, in turn, initiates a protective mechanism known as the SOS response, which enables bacterial survival against the lethal impacts of antibiotics by activating intrinsic pathways for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Žgur-Bertok, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wigley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harms et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maslowska et al., 2019</xref>). The activation of DNA repair processes relies on specific genes, such as <italic>recA</italic>, which encodes a recombinase involved in DNA repair, and <italic>lexA</italic>, a repressor of the SOS response that can be inactivated by RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that a single exposure to fluoroquinolones, a type of antibiotic that induces DNA breaks and triggers the SOS response, leads to the development of bacterial resistance in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> through a RecA and SOS response-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrett et al., 2019</xref>). Given the crucial role of RecA in the SOS response, inhibiting RecA activity to deactivate the SOS response presents an appealing strategy for preventing the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlopoulou, 2018</xref>). Similarly, exposure to fluoroquinolones induces the SOS response and mutagenesis in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and the deletion of <italic>recA</italic> in this pathogen results in a significant reduction in resistance to fluoroquinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mercolino et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Unlike fluoroquinolones, β-lactam antibiotics induce a RecA-dependent SOS response in <italic>E. coli</italic> through impaired cell wall synthesis, mediated by the DpiBA two-component signal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2004</xref>). The development of antibiotic resistance, triggered by exposure to β-lactams, has been extensively investigated using the cyclic adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) method. Mutations that arise during cyclic ALE experiments are attributed to errors occurring during continued growth, necessitating multiple rounds of β-lactam exposure to drive the evolution of resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>). However, the precise roles of RecA and SOS responses in the development of resistance under short-term β-lactam antibiotics exposure remain unclear.</p><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in understanding the impact of the stress-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>). While exploring methods to harness ROS-mediated killing has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of various antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao and Drlica, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), the role of ROS in antimicrobial activity has become a topic of controversy following challenges to the initial observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imlay, 2015</xref>). The generation of ROS has been found to contribute to the development of multidrug resistance, as prolonged exposure to antibiotics in cyclic ALE experiments is known to generate ROS, leading to DNA damage and increased mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge regarding the consequences of ROS accumulation in bacteria when the activity of RecA or the SOS response is suppressed.</p><p>Here, we report that a single exposure to β-lactam antibiotics can rapidly drive the evolution of multidrug resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking RecA. This process reflects a two-step evolutionary mechanism: RecA deficiency increases mutational supply by impairing DNA repair, repressing antioxidant gene expression, and promoting ROS accumulation; subsequently, antibiotic pressure selectively enriches resistant variants from this hypermutable population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single β-lactam exposure accelerates resistance evolution in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain through a selection-driven mechanism</title><p>To investigate the impact of the SOS response on bacterial evolution towards β-lactam resistance, we generated a <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain (<italic>ΔrecA</italic>) from the <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 strain. Initially, we conducted an ALE experiment using a slightly modified treatment protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Hughes, 2014</xref>) on the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains. During a period of three weeks, the cells were subjected to cycles of ampicillin exposure for 4.5 hr at a concentration of 50 µg/mL (10 times the MIC) each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fridman et al., 2014</xref>). As anticipated based on previous studies, the intermittent ampicillin treatments over the course of three weeks resulted in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, a significantly accelerated development of resistance was found in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, with the average time to resistance reduced to 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). More importantly, we observed that resistance even emerged in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain after a single exposure for 8 hr to ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Meanwhile, after 8 hr of treatment with 50 μg/mL ampicillin, the survival rates of both wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To ensure that the emergence of resistance we observed was not illusory due to technical issues during the <italic>recA</italic> knockout process, we employed another <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (JW2669-1) provided by the Coli Genetic Stock Centre (CGSC) with the same killing procedure. The results from both bacterial strains were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). To further investigate, we treated both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells with other β-lactams, including penicillin G and carbenicillin, at concentrations equivalent to 10 times the MIC (1 mg/mL and 200 µg/mL, respectively) for 8 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reimer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 1979</xref>).

Our findings revealed that once resistance was established, resistance remained stable and was able to be passed on to subsequent generations even in the absence of ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, we performed a complementation experiment by introducing a plasmid containing <italic>recA</italic> under its native promoter into the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain prior to Step i in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, that is, before exposing the cells to ampicillin.

To clarify which mechanism underlies the rapid emergence of resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, we systematically analysed the mutation frequency and distribution patterns in response to ampicillin treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows the distribution of rifampicin-resistant colony-forming units (CFUs) across 96 independent cultures of the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains, with and without exposure to ampicillin (50 µg/mL for 8 hr). Although the treatment of ampicillin in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain displayed a highly skewed distribution with apparent jackpot cultures, non-parametric statistical comparison (Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s test) did not detect a significant difference in overall mutation frequency compared to untreated <italic>ΔrecA</italic>. This suggests that while the median mutation burden remained stable, rare resistant outliers were significantly enriched, which was a pattern consistent with selection rather than broad mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>). Further, using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng, 1999</xref>), we calculated the mutation rates (mutations per culture) for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

The mutation frequency distributions in the wild type strain with or without the treatment of ampicillin conformed well to Poisson expectations, consistent with random spontaneous mutation events. In contrast, the single exposure to ampicillin significantly deviated from the Poisson model, indicating a non-random clonal enrichment process in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sarkar et al., 1992</xref>). Finally, we applied a fluctuation test-based inference framework grounded in the Luria-Delbrück model to distinguish between mutation induction and clonal selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster, 2007</xref>).

However, in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant strain, antibiotic exposure does not affect the transcription levels of any SOS system-related proteins, suggesting that antibiotic exposure induced the SOS response in the wild type strain but not in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain. More importantly, we discovered that the induction of the transcription level of DNA Pol I was significantly suppressed after the single treatment of ampicillin in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain compared with that in the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This is consistent with our imaging results and further supports the notion that an SOS-independent evolutionary mechanism dominates the development of antibiotic resistance in <italic>recA</italic> mutant <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Further, significant downregulation in the transcription of antioxidative-related genes in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain was detected, including <italic>cysJ</italic>, <italic>cysI</italic>, <italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>soda</italic>, and <italic>sufD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This downregulation suggested an excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to compromised cell antioxidative defences. It has been previously reported that the induction of mutagenesis can be stimulated by the overproduction of ROS during antibiotic administration, leading to the evolution of antibiotic resistance both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesised that elevated ROS levels facilitate the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain by increasing genetic instability and enabling the selection of resistant variants. To test it, we first examined the level of ROS generation in the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains treated with ampicillin for 8 hr by using the ﬂuorescent probe DCFDA/H2DCFDA. We found that ROS levels significantly increased in both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain after 8 hr of ampicillin treatment. However, ROS levels in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain showed a significant further increase compared to the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Additionally, with the addition of 50 mM glutathione (GSH), a natural antioxidative compound, no significant change in ROS levels was observed in either the wild type or <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain before and after ampicillin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Further, we supplemented the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains with 50 mM GSH and treated them with ampicillin at a concentration of 50 μg/mL for 8 hr. Remarkably, the addition of GSH prevented the development of resistance to ampicillin in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), without impairing the bactericidal effectiveness of ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the SOS response, bacterial cells coordinate other DNA repair activities through a network of regulatory pathways, including base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahm et al., 2022</xref>). The excessive generation of ROS results in elevated levels of deoxy-8-oxo-guanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP), an oxidised form of dGTP that becomes both highly toxic and mutagenic upon integration into DNA. The presence of 8-oxo-dG can induce SNP mutations, especially those occurring in guanine, which can be actively rectified by the BER repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahm et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, BER glycosylases MutH and MutY can identify and repair these 8-oxo-dG-dependent mutations; however, when MutY and MutH are inactivated, unrepaired 8-oxo-dG can lead to the accumulation of SNP mutations within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahm et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, we conducted a further assessment of the transcription levels of the BER repair pathway in both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain before and after a single exposure to ampicillin. We discovered that after an 8 hr treatment of ampicillin, three DNA repair-associated proteins, including MutH, MutY, and MutM, were notably suppressed in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we sequenced the surviving <italic>ΔrecA</italic> isolates and found that the addition of GSH inhibited drug resistance-associated mutations in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, which were detected in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic>-resistant isolates including genes of the promoter of <italic>ampC</italic> and <italic>acrB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). Given the DNA repair impairment resulting in the generation of ROS, it would have been expected for genes involved in the oxidative stress response to be induced in RecA-deficient cells. However, the repression of antioxidative-related genes indicated the involvement of transcriptional repressors that might be regulated by RecA. Consequently, we examined the transcription levels of all transcriptional repressors in both the wild type and <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain. Remarkably, we observed a significant upregulation of H-NS, a crucial transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). This finding suggests that the upregulation of H-NS could potentially contribute to the suppression of antioxidant gene expression in the <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strain, thereby promoting ROS accumulation and subsequent resistance evolution. Together, these findings demonstrate that RecA deficiency not only impairs DNA repair but also suppresses the oxidative stress response, leading to elevated ROS and increased mutational load. This oxidative-genetic imbalance forms the basis for enhanced mutational supply in RecA-deficient cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we challenge the prevailing view that disabling RecA and thereby inhibiting the SOS response can prevent bacteria from developing antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlopoulou, 2018</xref>). While the SOS response and RecA have been extensively studied for their roles in antibiotic resistance evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlopoulou, 2018</xref>), we observed a remarkably fast and stable evolution of multidrug resistance in the <italic>E. coli ΔrecA</italic> strains following a single exposure to β-lactam antibiotics. This phenomenon cannot be explained by canonical SOS-driven mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janion, 2008</xref>), but instead reflects the interplay of two distinct evolutionary forces: RecA loss increases mutational supply through DNA repair suppression and ROS accumulation, while antibiotic-induced lethal stress provides a selective environment that promotes the expansion of rare and resistance-conferring variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of rapid development of multidrug resistance in the <italic>recA</italic> mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> strain.</title><p>Deletion of <italic>recA</italic> impairs DNA damage repair and upregulates the transcription of the global repressor H-NS, though the mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. Elevated H-NS levels repress the expression of multiple antioxidant-related genes (<italic>cysI</italic>, <italic>cysJ</italic>, <italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>sodA</italic>, <italic>sufD</italic>), leading to excessive accumulation of ROS. The resulting oxidative stress increases the overall mutational burden. Upon single exposure to β-lactam antibiotics, drug-resistant subpopulations carrying specific mutations, such as in <italic>acrB</italic> or <italic>P<sub>ampC</sub></italic>, are selectively enriched, ultimately driving the rapid emergence of multidrug resistance. This process reflects a two-step mechanism involving enhanced mutational supply and subsequent selection under antibiotic pressure.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95058-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To determine whether antibiotic exposure in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells directly induces mutations or selectively enriches resistant variants, we combined statistical modelling, fluctuation analysis, and whole-genome sequencing. Although mutation rates estimated by maximum likelihood were moderately elevated in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells after ampicillin treatment, the mutation frequency distributions were highly right-skewed and deviated from Poisson expectations, a hallmark of clonal selection rather than uniform and population-wide mutagenesis. These findings align with the classical Luria-Delbrück framework and indicate that resistance evolution in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> is primarily driven by selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>). However, our data also demonstrate that the mutational supply is enhanced in this background due to antibiotic-induced oxidative stress and impaired DNA repair, which together increase the likelihood that resistance-conferring mutations arise and persist. Thus, this process reflects a selection-dominated evolutionary trajectory facilitated by stress-enhanced mutagenesis, rather than classical induced mutation or selection on pre-existing variants.</p><p>Mechanistically, our data reveal that RecA plays broader roles in genome stability beyond its function in SOS activation. Disruption of individual SOS components, including <italic>lexA</italic>, <italic>citA/B</italic>, or translesion polymerases, did not recapitulate the <italic>ΔrecA</italic>-specific resistance phenotype. Instead, <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains exhibited suppression of DNA Pol I and key BER genes, such as <italic>mutH</italic>, <italic>mutY</italic>, and <italic>mutM</italic>, confirming that RecA is essential for the maintenance of repair fidelity under stress conditions. This defect likely enables ROS-induced DNA lesions to persist and become fixed as mutations.</p><p>In parallel, we identified a striking repression of antioxidative stress response genes in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains exposed to ampicillin, including <italic>cysJIH</italic>, <italic>sodA</italic>, and <italic>sufD</italic>. This transcriptional suppression was associated with markedly elevated ROS levels. Crucially, supplementation with the antioxidant GSH reversed both ROS accumulation and the emergence of resistance, without impairing the bactericidal activity of ampicillin. This decouples the mutagenic and lethal effects of ROS and highlights ROS as a driver of mutational supply rather than survival.</p><p>To explore the transcriptional basis for oxidative dysregulation, we examined global repressors and discovered that <italic>hns</italic> was significantly upregulated in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains after ampicillin exposure. H-NS is a known transcriptional silencer of stress response genes, including those involved in redox regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracco et al., 1989</xref>). We propose that RecA deficiency may lead to H-NS derepression, thereby silencing antioxidant defences, exacerbating ROS accumulation and enabling mutation accumulation under stress. Although previous findings report that H-NS can down-regulate the transcriptional expression of <italic>cysIJH</italic> through the mediation of <italic>cysB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishihama and Shimada, 2021</xref>), the mechanistic relationship between RecA and H-NS regulation remains to be experimentally validated.</p><p>More broadly, our findings highlight the repair-redox axis as a central regulator of bacterial evolvability. Rather than solely targeting bacterial growth or survival, future antimicrobial strategies might focus on constraining mutational potential. For example, co-administration of antioxidants or repair stabilisers could buffer stress-induced mutagenesis without compromising antibiotic efficacy, which has been a concept already under exploration in cancer therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klinakis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, the emergence of <italic>acrB</italic> mutations and enhanced activity of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> strains recapitulates known multidrug resistance pathways. These observations raise concerns for therapies combining DNA repair inhibitors with ROS-inducing antibiotics or anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Our data suggest that such combinations may inadvertently promote resistance evolution, particularly in immunocompromised patients or during chemotherapy.</p><p>Finally, ROS-driven mutagenesis and repair suppression are not unique to β-lactams. Antimicrobial technologies such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson and Patterson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vatansever et al., 2013</xref>) also rely on oxidative stress. In RecA-deficient or stress-sensitised bacteria, these approaches may risk accelerating resistance evolution unless accompanied by safeguards that preserve genomic integrity. Thus, maintaining the transcription of genes involved in the oxidative stress defence or combining antibiotics represents a promising strategy to prevent ROS-driven mutagenesis and thereby limit the evolutionary emergence of resistance during antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, medium, and antibiotics</title><p>Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

Canonically, the SOS response is triggered by DNA damage, which results in the induction of error-prone DNA repair mechanisms. These error-prone repair pathways can increase mutagenesis in the cell, leading to the evolution of drug resistance. Thus, inhibiting the SOS regulator RecA has been proposed as means to delay the rise of resistance.</p><p>In this paper, the authors deleted the RecA protein from <italic>E. coli</italic> and exposed this ∆recA strain to selective levels of the beta-lactam antibiotic, ampicillin. After an 8h treatment, they washed the antibiotic away and allowed the surviving cells to recover in regular media. They then measured the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin against these treated strains. They note that after just 8 h treatment with ampicillin, the ∆recA had developed higher MICs towards ampicillin, while by contrast, wild-type cells exhibited unchanged MICs. This MIC increase was also observed in subsequent generations of bacteria, suggesting that the phenotype is driven by a genetic change.</p><p>The authors then used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify mutations that accounted for the resistance phenotype. Within resistant populations, they discovered key mutations in the promoter region of the beta-lactamase gene, ampC; in the penicillin-binding protein PBP3 which is the target of ampicillin; and in the AcrB subunit of the AcrAB-TolC efflux machinery. Importantly, mutations in the efflux machinery can impact the resistance towards other antibiotics, not just beta-lactams. To test this, they repeated the MIC experiments with other classes of antibiotics, including kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampicin. Interestingly, they observed that the ∆recA strains pre-treated with ampicillin showed higher MICs towards all other antibiotics tested. This suggests that the mutations conferring resistance to ampicillin are also increasing resistance to other antibiotics.</p><p>The authors then performed an impressive series of genetic, microscopy, and transcriptomic experiments to show that this increase in resistance is not driven by the SOS response, but by independent DNA repair and stress response pathways. Specifically, they show that deletion of the recA reduces the bacterium's ability to process reactive oxygen species (ROS) and repair its DNA. These factors drive the accumulation of mutations that can confer resistance towards different classes of antibiotics. The conclusions are reasonably well-supported by the data, but some aspects of the data and the model need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major strength of the paper is the detailed bacterial genetics and transcriptomics that the authors performed to elucidate the molecular pathways responsible for this increased resistance. They systemically deleted or inactivated genes involved in the SOS response in <italic>E. coli</italic>. They then subjected these mutants to the same MIC assays as described previously. Surprisingly, none of the other SOS gene deletions resulted in an increase in drug resistance, suggesting that the SOS response is not involved in this phenotype. This led the authors to focus on the localization of DNA PolI, which also participates in DNA damage repair. Using microscopy, they discovered that in the RecA deletion background, PolI co-localizes with the bacterial chromosome at much lower rates than wild-type. This led the authors to conclude that deletion of RecA hinders PolI and DNA repair. Although the authors do not provide a mechanism, this observation is nonetheless valuable for the field and can stimulate further investigations in the future.</p><p>In order to understand how RecA deletion affects cellular physiology, the authors performed RNA-seq on ampicillin-treated strains. Crucially, they discovered that in the RecA deletion strain, genes associated with antioxidative activity (cysJ, cysI, cysH, soda, sufD) and Base Excision Repair repair (mutH, mutY, mutM), which repairs oxidized forms of guanine, were all downregulated. The authors conclude that down-regulation of these genes might result in elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in the cells, which in turn, might drive the rise of resistance. Experimentally, they further demonstrated that treating the ∆recA strain with an antioxidant GSH prevents the rise of MICs. These observations will be useful for more detailed mechanistic follow-ups in the future.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Throughout the paper, the authors use language suggesting that ampicillin treatment of the ∆recA strain induces higher levels of mutagenesis inside the cells, leading to the rapid rise of resistance mutations. However, as the authors note, the mutants enriched by ampicillin selection can play a role in efflux and can thus change a bacterium's sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics, in what is known as cross-resistance. The current data is not clear on whether the elevated &quot;mutagenesis&quot; is driven by ampicillin selection or by a bona fide increase in mutation rate.</p><p>Furthermore, on a technical level, the authors employed WGS to identify resistance mutations in the ampicillin-treated wild-type and ∆recA strains. However, the WGS methodology described in the paper is inconsistent. Notably, wild-type WGS samples were picked from non-selective plates, while ΔrecA WGS isolates were picked from selective plates with 50 μg/mL ampicillin. Such an approach biases the frequency and identity of the mutations seen in the WGS and cannot be used to support the idea that ampicillin treatment induces higher levels of mutagenesis.</p><p>Finally, it is important to establish what the basal mutation rates of both the WT and ∆recA strains are. Currently, only the ampicillin-treated populations were reported. It is possible that the ∆recA strain has inherently higher mutagenesis than WT, with a larger subpopulation of resistant clones. Thus, ampicillin treatment might not, in fact, induce higher mutagenesis in ∆recA.</p><p>Summary of revised manuscript:</p><p>In their revisions, the authors have addressed my major concerns with additional experiments and changes to the text.

Using a combination of microbiological, bacterial genetics, laboratory evolution, next-generation, and live-cell imaging approaches, the authors propose short-term (transient) drug resistance evolution can take place in RecA-deficient cells in an SOS response-independent manner.

The manuscript overall has improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In our initial submission, we acknowledge that our mutation analysis was based on a limited number of replicates (n=6), which may not have been sufficient to robustly distinguish between mutation induction and selection. In response to this concern, we have substantially expanded our experimental dataset. Specifically, we redesigned the mutation rate validation experiment by increasing the number of biological replicates in each condition to 96 independent parallel cultures. This enabled us to systematically assess mutation frequency distributions under four conditions (WT, WT+ampicillin, <italic>ΔrecA</italic>, <italic>ΔrecA</italic>+ampicillin), using both maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and distribution-based fluctuation analysis (new Figure 1F, 1G, and Figure S5).</p><p>These expanded datasets revealed that:</p><p>(1) While the estimated mutation rate was significantly elevated in <italic>ΔrecA</italic>+ampicillin compared to <italic>ΔrecA</italic> alone (Fig. 1G),</p><p>(2) The distribution of mutation frequencies in <italic>ΔrecA</italic>+ampicillin was highly skewed with evident jackpot cultures (Fig. 1F), and</p><p>(3) The observed pattern significantly deviated from Poisson expectations, which is inconsistent with uniform mutagenesis and instead supports clonal selection from an early-arising mutational pool (Fig. S5).</p><p>Importantly, these new results do not contradict our original conclusions but rather extend and refine them. The previous evidence for ROS-mediated mutagenesis remains valid and is supported by our GSH experiments, transcriptomic analysis of oxidative stress genes, and DNA repair pathway repression. However, the additional data now indicate that ROS-induced variants are not uniformly induced after antibiotic exposure but are instead generated stochastically under the stress-prone <italic>ΔrecA</italic> background and then selectively enriched upon ampicillin treatment.</p><p>Taken together, we now propose a two-step model of resistance evolution in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells (new Figure 5):</p><p>Step i: RecA deficiency creates a hypermutable state through impaired repair and elevated ROS, increasing the probability of resistance-conferring mutations.</p><p>Step ii: β-lactam exposure acts as a selective bottleneck, enriching early-arising mutants that confer resistance.</p><p>We have revised both the Results and Discussion sections to clearly articulate this complementary relationship between mutational supply and selection, and we believe this integrated model better explains the observed phenotypes and mechanistic outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This study aims to demonstrate that <italic>E. coli</italic> can acquire rapid antibiotic resistance mutations in the absence of a DNA damage response. The authors employed a modified Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) workflow to investigate this, initiating the process by diluting an overnight culture 50-fold into an ampicillin selection medium. They present evidence that a recA- strain develops ampicillin resistance mutations more rapidly than the wild-type, as indicated by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and mutation frequency. Whole-genome sequencing of recA- colonies resistant to ampicillin showed predominant inactivation of genes involved in the multi-drug efflux pump system, contrasting with wild-type mutations that seem to activate the chromosomal ampC cryptic promoter. Further analysis of mutants, including a lexA3 mutant incapable of inducing the SOS response, led the authors to conclude that the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance occurs via an SOS-independent mechanism in the absence of recA. RNA sequencing suggests that antioxidative response genes drive the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in the recA- strain. They assert that rapid evolution is facilitated by compromised DNA repair, transcriptional repression of antioxidative stress genes, and excessive ROS accumulation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experiments are well-executed and the data appear reliable. It is evident that the inactivation of recA promotes faster evolutionary responses, although the exact mechanisms driving this acceleration remain elusive and deserve further investigation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some conclusions are overstated. For instance, the conclusion regarding the LexA3 allele, indicating that rapid evolution occurs in an SOS-independent manner (line 217), contradicts the introductory statement that attributes evolution to compromised DNA repair.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful observation, which highlights a central conceptual advance of our study. Our data indeed indicate that resistance evolution in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> occurs independently of canonical SOS induction (as shown by the lack of resistance in <italic>lexA3</italic>, <italic>dpiBA</italic>, and translesion polymerase mutants), yet is clearly associated with impaired DNA repair capacity (e.g., downregulation of <italic>polA</italic>, <italic>mutH</italic>, <italic>mutY</italic>).</p><p>This apparent “contradiction” reflects the dual role of RecA: it functions both as the master activator of the SOS response and as a key factor in SOS-independent repair processes. Thus, the rapid resistance evolution in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> is not due to loss of SOS, but rather due to the broader suppression of DNA repair pathways that RecA coordinates, which elevates mutational load under stress (This point is discussed in further detail in our response to Reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claim made in the discussion of Figure 3 that the hindrance of DNA repair in recA- is crucial for rapid evolution is at best suggestive, not demonstrative. Additionally, the interpretation of the PolI data implies its role, yet it remains speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and would like to respectfully clarify that our conclusion regarding the role of DNA repair impairment is supported by several independent lines of mechanistic evidence.</p><p>First, our RNA-seq analysis revealed transcriptional suppression of multiple DNA repair genes in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells following ampicillin treatment, including <italic>polA</italic> (DNA Pol I) and the base excision repair genes <italic>mutH</italic>, <italic>mutY</italic>, and <italic>mutM</italic> (Fig. 4K). This indicates that multiple repair pathways, including those responsible for correcting oxidative DNA lesions, are downregulated under these conditions.</p><p>Second, we observed a significant reduction in DNA Pol I protein expression as well as reduced colocalization with chromosomal DNA in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells, suggesting impaired engagement of repair machinery (Fig. 3C-E). These phenotypes are not limited to transcriptional signatures but extend to functional protein localization.</p><p>Third, and most importantly, resistance evolution was fully suppressed in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> cells upon co-treatment with glutathione (GSH), which reduces ROS levels. As GSH did not affect ampicillin killing (Fig. 4J), these findings suggest that mutagenesis and thus the emergence of resistance requires both ROS accumulation and the absence of efficient repair.</p><p>Therefore, we believe these data go beyond correlation and demonstrate a mechanistic role for DNA repair impairment in driving stress-associated resistance evolution in <italic>ΔrecA</italic>. We have revised the Discussion to emphasize the strength of this evidence while avoiding overstatement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2A table, mutations in amp promoters are leading to amino acid changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this inconsistency. Indeed, the <italic>ampC</italic> promoter mutations we identified reside in non-coding regulatory regions and do not result in amino acid substitutions. We have corrected the annotation in Fig. 2A and clarified in the main text that these mutations likely affect gene expression through transcriptional regulation, rather than protein sequence alteration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' assertion that ampicillin significantly influences persistence pathways in the wild-type strain, affecting quorum sensing, flagellar assembly, biofilm formation, and bacterial chemotaxis, lacks empirical validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the original version, we acknowledged transcriptional enrichment of genes related to quorum sensing, flagellar assembly, and chemotaxis in the wild-type strain upon ampicillin treatment. However, as we did not directly assess persistence phenotypes (e.g., biofilm formation or persister levels), we agree that such functional inferences were not fully supported. We have revised the relevant statements to focus solely on transcriptomic changes and have removed language suggesting direct effects on persistence pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1G suggests that recA cells treated with ampicillin exhibit a strong mutator phenotype; however, it remains unclear if this can be linked to the mutations identified in Figure 2's sequencing analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. This point is discussed in further detail in our response to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>In the present work, Zhang et al investigate involvement of the bacterial DNA damage repair SOS response in the evolution of beta-lactam drug resistance evolution in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Using a combination of microbiological, bacterial genetics, laboratory evolution, next-generation, and live-cell imaging approaches, the authors propose short-term (transient) drug resistance evolution can take place in RecA-deficient cells in an SOS response-independent manner. They propose the evolvability of drug resistance is alternatively driven by the oxidative stress imposed by accumulation of reactive oxygen species and compromised DNA repair. Overall, this is a nice study that addresses a growing and fundamental global health challenge (antimicrobial resistance).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors introduce new concepts to antimicrobial resistance evolution mechanisms. They show short-term exposure to beta-lactams can induce durably fixed antimicrobial resistance mutations. They propose this is due to comprised DNA repair and oxidative stress. Antibiotic resistance evolution under transient stress is poorly studied, so the authors' work is a nice mechanistic contribution to this field.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors do not show any direct evidence of altered mutation rate or accumulated DNA damage in their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. This point is discussed in further detail in our response to Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I would like to suggest two minor changes to the text.</p><p>(1) Re. WGS data.</p><p>The authors write in their response &quot;We appreciate your concern regarding potential inconsistencies in the WGS methodology. However, we would like to clarify that the primary aim of the WGS experiment was to identify the types of mutations present in the wild type and ΔrecA strains after treatment of ampicillin, rather than to quantify or compare mutation frequencies. This purpose was explicitly stated in the manuscript.</p><p>I think the source of my confusion stemmed from this part in the text:</p><p>&quot;In bacteria, resistance to most antibiotics requires the accumulation of drug resistance associated DNA mutations developed over time to provide high levels of resistance (29).

ID-ing mutations). The current phrase can give the impression that WGS was used to validate rapid or high mutagenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have revised this description to “In bacteria, resistance to most antibiotics requires the accumulation of drug resistance associated DNA mutations that can arise stochastically and, under stress conditions, become enriched through selection over time to confer high levels of resistance (33). Having observed a non-random and right-skewed distribution of mutation frequencies in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> isolates following ampicillin exposure, we next sought to determine whether specific resistance-conferring mutations were enriched in <italic>ΔrecA</italic> isolates following antibiotic exposure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Re. whether the mutations are &quot;induced&quot; or &quot;pre-existing.&quot;</p><p>The authors write:</p><p>&quot;We appreciate your detailed feedback on the language used to describe our data. We understand the concern regarding the use of the term &quot;induced&quot; in relation to beta-lactam exposure. To clarify, we employed not only beta-lactam antibiotics but also other antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol, in our experiments (data not shown). However, we observed that beta-lactam antibiotics specifically induced the emergence of resistance or altered the MIC in our bacterial populations. If resistance had pre-existed before antibiotic exposure, we would expect other antibiotics to exhibit a similar selective effect, particularly given the potential for cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics.&quot;</p><p>I think it is important to discuss the negative data for the other antibiotics (along with the other points made in your Reviewer response) in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is discussed in further detail in our response to Reviewer 1 (Public Review).</p></body></sub-article></article>
