accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS comprising the peripheral sensory vomeronasal organ has evolved elaborate molecular and cellular mechanisms to detect chemo signals. To gain insight into the cell types, developmental gene expression patterns, and functional differences amongst neurons, we performed single-cell transcriptomics of the mouse vomeronasal sensory epithelium.

The rodent VNO neuroepithelium consists of two major neuronal subtypes, that are defined primarily based on the expression of two distinct families of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated G protein alpha subunit: vomeronasal type-I GPCRs (V1R) with G⍺i2 subunit (Gnai2) neurons or vomeronasal type-2 GPCRs (V2R) with G⍺o subunit (Gnao1) neurons. V1R and V2R expressing neurons are spatially segregated within the neuroepithelium, and project to distinct locations in the accessory olfactory bulb along the anterior-posterior axis. Functional evidence suggests that V1R and V2R neurons may recognize ligands that mediate different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oboti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trouillet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pallé et al., 2020</xref>). However, we currently lack a comprehensive mapping of receptor-ligand interactions and how these lead to distinct behaviors. Cognate ligand binding in both Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons, is thought to signal via the phospholipase-c pathway which results in the activation of the VNO-specific cation channel, Trpc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zufall, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), neurons regenerate throughout life, continuously differentiating from a stem cell population into neurons and supporting cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fletcher et al., 2017</xref>). Neuronal differentiation is also associated with the expression of a single GPCR to the exclusion of many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanchate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), leading to the hallmark feature termed as ‘one neuron one receptor (ONOR)’ rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serizawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serizawa et al., 2003</xref>). VNO sensory neurons (VSNs) also continuously regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber and Raisman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>) from a stem cell population, and differentiating cells take on the identity of supporting cells and mature neurons of either the Gnao1 or Gnai2 sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katreddi et al., 2022</xref>). While Gnai2 neurons seem to largely follow the ONOR rule in expressing one V1R gene per neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Serizawa et al., 2004</xref>), Gnao1 neurons seemingly deviate from this rule by co-expressing a combination of GPCRs. Thus, each Gnao1 neuron expresses a single V2R gene from the ABD family as well as a member of the C family V2R genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silvotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2011</xref>). In addition, further molecular diversification of Gnao1 neurons occurs due to combinatorial co-expression of a family of non-classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes, H2-M<italic>v</italic>, that are co-expressed along with V2Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishii et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loconto et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>). A few combinations of V2R and H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression have been identified, indicating that these co-expression patterns are non-random and could be functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishii et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loconto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silvotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishii and Mombaerts, 2011</xref>). However, identifying the precise combinatorial expressions of V2R-ABD, V2R-C and H2-M<italic>v</italic> has been elusive, partly due to the challenges in generating RNA or antibody reagents to identify closely homologous genes, combined with the challenges with multiplexing more than three targets.</p><p>Starting with a common progenitor population, how do cells of the VNO sensory epithelium diversify in their gene expression patterns that define the sensory neuron types? Recent studies using single-cell transcriptomic analysis have implicated Notch signaling along with downstream transcription factors, <italic>Tfap2e</italic>, <italic>Bcl11b</italic> to play a role in specifying the fates of developing VSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enomoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katreddi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). As the progenitor cells differentiate to mature neurons, transcriptional reprogramming downstream to Notch signaling leads to distinct neuronal populations: Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons. While these studies identified transcription factors, it is not clear whether the two major differentiated VSN subtypes expressing Gnao1-V2Rs or Gnai2-V1Rs fundamentally differ in their cellular properties.</p><p>Here, we applied a multilevel transcriptomics approach which bundles single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) validated by low-level spatial transcriptomics to characterize gene expression of the mouse VNO sensory epithelium. Our results identified genes specifically expressed in sensory, and non-sensory cell types and the divergence of gene expression between Gnao1 - Gnai2 neurons at different maturation stages. Analysis of mature neurons provided a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of VR and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes. Surprisingly, mature Gnao1 neurons revealed a significant enrichment of endoplasmic reticulum-related gene transcripts and proteins, which is indicative of a fundamental divergence in cellular function between these cell types. Electron microscopy further revealed a hypertrophic ER ultrastructure consisting of gyroid cubic membrane morphology, more prevalent in Gnao1 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptome of mouse vomeronasal neuroepithelium</title><p>We standardized VNO neuroepithelium dissociation to obtain a single-cell suspension along with optimizing cell viability.

This resulted in 13 clusters (labeled n1-n13), which potentially represent distinct neuronal sub-populations within the broadly defined Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We asked the question, to what extent do VRs influence neuronal sub clustering. Exclusion of VRs from clustering parameters did not affect the divergence of mature neurons into Gnai2 /Gnao1 and only selectively affected some of the subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), thus indicating that neuronal subtype identity was governed by gene expression differences beyond vomeronasal GPCRs.</p><p>Since immature neurons are separated into two clusters expressing Gnao1 or Gnai2, these imply a possible branch point in the developmental trajectory towards mature neurons. To confirm this, we performed pseudo-time analysis on neurons using Slingshot, and progenitor neurons (cluster n5) as a start/anchor point. For the purpose of developmental analysis, we merged subclusters within mature Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons. The trajectory of development confirms a split of immature <italic>Gap43</italic> +neurons into Gnao1 or Gnai2 cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This analysis resulted in the identification of multiple co-expressing V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes per cell. The chance that a combinatorial pattern identified can be due to a doublet is dependent on the frequency of expression of that gene. Therefore, for abundantly expressed family C V2Rs, it is possible some combinatorial patterns may be from doublets. But in the case of family ABD V2Rs, the probability of a particular combination falsely identified due to a doublet more than once is very low. Hence, we assigned a threshold for combinatorial co-expression patterns that are identified in two or more cells to be more reliable.

This rules out the possibility of dataset-specific artifacts leading to spurious co-expression patterns. Altogether, these data validate the co-expression analysis methodology and identify novel combinatorial co-expression patterns of V2Rs and H2Mv genes.</p><p>We next asked, whether the total GPCR or H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression level is regulated or capped in a single-cell? To answer this question, we calculated the total family-C-V2R, ABD-V2R, and H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression in a single-cell that either expresses one member or multiple members of each family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>). The results showed that when cells express more than one V2R, total V2R expression of either family-C or family-ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>) scales up proportional to a total number of expressed V2Rs of that family. This is also true in the case of multiple H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression where total H2-M<italic>v</italic> expression is proportional to the number of H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed in a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). As a control, and to eliminate the possibility of doublets, we see that the levels of Gnao1 do not change with a number of V2Rs or H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed in a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we performed a similar co-expression analysis for V1Rs with a threshold value of 2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In similarity to the pattern observed for ABD-V2Rs, most Gnai2 neurons expressed a single V1R per cell with some cells co-expressing two V1Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B and A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Some of these V1R combinations have been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Even in the case of Gnai2 neurons, total V1R expression in the cells that co-express two receptors is higher compared to cells that express one GPCR with Gnai2 levels being same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>), indicating that these measurements are from singlet cells. Due to the stringent expression threshold, it is possible that VRs expressed at very low levels were not considered and thereby leading to neurons where zero VRs are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). However, these neurons express other genes like neuronal marker Gnai2 at same level as other neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>) ruling out the possibility of them being debris. Collectively, these data reveal the patterns of GPCR, and H2-M<italic>v</italic> co-expression in VNO neurons, which is likely to be instrumental in deciphering how these neurons respond to a single or combination of stimuli, as well as the cellular mechanisms that orchestrate these expression patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Divergent gene expression profile of mature Gnao1 and Gnai2 neurons</title><p>Since the exclusion of VR genes did not fundamentally alter the clustering and divergence into mature Gnai2 /Gnao1 neurons, we decided to investigate the gene expression differences between these neurons by performing differential gene expression analysis of mature Gnao1 (cluster 14 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and Gnai2 neurons (cluster 7, 16 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and identified 924 differentially expressed genes with at least log2 fold change of 1 and adjusted p-value &lt;10e-6.

Some V1Rs were found to consistently co-express in Gnai2 neurons and the major combinations observed from our analysis (such as Vmn1r85/86, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), match those identified recently from a functional single-cell study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), leading confidence to the methodology used in our co-expression analysis. Receptors of the ABD-V2R subfamilies are also mostly expressed at one receptor per neuron, with notable exceptions being the observed combinations of <italic>Vmn2r20/22</italic> and <italic>Vmn2r39/43/50</italic> being co-expressed per cell.</p><p>In our study, the analysis of family-C, family ABD-V2Rs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes expressed per cell, confirmed the earlier reported sub-division of basal/Gnao1 neurons into those that express either <italic>Vmn2r1</italic> (family-C1) or <italic>Vmn2r2-Vmn2r7</italic> (family-C2), resulting in a broad four-part division of mature VNO neurons: those expressing (a) <italic>Gnai2</italic>/V1Rs, (b) <italic>Gnao1</italic>/<italic>Vmn2r1</italic>, (c) <italic>Gnao1</italic>/<italic>Vmn2r2-2r7</italic>; H2-M<italic>v</italic>+, (d) <italic>Gnao1</italic>/<italic>Vmn2r2-2r7</italic>; H2-M<italic>v</italic>-. The co-expression of ABD-V2R sub-families A1-A5 and most of the H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes with <italic>Vmn2r2</italic>/family-C2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>, <bold>cluster n3, n2,</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) as well as preferential co-expression of A6-A9, B, D, E sub-families with Vmn2r1 along with exclusion of H2M<italic>v</italic> genes from these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), points to the overall non-random logic of V2R/H2Mv co-expression. It would be interesting to see how receptor deorphanization and future functional experiments will map onto these elaborate co-expression patterns. At the same time, there were notable deviations observed from these rules, namely the restricted and sparse expression of <italic>H2-M1/M9/M11</italic> with <italic>Vmn2r1</italic> neurons in cluster n4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and E</xref>), where the receptors <italic>Vmn2r81</italic>/<italic>82</italic> are also expressed selectively in these neurons.</p><p>Of note, the combined expression of VR/H2-M<italic>v</italic> in a cell is not capped and is proportional to a number of VRs and H2-Mv genes expressed in that cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>). It would be interesting to see whether the levels of co-expressing transcripts also translate to protein levels in cells and their impact on functional interactions, if any, between co-expressed proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ER environment in VNO neurons</title><p>When comparing gene expression amongst Gnai2/Gnao1 mature neurons, what stood out was the unexpected enrichment of gene ontology terms associated with ER functions within Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and E</xref>). Most of these ER-Gnao1 enriched genes from our dataset, match the ones identified from a similar comparison by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2022</xref>, supporting our findings. We validated several of these ER genes via RNA-ISH to be exclusively expressed or enriched in Gnao1 neurons. Even more puzzling was our observation that this enrichment pattern extended at the protein level to many ER proteins probed by immune labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In some cases, both RNA and proteins were Gnao1 enriched, whereas in others, RNA levels were comparable but protein levels were biased towards Gnao1 cells. The enrichment of ER genes/proteins via transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms presents a new feature of these cell types that could be associated with their differentiation and function. High levels of several chaperones such as Creld2, Dnajc3, Pdia6, PDI, Hspa5/Bip, Grp94, and Calnexin in Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) compared to Gnai2 neurons indicates a chaperone rich ER environment in these neurons. The chaperone Calr4 has been shown to be enriched in Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). Our observations indicate that the enrichment of chaperones is a generalized feature of Gnao1 neurons that extends to several other genes/proteins of related function and localization.</p><p>Since it has been proposed that the V2R family is an evolutionarily recent acquisition in rodents and marsupials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takigami et al., 2004</xref>) and sub-family members, such as sub-family-C2, A1-A6 V2Rs, as well as H2-M<italic>v</italic> genes have evolved in Muridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silvotti et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that mouse Gnao1 neurons may have required to co-evolve ER protein folding mechanisms to handle multiple GPCR/H2-M<italic>v</italic> co-expression and their putative protein interactions. In addition to our observations on the generalized upregulation of ER genes in Gnao1 neurons, it may be possible that some specific ER genes are also necessary for proper folding of vomeronasal type-2 GCPRs. These data and observations assume significance given the well-recognized fact that functional reconstitution of these GPCRs and H2-M<italic>v</italic> molecules in heterologous cells remains a persistent challenge, with some success being reported using the chaperone <italic>Calr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, olfactory receptors have been shown to co-opt the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway via the ER proteins PERK/CHOP and transcription factor ATF5 as a mechanism for their functional expression, setting the stage for ONOR expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>). ATF5 is observed in the VNO, however, it is reported to be broadly expressed across Gnai2 and Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalton, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalton, 2018a</xref>),. Further experiments are required to evaluate whether V2Rs and Gnao1 neurons adopt similar mechanisms and how the chaperone-rich ER environment observed here might impact the expression, folding of GPCRs, and neuronal function.</p><p>It is worth noting that in addition to the expression of ER chaperones in Gnao1 neurons, we also observed distinctly higher levels of ER structural and membrane proteins. Levels of membrane curvature stabilizing proteins - Reep5, NogoB/Reticulon4B, the three-way junction formation protein - Atlastin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goyal and Blackstone, 2013</xref>), ER sheet lumen spacer protein - Climp-63/Ckap4 as well as Sec61β - a commonly used ER membrane marker were all observed to be high in Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, it is possible that an added layer of complexity could involve modulation of total ER content or ER structure in Gnao1 neuronal subtypes. Our electron microcopy results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed a strikingly higher smooth ER membrane content in Gnao1 neurons compared to Gnai2 neurons. Interestingly, this ER adopts a cubic membrane architecture, packing the Gnao1 neuron cell body with a gyroid/sinusoidal membrane. Early electron microscopy studies in rodents, identified that smooth ER content is higher in VSNs than in olfactory sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciges et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breipohl et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taniguchi and Mochizuki, 1982</xref>), however, these studies preceded the discovery of Gnao1-Gnai2 dichotomy. To our knowledge, Breipohl and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breipohl et al., 1981</xref>) reported the presence of smooth ER whorls in VSNs, later termed as cubic membranes. Future studies using serial section EM would be instrumental in reconstructing the 3D architecture of VSN ER.</p><p>Cubic membranes, representing highly curved periodic structures, have been observed in a variety of biological contexts, however, their functional significance has been harder to pin down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almsherqi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almsherqi et al., 2009</xref>). In the context of VNO, and in particular Gnao1 neurons, we speculate that the high ER content and dense packing in the form of cubic membranes, could indicate a perpetual stress-like state in these neurons, necessary to address unique folding requirements of V2R or H2-M<italic>v</italic> proteins. For instance, the maturation of these proteins and their proper folding or multimerization may require a slower transit through the ER, necessitating the sinusoidal arrangement of ER membranes. Likewise, the V2R biosynthetic processes in Gnao1 neurons may require enhanced levels of ER chaperones, which could in turn induce ER membranes into a homeostatic response. Can V2Rs themselves trigger the upregulation of ER chaperones and the hypertrophic ER, or are these cellular characteristics established before the onset of V2R expression? From our single-cell transcriptomics data, we tried to identify at what stage ER chaperones express during the developmental trajectory of VSNs. We observed that the onset of <italic>Vmn2r1</italic> expression coincides with the upregulation of ER chaperones in cluster n6 immature Gnao1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). However, some Gnao1 cells show upregulated ER gene expression without <italic>Vmn2r1</italic>/<italic>Vmn2r2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), hence further experiments are needed to dissect the mechanism and precise relationship between neuronal differentiation, GPCR expression, and ER chaperones as well as ER ultrastructure.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Onset of vomeronasal type-2 GPCR (V2R) expression coincides with the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Feature Plot showing the expression of Gnao1, Vmn2r1, Sdf1l1, and Manf.

The ER genes and their Gnao1 biased expression we identified, could be downstream targets of specific transcription factors and as a result of neuronal differentiation, while functionally these could be required for the proper folding and co-expression of V2R GPCRs. The developmental trajectory of VSNs into Gnai2/Gnao1 neurons via transcription factors and their differential ER environment is summarized as a model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, the comprehensive scRNA seq analysis presented in this study contributes valuable insights into the complexity of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium, offering a roadmap for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying sensory perception and neural development in this specialized sensory organ. Vomeronasal neurons may also serve as a model system to study specialized ER structure-function relationships and their role in the maturation of GPCR-expressing neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

VNOs were dissected from male and female animals (six male, 10 female) and processed separately. The sensory epithelium was separated using forceps and immediately placed in EBSS equilibrated with 95% CO<sub>2,</sub> and 5% O<sub>2</sub>. 60 U of DNase was added to the prewarmed PDB made earlier and 3 mL of it was transferred to a single well of 12-well dish. Neuroepithelial tissue from multiple animals was transferred to this well containing the final dissociation buffer and was cut into small pieces, and the suspension was transferred to a 14 mL tube and was incubated with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 30 min on a thermomixer (Eppendorf) by passing 95% CO<sub>2</sub>,5% O<sub>2</sub> on top of the liquid headspace. During this incubation, the solution was triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette every 10 min and at the end of the incubation. After incubation, the suspension was passed sequentially through 70 µm, and 35 µm filters to remove tissue debris. The filtered suspension was further layered over a mix of ovomucoid inhibitor (2.5 mg/mL) and albumin (2.5 mg/mL) in EBSS and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature to remove subcellular debris or membrane fragments.

After normalization, the top 2000 variable genes in the dataset were identified using the <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> function using mean.function=ExpMean, dispersion.function=LogVMR, x.low.cutoff=0.0125, x.high.cutoff=3, y.cutoff=0.5 as parameters.

Data was scaled and centered using <italic>ScaleData</italic> using the default model by regressing out a percentage of mitochondrial genes and the total number of RNA molecules per cell to remove their contribution in downstream analysis. The basis of scaling for each gene is by subtracting the mean from the value and dividing the difference by the standard deviation. To cluster the cells, we initially performed principal component analysis (PCA) with 50 components using <italic>RunPCA</italic>. We used elbow plot and Jack Straw plot and determined the optimum number of dimensions required for the next steps of clustering as 37. Graph-based clustering was performed using Seurat’s <italic>FindNeighbours</italic> function to identify the neighboring cells that share similar expression patterns in a network constructed in PCA space with 37 dimensions. Later the clusters were identified by using the <italic>FindClusters</italic> function by varying the resolution parameter from 0.2 to 0.8. The resolution parameter 0.3 was chosen, as it shows minimum overlapping markers upon plotting the heatmap of gene markers for each cluster identified by the <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> function. To clean up the dataset further, cells (408) expressing the Hbb-bs gene were considered as RBC contamination, and a cluster (215 cells) enriched with mitochondrial genes indicative of dying cells was removed from the data.

The data was scaled again, PCA was performed, the number of principal components was determined, and clustering was performed as described above with resolution = 0.4 to define neuronal subtypes. To compare the results of clustering with and without VRs, a new Seurat object– ‘neurons_no_VR’ was created by removing all vomeronasal receptors from the variable gene set. Dimensionality reduction, and clustering were performed again using the same method mentioned above. Seurat’s query to reference mapping module was used to project the neurons_no_VR object in the same UMAP space as the neurons object so that UMAPs are comparable.

To make the signal intensities along the apical-basal axis across different images and antibodies comparable, the signal intensity and length of ROI were normalized by min-max normalization,<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>`</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the measured or actual value, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">min</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> are minimum and maximum values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, respectively.

Dissected VNO was embedded in 2% agarose and coronal sections of 400 um were obtained on a vibratome in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Sections were fixed with Karnovsky’s fixative (3% PFA + 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate) for up to 1 wkk. Subsequent processing steps were similar to those described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Terasaki et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, vibratome sections were rinsed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate and then immersed in 1% osmium, and 0.8% potassium ferricyanide in the cacodylate buffer for 1 hr. This was followed by incubation in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 hr, then 30 min in lead aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walton, 1979</xref>), dehydration in graded ethanol, infiltration with epon resin then embedding and polymerization at 60 °C for 2 d. Serial 70 nm thick sections were collected using a Powertome automated tape collector (RMC Boeckeler, Tucson, AZ). The tape was mounted on a silicon wafer, carbon coated, and imaged with a field emission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher/FEI Verios, Hillsboro, OR). Backscatter electrons were imaged from a 5 keV/0.8 nanoAmp beam of electrons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2. Using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data, the authors identified three Gnai2+ VSN subtypes and a single Gnao1+ VSN type. To study VSN developmental trajectories, Devakinandan and colleagues took advantage of the constant renewal of the neuronal VSN pool, which allowed them to harvest all maturation states. All neurons were re-clustered and a pseudotime analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the emergence of two pools of Gap43+ clusters from a common lineage, which differentiate into many subclusters of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. By comparing the transcriptomes of these two pools of immature VSNs, the authors identified a number of differentially expressed transcription factors in addition to known markers. Next, by comparing the transcriptomes of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs, the authors report an enrichment of ER-related genes in Gnao1+ VSNs. Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons. Finally, the authors characterized chemosensory receptor expression and co-expression (as well as H2-Mv proteins) in mature VSNs, which recapitulated known patterns.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data presented here provide new and interesting perspectives on the distinguishing features between Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. These features include newly identified markers, such as transcription factors, as well as an unsuspected ER-related peculiarity in Gnao1+ neurons, consisting in a hypertrophic ER and an enrichment in ER-related genes. In addition, the authors provide a comprehensive picture of specific co-expression patterns of V2R chemoreceptors and H2-Mv genes.</p><p>Importantly, the authors provide a browser (scVNOexplorer) for anyone to explore the data, including gene expression and co-expression, number and proportion of cells, with a variety of graphical tools (violin plots, feature plots, dot plots, ...).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98250.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Devakinandan</surname><given-names>GVS</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hyderabad</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Terasaki</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UConn Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Farmington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dani</surname><given-names>Adish</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hyderabad</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Devakinandan et al. present a revised version of their manuscript.

To address this concern, the authors should also show the raw counts for Gnao1 as well as the total number of UMIs for these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4I, 4K and Figure 4-Figure supplement 4C, on Y-axis, we plotted the sum of normalized counts of all V1R/V2R/H2-Mv genes expressed in each cell along with the normalized expression value of Gnao1/Gnai2. Both VR/H2-Mv and Gnao1/Gnai2 are normalized values, with normalization based on LogNormalize (mentioned in methods). We show here plots of total expression calculated from raw counts corresponding to the same Figure. Raw counts of VRs/H2-Mv, Gnao1/Gnai2 are plotted separately due to difference in scale. The overall trend matches normalized counts, with minor fluctuations in Gnao1/Gnai2.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98250-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As mentioned in our response to version-1 reviews and in our manuscript, doublets generally are a random combination of two cells and the probability that a combinatorial pattern is due to doublet is proportional to the abundance of cells expressing those genes. It is possible that some of the family-C V2R combinations represented by 2 cells are doublets because of their widespread expression. The frequency of combinatorial expression patterns, greater than a set threshold of 2 cells, that we observed for family ABD V2Rs or V1Rs (supplementary tables 7, 8) is an indication of co-expression and unlikely from random doublets.

VSNs are known to arise from a common pool of progenitors that differentiate into two distinct populations characterized by the expression of either the G protein subunit Gnao1 or Gnai2. Using single-cell RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data, the authors identified three Gnai2+ VSN subtypes and a single Gnao1+ VSN type. To study VSN developmental trajectories, Devakinandan and colleagues took advantage of the constant renewal of the neuronal VSN pool, which allowed them to harvest all maturation states. All neurons were re-clustered and a pseudotime analysis was performed. The analysis revealed the emergence of two pools of Gap43+ clusters from a common lineage, which differentiate into many subclusters of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs. By comparing the transcriptomes of these two pools of immature VSNs, the authors identified a number of differentially expressed transcription factors in addition to known markers. Next, by comparing the transcriptomes of mature Gnao1+ and Gnai2+ VSNs, the authors report an enrichment of ER-related genes in Gnao1+ VSNs. Using electron microscopy, they found that this enrichment was associated with specific ER morphology in Gnao1+ neurons.

The main advances in this manuscript are to identify and verify the differential expression of genes that distinguish apical and basal vomeronasal neurons. The authors also identify the enriched expression of ER-related genes in Gnao1 neurons, which they verify with in situ hybridizations and immunostaining, and also explore via electron microscopy. Finally, the results of this manuscript are presented in an online R shiny app. Overall, these data are a useful resource to the community. I have a few concerns about the manuscript, which I've listed below.</p><p>General Concerns:</p><p>(1) The authors mention that they were unable to identify the cells in cluster 13. This cluster looks similar to the &quot;secretory VSN&quot; subtype described in a recent preprint from C. Ron Yu's lab (10.1101/2024.02.22.581574). The authors could try comparing or integrating their data with this dataset (or that in Katreddi et al. 2022) to see if this is a common cell type across datasets (or arises from a specific type of cell doublets). In situ hybridizations for some of the marker genes for this cluster could also highlight where in the VNO these cells reside.</p></disp-quote><p>Cluster13 (Obp2a+) cells identified in our study have similar gene expression markers to “putative secretory” cells mentioned in Hills et al.. At the time this manuscript was available publicly, our publication was already communicated. We have now performed RNA-ISH to Obp2a, the topmost marker identified with this cluster, and found it to be expressed in cells from glandular tissue on the non-sensory side. Some of the other markers associated with this cluster such as Obp2b, Lcn3, belong to the lipocalin family of proteins. Hence in our estimate these markers collectively represent non-sensory glandular tissue. We have added Obp2a RNA-ISH to Figure 2-figure supplement-1A and results section in our revised manuscript. Cluster-13 also has cells expressing Vmn1r37, which typically is expressed in neuronal cells. However, we do not see Obp2a mRNA in the sensory epithelium. It is possible that cluster-13 comprises a heterogenous mixture of cells, some of which are clearly non-sensory cells from glandular tissue, co-clustered with other cell types as well as a possibility that Obp2a is expressed below the detection level of our assay in neurons, which will require further experiments. We do not have any possible reason to confidently assign this cluster as a neuronal cell type, hence, we excluded it in downstream analysis of neurons.</p><p>We used the data from Hills et al., to compare co-expression characteristic of V2Rs, which is added as Figure 3-figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I found the UMAPs for the neurons somewhat difficult to interpret. Unlike Katreddi et al. 2022 or Hills et al. 2024, it's tricky to follow the developmental trajectories of the cells in the UMAP space. Perhaps the authors could try re-embedding the data using gene sets that don't include the receptors? It would also be interesting to see if the neuron clusters still cluster by receptor-type even when the receptors are excluded from the gene sets used for clustering. Plots relating the original clusters to the neuronal clusters, or dot plots showing marker gene expression for the neuronal clusters might both be useful. For example, right now it's difficult to interpret clusters like n8-13.</p></disp-quote><p>a) We have revised the UMAP in Figure 3A, and labeled mature, immature, progenitor neurons so that it is easier to follow the developmental trajectory.</p><p>b) In our revised text we have explicitly drawn equivalence between neuronal clusters from Figure 1 to re-clustered neurons in subsequent figures (Figure 3 and 4 in revised submission). For developmental analysis, we merged mature Gnao1, Gnai2 neuronal subclusters to two major clusters that are equivalent to original neuronal clusters in Figure 1. As UMAP is an arbitrary representation of cells, we also show expression of markers for major neuronal cell types in Figure 1C and Figure 3-figure supplement 1B, helpful in making the connection.</p><p>c) The purpose of re-clustering with higher resolution was to identify sub-populations within Gnao1 and Gnai1 neurons. It was useful to make sense of mature Gnao1 neurons, where family-C Vmn2r and H2-Mv expression maps onto distinct subclusters. Along with neuronal subclusters in revised Figure 3-figure supplement-1 we include a dot plot of gene expression markers.</p><p>d) In Figure 3-figure supplement-2, we show a comparison of neuronal clusters with and without VRs. Exclusion of VRs did not substantially alter mature neuron dichotomy into Gnao1/Gnai2. Only Gnao1 subclusters n1/n3 whose organization is dependent on family-C Vmn2r expression were affected, as well as redistribution of subcluster n8 from Gnai2 neurons. VR expression does not seem to be the primary determinant of VSN cluster identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study focuses on the vomeronasal organ, the peripheral chemosensory organ of the accessory olfactory system, by employing single-cell transcriptomics.

The Seurat package has many available pipelines for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, with a significant impact on the output data. How did the authors pre-process and normalize the data? Was the pipeline used with default settings? What batch correction method was applied to the data to mitigate possible sampling or technical effects? Moreover, the authors do not describe how cell and gene filtering was performed. The data in Figure 7-Supplement 3 show that one-sixth of the V1Rs do not express any chemoreceptor, while over a hundred cells express more than one chemoreceptor. Do these cells have unusually high or low numbers of genes or counts? To exclude the possibility of a technical artifact in these observations, the authors should describe how they dealt with putative doublet cells or debris. Surprisingly, some clusters are characterized by the expression of specific chemoreceptors (VRs). Have these been used for clustering? If so, clustering should be repeated after excluding these receptors.</p><p>The identification of the VSN types should be consistent across the different analyses and validated. The data presented in Figure 1 lists four mature VSN types, whereas the re-clustering of neurons presented in Figure 3 leads to a different subdivision. At present, it remains unclear whether these clusters reflect the biology of the system or are due to over-clustering of the data, and therefore correspond to either noise or arbitrary splitting of continua. Clusters should be merged if they do not correspond to discrete categories of cells, and correspondence should be established between the different clustering analyses. To validate the detected clusters as cell types, markers characteristic of each of these populations can be evaluated by ISH or IHC.</p><p>There is a lack of quantification of imaging data, which provides little support for the ERrelated main claim. Quantification of co-expression and statistics on labeling intensity or coverage would greatly strengthen the conclusions and the title of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>a) scRNA-seq data analysis methods: Our revised submission has expanded on the methods section with details of parameters, filtering criterion and software used.</p><p>b) Inclusion/exclusion of VRs: Figure 3-Figure supplement-2 of our revised submission shows a comparison of neuronal sub-clusters with and without VRs. Overall sub-cluster identities were not affected by VR exclusion, except for Gnao1 sub-clusters n1/n3 -governed by family C Vmn2r1/Vmn2r2 and redistribution of Gnai2 cluster n8. The minimal effect of VRs on Gnai2 sub-clustering can also be confirmed by lack of V1R in the dot plot showing markers of neuronal clusters.</p><p>c) Neuronal clusters and potential over-clustering: we pooled neuronal cells from Figure-1 and re-clustered to identify sub-populations within Gnao1 and Gnai1 neurons. Several neuronal sub-clusters identified by us including progenitors, immature neurons and mature neurons are validated by previous studies with wellknown markers. Amongst the mature neurons, the biological basis of four Gnao1 neuron sub-clusters (n1-n4) is discussed in our co-expression section (Figure 4AE) and these are also validated by previous experimental studies. These Gnao1 clusters are organized according to the expression of family-C V2Rs (Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2) as well as H2M_v_ genes. Within Gnai2 sub-clusters, n12 and n13 exclusively express markers that distinguish them from n8-n11 which we have described in our revised version. However, n8-n11 do not have definitive markers and whether these sub-clusters are part of a continuum or over-clustered, will require further extensive experiments and analysis. We prefer to show all subclusters, including Gnai2 sub-clusters, in Figure 3-Figure supplement-1, along with a dot plot of sub-cluster gene expression, so that this data is available for future experiments and analysis. We share the concern that some Gnai2 sub-clusters may not have an obvious biological basis at this time. Hence in our revised submission, we have merged mature Gnao1 and mature Gnai2 sub-clusters for the developmental analysis shown in Figure 3A.</p><p>d) Quantification of the ER phenotype: In our revised submission, we provide extensive quantification of the ER phenotype in Figure 7, Figure7-figure supplement-1.</p><p>e) We think that the cells expressing zero as well as two V1Rs are real and cannot be attributed to debris or doublets for the following reasons:</p><p>i) Cells expressing no V1Rs are not necessarily debris because they express other neuronal markers at the same level as cells that express one or two V1Rs. For instance, Gnai2 expression level across cells expressing 0, 1, 2 V1Rs is the same, which we have included in Figure 4-figure supplement 4-C of our revised submission. Higher expression threshold value used in our analysis may have somewhat increased the proportion of cells with zero V1Rs. Similarly, Gnao1 levels across cells expressing multiple V2Rs and H2-M_v_ per cell stay the same, indicating that these are unlikely to be doublets (Figure 4 I-K). The frequency of each co-expression combination (Supplementary Table 7 and 8) itself is an indication of whether it is represented by a single cell or an artifact.</p><p>ii) Cells co-expressing V1R genes: We listed the frequency of cells co-expressing V1R gene combinations in Supplementary table - 8. Among 134 cells that express two V1Rs, 44 cells express Vmn1r85+Vmn1r86, 21 express Vmn1r184+Vmn1r185, 13 express Vmn1r56+Vmn1r57, 6 express Vmn1r168+Vmn1r177, and so on. Doublets generally are a random combination of two cells. Here, each specific co-expression combination represents multiple cells and is highly unlikely by random chance. Some of the co-expression combinations we reported were also identified and verified experimentally in Lee et al., 2019 and Hills et. al., 2024.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>The editor had a query about the analysis of FPRs, which are a third family of sensory receptors in the rodent VNO.</p></disp-quote><p>FPRs were found in our study as expressed in subsets of Gnai2 and Gnao1 neurons as well as non-neuronal cells.

This led us to hypothesize a differential ER content or ultrastructure, which was verified by EM. We have also addressed the question of whether upregulation of mRNAs related to ER proteins results in their increased levels (Figure 7-figure supplement-2). In some cases, for example Hspa5 (Bip), mRNA as well as protein levels are upregulated in Gnao1 neurons (see Figure 3A volcano plot, Figure 5-figure supplement-1 RNA-ISH, Figure 7-figure supplement-1 comparison of mRNA levels, Figure 7F immunofluorescence). However, there are other genes in the same figures, for which mRNA levels are not upregulated, yet protein levels are higher in Gnao1 neurons. As mentioned in our text and discussion, upregulated mRNA levels as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms are both likely to play a role in upregulating ER protein levels in Gnao1 neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 3, the authors seemed to exclude cluster 13 from Figure1 in the pseudotime analysis without justification.</p></disp-quote><p>Cluster13 has markers such as Obp2a, Obp2b, Lcn3.

It is possible that cluster-13 comprises a heterogenous mixture of cells, some of which are non-sensory glandular cells, co-clustered with other cell types as well as the possibility that Obp2a is expressed in neurons, below the detection level of our assay.

However, the lack of quantification for the ER phenotype is a concern. For example, does the ER area of a given cell correlate with the relative position of the cells along the apical-basal axis of the vomeronasal organ? What about the ER morphology in the progenitor cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We show here a quantification of the ER area from the low magnification EM image shown in Figure 8A. The ER area shows an increase going towards the basal side of the cross-section. However, this quantification is complicated by the following factors: (a) Processing for EM, results in some shrinkage of the tissue, (b) Gnao1 neurons follow an invaginating pattern in cross-sections. Due to these reasons, some Gnao1 neurons could come very close to, and at times lie adjacent to Gnai2 neurons in EM cross-section. Due to a lack of contrast, it is harder to identify the ER within the cell at low mag, especially in the apical zone. The plot shown here does indicate that roughly, the ER area of a cell correlates with its position along the apical-basal axis. In our revised submission, we have quantified the fluorescence intensities of various ER proteins along the apical basal axis from confocal images (Figure 7, Figure 7-figure supplement-1).</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>ROIs (yellow) are manually drawn in the sensory epithelium, wherever possible to identify ER without ambiguity.</title><p>Area and centroid of ROI are calculated and x coordinates of centroid of each ROI are used to position ER area along the apical-basal axis as shown in the plot below.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98250-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Establishing ER ultrastructure in progenitor or immature cells, as well as unambiguous quantification of ER area in mature neurons, requires identification of these cells in crosssections using fluorescent molecular markers, followed by performing correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM).

The authors should provide a list of differentiating marker genes for the clusters in Figure 3. At present, it remains unclear whether these clusters are the result of over-clustering of cells (and therefore represent either noise or arbitrary splits of continua) or whether they reflect the biology of the system. Subsequent characterization of these curated VSN subtypes (as done in Figure 4) would add value to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We pooled neuronal cells from Figure-1 and re-clustered at higher resolution to identify subtypes. Several neuronal sub-clusters identified by us including progenitors, immature neurons and mature neurons are validated by previous studies with well-known markers. Amongst the mature neurons, the biological basis of four Gnao1 neuron sub-clusters (n1n4) is discussed in our analysis and these are also validated by previous experimental studies. These Gnao1 clusters are organized according to the expression of family-C V2Rs (Vmn2r1 or Vmn2r2) as well as H2Mv genes. Within Gnai2 sub-clusters, n12 and n13 exclusively express markers that distinguish them from n8-n11 which we have described in our revised version. However, Gnai2 n8-n11 do not have definitive markers and whether these sub-clusters are part of a continuum or over-clustered, will require further extensive experiments and analysis. We prefer to show all sub-clusters, including Gnai2 sub-clusters, in Figure 3-Figure supplement-1, along with a dot plot of sub-cluster gene expression, so that this data is available for future experiments and analysis. We share the concern that some Gnai2 sub-clusters may not have an obvious biological basis at this time. Hence in our revised submission, we have merged mature Gnao1 and mature Gnai2 sub-clusters for the developmental analysis shown in Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some clusters are characterized by the expression of specific chemoreceptors (VRs). Have these been used for clustering? If so, clustering should be repeated after excluding these receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3-Figure supplement-2 of our revised submission shows a comparison of neuron clusters with and without VRs. We also describe in the results, specific clusters that are affected by exclusion of VRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Given the title and the data, the paper should be structured around its main claim (i.e. differential ER environment between VSN types). For example, Figure 7, which deals with the characterization of receptor expression and co-expression in VSNs, is sandwiched between the validation of ER substructure (Figure 6) and the timing of coexpression of ER chaperone genes (Figure 8). The data presented in Figure 7 would fit better if used as a validation of the dataset prior to the investigation presented in the current Figure 4. In addition, we suggest that expression and co-expression diagnostics should be used to filter cells for subsequent analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have reorganized the figures in our revised version. Our subsequent analysis showing enrichment of ER related genes at RNA, protein level covers all Gnao1 neurons and is not restricted to a specific subset. This is reflected in the ISH and IHC of ER genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 7-Supplement 3 suggests the presence of co-expressed V1Rs in VSNs. It is unclear from the data presented whether these co-expressing cells are artifactual cell doublets and should be removed from the analysis or whether the expression of the coexpressed receptors reflects a reality. To better address this observation, one may want to see the expression levels of the individual co-expressed V1rs in Figure 7-Supplemet 3 rather than the sum of V1r expression. I am also concerned about the unusually high frequency of &quot;empty&quot; neurons (i.e. without expressed VRs). Could these be debris?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the cells expressing zero as well as two V1Rs are real and cannot be attributed to debris or doublets for the following reasons:</p><p>i) Cells expressing no V1Rs are not necessarily debris because they express other neuronal markers at the same level as cells that express one or two V1Rs. For instance Gnai2 expression level across cells expressing 0, 1, 2 V1Rs is the same, which we have included in Figure 4-figure supplement 4-C of our revised submission. Higher expression threshold values used in our analysis may have somewhat increased the proportion of cells with zero V1Rs. Similarly, Gnao1 levels across cells expressing multiple V2Rs and H2-M_v_ per cell stay the same, indicating that these are unlikely to be doublets (Figure 4 I-K). As doublets are formed randomly, the frequency of each co-expression combination (Supplementary Table 7 and 8) itself is an indication of whether it is represented by a single cell or an artifact.</p><p>ii) Cells co-expressing V1R genes: All cells used for co-expression analysis were filtered via an expression threshold (Figure 4-figure supplement 1D), which eliminates cells with low counts of V1R expression. We listed the frequency of cells co-expressing V1R gene combinations in Supplementary table - 8. Among 134 cells that express two V1Rs, 44 cells express Vmn1r85+Vmn1r86, 21 express Vmn1r184+Vmn1r185, 13 express Vmn1r56+Vmn1r57, 6 express Vmn1r168+Vmn1r177, and so on. Doublets generally are a random combination of two cells. Here, each specific co-expression combination represents multiple cells and is highly unlikely by random chance. iii) Some of the co-expression combinations we reported were identified earlier and verified experimentally in Lee et al., 2019 using FACS based single collection in 96-well plates following the cellseq-2 protocol with very low chance of doublets, and Hills et. al., 2024.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors use either dot plots or scatter plots to show gene expression in cell clusters. It looks nice, but it is very difficult to deduce population levels of expression from these plots. Could we see the distribution of gene expression across clusters using more quantitative visualizations such as violin or box plots?</p></disp-quote><p>Dot plots are majorly used in our manuscript to show markers of cell clusters in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3-figure supplement 1. We would like to show at least 5 gene markers for each cluster that are important to identify the cell type. Using violin plot or bar plot for this will make the panel extremely big and overwhelming, especially with 16 clusters in Figure 1 and 13 clusters in Figure 3-figure supplement 1 or make the bars/violin too small to interpret. Hence, for the sake of simplicity, we used dot plots to give our reader a birds-eye of gene expression differences across clusters. Scatter plots were used when we want to compare the expression levels of genes between male and female samples and show the expression of two genes (VRs) simultaneously in a single cell. This cannot be achieved by Violin/box plot. However, we have made our dataset available at scvnoexplorer.com to explore the expression patterns across cell clusters with different visualization options, including violin or box plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) To investigate whether sex might bias clustering, the authors calculated the Pearson coefficient of gene expression between sexes for each cluster. Given the high coefficient observed across all clusters (although no threshold is used), the authors conclude that there was no bias. While the overall effect may show a strong similarity in gene expression in each cluster between the sexes, this overlooks all the genes that are significantly differentially expressed. It would be worth investigating and discussing these differences. Relatedly, what batch correction method was applied to the data (to mitigate any possible sampling or technical effect)?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the Pearson coefficient as a representative parameter to show that there is no bias. In addition, we have performed differential expression analysis for each cluster and the results are in supplementary table-1. Except known sexually dimorphic genes, other genes are not differentially expressed significantly with adjusted p-values greater than 0.05. This was also shown by earlier studies using bulk RNAseq (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004593, doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4364-4). We used depth normalization to integrate samples and described this in the methods section of our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) We found the method description to be incomplete for the single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. The method section should include a detailed explanation of the code used by the authors to analyze the data. The Seurat package has many available pipelines for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, which have a major impact on the output data. It is therefore imperative to describe which of these pipelines were used and whether the pipeline was run with default settings.</p></disp-quote><p>Our revised submission has expanded on the methods section with details of parameters, filtering criterion and software used.</p></body></sub-article></article>
