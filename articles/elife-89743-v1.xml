memory, the encoding properties of the somatic spiking activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons for short-term memory computations have not yet been identified. Here, we probed and analyzed the activity of optogenetically identified DA and GABA neurons while mice engaged in short-term memory-dependent behavior in a T-maze task. Single-neuron analysis revealed that significant subpopulations of DA and GABA neurons responded differently between left and right trials in the memory delay. With a series of control behavioral tasks and regression analysis tools, we show that firing rate differences are linked to short-term memory-dependent decisions and cannot be explained by reward-related processes, motivated behavior, or motor-related activities. This evidence provides novel insights into the mnemonic encoding activities of midbrain DA and GABA neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>short-term memory</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H02711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Shigeyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004398</institution-id><institution>Mitsubishi Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Shigeyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Shigeyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Shigeyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H05525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujisawa</surname><given-names>Shigeyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area encode short-term memory in the T-maze task, which cannot be explained by reward-related processes, motivated behavior, or motor-related activities.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA) neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) project to diverse forebrain regions, forming distinct but interacting neuromodulatory systems that are thought to play pivotal roles in the regulation of reward-related learning, motivation, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tzschentke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pierce and Kumaresan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vijayraghavan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robbins and Arnsten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hauber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salamone and Correa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). A wealth of electrophysiological recordings from midbrain DA neurons, complemented by in vivo microdialysis data indicate that midbrain DA activity promotes behaviors associated with motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wise, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salamone and Correa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>) and supports reward-based learning by encoding reward prediction error (RPE) signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Also, DA is of central importance to higher cognitive functions, such as updating and maintaining short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>). Pioneering behavioral studies that pharmacologically manipulated the activity of DA receptors in the PFC revealed the significant role of DA signals on short-term memory. An inverted-U-shape effect was discovered, where too little or too much DA receptor stimulation impairs PFC-engaging short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vijayraghavan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robbins and Arnsten, 2009</xref>). Moreover, at the origin of the DA system, electrophysiological recordings at the VTA showed that DA neurons are not active in the delay period of memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Motivated by the response of DA neurons to reward-related stimuli and memory delays, several lines of computational modeling studies sought to answer when and how DA signals support short-term memory âupdateâ and âmaintenanceâ. They proposed the âgating theoryâ, which provided a unified computational framework for reward prediction and short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dreher and Burnod, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>). According to the model, reward-predicting cues, elicit phasic DA release which opens the gate for the afferent signals to be stored in memory (update). But, in the delay period, low, tonic DA levels close the gate for interfering signals to enter the PFC and overwrite the short-term memory component (maintenance). Although the âgating theoryâ fits adequately the behavior-unique responses of DA neurons to the coding schemes of short-term memory, it relies mainly upon empirical evidence of putative DA neurons and the longstanding consensus that short-term memory depends on the unbroken chain of persistent neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durstewitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis and DâEsposito, 2003</xref>).</p><p>However, recent advances in the study of the brainâs functional organization suggest that persistent neuronal activity might not be the only candidate mechanism for the active maintenance of goal representation over short delays, leading to the proposal of new coding schemes for short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stokes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). One of these candidate mechanisms regards the memory-dependent dynamic changes in functional connectivity. Neural oscillations are abundant in the mammalian brain and are thought to offer the networking framework for the temporal organization of neuronal activity and information processing in short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buschman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). Calculating the phase coherence of neural oscillations between distributed brain regions, provides an estimation of the functional connectivity between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fries, 2005</xref>). Among other basal ganglia regions, the VTA engages dynamically in the large-scale network of brain systems that support memory-related information processing. Simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were performed in the PFC and the VTA while rodents executed memory-guided behavioral choices in a T-maze task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2011</xref>). Neural oscillations (4 Hz) were prominent in both regions throughout the task, but their power and coherence were adaptively increased in memory delay. In a similar behavioral task, another short-term memory-related coding scheme was reported, this time at the single neuronal level. It was shown that while rodents navigate the maze, performing memory-guided decisions, PFC and parietal neurons differentiate their firing activities between opposite behavioral choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>). To summarize, this novel empirical evidence from rodent studies on the T-maze behavioral apparatus complements the coding framework of short-term memory with more dynamic and adaptive information-processing mechanisms other than persistent activity.</p><p>In studying the role of DA neurons in short-term memory, we should take into consideration that the DA neuronal circuit is by no means self-contained and therefore it should not be investigated in isolation. Neurons utilizing GABA as a neurotransmitter constitute approximately 30% of the VTA neuronal population. The memory-related encoding properties of these inhibitory neurons have been largely overlooked, despite evidence of a strong inhibitory influence on neighboring DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>) and well-established interconnections with the PFC circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr and Sesack, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr and Sesack, 2000b</xref>).</p><p>In light of the above, we wished to investigate with fine temporal and spatial resolution the firing activity of optogenetically identified DA and GABA neurons while mice performed a T-maze reward-seeking task with memory load. We took into consideration that (i) earlier studies analyzed either the activity of putative DA neurons or drew inferences of the population activity from voltammetry and fiber photometry recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), and (ii) field potentials (like the 4 Hz oscillations recorded in the VTA) stem mainly from phase-aligned excitatory or inhibitory post-synaptic potentials, whereas spiking activity is sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Traub et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2006</xref>). (iii) A recent report revealed the causal relationship of DA activity with short-term memory, by inhibiting DA neurons with optogenetic tools. However, they did not report the encoding properties of single VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic identification of DA and GABA neurons in the VTA</title><p>In the present study, we sought to investigate the encoding properties of DA and GABA neurons of the VTA while mice engage in memory-dependent reward-seeking behavior. To identify neurons, we expressed the light-gated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), in DA and GABA neurons by injecting an adeno-associated virus containing FLEX-ChR2 into DAT-Cre and VGAT-Cre transgenic mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">BÃ¤ckman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The mice were trained on different variations of an associative T-maze task with visual instruction cues. The behavioural apparatus was a Figure-eight T-maze (OâHara &amp; CO., LTD, Tokyo, Japan), 50 cm tall, with a main arm (120 cm) and side arms (30 cm each). Infrared light-beam sensors placed at key position points on the maze defined the beginning and end of the successive maze sections. The apparatus was equipped with sliding doors, which prevented the animals from developing unwanted behavior (e.g. moving backwards). Sensor activations were on-line monitored, and significant behavioural events (e.g. visual-cue presentation, reward delivery, door opening/closing) were dictated by an in-house behavioural software written in MATLAB (Mathworks, MA, USA), through a multi-signal processor interface system (RX6; Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL, USA). The moment-by-moment position of the animal on the maze apparatus was monitored continuously by a video tracking system, composed of a red light-emitting diode mounted on the mouse head stage and a video camera (39 frames/sec) hung by the room ceiling. Video data were stored for offline analysis. (<bold>B</bold>) Detailed schematic representation of the T-maze apparatus. Infrared light-beam sensors (s1âs6) were mounted securely at key positions on the maze to define the beginning and end of the maze sections (start: s1âs2; visual cue: s2âs3; delay: s3âs4; side-arms: s4âs5/s6; reward: s5/s6). The first activation of s5 or s6 sensors (i.e. 1st lick) triggered the water-delivery pump. Five sliding doors restrained the animals from unwanted moves. Every trial began with the animal activating s1. At this point, the doors d1, d3, and d5 remained closed, isolating the animal in the starting location for approximately 2 s. This served two purposes: (1) to drain the waterspouts and (2) to prevent the animal from making decisions on the next trial guided by the previous trial outcome. After door d1 opened, the animal could run freely along the main arm. Activating s2 and s3 resulted in the visual cue onset and offset, respectively. Activating s5 triggered the left water-delivery pump, and door d3 opened while d1 closed. Activating s6 triggered the right water-delivery pump, and door d5 opened while d1 closed. In the memory task, doors d2 and d4 were always open. In the no-cue-no-choice task, doors d2 and d4 were initially closed. However, when the mouse activated s4, one door opened pseudo-randomly.

The null hypothesis was that correct performance was independent of behavioral choices.

Simple linear regression analysis, with the neuronal firing rate as the response variable and the animalâs position on the maze as the single predictor variable, showed that from the beginning until the end of the trial (a 1.5-m distance), the population activity of DA neurons deviated slightly by 0.17Â±0.62 Hz (mean Â± standard error of the mean [SEM], did not differ from a distribution with a mean equal to zero; one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test on the position coefficient, t<sub>(103)</sub> = 0.275, p=0.78).

Therefore, we grouped and averaged trial spike trains of single neurons by the corresponding lap trajectories (left or right; see also Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, we arranged spiking events according to the position they occurred, to get an estimate of the behavioral correlates of neuronal activity.

We then randomly reassigned the trajectory labels (left or right) on the trial spike trains and produced the permuted average firing rate differences.

However, in the present study, we did not detect different responses between left or right visual cues. Furthermore, neuronal preference for trajectories was not restricted to the turning point, which could indicate neuronal engagement in motor preparation for choice execution. Instead, it was spread in a wider area, covering a distance from the memory delay onset until the end of the side arms.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the trajectory-specific responses in the side arms is that neurons were under the control of the sensory, motor, or goal-directed behavioral processes triggered by the opposite trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). However, in the memory-delay section, trajectories were identical for the left and right trials, which could be suggestive of the engagement of these neurons in short-term memory processing. Neuronal preferences to arm visits in memory delay are not uncommon in T-maze tasks. They have been reported in prefrontal and post-parietal cortical neurons and have been attributed to short-term memory-dependent decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>). So, is the trajectory-specific activity in our task reminiscent of internally generated, memory representations, or can be attributed to the well-known DA-linked neuronal computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>)?

Midbrain DA neurons are known to respond to a wide variety of behavioral parameters (i.e. choice accuracy, reward history, running speed, and distance to rewards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>) which could also exert a significant effect on neuronal firing activity.

We evaluated the trajectory-specific activities on each task separately using the permutation method. In the delay section of the no-cue-no-choice task, we observed a significant reduction in the number of positions with a significant firing rate difference (mean Â± SD; DA: memory task 5.9Â±3.8 points, no-cue-no-choice task 1.5 Â± 3.4 points, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.002, four animals; GABA: memory task 10.7 Â± 3.9 points, no-cue-no-choice task 1.5 Â± 2.0 points, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001, three animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâE</xref>). The attenuating effect on trajectory-specific activity was also reflected by a marked reduction in the number of trajectory-specific neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, numbers in parentheses). However, the firing rate difference between the left and right-side arms was strong in both tasks (DA: memory task 8.5 Â± 7.8 points, no-cue-no-choice task 5.9Â±7.4 points, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.139, four animals; GABA: memory task 12.6Â±8.1 points, no-cue-no-choice task 9.9Â±8.8 points, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.234, three animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâE</xref>).</p><p>However, the significant reduction in trajectory-specific encoding preference in the no-cue-no-choice task could not be entirely attributed to the absence of the memory component. This is because important running speed, motor responses, and motivational discrepancies exist between memory and no-cue-no-choice tasks. With regard to motivation, the important role of DA in adaptive decision-making is widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). We did not observe animal choice bias in memory task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), but we cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons were modulated differently by effortful actions to reach the left- and right-sided rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike the memory task, in the no-cue-no-choice task, the mice could not direct behavior towards the left- or right-side arms due to the absence of a visual cue. As a result, they were unable to allocate incentive motivational drives to the left-or-right trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). Also, the initial access denial to the side arms in the control task eliminates any potential differences in the motor preparation coding schemes (according to the âgating theoryâ) for the opposite arm visits in the memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>). Finally, regarding speed, a representative example of running speed differences between the two tasks within a single session is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</p><p>To dissociate the short-term memory component of neuronal activity from the modulatory effects of running speed, incentive motivation, and motor-related signaling, we trained mice in a second control task. The cue-no-choice task preserved the same running speed parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>), motor skill requirements, and physical effort demands (i.e. visual cues, maze shape, arm length, and reward amount were the same) as the memory task, but it prevented animals from making decisions. Accordingly, the animals were presented with the same visual cue as in the memory task, which indicated the side arm that was rewarded and enabled them to allocate incentive motivational drive to the left-or-right trials; however, they were always forced to visit the rewarded arm by blocked access to the unrewarded arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the same recording session, the mice performed a separate block of memory task trials. Similar to the first control task, in the delay section of the cue-no-choice task we observed a significant reduction in the spatial extent of the firing rate difference (DA: memory task 5.4Â±3.6 points, cue-no-choice task: 0.4Â±1.1, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p=0.011, four animals; GABA: memory task 10.7Â±6.3 points, cue-no-choice task 3.5Â±4.2 points, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;0.001, 1 animal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>).

Different reward values correspond to different functions of discounted state-action values. If a cue predicts a reward with a higher value then the state-action value jumps to the discounted value function of that reward. In our study, key parameters that could potentially influence incentive motivational drives were equal between left and right trials (reward amount, lap trajectory distance, etc.) and moreover, behavioral performance did not indicate choice biasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that left and right rewards were valued differently, producing distinct value functions. If this is true, then the trajectory-specific activities elicited by subgroups of DA and GABA neurons could reflect differences in the state-action values for left and right trials, and not memory-dependent decisions. (<bold>A</bold>) The plot illustrates the hypothesis of different discounted value functions (i.e. the state-action value is a function of position and trajectory). In the memory task and the cue-no-choice task the assignment of the state-action value function takes place when the visual cue signals which reward is available.

In both neuronal populations, more neurons showed opposite significant lap-trajectory preferences (red clusters) between delay and reward sections, as opposed to a small minority of neurons that elicited the same lap-trajectory preference (green clusters). Notably, in agreement with earlier studies reporting preferential contralateral responses of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moss et al., 2020</xref>), the majority of memory-specific neurons exhibited a preference for the contralateral lap trajectory to that of the recording site (left hemisphere).

We discovered that only four (n=4 out of 104) DA neurons showed the same side preference in the reward and delay sections (e.g. elicit significantly stronger firing activities in the delay section of left trials and left reward).

Therefore, we sought to determine whether neurons with memory-specific encoding properties were anatomically segregated from the rest of the population. Estimating the location of recorded neurons (i.e. Bregma vs Mediolateral coordinates) from the anatomical reconstruction of the recording channels revealed that the trajectory-specific GABA neurons were located more laterally compared to the rest of the group (Bregma: t<sub>(72)</sub> = 1.165, p=0.248, Mediolateral: t<sub>(72)</sub> = â2.38, p=0.019, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>).

The lack of evidence of functional and anatomical segregation in the DA neurons could be accounted for by the fact that we targeted mostly the lateral parts of the VTA.

Mice were trained to choose between two spatially separate goals under the instruction of visual cues presented at the beginning of the trial. A short memory delay was introduced between cue presentation and choice selection. We discovered that subpopulations of DA and GABA neurons showed differential responses between the left and right trials, starting from the onset of the memory delay in the main arm, where the trajectories were indistinguishable. Trajectory-specific preference was not correlated with reward history, running speed, the incentive motivational drive of physical effort, or reward-related encoding differences, and diminished significantly when the memory-dependent decision component was eliminated in control behavioral tasks. This evidence indicates that populations of DA and GABA neurons in the VTA encode internally generated signals that support short-term memory in decision-making.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Activities of midbrain DA neurons in short-term memory</title><p>The âgating theoryâ unifies the signaling activities of DA neurons in reward prediction and short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dreher and Burnod, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>). With regards to mnemonic processing, the well-established notion that DA somatic spiking activity is low in short-term memory stemmed either from recordings of putative DA neurons of the A8, A9, and A10 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>) or inferred from neuronal population activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the latter reports we did not observe a profound variation in the population activity of DA neurons during the memory task.</p><p>However, a wealth of recent studies has shown that DA neurons are functionally and genetically segregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, in many real-life situations, animals must choose between many options for behavioral responses in high-dimensional environments. In such behavioral conditions, averaging neuronal responses, irrespective of the behavioral features and decisions they respond to, could hinder the fine computational processes of single neurons. To overcome this limitation, we analyzed the firing activities of identified single neurons, focusing on different discharge patterns between behavioral choices. Here, we demonstrated that memory-specific activities by midbrain DA neurons can be represented as trajectory-specific responses in the delay period of the memory task.</p><p>Other than gating sensory input, and maintaining and manipulating memory contents, DA has been implicated in relaying motor commands to elicit memory-guided responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>). We tested this theory, but we found that the firing rate differences between left and right-arm responses declined in a control behavioral task (cue-no-choice) without memory load but with the same motor skill requirements as the memory task. From this, we concluded that motor preparation coding schemes for left or right arm responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>) cannot account for the trajectory-specific activities in the memory delay of the T-maze task. Instead, our evidence indicates that trajectory-specific activities by DA (also GABA) neurons are functionally linked to the maintaining and manipulating of memory contents.</p><p>Our study provides more evidence to a mounting body of recent work that suggests a dynamic functional interaction between the PFC and VTA circuits in high-dimensional behavioral environments. The memory-related, trajectory-specific midbrain neuronal activities demonstrated here, have also been reported for PFC and post-parietal neurons while rodents perform reward-seeking responses on the T-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>). We also report that while mice navigate the maze, individual VTA neurons elevate transiently their firing activity at unique positions producing at the population level a neuronal sequential activity, which is a well-known physiological hallmark of cortical neurons. PFC and VTA networks are known to oscillate in high synchrony at 4 Hz in T-maze tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2011</xref>). Network oscillations were also evident in our VTA recordings (unpublished data). Finally, we report that DA and GABA neurons of the VTA exhibit multitasking activities, encoding behaviors that overlap those of PFC neurons (see further discussion below). These striking similarities are in line with a recent computational theory proposing that the encoding properties of DA neurons reflect those of the upstream PFC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The present study also corroborates important findings from a recent report, which demonstrated that optogenetic perturbations in DA neuron excitability exert a strong effect on short-term memory performance, highlighting the causal role of DA neuronal firing activity in memory-dependent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Also, in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>) by the same laboratory, we show that subpopulations of VTA neurons are modulated by running speed, cumulative performance rate, current choice accuracy, and reward history. Disparities between this and our study in the proportions of modulated neurons could be attributed to the different recording techniques applied as well as the maze regions of interest. Although, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref> trained mice in a virtual T-maze task, they analyzed neuronal firing activities and identified choice-specific neurons only in the visual-cue period, but not in memory delay. In contrast, we focused our analysis on the memory delay of the T-maze task.</p><p>Overall, our results agree with the notion that DA neurons encode a variety of behavioral parameters in complex environments. In addition, we confirmed that in memory-dependent behaviors, DA neuronal populations did not elicit sustained increases in their discharge rate. However, in the present task, DA neurons individually encoded internal representations by differentiating their responses to lap trajectories in memory delay.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of motivated behavior in trajectory-specific encoding properties of VTA neurons</title><p>Midbrain DA activity is known to be involved in motivated behavior while rodents navigate mazes to receive rewards beyond immediate reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). When mice approach rewards, striatal DA concentrations increase, scaling flexibly with reward size and proximity, which is proposed to reflect a neural correlate of a sustained motivational drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). To evaluate the role of motivated behavior in the trajectory-specific preference of midbrain neurons, we compared firing activities between a memory task and a control task without memory-dependent decisions (cue-no-choice task). Although in the cue-no-choice task, the behavioral parameters that determined the incentive motivational drives were the same as in the memory task (visual cues, maze shape, and reward amount), neuronal responses did not differ between the left and right trials. This result strongly indicates that incentive motivational drives (at least for physical effort) do not contribute to trajectory-specific activities of midbrain neurons during the delay period of the memory task.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Memory-specific activities of the VTA neurons are not attributed to reward prediction error signaling</title><p>We also assessed the role of reward-related processing in the trajectory-specific activity of the midbrain neurons. When animals estimate the spatial proximity of distant rewards, DA neurons calculate RPE signals from state-value functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, the animals received ongoing visual input, facilitating the continuous estimation of reward proximity. Thus, DA neurons can potentially estimate RPE signals from successive state values assigned to each position on the maze track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the difference in firing activity between the left and right trials could be the result of differences in the state-value functions assigned to these trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2018</xref>). However, significant evidence contradicts this hypothesis.</p><p>First, the behavioral parameters that determine the state-value functions for the left and right trajectories were set to be identical in the cue-no-choice task and memory task, by preserving the same maze configurations and delivering equal amounts of reward. In addition, behavior in both tasks was cue-driven; therefore, animals could make predictions about the reward location and orchestrate behavior accordingly. However, we observed a prominent reduction in the firing rate difference between the left and right trials in the cue-no-choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, a significant subset of DA neurons (approximately 20%) responded differently to the left and right rewards in the memory task, although the same amount of reward was delivered. This unexpected finding raised the hypothesis that the encoding preference for reward could be reflected in the values of the preceding states in the maze and, therefore, could account for the trajectory-specific effect in memory delay. However, the differences in the firing activity elicited by the consumption of left or right rewards were unrelated to the firing rate difference in the delay section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Also, we discovered a very small minority of neurons with the same trajectory preference in the memory delay and reward sections within the same trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In conclusion, these findings indicate that the encoding preference for lap trajectories exhibited by midbrain DA and GABA neurons cannot be simply explained by discrepancies in RPE signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GABA neurons of the VTA and short-term memory</title><p>With the advent of highly selective identification and perturbation techniques, new evidence has emerged regarding the encoding properties and functional roles of local VTA inhibitory networks in reward processing and motivation. There are reports demonstrating that GABA neurons of the VTA suppress reward consummatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>), facilitate aversive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2012</xref>), and elicit sustained activities in the delay period between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). During these behaviors, the responses of DA and GABA neurons are often inverse, such that when GABA neurons are excited, neighboring DA neurons decrease their discharge rate. In particular, aversive stimuli excite GABA neurons, which then suppress the neighboring DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, during reward consumption, GABA neurons are inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>); however, when excited, they inhibit DA neurons and disturb consummatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, in classical conditioning tasks, DA neurons respond to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli, whereas GABA neurons remain silent during such events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). However, we demonstrated here that midbrain DA and GABA neurons elicit remarkably similar encoding properties. Both neuronal populations respond to short-term memory-specific activities manifested by encoding preferences for lap trajectories. Notably, though, GABA neurons are more strongly engaged in this dynamic encoding activity since almost twice as many inhibitory neurons responded differently to the left and right trials.</p><p>This result presents an activity paradox. Given the abundant and potent synaptic inhibition of DA neurons by neighboring GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2009</xref>), it was unexpected that both populations were highly active and similarly engaged in tasks. However, anatomical evidence provides a plausible explanation. Local inhibitory neurons form a dense network of local synaptic innervations that target the dendritic sites of DA and other GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Traub et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2009</xref>). Although potent and well-suited for coordinated network activity, this synaptic inhibition is not as strong as somatic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omelchenko and Sesack, 2009</xref>), and it has been suggested that it is not sufficient to suppress DA neurons when they receive a strong excitatory drive from extrinsic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the stronger engagement of GABA neurons in trajectory-specific activity is an interesting observation that requires further investigation. In our opinion, future research on this topic should point to the direction of network oscillations. The VTA circuit is known to oscillate in memory-engaging behaviors producing frequencies of a wide spectrum; up to 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2011</xref>); also unpublished observations in our study. Although the mechanisms supporting circuit oscillations in the VTA are not well investigated, evidence from the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Aerde et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glykos et al., 2015</xref>) and the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Traub et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mann and Paulsen, 2007</xref>) demonstrate that the excitation of the local network of inhibitory neurons is crucial for the generation and maintenance of network oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we optogenetically probed DA and GABA neurons in the VTA while mice performed a decision-making task with memory load.

This evidence indicates that VTA neurons encode mental representations to support short-term memory-dependent decisions and provides insights into novel sophisticated coding strategies employed by the midbrain DA and GABA neurons in reward-related behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J-Slc6a3<sup>tm1.1(cre)Bkmn/J</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jax #006660;

Animals were housed in separate cages on a 12 hr dark/light cycle and each performed the behavioral tasks at the same time of the day, between 11:00 and 17:00. In the cage, they were provided ad libitum food access but were restrained from water availability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><p>All behavioral tasks took place on a T-maze apparatus.

Then, access to the main corridor was provided and the animal had to run through the âstartâ section (0â50 cm) before it arrived at the maze segment surrounded by two PC monitors (âvisual-cueâ section, 50â80 cm). In this section, it was presented with a distinctive visual object (vertical black and gray bars) in one of the two monitors (the other monitor remained dark) indicates which side arm to visit to obtain the reward (i.e. left cue â left reward, right cue â right reward). In the third region of the central arm (âdelayâ section, 80â120 cm) both monitors turned dark. While running in the delay section, the animal had to maintain the reward-related information and based on that perform the action selection at the T-intersection. The intersection at the end of the main arm designated the end of the delay section and the beginning of the âside-armsâ section (120â150 cm) where the animal runs towards the reward position in anticipation of the reward. Reward (5 Î¼l water) was delivered on correct trials at the end of the side-arms section from a waterspout. The first activation of the light-beam sensor at the waterspout triggered the water-delivery pump (Burkert, Ingelfingen, Germany), followed by reward consumption (ârewardâ section). After consuming the reward, the animal could return of its own will to the starting position, to commence a new trial.</p><p>Daily behavioral sessions consisted of 80â100 trials. Only animals with at least three successive sessions with an 80% performance ratio or more in the training phase were subjected to surgical operations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>No-Cue-No-Choice task</title><p>Trials of this control task were delivered in recording sessions, interleaved with memory task trials.

Also, access to both side arms was initially denied by closed sliding doors. Approximately 1 s after the animal arrived at the turning point, one of the sliding doors opened (pseudo-randomly) providing access to the reward. On every trial, the presentation or absence of the visual cue could instruct the animal about the task rules (i.e. memory task or no-cue-no-choice task).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Cue-no-choice-task</title><p>The settings of this control task were the same as the memory task settings, except for the blockade of the unrewarded side arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the animals were always forced to perform correct choices. Because in both tasks, the same cue was presented, the animals could potentially be confused about the trialâs task rules. Therefore, memory task and cue-no-choice task trials were delivered in separate sets within the same recording session. Accordingly, when the animals completed the set of cue-no-choice task trials (approximately 50 trials), they were automatically delivered with another set of memory task trials (approximately 50 trials).</p><p>Recording sessions lasted approximately 20â30 min.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Intracranial surgeries and electrophysiological recording</title><p>The surgical process consisted of two separate operations.

We used Buzsaki64spL (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) silicon probes which are composed of 6 shanks (10 mm long, 15 Î¼m thick, 200 Î¼m shank separation) and each shank has 10 recording sites (160 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> each site 0.6â1.0 MÎ© impedance). The silicon probe was attached to a custom-made micromanipulator and moved gradually to the desired depth position. On every probe shank, optic fibers were firmly attached to secure an accurate and firm insertion of the recording channels in the deep midbrain area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For experiments where light delivery was required, two of the optic fibers (shanks 2 and 5) were coupled with blue (450 nm) laser diodes (PL450B, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors). Light dispersion could potentially cover the axial and transverse span of all 64 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stark et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>During recording sessions, the wide-band neurophysiological signals were acquired continuously at 20 kHz on 256-channel Amplipex systems (KJE-1001, Amplipex Ltd, Hungary; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BerÃ©nyi et al., 2014</xref>). Following surgery, the probe was inserted 45 Î¼m deeper into the brain daily, until it reached the VTA. Thereafter, the probe was moved deeper by 20 Î¼m / day. The average recording coordinates for the DAT-Cre animals are 3.32Â±0.32 mm (mean Â± standard deviation) rostrocaudal and 0.82Â±0.17 mm mediolateral, and for the VGAT-Cre animals, 3.52Â±0.29 mm rostrocaudal and 0.90Â±0.17 mm mediolateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that some neurons were recorded in successive sessions because clustering analysis was performed on individual sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, data analysis was performed with custom-made programs designed in MATLAB with Signal-processing and Statistics toolboxes.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Light-stimulation protocols for optogenetic identification</title><p>Light stimulation protocols were delivered before and after the behavioral tasks.

To overcome this limitation, we arranged firing activity by the animalâs position on the maze. To do so, first, we linearized the trial trajectories and assigned them with a lap trajectory label (left or right). Then, the linearized products were divided into 100 position points and normalized so that position 0 corresponded to the starting point of the trial and position 1 to the waterspout. Second, we constructed post-distance histograms, analogous to the peri-stimulus-time-histograms (PSTHs), although the time of spiking events was replaced by the position they occurred (for simplicity, also by habit, we will call the post-distance histograms as PSTHs). To construct accurate PSTHs we considered the exact position the spikes were discharged and the time the animal occupied this certain position.

In those tasks, the animal does not control the exact timing of behavioral events. The experimenter determines when trials begin or end, when visual cues or rewards are delivered, and how much time elapses between cue onset and rewards. Then, usually, post-hoc analysis looks for neuronal responses that are time-aligned to significant task events. For this type of analysis, the researcher should be careful so that the epochs of interest between successive events must not overlap, and most of all, important events are not captured within the epoch of interest of the preceding or succeeding events.</p><p>However, in the T-maze task, the timing of behavioral events was completely controlled by the animal, causing a high amount of variability in the timestamps of the task events. For example, within a recording session, animals would consume unique trial rewards within a range of 1â10 s. Also, the trial duration would usually increase throughout the session as the animals progressively became tired and slower. On top of all, there was high behavioral response variability between animals. Therefore, the increased variability in the timing of events between trials, sessions, and animals caused a significant amount of ambiguity when firing activities were arranged by time and aligned by key task events. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref> shows the average firing activity of individual neurons extracted from a single recording session when neuronal firing was arranged by time (A) and by position (B; the position-arranged firing rate of these particular neurons are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, but for convenience to the reader are also shown here). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref> firing activities for left/right trials were also aligned at the timing of the delay offset (sensor 5). The shadow-colored areas show the range of the timestamps of the other important task events (trial start, cue onset, etc.) across 80â100 trials, relevant to the delay offset. It is evident from this example that deciding the epoch of interest for the memory delay is highly ambiguous.</p><p>This important caveat could be easily resolved by arranging firing activities by position. This way, we could produce reliable neuronal firing averages from recording sessions and perform comparisons between behavioral tasks and animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Identifying and characterizing RPE signals in the Tmaze task</title><p>The role of DA in processing RPE signals has been studied extensively with classical conditioning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ljungberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schultz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). In this Pavlovian paradigm, animals are usually physically restrained and are not trained to make decisions, also, they are exposed to a strictly controlled sensory environment and receive easily accessible and immediate rewards. The present study was designed to investigate the memory-encoding properties of individual neurons in a high-dimensional environment. We did not observe strong manifestations of RPE signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). However, compared to classical conditioning studies, in the T-maze task neurons were under the control of numerous behavioral parameters that could be masking cue-related responses, and therefore we cannot draw safe conclusions about the computational role of DA neurons on RPE signals. So far, only manipulating the behavioral parameters with virtual reality tools, has provided insight into the RPE-related responses of DA neurons in goal-directed behavioral tasks like ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the RIKEN Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval number: W2022-2-011).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-89743-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data files and analysis scripts included in this manuscript are at the GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vglykos/Memory-specific-encoding-activities-of-the-ventral-tegmental-area-dopamine-and-GABA-neurons/tree/main">https://github.com/vglykos/Memory-specific-encoding-activities-of-the-ventral-tegmental-area-dopamine-and-GABA-neurons/tree/main</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glykos, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research 18H02711 and 18H05525), the Mitsubishi Foundation, the Naito Foundation, and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).</p><p>In memory of Miles Adrian Whittington.

Since the permutation analysis of the original spike trains revealed that the trajectory-specific effect on neuronal firing activity was highly dependent on the animalâs position (occurring mainly in the delay and side-arm sections), we included the joint effect of lap trajectory and position in the training model instead of testing the effect of trajectory alone. A major advantage of regression analysis is that one can dissociate the inherently bound effects of the independent variables. For example, we can examine the influence of the lap trajectory variable on neuronal firing activity without including the effect of the running speed variable (which could potentially differ between left and right trials).</p><p>For each neuron, we produced model predictions for the correct left and right trial average firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>, dashed lines) from which we calculated the predicted firing rate difference. We subsequently examined the contribution of each independent variable to the trajectory-specific firing activity by shuffling the trajectory labels assigned only to this particular variable. If the tested variable exerts a significant effect on the firing rate, then shuffling the trajectory labels would produce a significant reduction in the predicted firing rate difference. We examined the same pool of neurons that we reported on the memory task, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (n=104 DA and n=74 GABA-identified neurons). In the delay region, the joint effect of lap trajectory and position (trajectory Ãposition predictor) contributed significantly to the predicted average rate difference of 23 DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, C top), 17 of which overlapped with the 22 trajectory-specific neurons identified with the permutation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref> bottom). Of the GABA neurons, 34 were modulated by trajectory and position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, C top), 30 of which were also trajectory-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref> bottom). These results confirm that the trajectory factor was responsible for the firing rate difference shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The speed variable significantly modulated 24 DA and 22 GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, C top), but only four DA and four GABA neurons were co-modulated by trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref> bottom). The performance and accuracy variables modulated smaller numbers of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, C top), and the reward outcome of the previous trial did not co-modulate any of the trajectory-specific DA and GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref> bottom). The trial variable modulated 30 DA neurons and 32 GABA neurons, co-modulating with the trajectory variable of 8 DA and 15 GABA neurons. However, the distribution of the trial predictor coefficient did not differ from a distribution with a mean equal to zero (one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3D</xref>), indicating that the effect of successive trials on firing rate did not reflect cognitive processing, but was caused by mechanical reasons; due to the animalâs movements, the distance of the recording channel from the targeted neurons changed continuously, which affected the signal-to-noise ratio and eventually spike detection. In agreement with Engelhard et al., a notable proportion of DA neurons (36%) and GABA neurons (74%) were co-modulated by more than one behavioral variable <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3E</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the regression analysis confirmed the results of the permutation analysis regarding the significant effect of trajectory on midbrain neuronal activity during memory-dependent decisions.

A different line of research, on the other hand, has shown that these neurons are also involved in higher cognitive functions such as short-term memory. However, these neurons are thought not to encode short-term memory itself because they just exhibit a phasic response in short-term memory tasks, which cannot seem to maintain information during the memory period. To understand the role of dopamine neurons in short-term memory, the present study investigated the electrophysiological property of these neurons in rodents performing a T-maze version of a short-term memory task, in which a visual cue indicated which arm (left or right) of the T-maze was associated with a reward. The animal needed to maintain this information while they were located between the cue presentation position and the selection position of the T-maze. The authors found that the activity of some dopamine neurons changed depending on the information while the animals were located in the memory position. This dopamine neuron modulation was unable to explain the motivation or motor component of the task. The authors concluded that this modulation reflected the information stored as short-term memory.</p><p>I was simply surprised by their finding because these dopamine neurons are similar to neurons in the prefrontal cortex that store memory information with sustained activity. Dopamine neurons are an evolutionally conserved structure, which is seen even in insects, whereas the prefrontal cortex is developed mainly in the primate. I feel that their findings are novel and would attract much attention from readers in the field. But the authors need to conduct additional analyses to consolidate their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for the positive assessment and for the valuable and constructive comments on our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations to The Authors)</bold></p><p>(1) The authors found the dopamine neuron modulation that reflected the memory information during the delay period. Here the dopamine neuron activity was aligned by the position, not by time, in which the animals needed to maintain the information. Usually, the activity was aligned by time, and many studies found that dopamine neurons exhibited a short duration burst in response to rewards and behaviorally relevant stimuli including visual cues presented in short-term memory tasks. For comparison, I (and probably other readers) want to see the time-aligned dopamine neuron modulation that reflected the memory information. Did the modulation still exist? Did it have a long duration? The authors just showed the time-aligned &quot;population&quot; activity that exhibited no memory-dependent modulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the point raised by the reviewer is important. To address this question, we added a new paragraph to the Methods section titled âMethodological considerationsâ (in line 793 of the revised manuscript), where we explain the caveats of using time alignment in the T-maze task study. We also created a new sup figure 5 to clarify our argument. As the figure shows, we did not observe major differences in the firing rates when they were arranged by position or time. More importantly, we did not detect brief bursts of activity in response to the visual cue which could reflect an RPE signaling scheme. Our interpretation is that in the T-maze task, DA neurons encode âminiatureâ RPE signals between successive states in the T-maze, which are hard to detect, especially when neurons receive a continuous sensory input during trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Several studies have reported that dopamine neurons at different locations encode distinct signals even within the VTA or SNr. Were the locations of dopamine neurons maintaining the memory information different from those of other dopamine neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewerâs comment. Indeed, there is evidence from recent studies demonstrating that DA neurons form functional and anatomical clusters in the VTA and SN. Following the reviewerâs advice, we report the anatomical structure of memory and non-memory-specific neurons in the revised manuscript. You can read these results in the paragraph âAnatomical organization of trajectory-specific neurons.â in the âResultsâ section (in line 383 of the revised manuscript) and in the new sup figure 11. We only observed a clear functional-anatomical segregation in GABA neurons, but not in DA neurons. But we should note that the absence of segregation in the DA neurons could be accounted for by the fact that we recorded mostly from the lateral VTA, therefore we do not have any numbers from the medial VTA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3a) Did the dopamine neurons maintaining the memory information respond to reward?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that we have already provided the data that can partially answer this question by correlating the firing rate difference between the reward and memory delay sections. This result was described in the âNeuronal activities in delay and reward are unrelated.â paragraph and in Figure 6. Moreover, motivated by the reviewerâs question, we also performed additional analysis, which is included in the revised manuscript. Briefly, we clustered significant responses between the memory delay and reward sections (Category 1: Left-signif, R-signif or No-signif / Category 2: Memory delay or Reward). We discovered that only a very small number of neurons showed the same significant trajectory preference in the memory delay and reward sections (i.e., significant preference for left trials in the memory delay and significant preference for the left reward). In fact, more significant neurons showed a preference for opposite trajectories (i.e. significant preference for left trials in memory delay and a significant preference for right rewards). A description of the new results is included in the âNeuronal activities in delay and reward are unrelated.â paragraph (in line 349 of the revised manuscript) and in the new supplementary Figure 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3b) Did they encode reward prediction error? The relationship between the present data and the conventional theory may be valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that the readers of this study will come up with the question of how memory-specific activities are related to RPE signaling. However, the T-maze task we used in this research was designed for studying working memory and was not adequate to extract information about the RPE signaling of DA neurons.</p><p>RPE signaling is mainly studied in Pavlovian conditioning. These are low-dimensional tasks with usually four (4) states (state1: ITI, state2: trial start, state3: stimulus presentation, state4: reward delivery). Evidence of RPE signaling is extracted from the firing activity of states 3 and 4 (which is theorized to be related to the difference in the values for states 3 and 4).</p><p>However, in the T-maze task, the number of states is hard to define and practically countless. In these conditions, it has been suggested that numerous small RPEs are signaled while the mice navigate the maze; Thus, they are very difficult to detect. To our knowledge, only Kim et al 2020, Cell, vol183, pg1600, managed to detect the RPE signaling activity of DA neurons while mice were teleported in a virtual corridor.</p><p>Another confounding factor in extracting RPE signals in the T-maze task is that the environment is high-dimensional and DA neurons are multitasking. Therefore, it is likely that RPE signaling could be masked by other parallel encoding schemes.</p><p>We have added these descriptions in the âMethodological considerationsâ (in line 793 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Did the dopamine neurons maintaining the memory information (left or right) prefer a contralateral direction like neurons in the motor cortex?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, the majority of the memory-specific DA neurons showed a preference for the contralateral direction. We report this result in the legend of the new sup fig 10 (in line 1668 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As shown in Table S2, the proportion of GABA neurons maintaining the memory information (left or right during delay) was much larger than that of dopamine neurons. It seems to be strange because the main output neurons in the VTA are dopaminergic. What is the role of these GABA neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The present study shows that in both populations a sizeable portion of neurons show memory-specific encoding activities. However, the percentage of memory-encoding GABA neurons is more than twice as large as in the DA neurons. Moreover, we show that GABA neurons are functionally and anatomically segregated.</p><p>From this evidence, one could raise the hypothesis that the GABA neurons have a primary role and that the activity of DA neurons is a collateral phenomenon, triggered in a sequence of events within the VTA network. To characterize the (1) role and (2) importance of GABA neurons in memory-guided behavior, one should first identify the afferent and efferent projections of these cells in great detail. Unfortunately, we do not provide anatomical evidence.</p><p>So far, with the electrophysiological data we have collected (unit and field recordings), we can address an alternative hypothesis. It has been reported earlier (but we have also observed) that the VTA circuit engages in behaviorally related network oscillations which range from 0.4Hz up to 100Hz. Converging evidence from different brain regions, in vitro preparations but also in vivo recordings agree that local networks of inhibitory neurons are crucial for the generation, maintenance, and spectral control of network oscillations. Ongoing analysis, which we hope will lead to a publication, is looking for the behavioral correlates of network oscillations on the T-maze task, as well as the correlation of single-unit firing activity to the field oscillations. We expect to detect a higher field-unit coherence in GABA neurons, which could explain their stronger engagement in memory-specific encoding activity.</p><p>The potential role of GABA neurons in network oscillations is discussed in the revised manuscript in a newly added paragraph in line 564.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review)</bold></p><p>The authors phototag DA and GABA neurons in the VTA in mice performing a t-maze task, and report choice-specific responses in the delay period of a memory-guided task, more so than in a variant task w/o a memory component.

However, many of the neurons aren't significant by their permutation test. Often people either only plot the neurons that are significant, or plot with cross-validation (ie sort by half of the trials, and plot the other half).</p><p>Relatedly, the cross-task comparisons of sequences (Fig, 4,5) are hampered by the fact that they sort in one task, then plot in the other, which will make the sequences look less robust even if they were equally strong. What happens if they swap which task's sequences they use to order the neurons? I do realize they also show statistical comparisons of modulated units across tasks, which is helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for the valuable and constructive comments on our manuscript. If, as the reviewer commented, the rate differences between left and right trajectories were only the result we want to claim, there may be a way to show only those whose left and right are significant. However, the sequential activity is also one of the points we wanted to display. We did not emphasize this result because it has already been shown by Engelhard et al. 2019. However, after reading the reviewer's comments, we decided to add a few lines in the &quot;Results&quot; (in lines 205 - 215 of the revised manuscript) and &quot;Discussion&quot; (in line 453 of the revised manuscript) describing the sequential activity of the VTA circuit. In those lines, we explained that DA activity is position-specific (resulting in sequential activity) and that a fraction of them also have left-right specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the introduction was scholarly and did a good job covering a vast literature. But the explanation of t-maze data towards the end of the introduction was confusing. In Line 87, I would not say &quot;in the same task&quot; but &quot;in a similar task&quot; because there are many differences between the tasks in question.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this mistake. In the revised manuscript, we replaced âin the same taskâ with âin a similar taskâ (in line 85 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And not clear what is meant by &quot;by averaging neuronal population activities, none of these computational schemes would have been revealed. &quot; There was trial averaging, at least in Harvey et al. I thought the main result of that paper related to coding schemes was that neural activity was sequential, not persistent. I think it would help the paper to say that clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that this sentence leaves room for misunderstanding. We were mainly referring to DA studies using microdialysis or fiber photometry techniques. We decided to delete this sentence in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I'm not aware it was shown that choice selectivity diminishes when the memory demand of the task is removed - please clarify if that is true in both referenced papers.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewerâs remark is correct. None of these reports show explicitly that memory-specific activities are diminished without the memory component. Therefore, we deleted this sentence in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If so, an interpretation of this present data could be found in Lee et al biorxiv 2022, which presents a computational model that implies that the heterogeneity in the VTA DA system is a reflection of the heterogeneity found in upstream regions (the state representation), based on the idea that different subsets of DA neurons calculate prediction errors with respect to different subsets of the state representation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for sharing this interpretation. We agree that this theory would support our results. In the revised manuscript we briefly discuss the Lee et al. report (in line 460 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am surprised only 28% of DA neurons responded to the reward - the reward is not completely certain in this task. This seems lower than other papers in mice (even Pavlovian conditioning, when the reward is entirely certain). It would be helpful if the authors comment on how this number compares to other papers.</p></disp-quote><p>In Pavlovian conditioning, neuronal responses to rewards are compared to a relatively quiet period of firing activity (usually the inter-trial interval epoch). As the reviewer pointed out, in the present study, the number of DA neurons responding to reward is smaller compared to the earlier studies. We hypothesize that this is due to our comparison method. We compared the post-reward response to an epoch when the animal was running along the side arms and the majority of neurons were highly active, instead of comparing it to a quiescent baseline epoch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations to The Authors)</bold></p><p>Can you clarify what disparity you are referring to here? &quot;Disparities between this 438 and our study in the proportions of modulated neurons could be attributed to the 439 different recording techniques applied as well as the maze regions of interest; for 440 example, Engelhard et al. analyzed neuronal firing activities in the visual-cue period 441 (Engelhard et al., 2019), whereas we focused on memory delay.&quot;. Is it the fact that Engelhard et al did not report choice-selective activity? They did report cue-side-selective activity, with some neurons responsive to cues on one side, and other neurons responsive to cues on the other side. Because there are more cues on the left when the mouse turns left, these neurons do indeed have choice-selective responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree that we need to clarify further our argument. As the reviewer pointed out, Engelhard et al identified choice-specific DA neurons. However, they reported the encoding properties of DA neurons only in the visual-cue period and the reward period. Remarkably, although the task has a memory delay, they did not report the neuronal firing activities for this delay period. Instead, in the present study we dedicated most of our analysis to characterizing the firing properties of VTA neurons in the delay period.</p><p>Also, in response to your comment, we edited the paragraph where we describe the disparities between our study and Engelhard et al (in line 466 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think this sentence of intro is needed since it doesn't really contain new info: &quot;Therefore, we looked for hints 116 of memory-related encoding activities in single DA and GABA neurons by 117 characterizing their firing preference for opposite behavioral choices.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Therefore, we deleted this sentence in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I didn't understand this line of discussion: &quot;Our evidence does not question the validity of this computational model, since we do not provide evidence of how the selective preference for one response over the other translates into the release site.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The gating theory is based on experimental evidence of neuronal firing activities of DA neurons but also takes into consideration (to a lesser degree) the pre- and post-synaptic processes at the DA release sites (inverted U-shape of D1R activity). We thought that the reader may come to the conclusion that we question the validity of the gating theory. But this is not our intention, especially when we do not provide important evidence such as (1) the projection sites of DA and GABA neurons and (2) the sequence of events that take place at the synaptic triads following the DA and GABA release.</p><p>After reading your comment we came to the conclusion that this sentence should be omitted because it is not within the scope of this study to question the validity of the gating theory. Instead, we dedicated a few lines of text to explaining which components of the gating theory (âupdateâ, âmaintenance &amp; manipulationâ and âmotor preparationâ) could be attributed to the trajectory-specific activities in the memory delay of the T-maze task.
