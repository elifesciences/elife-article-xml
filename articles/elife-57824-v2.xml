drastically alter the expression profiles of antibiotics and other drugs in actinobacteria. For example, avenolide (a butenolide) regulates the production of avermectin, derivatives of which are used in the treatment of river blindness and other parasitic diseases. Butenolides and γ-butyrolactones control the production of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites by binding to TetR family transcriptional repressors. Here, we describe a concise, 22-step synthetic strategy for the production of avenolide. We present crystal structures of the butenolide receptor AvaR1 in isolation and in complex with avenolide, as well as those of AvaR1 bound to an oligonucleotide derived from its operator. Biochemical studies guided by the co-crystal structures enable the identification of 90 new actinobacteria that may be regulated by butenolides, two of which are experimentally verified. These studies provide a foundation for understanding the regulation of microbial secondary metabolite production, which may be exploited for the discovery and production of novel medicines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria that dwell in soil known as actinobacteria are the source of many drugs that are used to treat cancer and infectious diseases in humans. In their natural environments actinobacteria produce these drugs, or at least similar compounds, to compete with neighboring microbes for food or to kill their enemies. However, when researchers culture actinobacteria in the laboratory, the bacteria often produce little or none of these compounds.</p><p>Some actinobacteria produce a compound called avermectin. This compound is closely related to a drug used to treat an infectious disease known as river blindness, which is a common cause of sight loss in people living in West Africa. A bacterial hormone known as avenolide regulates when the bacteria produce avermectin by binding to a receptor known as AvaR1. But the precise details of how this process works remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate how avenolide binds to AvaR1, Kapoor, Olivares and Nair developed a new strategy to produce large quantities of avenolide in the laboratory from commercially available molecules. A three-dimensional structure of AvaR1 was then generated showing the receptor on its own, bound to avenolide or bound to a short DNA molecule. In the absence of avenolide, AvaR1 sits on DNA. However, binding to avenolide causes AvaR1 to move off the DNA. This revealed how the binding of avenolide changes the receptor protein so that it can be released from DNA to allow the production and release of other small molecule compounds. Further experiments used these structures as guides to identify 90 new species of actinobacteria that may respond to avenolide and other similar bacterial hormones.</p><p>Understanding how bacterial hormones stimulate actinobacteria to produce avermectin and other compounds will aid efforts to extract new compounds from soil bacteria that have the potential to treat cancer or infectious diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacterial signalling</kwd><kwd>Streptomyces</kwd><kwd>antibiotic</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>biosynthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapoor</surname><given-names>Iti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funding agency provided support for facilities and services.

A major limitation is the lack of tools that enable access to the vast library of bacterial natural product antibiotics. Statistical surveys depict the number of antibiotics that are genetically encoded within the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genus to be in excess of ~300,000 new molecules, but a large repertoire of these compounds cannot be produced when the strain is grown under standard laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Govern, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Watve et al., 2001</xref>).

Butenolides, such as avenolide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), trigger the production of secondary metabolites with a minimum effective concentration in the low nanomolar range in <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, butenolides show greater pH stability and generally regulate fewer processes than γ-butyrolactones. The recent discovery of avenolide activity in about 24% of observed actinomycetes (n = 51), suggests that other active actinobacteria can also produce avenolide-like compounds to regulate secondary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thao et al., 2017</xref>). For example, avenolide regulates the production of the anthelminitic compound avermectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Miller et al., 1979</xref>). Ivermectin, a chemical derivative of avermectin, is on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, and has lowered the incidence of otherwise untreatable parasitic infections, including river blindness, strongyloidiasis, and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaway and Cyranoski, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Enzymatic and synthetic routes towards the production of γ-butyrolactones have been described, but access to butenolides has been restrictive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kato et al., 2007</xref>)., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Seitz and Reiser, 2005</xref>) Here, we describe a concise 22-step convergent route towards the total synthesis of avenolide, enabling biochemical and biophysical characterization of its interaction with the AvaR1 receptor. We also present structures of AvaR1, in isolation (2.4 Å resolution), in complex with avenolide (2.0 Å resolution), and bound to a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide (3.09 Å resolution) derived from its natural binding site. Using the primary sequence of AvaR1 and the synteny of genes that are likely to be involved in butenolide biosynthesis, we identify 89 additional putative butenolide receptors. Mapping of residues at the ligand-binding site that form conserved sequences highlights their importance in ligand activation. The identification of these putative avenolide-responsive strains may enable the production of novel metabolites in the presence of the hormone. As proof of principle, we show that the supplementation of synthetic avenolide into growing cultures of two strains that contain homologous receptors results in visible changes to the production media.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Convergent synthesis of (4<italic>S</italic>, 10<italic>R</italic>)-avenolide and characterization of binding to AvaR1</title><p>We hypothesized that a detailed understanding of the mechanism of regulation of secondary metabolite production by avenolide would benefit from an understanding of the regulatory mechanism. Moreover, as AvaR1 shares ~40% sequence identity with the γ-butyrolactone receptor ArpA, biochemical studies of AvaR1 may inform on other classes of bacterial hormone receptors while also providing the rationale for ligand specificity amongst these different classes.</p><p>The inherent temperature, acidic and alkali stability of butenolides over γ-butyrolactones prompted efforts towards the large-scale production of avenolide for biochemical studies. However, little is known about the biosynthetic pathways that elaborate butenolides, as opposed to canonical GBLs that can be produced enzymatically from commercially available precursors. To this end, we undertook a novel retro-synthetic strategy produce avenolide from the convergent synthesis of three key fragments: the iodide (<bold>11</bold>), the aldehyde (12) and epoxy (10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).We followed the protocol reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>, which begins with commercially available 1-methyl-2-butene. A Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kolb et al., 1994</xref>) produced the diol intermediate (1) in 82% yield in a single step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The desired key intermediates aldehyde (12), iodo alkene (11) and epoxy (10) were also made following the same reported protocol except that TBDPS rather than TBS was used for improved reaction monitoring using TLC. The epoxy (10) was then stereospecifically converted into allyl alcohol (17) in a single step, by using titanocene dichloride and Zn powder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katsuki and Sharpless, 1980</xref>). The final product, stereospecific (4<italic>S,</italic> 10<italic>R</italic>)-avenolide (<bold>13</bold>) was then produced by ring-closing metathesis of molecule <bold>19</bold>, treating the dialkene with Grubb’s second-generation catalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sheddan and Mulzer, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The synthetic strategy significantly reduced the number of steps from those reported in prior studies. Specifically, the diol intermediate (<bold>1</bold>) was synthesized from the commercially available 1-methyl-2-butene in single step using Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, avoiding multiple protection/deprotection steps. Likewise, the aldehyde intermediate (<bold>12</bold>) was synthesized effectively in three steps (as compared to ten steps in prior reports), avoiding the use of toxic CuCN. Last, conversion of the epoxy intermediate (<bold>10</bold>) to the final product occurred through the intermediacy of an allyl alcohol (<bold>17</bold>), reducing the strategy used in prior reports by four more steps. The final yield of avenolide was 14 mg total from 15 g of starting material. The identities of all intermediates, as well as that of the final product, were determined using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR that matched with the reported data. Detailed experimental methods and NMR spectra can be found in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Crystal structure of AvaR1 and the binary complex with avenolide</title><p>The structure of AvaR1 was determined to 2.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) using crystallographic phases determined from anomalous diffraction data collected from SeMet-labeled protein crystals. The overall structure is reminiscent of that of other TetR-family transcriptional repressors, and consists of an obligate homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhukya and Anand, 2017</xref>). Each monomer is entirely helical and consists of a DNA-binding domain (DBD; composed of α helices 1–4), and a ligand-binding domain (LBD; consisting of α helices 5–13). The dimer interface is formed via interactions between the two LBDs and is formed mainly through hydrophobic packing interactions.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural characterization of the AvaR1-avenoide binding interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the AvaR1 homodimer in the absence of bound ligand.

Clear density for the entire hormone can be visualized bound to the LBD of both monomers in the homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, the structure of AvaR1 undergoes conformational shifting upon ligand binding, and a structure-based superposition against the ligand-free structure illustrates that binding of the hormone results in an ~10<sup>o</sup> shift in the DBD of each monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This shift results in an increase in the distance between the two DBD in the dimer upon binding of the ligand, which would preclude DNA binding by the ligand-bound homodimer. Additional local changes between the two structures included the movement of Gln165, which swings into the binding pocket to make hydrogen-bonding interactions with the lactone ring, as well with Gln64. Last, Thr108, which is harbored on helix α6, also moves to accommodate interactions with the hormone. The indole side chain of Trp127 likewise shifts to increase the volume of the binding cavity. Other interactions include hydrogen bonds between Thr131 and the C10 hydroxy, and an interaction between Thr162 and the lactone ring of avenolide. The superimposition suggests that the new contacts formed by these residues are likely to couple hormone binding to the conformational shift between the two monomers of AvaR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We used isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize the binding interaction between the synthetic avenolide and AvaR1 (measurements were conducted in triplicate). The resultant binding isotherm shows the point of inflection at a molar ratio of N-1, which suggests a 1:1 binding of ligand per monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The strength of the binding is measured to be K<sub>d</sub> = 42.5 nM ± 2.1 nM (three independent trials), which correlates with the reported value of ~4 nM that was estimated from gel shift-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitani et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structure-based comparison across different GBL-like receptors</title><p>A structure-based sequence alignment of GBL-like receptors for which ligand specificity has been established reveals a strong conservation of residues that have been shown to be critical for ligand binding, suggesting a common mechanism for ligand recognition across disparate classes of receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Residues that surround the alkyl chain of avenolide include Trp127, Val158, and Phe161, which are almost universally conserved across all members of the receptor family, whereas Leu88, which forms the opposite wall of the binding cavity, is always a hydrophobic residue but of variable size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The chain length of the methylenomycin furans (MMFs) is shorter than those of the GBLs and butenolides; correspondingly, residues at the base of the ligand-binding cavity in the AvaR1, such as Ala85, His130, and Thr131, are replaced by bulkier the Glu107, Leu150, and Leu151 in the sequence of the MMF receptor MmrF. Residue Thr161 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the lactone ring of avenolide, and this residue is conserved in receptors that bind to γ-butyrolactones and butenolides, but absent from receptors for other classes of hormones such as MmrF. Likewise, Gln64 in AvaR1 is positioned on the opposite site of the lactone and is conserved among receptors that bind to structurally related classes of hormones, but is absent from the structure of MmrF. The latter sequence contains a Tyr85 at a near equivalent position, which may be necessary for interactions with the carboxyl group of MMF.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Close-up views of AvaR1-ligand and DNA structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment of various GBL-like receptors for which ligand specificity is known.

Notably, this helix bridges the LBD and the DBD, suggesting that it plays a role in coupling ligand binding to DNA dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Specifically, movement of Gln64 and Thr108 into the ligand-binding cavity of AvaR1 upon engagement of the hormone results in the displacement of helix α6 away from the pocket. The orientation of Arg105, located on the opposite side of helix α6, is established through multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with the backbone carbonyls of conserved residues in helix α1, including the universally conserved Phe22, Gly26, and Tyr27. Hence, the accommodation of hormone binding necessitates movement of the DBD, in order to preserve the suite of hydrogen-bonding interactions with helix α6. As noted, Gln64 and Thr107 are largely conserved among receptors that bind lactone-containing hormones, suggesting a common mechanism for coupling ligand binding to DNA dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Crystal structure of AvaR1 and the binary complex with the <italic>aco</italic> ARE</title><p>In order to gain further insights into the mechanism of hormone-mediated de-repression, we also determined the structure of AvaR1 bound to a synthetic oligonucleotide derived from the autoregulator responsive element (ARE) sequence.

Crystallization efforts with the symmetric AvaR1 homodimer yielded crystals that did not diffract beyond 8 Å, presumably as a result of the asymmetry of the ARE operator. Efforts using an artificial palindromic sequence derived by inverting and repeating each half of the pseudo palindrome yielded crystals that diffracted to 3.09 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>), and the structure was determined by molecular replacement.

Numerous contacts are formed between helix α1 of the DBD and the duplex, including Arg5, which inserts into the major groove and interacts with Thy7, as well as between Lys43 and Ade15 of the ARE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additional non-specific interactions include those between Thr10, Thr42, and Tyr47 and the backbone phosphate of the duplex. A comparison of the ligand-binding sites with that in the hormone-bound structure reveals that the binding pocket is further occluded through movements of Trp127 and the loop harboring Gln64, consistent with the roles of these residues in effecting conformational movements of the DBD upon binding of the hormone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Genome mining informs on putative butenolide regulatory biosynthetic pathways</title><p>Given the improved stability of butenolides over γ-butyrolactones, we speculate that these hormones may prove more amenable in attempts to activate antibiotic production. In order to identify actinobacterial strains that are under butenolide regulatory control, we sought to use a bioinformatics approach based on the identification of the corresponding receptor. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the sequence similarity between bona fide γ-butyrolactone receptors, such as ArpA, and butenolide receptors is high (40% sequence identity with AvaR1) precluding such analysis. Orphan receptors called pseudo γ-butyrolactone receptors that are activated by multiple ligands likewise share 40% sequence identity with AvaR1, confounding simple sequence-based analysis. Prior efforts to discriminate between receptor classes have not proven fruitful, and phylogenetic analyses have failed to discriminate between positive and negative regulators.</p><p>In an effort to identify other actinobacteria that are under butenolide regulatory control, we utilized synteny of the putative butenolide biosynthetic genes to distinguish between receptor clades. We first used the Enzyme Similarity Tool (EST) from the Enzyme Function Initiative to create a Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) of all members of the receptor class. An E-value cutoff of 10<sup>−70 </sup>was used to produce an SNN in which characterized receptors of the various GBL families were segregated with mutually exclusive co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We used the resultant SSN as input for the EFI Genome Neighborhood Network (GNN) tool to identify nodes that are co-localized next to genes with PFams that are associated with putative avenolide biosynthetic genes. The fact that the butenolide receptors often regulate the production of their own ligand further enabled this approach and allowed for inferences about the classes of ligands that are produced and recognized by receptors that have yet to be characterized. Because the EFI tools are only integrated with the Uniprot database, we also manually searched sequences in Genbank for similar operonic architecture to identify putative butenolide receptors on the basis of genomic context.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sequence Similarity Networks of likely butenolide gene clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence Similarity Networks (SSN) showing the relationship between different clades of putative butenolide receptors.

We emphasize that, although this is orders of magnitude greater than the currently known number of butenolide receptors, this number represents a significant underestimate but the true number cannot be identified given the limitations of our approach. Mapping of the sequence conservation amongst these 90 receptors onto the co-crystal structure of hormone bound to AvaR1 reveals that residues Gln64, Thr108, and Trp127 , which are proposed to couple ligand binding to domain shift, are conserved among all of these sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The conservation score is highest for residues that are involved in interactions with the lactone, whereas those that interact with the alkyl tail are more divergent. These data are consistent with the observations that the lactone ring and C10 hydroxyl are general features of butenolides, whereas the length and branching of the alkyl tail vary significantly. The organization of the biosynthetic operon that harbors genes, which is hypothesized to be involved in butenolide biosynthesis, is largely conserved in these organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the bacterial hormone A-factor was discovered nearly a half century ago, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how these signaling molecules regulate gene expression. The discovery of the regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis by γ-butyrolactones inspired efforts to use these molecules as ex vivo effectors to induce otherwise silent biosynthetic gene clusters, but these efforts met with little success. The labile nature of the lactone ring, as well as the often pleiotropic effects that γ-butyrolactones induce, have presumably subverted efforts to utilize these small molecules as chemical inducers. By contrast, the structurally related butenolides show improved stability under strongly acidic and basic conditions. However, the utility of butenolides in biotechnology efforts has been limited by an inability to access these molecules.</p><p>Here, we present here an efficient and convergent 22-step total synthetic route for the production of avenolide, which can be extrapolated for the total synthesis of other members of the butenolide class of small signaling molecules. This effort allowed for detailed structure–function studies of the corresponding hormone receptor, including the first crystal structure of any GBL-type receptor bound to its cognate ligand. The structural data informs on the mechanism by which hormone binding induces a conformational change in the AvaR1 receptor, resulting in the formation of a dimeric assembly that occludes efficient DNA binding. We also elaborate a bioinformatics strategy using the genomic neighborhood context of butenolide biosynthetic genes as a marker to identify 90 actinobacterial strains that are likely to be under the regulatory control of butenolides. The addition of avenolide to the growth media for two representative strains results in changes in the color of the culture supernatant. These results support the validity of our bioinformatics approaches and set the framework for further efforts towards the use of butenolides to active antibiotic biosynthesis in otherwise silent gene clusters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Total synthetic schemes, experimental procedures, and validation of relevant synthetic intermediates are provided in the 'Supplemental data'.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Expression, purification, crystallization and structure determination of AvaR1</title><p>Wild-type protein AvaR1 was amplified from <italic>S. avermitilis</italic> genomic DNA by PCR using primers that were based on the published sequence of the polypeptide and inserted into a pET-28-MBP vector for expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a maltose binding protein (MBP)-tagged fusion.

AvaR1 was produced by growing the cells in shaking flask of LB media at a temperature of 37°C. When the cells reached an O.D.<sub>600</sub> of 0.6, the cells were cooled on ice for 15 min. Following the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl β- d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the cells were placed in an 18°C shaking incubator for 18 hr. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and re-suspended in a buffer composed of 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris base (pH 8.0), and 10% glycerol. Re-suspended cells were lysed by homogenization and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to remove cell debris. The cleared cell lysate was loaded onto a HisTrap column, which was subsequently washed with 1 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, and 20 mM Tris base (pH 8.0). MBP-tagged AvaR1 was eluted using a linear gradient beginning with 1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris base (pH 8.0), and 30 mM imidazole and ending with 250 mM imidazole. Pure fractions, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were combined and diluted two-fold before treatment with thrombin (final ratio of 1:100 [w/w]) for 18 hr at 4°C to cleave the N-terminal tag. Tag-free AvaR1 was concentrated and loaded onto a size exclusion column (Superdex S75 16/60) pre-equilibrated with 100 mM KCl and 20 mM HEPES free acid (pH 7.5). Pure fractions were collected and concentrated to 25 mg/mL before storage in liquid nitrogen.

The autoPROC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vonrhein et al., 2011</xref>) software package was utilized for the indexing and scaling of the diffraction data. Initial phases for AvaR1 were obtained using anomalous diffraction data collected on crystals of SeMet-labeled protein. Initial models were built using Phenix and Parrot/Buccaneer. Manual refinements were completed by the iterative use of COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and Phenix.refine.

Palindromic DNA sequences were first self-annealed and then double stranded DNA was used from 1 mM stock prepared in 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) buffer. The order in which reactants were added was: buffer, DNA and finally protein. For some oligonucleotides, white turbid solution was obtained as soon as the protein was added, but the addition of a few microliters of ammonium acetate and incubating at either room temperature or on ice produced clear solution.

Because the EFI webtools are only integrated with the uniprot database, we also manually scoured through a number of Genbank sequence results derived from BLAST analysis for proper genomic context relative to butenolide production. These BLAST searches used the sequences of any putative butenolide biosynthetic genes as handles.

The range of the study from total synthesis of complex small molecules to structural studies of the signaling system were all well done. There is potential for future research, possibly with identification of the upregulated small molecule(s)</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Biochemical Basis for the Regulation of Biosynthesis of Antiparasitics by Bacterial Hormones&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jon Clardy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brian Bachman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Humans use small diffusible molecules – hormones and neurotransmitters – to coordinate multicellular responses, and bacteria use a functionally equivalent system – bacterial hormones in this manuscript – to coordinate cellular behavior. This study investigated one foundational signaling system in molecular and mechanistic detail to produce an informative description of how the bacterial hormone avenolide binds to its cognate receptor AvaR1 to regulate the production of other diffusible small molecules, some of which could be previously undescribed and conceivably therapeutically useful. The report clearly describes the studies in convincing and clear detail.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both peer reviewers and the Reviewing Editor thought that the article contained convincing data on an important topic and that a suitably revised manuscript would be a worthy contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>. They also felt that the manuscript needed additional work in explaining the motivation for some studies and ideally additional experimental data. Specifically:</p><p>• The manuscript described a detailed structural study on an important regulator of small molecule biosynthesis with potential significance to the discovery of new molecules that might be useful therapeutic leads. The manuscript concludes with a demonstration of this potential that is, to put it bluntly, underwhelming: color changes that might indicate the production of previously cryptic molecules. There is no additional evidence to support this interpretation. No differential metabolomics that would indicate production of a new molecule, no evidence that the production of any new molecule was induced through AvaR1 regulation, not even evidence that there was a qualitative, not quantitative, change in metabolism were presented.</p><p>• The manuscript would benefit from a clearer description of why avenolide was synthesized and why the strategy was significant.

They also felt that the manuscript needed additional work in explaining the motivation for some studies and ideally additional experimental data. Specifically:</p><p>• The manuscript described a detailed structural study on an important regulator of small molecule biosynthesis with potential significance to the discovery of new molecules that might be useful therapeutic leads. The manuscript concludes with a demonstration of this potential that is, to put it bluntly, underwhelming: color changes that might indicate the production of previously cryptic molecules. There is no additional evidence to support this interpretation. No differential metabolomics that would indicate production of a new molecule, no evidence that the production of any new molecule was induced through AvaR1 regulation, not even evidence that there was a qualitative, not quantitative, change in metabolism were presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback and constructive criticisms of our manuscript. We had been able to obtain metabolomics data but could not conduct these in replicate prior to the shutdown. While these data do show evidence for the production of new (as yet unidentified) molecules, due to the lack of replicate data we have opted not to include them in the revised manuscript. We have deleted the color changing experiments as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The manuscript would benefit from a clearer description of why avenolide was synthesized and why the strategy was significant.

A synthetic approach was needed as it was the both the most efficient way to obtain the desired ligand, and because it may be easily adapted for the synthesis for other activating butenolides with slightly different chemical structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>In the event you are not able to provide more substantial proof of the ability/potential to discover new molecules to the current manuscript, we would suggest deleting the color change experiments.
