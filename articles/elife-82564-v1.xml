However, mechanistic understanding of how GWAS variants influence complex morphological traits and can, in certain cases, simultaneously confer normal-range phenotypic variation and disease predisposition, is still largely lacking. Here, we focus on <italic>rs6740960</italic>, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the 2p21 locus, which in GWAS studies has been associated both with normal-range variation in jaw shape and with an increased risk of non-syndromic orofacial clefting. Using in vitro derived embryonic cell types relevant for human facial morphogenesis, we show that this SNP resides in an enhancer that regulates chondrocytic expression of <italic>PKDCC</italic> - a gene encoding a tyrosine kinase involved in chondrogenesis and skeletal development. In agreement, we demonstrate that the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP is sufficient to confer chondrocyte-specific differences in <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression. By deploying dense landmark morphometric analysis of skull elements in mice, we show that changes in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> dosage are associated with quantitative changes in the maxilla, mandible, and palatine bone shape that are concordant with the facial phenotypes and disease predisposition seen in humans. We further demonstrate that the frequency of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> variant strongly deviated among different human populations, and that the activity of its cognate enhancer diverged in hominids. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of how a common SNP can mediate normal-range and disease-associated morphological variation, with implications for the evolution of human facial features.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enhancer evolution</kwd><kwd>craniofacial development</kwd><kwd>face-shape variation</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1711847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohammed</surname><given-names>Jaaved</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE027023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaffer</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Claes</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008483</institution-id><institution>NOMIS Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SNP-editing of human embryonic stem cells reveals cell type specific function of a genetic variant associated with changes in human jaw shape.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The face is one of the most complex structures of the human body and has changed dramatically over the course of human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitteroecker et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to facilitating the coordination of multiple sensory organs, protection of the brain, and a number of biological adaptations, the human craniofacial complex is a target of sexual selection and plays key roles in communication and other social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheehan and Nachman, 2014</xref>). The human face shape varies tremendously across individuals, much of which is genetically encoded, as manifested by the high similarity of facial features in monozygotic twins and by familial resemblances [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naqvi et al., 2022</xref>]. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding the genetic underpinnings of the normal-range facial variation in human populations through GWAS [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weinberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naqvi et al., 2022</xref>]. Collectively, these studies have uncovered over 300 loci associated with different aspects of facial shape, indicating that - perhaps not surprisingly - facial shape is a highly polygenic trait [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naqvi et al., 2022</xref>.] Furthermore, as has been seen for many other human phenotypic traits, facial shape GWAS variants map to the non-coding parts of the genome and are especially enriched within <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements, such as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claes et al., 2018</xref>). Enhancers are modular genetic elements that activate the expression of their target genes over long genomic distances and in a tissue-specific manner [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furlong and Levine, 2018</xref>]. As would be expected, enrichment of facial GWAS signals in enhancers is specific to cell types relevant for facial morphogenesis during development, including early fetal facial tissue, in vitro derived embryonic facial progenitors called cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), and their more differentiated descendants, such as cranial chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naqvi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2021</xref>). These observations support the <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory origins of normal-range human facial diversity, whereby non-coding genetic variants affect enhancer function and lead to quantitative changes in gene expression in cell types contributing to facial morphogenesis during development.</p><p>In addition to the genetic underpinnings of normal-range facial variation, GWAS of non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P) has revealed the polygenic architecture of this common birth defect, with risk variants again mapping mostly to the non-coding parts of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leslie, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naqvi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weinberg, 2022</xref>). While CL/P co-occurs with several Mendelian craniofacial syndromes, the majority of cases (~70%) are non-syndromic (meaning, occurring in the absence of other manifestations) and characterized by complex inheritance. We and others previously noted an overlap between sequence variants associated with nsCL/P risk and normal-range face shape variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boehringer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Indencleef et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indencleef et al., 2021</xref>). For example, the <italic>rs6740960</italic> variant at the 2p21 locus affects the normal-range jaw shape and confers nsCL/P risk in Europeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ludwig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claes et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, such SNPs at the intersection of normal and dysmorphic facial features show high heterozygosity in the analyzed populations and affect diverse aspects of the normal-range facial morphology, such as the shape of the jaw, philtrum, or nose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Indencleef et al., 2018</xref>). These observations raise a question of how such common genetic variants simultaneously confer disease predisposition and normal-range phenotypic variation of distinct facial regions.</p><p>Despite the enormous progress in understanding the genetics of the normal-range and disease-associated phenotypic variation of facial features and other human traits, functional follow-up studies have lagged behind. Such studies may involve the discovery of functional variants directly relevant for gene expression, identifying the specific cell types and spatiotemporal contexts they act in, and pinpointing the genes they regulate [for example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Small et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caliskan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinnott-Armstrong et al., 2021</xref>]. Even more rudimentary is our understanding of mechanisms by which changes in gene dosage associated with common genetic variation translate into complex human phenotypes. This scarcity of mechanistic discernment is not unique to the face, but emerges as a general bottleneck in translating GWAS results to genuine insights into molecular and cellular processes underlying complex traits and diseases, and utilizing them for new therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cano-Gamez and Trynka, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we deploy an integrated ‘SNP-to-phenotype’ approach, combining trait-relevant in vitro human stem cell models with in vivo studies in mice to probe the mechanism by which a specific GWAS-identified variant, <italic>rs6740960</italic>, affects both normal-range facial shape and confers nsCL/P risk. We identify a craniofacial enhancer harboring the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP, characterize its cell-type specific and facial-domain restricted activity pattern, and describe changes in activity during hominid evolution. Using in situ chromatin conformation capture experiments, we link the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer to its target gene, <italic>PKDCC</italic>. Through genome editing, we then uncover the chondrocyte-specific impact of this enhancer and of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP itself on the <italic>PKDCC</italic> dosage. Finally, using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) coupled with dense landmark morphometric analysis of skull elements, we demonstrate the phenotypic impact of <italic>Pkdcc</italic> dosage on mouse craniofacial development and reveal its striking concordance with the lower jaw phenotypes and clefting predisposition associated with the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Common genetic variant at 2p21 associated with lower jaw shape variation and susceptibility to clefting shows large frequency shifts in human populations</title><p>Our recent multivariate GWAS studies of normal-range facial variation in two independent European ancestry populations revealed an association of non-coding genetic variants at the 2p21 locus with lower jaw and chin shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2021</xref>). The lead SNP at this locus, <italic>rs6740960</italic> (A/T) (lowest meta-analysis p-value = 3.39 × 10<sup>–36</sup>), was significantly associated with shape variation over the entire face, however, the most pronounced effects were seen in the lower face, especially in the jaw region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, the ‘T’ allele (Allele Frequency = 0.497 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claes et al., 2018</xref>) is associated with an outward protrusion of the lower jaw and zygomatic region, coupled with a retrusion of the entire central midface. Interestingly, this same lead SNP was significantly associated with non-syndromic cleft-lip and palate (nsCL/P) in a separate GWAS from an independent cohort of European ancestry individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ludwig et al., 2017</xref>).

We observed a large range of ‘A’ vs ‘T’ allele frequencies, with the ‘A’ allele occurring at roughly 50% frequency in Europeans and South Asians (i.e. Europeans = 52%, South Asians = 58%), but at much lower frequencies in other populations (i.e. 21% in Africans and to its lowest frequency of 2% in East Asians) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These allele frequencies were also consistent within a second human population dataset, namely the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergström et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the fixation index metric, <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>, between East-Asians and either Europeans or South-Asians was 0.48 and 0.52, respectively, indicative of high genetic differentiation between East Asians and these two populations for this specific SNP. <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> values range from 0 to 1 with 0 indicative of identical allelic content whereas 1 indicates that alternate alleles are fixed in each sub-population. Large shifts in <italic>rs6740960</italic> allele frequency within human populations, and high <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> values between populations, suggest that this GWAS variant may have a distinct impact on facial shape variation and disease predisposition in different populations, with potential population-specific selection events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>rs6740960</italic> resides in a craniofacial enhancer with evolutionarily modulated activity</title><p>To investigate the evolutionary history of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> variant, we constructed sequence alignments of extant and archaic reconstructed hominin and hominid species, centered at the SNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, enrichment of the coactivator p300 and of the active chromatin mark H3K27ac at this region is higher in the chimpanzee CNCCs as compared to humans, suggesting that this non-coding element may have higher regulatory activity in the chimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the genomic region spanning <italic>rs6740960</italic> is a <italic>bona fide</italic> craniofacial enhancer, we cloned orthologous human (with an ancestral T variant at <italic>rs6740960</italic>) and chimpanzee regions into a LacZ reporter vector and assayed them by conventional transgenic mouse reporter assays. The resulting activity patterns were analyzed by LacZ staining of E11.5 mouse embryos. We observed that the human element displayed specific craniofacial activity in the developing upper and lower jaw primordia (mandibular and maxillary prominences), and in the lateral nasal prominence, but had little activity in the medial nasal prominence or in other tissues of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Although one caveat to this analysis is that the transgenic reporter was integrated randomly, and thus a subject of positional effects, we have observed weaker activity of the human enhancer across multiple embryos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for all LacZ positive embryos).

The closest annotated gene to the <italic>rs6740960</italic> is <italic>C2orf91 (LINC02898</italic>). However, when we examined RNA-seq data from the in vitro derived CNCCs and their derivative cell types, we observed minimal if any, expression of <italic>C2orf91</italic> (TPM &lt;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer may be a more distal gene.

To examine long-range interactions of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer during craniofacial development, we utilized an in vitro model previously developed in our laboratory, in which hESC are differentiated to CNCCs, and then further to cranial chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). From these cell derivatives, we profiled active chromatin by H3K27ac ChIP-seq and enhancer-promoter interactions using H3K27ac HiChIP, an assay based on principles of chromatin conformation capture, which further enriches for long-range interactions between active regulatory elements via an immunoprecipitation step with an H3K27ac antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mumbach et al., 2016</xref>). In H3K27ac ChIP-seq data, we observed that the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer is comparably enriched for H3K27ac both in CNCCs and in cranial chondrocytes, although in general, there was more H3K27ac at the locus in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We further confirmed commensurate H3K27ac levels at the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer in CNCCs and chondrocytes using the more quantitative ChIP-qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Nonetheless, the allele bearing the ‘T’ variant at <italic>rs6740960</italic> showed a 15–30% reduction in <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression across examined cell lines, and this reduction was observed only in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> for independent biological replicate). Of note, while the ‘T’ mutation consistently resulted in diminished <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression across cell lines, the effect was larger when one allele was targeted compared to the other; similar effects were observed in heterozygous deletion lines where the enhancer has been deleted from alternate alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Given the modest, normal-range face shape changes associated with <italic>rs6740960</italic> in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we also expected subtle phenotypes associated with <italic>Pkdcc</italic> heterozygosity in mice, requiring both a large animal sample size and sensitive morphometric analysis. In this vein, we utilized a pipeline that incorporated high-resolution micro-CT data from 20 wild-type and 24 <italic>Pkdcc<sup>+/-</sup></italic> E18.5 mutant embryos spanning seven litters, manual bone segmentation, and dense landmarking of bone surfaces to capture subtle effects on bone shape variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To circumvent the limitations of sparsely labeled bone landmarks common to standard morphometric analysis, we used the software package MeshMonk, to densely landmark each specimen via a non-rigid registration of a template surface onto each specimen thereby allowing comparative bone surface evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White et al., 2019</xref>). Using the full collection of aligned surfaces as the measured phenotype, we used partial least-squares regressions and permutation tests to compute the effect of genotype, independent of other covariates such as litter and sex, on phenotype, either at the level of complete bone shape or variation at each vertex (see <bold>Methods</bold>). Local regions of depression or protrusion in the shape of the bone in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> heterozygous mutant animals, as compared to wild-type animals, are visualized in blue and red color maps representing the regression coefficients.</p><p>Using this pipeline, we characterized the phenotypes of the mandible, maxilla, and palatine bones. We saw overall significant changes to the mandible shape, with strong local effects seen within the mandibular ramus and mental protuberance region, especially evident in the elongation of the angular process and mental region in <italic>Pkdcc<sup>+/-</sup></italic> as compared to wild-type animals, phenotypes consistent with the protruding jaw phenotype reported in GWAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video6 fig4video7">Figure 4—videos 6–7</xref>). Additionally, we observed significant shape variation in the oral view of the palatine bone, especially in the distance between the symmetric horizontal plates whose eventual closure forms the base of the hard palate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video8 fig4video9 fig4video10">Figure 4—videos 8–10</xref>). A similar effect was observed, but to a lesser extent, for the palatal processes of the maxillae. The palatine and maxillary phenotypes are more subtle and distinct from the complete cleft phenotype that is present in the <italic>Pkdcc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> homozygous mice. These changes can explain why alternations in <italic>PKDCC</italic> dosage associated with a common genetic variant in humans increase susceptibility to clefting, but are not by themselves sufficient to cause CL/P. Finally, we examined the maxilla for shape differences between genotypes. We observed no appreciable differences within the palatine process of the maxilla, but we saw significant shape changes throughout the zygomatic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video8 fig4video9 fig4video10">Figure 4—videos 8–10</xref>). Interestingly, these observations may potentially explain why the <italic>rs6740960</italic> variant shows a modest, but significant association with cheek shape in facial GWAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In summary, quantitative exploration of facial phenotypes in <italic>Pkdcc<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice has allowed us to identify specific anatomical structures that are affected by decreases in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> gene dosage. The remarkable concordance of these phenotypes and face shape changes associated with the <italic>rs6740960</italic> substitution in humans provides strong support to our hypothesis that this genetic variant affects normal-range and disease-associated facial variation through regulating the expression of <italic>PKDCC</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study provides an in-depth functional analysis of a non-coding genetic variant associated with both normal-range and disease-associated variation in a human morphological trait. Based on our collective results we propose a mechanism of <italic>rs6740960</italic> function. The <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP resides in and modulates the activity of a craniofacial enhancer active in the developing jaw primordia. This enhancer regulates the expression of <italic>PKDCC</italic> in cranial chondrocytes. The <italic>PKDCC</italic> gene encodes a secreted tyrosine kinase, which remodels the extracellular matrix during cartilage development and affects the timing of proliferative chondrocyte differentiation and subsequent bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordoli et al., 2014</xref>). Although in mice <italic>Pkdcc/Vlk</italic> is also important for long bone development in limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imuta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinoshita et al., 2009</xref>), the craniofacial activity of the cognate <italic>rs6740960</italic> enhancer restricts the SNP effects on <italic>PKDCC</italic> dosage to the developing face. Thus, a parsimonious explanation for the association of <italic>rs6740960</italic> with facial variation is through the sensitivity of cranial chondrogenesis, and in turn facial skeletal development, to the <italic>PKDCC</italic> dosage. This may be especially pronounced during lower jaw development, where the transient Meckel’s cartilage impacts mandibular form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svandova et al., 2020</xref>), and mandibular chondrocytes can directly transform into bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jing et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we demonstrated that in mice 50% reduction in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> dosage results in quantitative changes in the shape of several mandibular regions.</p><p>Our observations can also explain why <italic>rs6740960</italic> is associated with nsCL/P. The reduction in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> dosage increased the distance between the horizontal plates of the palatine bones (and the palatal plates of the maxillae to a lesser extent) which ultimately need to fuse to form the secondary palate, but by itself, is not sufficient for clefting. This makes sense, given that the frequency of the risk-conferring <italic>rs6740960</italic> ‘T’ allele in the European ancestry population (even in a homozygous setting) is two orders of magnitude higher than the frequency of orofacial clefting in the same population. Thus, by definition, the risk variant must work additively or synergistically with other variants acting on genes affecting palate development, either at the same locus or at different loci, and/or with environmental factors. These include prenatal exposure to alcohol, nicotine, viruses, maternal diabetes, and methyl donor deficiency, all of which are linked to an increased prevalence of orofacial clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinelli et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, unaffected relatives of individuals with nsCL/P show distinctive facial features, which have been quantitatively characterized to define a subclinical ‘endophenotype’ that may reflect a heightened susceptibility to clefting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indencleef et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weinberg, 2022</xref>). Subsequent GWAS analysis revealed loci associated with nsCL/P endophenotype in a healthy, unselected population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indencleef et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, one of the genome-wide significant lead SNPs from this analysis, <italic>rs4952552</italic>, maps to the <italic>PKDCC</italic> locus, suggesting that the impact of <italic>rs6740960</italic> on clefting risk is likely modulated by the presence of other common variants acting on <italic>PKDCC</italic>.</p><p>It is not entirely clear what the embryological origins of the maxillary and palatine changes observed in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> heterozygous mutants, particularly given the intramembranous origin of these bones. One possibility is that these changes are a secondary consequence of effects taking place in the adjacent endochondral cranial base. Another possibility worth future exploration is that in addition to chondrocytes, mesenchymal tissues forming the bony structures of the palate are also sensitive to <italic>Pkdcc</italic> dosage. Consistent with this possibility, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinoshita et al., 2009</xref> showed that <italic>Pkdcc</italic> is expressed in the CNCC-derived mesenchyme populating the palatal shelves. Regardless, the quantitative phenotypes we describe in <italic>Pkdcc</italic> heterozygous mice are consistent with an increased susceptibility of clefting in Europeans carrying the risk-conferring <italic>rs6740960</italic> allele.</p><p>The activity of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer diverged in hominids, suggesting that this element may have contributed to the divergence in craniofacial morphology between hominid species. Our analysis also revealed drastic variation in <italic>rs6740960</italic> allele frequency across modern human populations, with Europeans and South Asians showing high heterozygosity for this SNP, and East Asians exhibiting prevalence of the ancestral ‘T’ allele. What could be the potential adaptive advantages for the increased frequency of the human-derived allele in European and South Asian populations? Our analysis suggests that the variation in jaw phenotype associated with the <italic>rs6740960</italic> was partly driven by variation in the angular process of the mandible. The angular process, or mandibular angle, attaches to the masseter muscle which generates the majority of bite-force during mastication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sella-Tunis et al., 2018</xref>). Could the derived ‘A’ allele facilitate masticatory adaptations influenced by dietary changes along population boundaries? Was the increase in the derived allele frequency associated with the elevated susceptibility to clefting associated with the ancestral allele in the European population? And if so, are East Asians buffered from these effects by other, compensatory genetic variants? Or, alternatively, could the advantageous benefit be purely an aesthetic one, with a less or more protruding jaw appearance affecting sexual selection differently in distinct human populations and cultures? While we do not have answers to these questions at present, our results merit further consideration in the context of human facial adaptations and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and differentiation of hESCs to CNCCs and cranial chondrocytes</title><p>Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC) H9 line (directly obtained from WiCell Research Institute [catalog number WA09]) was cultured and differentiation to CNCCs using a protocol previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>.

provides an important exemplar of a coordinated body of work (using differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] and phenotyping of a mouse mutant) to dissect the mechanism by which a candidate human single nucleotide variant (SNV) may influence both shape variation in the oro-mandibular region, and susceptibility to cleft lip/palate. The extensive use of genome editing to introduce both targeted deletions and single nucleotide variants, taking into account that each allele has a different natural haplotype background associated with a differing functional readout, is especially compelling. As well as being of general interest to craniofacial biologists, the iPSC targeting approach is more broadly applicable, provided that a relevant functional readout can be identified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82564.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Wilkie</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03x94j517</institution-id><institution>MRC</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.05.506587">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.05.506587v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 made reference to other SNPs potentially in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs6740960. Confounding by LD is a well-known problem for the field, which was not addressed in the introductory part of the manuscript, which early on slipped into &quot;causal&quot; language for this SNP at multiple points; this should not be the starting point of this work. Whilst evidence previously presented by Ludwig (HMG 2017) on cleft lip/palate seems informative in this regard, the significance of this work was not highlighted, nor were equivalent imputation data for the facial GWAS signal presented. If further analysis supports that the rs6740960 SNP is &quot;untaggable&quot;, the potential mechanisms (ie recurrent mutation vs recombination vs selection) and significance of this should be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>2) Neither the evidence that rs6740960 is the causal SNP, nor if so its target of action (proposed to be PKDCC, rather than the lncRNA gene LINC02898 (c2orf91), which encompasses the rs6740960 SNP), were considered definitive. For example, the resolution of the H3K27HiChip appeared insufficient to establish direct enhancer/promoter interactions, and the H3K27/ddPCR experiment shown in Figure 3D, whilst consistent with differences in the enhancer chromatin state between the SNP alleles, does not indicate the functional effect of that difference. Whilst the homologous region of the mouse genome was not considered to show craniofacial enhancer activity (therefore limiting its use in further experiments), it is unclear why the 500 kb region chosen for the transgenic experiments did not coincide properly with the region that is conserved between vertebrates, thereby limiting the strength of this conclusion (Figure 2B). Such transgenic experiments are subject to position and dosage effects and more numerical details of the number of experiments conducted in each species should be provided.</p><p>Overall, the referees agreed that they would like to see a more definitive assay, either in cells or in vivo, that directly demonstrates a functional link between the proposed SNP (and not any other SNP in LD with it) and a downstream readout; and that this readout is specific to PKDCC rather than LINC02898 (c2orf91) (or affects both).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a solid manuscript that is easy to read.</p><p>The major unaddressed question here is that all the evidence they present is consistent with the possibility that a SNP in linkage disequilibrium is the actual causal one. This putative SNP could potentially be some distance away and indirectly affect activity of the enhancer that harbors rs6740960. This possibility is not farfetched and needs to be addressed. The strongest test is to engineer to homozygosity in iPSC and then differentiate the cells to chondrocyte. This group has the ability to carry out this incisive experiment. Much easier, and necessary at a minimum, is to carry out standard reporter assays with enhancer constructs bearing the two alleles in their cellular model.</p><p>The genome editing experiments were not conducted with sufficient rigor. For instance, it is not mentioned whether the WT unedited cells have undergone clonal isolation in Figure 3C dataset. To negate the possibility of off-target effect of CRISPR-Cas9, data from at least 3 engineered clones and 3 unedited clones are needed. For controls, rather than the parental cells, it is expected to use clones of cells that have been transfected with the targeting construct (or a non-specific targeting construct) and Cas9 but not edited (several such clones are shown in Figure 3, supplement 2). Moreover, a minimum of three clones for unedited and edited versions of the enhancers are necessary for credible quantitation.</p><p>The mouse reporter experiments are interpreted with quantitative language:</p><p>&quot;The chimp ortholog of the rs6740960 cognate enhancer … relative to the human element, showed both stronger and broader activity, which extended to the medial nasal prominence.&quot;</p><p>However, lacZ transgenic mouse reporter assays are not quantitative – unless there were single copies, or equivalent numbers of copies, of the two versions of the construct and they were integrated in a safe harbor locus. Insufficient details are provided on how this experiment was performed to know whether this bar was met. There is expression visible in the MNP in both versions, so they cannot argue that this domain is gained in the chimp version of the enhancer. Minimally, the numbers of transgenic embryos scored must be presented. How many embryos that were transgenic but had no signal, or the non-consensus pattern, were scored? The solid conclusion from this experiment is that the enhancer is active in the midface, the conclusion that the chimp and human versions are of different strength is not convincingly established.</p><p>The ancestral T allele is found in non-human primates. Do such primates exhibit more protruding jaw morphology than humans (chimps are not the appropriate comparator, because of the other changes in this enhancer)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please address why this enhancer region was not identified as Chimp biased in the original Prescot et al. analysis. Please plot all chromatin signals corrected for input according to Roadmap/ENCODE standards as they can be highly misleading as presented.</p><p>Please show publicly available data from Mouse ENCODE for evidence of enhancer activity in mouse craniofacial development. This will allow the reader to put into context the lack of enhancer activity from the lacZ assay for interpreting small differences between human and chimp versions of the sequence. Further test larger regions of the mouse sequence to concretely determine lack of enhancer activity.</p><p>The PKDCC knockout mouse has already been well characterized over 10 years ago. While the microCT data is much more quantitative and shows changes in the heterozygote the main premise of the paper is about the regulatory region controlling PKDCC. Since minimal differences in expression were seen in the human system either both copies of the enhancer should be deleted in the human system or perturbation of the endogenous mouse sequence should be attempted.</p><p>Please address the potential for a lncRNA directly adjacent to this locus. There is public data to suggest that it is expressed in CNCCs and primary craniofacial tissue but unknown in chondrocytes. Is this RNA species indeed expressed in the cells at hand and do it levels change in a similar way as chromatin activity. Lastly if it is indeed expressed is this RNA itself needed for the expression modulation effect?</p><p>Data is in an appropriate repository and available for inspection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1: In Figure 2 a multi-species alignment is shown. Since the mouse enhancer seems to behave differently, the question would be how conserved the enhancer is in mouse? Or what is different?</p><p>2: Figure 2C: how many embryos showed this exact staining?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82564.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 made reference to other SNPs potentially in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs6740960.

We acknowledge that in the original manuscript we have not fully explained the rationale for prioritizing the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP for the follow-up experiments. The <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP emerged as the lead SNP at the 2p21 locus both in our facial GWAS analysis and in a GWAS of susceptibility to clefting by Ludwig (HMG 2017) conducted on an independent European ancestry cohort. The reviewer is correct that other GWAS-significant SNPs in high LD with the lead SNP may be causative. In our GWAS analysis, <italic>rs6740960</italic> is in high LD with only one other genome-wide significant SNP, <italic>rs4952552</italic> (r<sup>2</sup>=0.81 using the 1000 Genomes Project European cohort), located ~16 kb away. To document this, we now present a LocusZoom plot in which LD correlation coefficient r<sup>2</sup> was computed between <italic>rs6740960</italic> and all other jaw-associated SNPs at the 2p21 locus found from our previous work, along with association significance, the locations of genes, and recombination rates and boundaries (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). From this plot, it is evident that <italic>rs4952552</italic> is the only genome-wide significant SNP at the locus with the r<sup>2</sup> value &gt;0.7. Among the two SNPs, we further prioritized <italic>rs6740960</italic>, as we found that this SNP, but not <italic>rs4952552</italic>, overlapped an open chromatin region in facial progenitor cells, CNCCs. We have now included a genome browser snapshot illustrating this to provide the rationale for further focusing on <italic>rs6740960</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B)<italic>.</italic> Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>rs4952552</italic> is associated with regulatory activity in some other, unexamined cell type and therefore might also functionally contribute to the association with jaw shape. In the revised manuscript we have added a sentence: <italic>‘Nonetheless, we note that other SNPs in linkage with rs6740960 may contribute to the observed genetic association of the 2p21 locus with the lower jaw shape.’</italic> Most importantly, through new genome-editing experiments, we now provide direct evidence that <italic>rs6740960</italic> is sufficient to drive chondrocyte-specific changes in <italic>PKDCC</italic> dosage in a native genomic context (please see our response to the second essential point).</p><p>Regarding the imputation data: the SNP <italic>rs6740960</italic> was imputed in our GWAS with a high imputation INFO score of 0.91. Imputation was based upon the reference haplotypes from the pre-phased genotypes of European individuals within the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel phase 3. This score values range from 0 to 1 with 0 meaning complete lack of support for a SNP’s allelic phase, and 1 representing SNPs that were genotyped. Higher values indicate higher probabilities of a SNP’s phase based on haplotype configurations within the reference panel. Broadly accepted threshold for inclusion of imputed variants is INFO score &gt; 0.8 at minor allele frequency &gt; 1%. We have now included this information in the methods of the revised manuscript. Of note, <italic>rs4952552,</italic> the SNP in high LD with <italic>rs6740960</italic> was directly genotyped in our GWAS study, which contributes to the high imputation score of the latter variant. Overall, our observations support the ‘taggability’ of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Neither the evidence that rs6740960 is the causal SNP, nor if so its target of action (proposed to be PKDCC, rather than the lncRNA gene LINC02898 (c2orf91), which encompasses the rs6740960 SNP), were considered definitive. For example, the resolution of the H3K27HiChip appeared insufficient to establish direct enhancer/promoter interactions, and the H3K27/ddPCR experiment shown in Figure 3D, whilst consistent with differences in the enhancer chromatin state between the SNP alleles, does not indicate the functional effect of that difference.

We address these concerns in turn.</p><p><italic>LINC02898 (C2orf91)</italic> as the potential target gene. <italic>C2orf91 (LINC02898)</italic>, a previously uncharacterized protein-coding gene that was later reclassified as a lincRNA, is indeed the closest gene to <italic>rs6740960</italic> and we have considered it as a potential target of <italic>rs6740960</italic> enhancer activity<italic>.</italic> However, this gene is not expressed at appreciable levels in any of the relevant cell types we have examined, including in vitro derived CNCCs and cranial chondrocytes or fetal facial tissues. For example, in our in vitro derived CNCCs and cranial chondrocytes, we find that <italic>C2orf91</italic> has Transcripts Per Million (TPM) &lt; 1, which is well below the community accepted threshold for defining an “expressed” gene (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This observation was corroborated in RNA-seq data from CNCCs of (Yankee, J.N. et al. Nat Comm 2023), which were in vitro derived using a different differentiation protocol, as recommended by the reviewers (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In contrast, in the same cells, <italic>PKDCC</italic> is expressed at levels comparable to those of key CNCC transcription factors, <italic>AP2α</italic> and <italic>NR2F1</italic>. To rule out our RNA-seq processing pipeline as a source of <italic>C2orf91</italic> potentially overlooked higher expression, we note that all RNA-seq datasets in our study were uniformly processed through the ENCODE RNA-seq pipeline to arrive at our observation of TPM &lt; 1 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/rna-seq/long-rnas/">(</ext-link>https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/rna-seq/long-rnas/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/rna-seq/long-rnas/">)</ext-link>. As the reviewers suggested, we also inspected the <italic>recount3</italic> database of our previously published CNCC dataset (Prescott, S. et al. Cell 2015), but found no more than a few raw reads that aligned to <italic>C2orf91</italic>, which pales in comparison to the hundreds of raw reads that align to <italic>PKDCC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq datasets from in vitro derived late CNCC differentiated from H9 hESCs (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>).</title><p>Datasets were re-processed using <italic>recount3</italic> pipeline recommended by a reviewer. Shown here are the limited number of raw reads that align to lincRNA <italic>C2orf91</italic> (<italic>LINC02898</italic>), versus the hundreds of raw reads that align to <italic>PKDCC</italic>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82564-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We then proceeded to use PCR-based assays to detect <italic>C2orf91</italic> expression. RT-qPCR assays conducted in CNCCs and cranial chondrocytes were unable to distinguish <italic>C2orf91</italic>’s expression from a negative, water-only control sample. Finally, we were unable to detect <italic>C2orf91</italic> expression using ddPCR, which made the study of <italic>C2orf91</italic>’s allelic imbalance upon enhancer perturbation infeasible. Overall, we conclude that <italic>C2orf91</italic> is not expressed at appreciable levels in CNCCs and cranial chondrocytes and thus it is an unlikely – and also technically inaccessible to measure – functional target of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer in these cell types. In contrast, our data show strong effects of the enhancer deletion (and now also of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP itself) on expression of <italic>PKDCC</italic>, a gene well-expressed in the aforementioned cell types and involved in the relevant biological processes such as chondrogenesis and development of the jaw and palate.</p><p>Functionality of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP. In the original manuscript, we demonstrated that the deletion of the <italic>rs6740960</italic> cognate enhancer results in a 40-60% reduction of <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression selectively in cranial chondrocytes. In the revised manuscript, we have now included an additional clonal line with the enhancer deletion to further corroborate these data (one of the reviewers requested three edited lines instead of two) (Updated Figure 3C). All comparisons were done with the isogenic cells that underwent the editing process but remained unedited, and we also note that our measurements are internally controlled, meaning that in the ddPCR we compare <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression from one vs the other allele in the same cell population, making it a highly quantitative and sensitive assay for detecting allelic imbalances.</p><p>Nonetheless, as the reviewers pointed out these data do not show that the <italic>rs6740960</italic> SNP is directly driving changes in <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression. To address this critique, we used genome editing to create multiple, independent clonal <italic>rs6740960</italic> A/T heterozygous hESC lines (wild-type H9 hESC used in our studies are A/A homozygous for <italic>rs6740960</italic>). Given that H9 hESCs are heterozygous for other variants at the locus, we obtained cell lines in which one or the other alternate allele was mutated from A to T at <italic>rs6740960</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Following differentiation to CNCCs and cranial chondrocytes, we compared allelic imbalance in <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression in these lines to the homozygous, A/A cells. As might be expected, the effects of the single base mutation were not as large as those seen for the deletion of the entire enhancer. Nonetheless, the allele bearing the ‘T’ variant at <italic>rs6740960</italic> showed a 15-30% reduction in <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression across all examined mutant cell lines, and importantly, this allelic imbalance was observed only in chondrocytes (Updated Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 5). These results definitively demonstrate that <italic>rs6740960</italic> is sufficient to cause chondrocyte-specific changes in <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression.</p><p>Of note, while the ‘T’ mutation consistently resulted in diminished <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression across cell lines, the effect was larger when one allele was targeted compared to the other (~30% vs 15% reduction); similar differences were observed in heterozygous deletion lines where enhancer has been deleted from these alternate alleles (Updated Figure 3C, compare haplotype 1 and haplotype 2). These observations suggest that other <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory variants at the locus (not necessarily in LD with <italic>rs6740960</italic>) can modulate effects of <italic>rs6740960</italic> and its cognate enhancer on <italic>PKDCC</italic> expression.</p><p>LacZ transgenic reporter experiments in mice. We agree with the reviewers that LacZ transgenic mouse assays are hampered by positional effects of random transgene integration. We have now included Figure 2—figure supplement 1 showing all LacZ-positive transgenic animals bearing the human and chimpanzee enhancer orthologs. These images indicate that while there is a substantial variability in these assays, on average animals bearing the chimpanzee enhancer ortholog do show stronger and broader staining patterns in the frontonasal prominence as compared with the animals bearing the human ortholog (ancestral version). To properly qualify these results, in the revised manuscript we added a sentence:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Although one caveat to this analysis is that the transgenic reporter was integrated randomly, and thus a subject of positional effects, we have consistently observed weaker activity of the human enhancer across multiple embryos (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for all LacZ positive embryos).”</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding why the 500 bp region was chosen for the transgenic assays rather than the full vertebrate conserved region: this was for a historical reason, as we first tested the activity of the human and chimp orthologs using the 500 bp region, and subsequently cloned the corresponding mouse region to maintain consistency. However, we do agree with the reviewers that we cannot exclude the possibility that the longer mouse sequence might show activity. Given that our manuscript is focused on the human variant and that the mouse enhancer was tangential to our studies, we decided to remove the mouse ortholog transgenic reporter data or any claims regarding mouse enhancer activity or lack thereof from the manuscript. This in no way impacts our conclusions from the quantitative analyses of the <italic>Pkdcc</italic> dosage on skull shape.</p></body></sub-article></article>
