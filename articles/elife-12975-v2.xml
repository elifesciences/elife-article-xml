Small chemical groups can be attached to the gene’s DNA, which dictates whether it is activated or inactivated. For example, methyl groups can be attached to DNA by enzymes known as DNA methytransferases in a process called DNA methylation.</p><p>In mammals, the pattern of DNA methylation changes in a highly regulated manner as the embryo develops. Mice that lack enzymes called DNA methytransferase 1 or DNA methytransferase 3b (shortened to Dnmt1 or Dnmt3b) die before they are born. It is also widely believed that Dnmt1 is needed to preserve DNA methylation patterns in dividing cells, and this enzyme is often called a ‘maintenance’ methyltransferase because it maintains the DNA methylation pattern in newly formed cells.</p><p>Epithelial cells that form an animal’s intestine are constantly being produced from dividing cells found in folds of the intestine called crypts. These cells are among the most rapidly dividing cells in animals, and are replaced every three to five days throughout adult life. Recently in 2015, researchers deleted the gene for Dnmt1 in intestinal cells in adult mice. This caused a reduction in DNA methylation and led to abnormal gene activation. However, the crypt cells were still able to form new cells to renew the intestine.</p><p>Elliott, Sheaffer and Kaestner – who were all involved in the previous study – have now explored why intestinal cells in adult mice can survive without Dnmt1. First, the experiments showed that the mutant mice recovered their normal levels DNA methylation within two months of the gene deletion. Further analysis uncovered that this recovery was due to the fact that Dnmt3b became activated in Dnmt1-lacking cells, and then re-methylated the DNA. Deleting the genes for both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b led to loss of DNA methylation and many of the adult mice died prematurely.</p><p>Previously, it was thought that Dnmt3b only acted to establish new DNA methylation patterns, but these latest findings suggest that this enzyme can act a ‘maintenance’ methyltransferase as well. Together the findings also reveal that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b cooperate to maintain methylation in the epithelial cells in the intestines of adult mice. Further work could next investigate if this is also the case for other tissues in the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12975.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12975.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>intestinal epithelium</kwd><kwd>dnmt1</kwd><kwd>dnmt3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-DK053839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaestner</surname><given-names>Klaus H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1 and the de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b cooperate to maintain DNA methylation and genomic stability in the adult intestinal epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation patterns are established by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (Dnmts), for which two categories have been defined based on in vitro assays. The ‘de novo<italic>’</italic> methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnm3b, establish novel patterns of DNA methylation, and prefer to bind unmethylated DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okano et al., 1998</xref>). The ‘maintenance’ methyltransferase, Dnmt1, has a high affinity for hemi-methylated DNA in vitro, and preserves DNA methylation in replicating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bestor, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leonhardt et al., 1992</xref>). Dnmts are crucial for embryonic development in mice, as mice null for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> or <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> arrest at mid-gestation, and <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> null mice die in the first few weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). Although DNA methylation is not necessary for murine embryonic stem (ES) cell growth, the differentiation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-hypomorphic and <italic>Dnmt3a; Dnmt3b</italic>-mutant ES cells is severely impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lei et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsumura et al., 2006</xref>). These results indicate an important role for DNA methylation and Dnmts in directing cell differentiation processes.</p><p>One of the primary consequences of hypomethylation is increased DNA damage and genomic instability. Global hypomethylation in mice results in chromosome duplications and invasive T-cell lymphomas at four months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaudet et al., 2003</xref>), and in mouse ES cells, loss of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> also causes global hypomethylation and increased mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). In the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line, ablation of the catalytically active DNMT1 results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis due to increased chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spada et al., 2007</xref>). In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, ablation of either <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson-Grusby et al., 2001</xref>) or <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dodge et al., 2005</xref>) causes gradual hypomethylation, deregulated gene expression, and cell death. Dnmt1 and DNA methylation are also required for viability in most proliferating somatic cell populations, including human skin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sen et al., 2010</xref>), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson-Grusby et al., 2001</xref>), and neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2001</xref>) and pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgia et al., 2013</xref>) progenitor cells.</p><p>Interestingly, Dnmt1 is not required for adult intestinal stem cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheaffer et al., 2014</xref>). The mature intestinal epithelium is a single cell layer lining the lumen of the intestine, structured into finger-like protrusions, designated ‘villi’, and invaginations into the underlying mesenchymal tissue, termed ‘crypts.’ Intestinal stem cells are located in the crypt and respond to multiple signaling pathways that control proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elliott and Kaestner, 2015</xref>). Stem cells give rise to rapidly dividing transit-amplifying cells, which move in ordered cohorts up the crypt-villus axis. As cells migrate out the crypt, they differentiate into one of several distinct cell lineages, a process that is largely dependent on levels of Notch signaling. Loss of Dnmt1 in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium causes hypomethylation of regulatory regions associated with several intestinal stem cell genes, resulting in inappropriate gene expression during differentiation, and expansion of the crypt zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheaffer et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, ablation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> during intestinal crypt development causes hypomethylation, DNA damage, and apoptosis of epithelial cells, resulting in increased perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elliott et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies did not investigate the requirement for Dnmt1 in maintaining global DNA methylation or preserving genomic stability in the mature intestine. Thus, the mechanism behind preservation of the <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-mutant adult intestinal epithelium, the only rapidly dividing somatic tissue known to survive without Dnmt1, is not known.</p><p>To determine the mechanism underlying <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mutant intestinal survival, we employed tissue-specific, inducible mouse models and analyzed the effects immediately after <italic>Dnmt1</italic> deletion in the adult intestinal epithelium. Ablation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> caused an acute phenotype characterized by weight loss, global DNA hypomethylation, genome instability, and apoptosis. Strikingly, animals returned to baseline DNA methylation levels within two months of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> deletion, indicating recovery by a de novo methyltransferase. We demonstrate that the de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b is upregulated following loss of Dnmt1, and essential for epithelial survival in the Dnmt1 mutant intestine. Our results implicate a role for DNA methylation, maintained by both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b, in protecting genomic stability in intestinal epithelial homeostasis. These data are the first to show that Dnmt3b can function in maintenance DNA methylation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Dnmt1</italic> ablation results causes weight loss, hypomethylation, and genomic instability</title><p>To determine the primary effects of Dnmt1 deletion in the adult intestinal epithelium, we employed an inducible, intestinal epithelial-specific gene ablation model.

Dnmt1 loss was confirmed on the protein level by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>), and the Dnmt1 mutant epithelium displayed a slight expansion of the proliferative crypt zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheaffer et al., 2014</xref>). However, Dnmt1 mutant epithelia also exhibited regions that lacked crypts and/or villi, juxtaposed with hyperplastic crypts that replaced damaged tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since Dnmt1 ablation results in increased double stranded breaks and apoptosis in the neonatal intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elliott and Kaestner, 2015</xref>), we investigated if the Dnmt1 deficient adult intestine also displayed altered genomic stability. As a general marker of chromosomal instability, we stained for γH2AX, which labels DNA double strand break foci, and is an indicator of the DNA damage response. We observed an increase in γH2AX foci in the crypts of Dnmt1 mutants compared to controls, which displayed minimal DNA double strand breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). We also performed TUNEL staining to identify apoptotic nuclei, and found that the Dnmt1 mutant intestine exhibited increased crypt cell apoptosis relative to the control intestinal epithelium, which did not contain any apoptotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>).</p><p>To determine global DNA methylation levels, we isolated mutant and control intestinal crypt epithelium by laser capture microdissection, and performed targeted bisulfite-sequencing of the repetitive <italic>LINE1</italic> loci. <italic>LINE1</italic> retrotransposons account for approximately 20% of the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Waterston et al., 2002</xref>), and are a representative of genome-wide DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lane et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>LINE1</italic> repeats were significantly demethylated in Dnmt1 mutant crypts, with methylation reduced to approximately 50% of controls at each CpG analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We also performed bisulfite sequencing of the <italic>H19</italic> imprinting control region to analyze maintenance methylation, and found that the region was slightly demethylated relative to controls, although this difference was only significant when comparing the methylation of the entire sequenced region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Overall, these results suggest a phenotype in which loss of Dnmt1 results in hypomethylation of LINE1 repeats and the H19 imprinting control region, increased DNA damage, and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dnmt1-deficient intestinal epithelium recovers within two months of tamoxifen treatment</title><p>Interestingly, <italic>Dnmt1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;Villin-CreERT2</italic> mutant mice survive at rates comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that Dnmt1 is not required for continued intestinal maintenance in the adult mouse.

We performed immunohistochemistry for Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b to confirm loss of both proteins in the majority of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>). Differentiation in the double mutant intestine was largely unaffected, and exhibited normal distribution of goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enterocytes (data not shown). Unlike the situation in Dnmt1 mutants, many crypts in double Dnmt1;Dnmt3b mutants were completely Ki67-negative, and harbored extensive DNA damage as indicated by γH2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). TUNEL staining revealed increased crypt cell apoptosis in <italic>Dnmt1;Dnmt3b</italic> mutants compared to sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). Overall, the <italic>Dnmt1;Dnmt3b</italic> double mutants displayed increased phenotypic severity compared to <italic>Dnmt1</italic> single mutants, characterized by hypomethylation, DNA damage, and cell death.</p><p>To confirm that <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> ablation alone does not replicate the <italic>Dnmt1;Dnmt3b</italic> double mutant phenotype, we also analyzed the intestine of <italic>Dnmt1<sup>loxP/+</sup>;Dnmt3b<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;Villin-CreERT2 (Dnmt3b</italic> mutant) mice.

Loss of Dnmt3b had no affect on intestinal crypt-villus architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), and immunostaining for cell proliferation, DNA damage, and apoptosis was similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>).

These results demonstrate that Dnmt3b alone is not required for intestinal homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>DNA methylation has been linked to genomic instability in multiple contexts, in both cell lines and in disease. <italic>Dnmt1</italic> hypomorphic mice exhibit increased chromosomal duplications and rearrangements, and develop invasive T-cell lymphomas at approximately four months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaudet et al., 2003</xref>). It is important to note that these effects are not restricted to Dnmt1 deficiency. Loss of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> also induces hypomethylation and chromosomal instability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dodge et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b are crucial for maintaining DNA methylation and preserving genome integrity.</p><p>In some cases, de novo methyltransferases are essential for methylation of certain elements or enhancers, and cannot be compensated for by Dnmt1. For example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) require Dnmt3a for normal self-renewal and differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Challen et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of Dnmt3a in HSCs causes demethylation at essential stem cell genes, inducing hyper-proliferation and reducing differentiation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Challen et al., 2012</xref>). Dnmt3b also contributes to silencing of germline genes in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Velasco et al., 2010</xref>), and maintenance methylation in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2002</xref>). Our work adds to this body of evidence that implicates a crucial role for DNA methylation in maintaining genome stability. Given that methylation of LINE elements is significantly reduced, it is tempting to speculate that reactivation of retrotransposition might be a contributing factor to genome instability.</p><p>Aberrant DNA methylation and genome instability correlate in a number of gastrointestinal pathologies, including inflammatory bowl disease (IBD) and colitis-associated cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartnett and Egan, 2012</xref>). The phenotype presented in our <italic>Dnmt1;Dnmt3b</italic> double mutant mice is reminiscent of mouse models of IBD, in which altered epithelial barrier function leads to increased immune cell recruitment and chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wirtz and Neurath, 2007</xref>). Indeed, a recent study in zebrafish demonstrated that loss of DNA methylation at the tumor necrosis factor alpha (<italic>tnf-a</italic>) promoter prompted increased <italic>tnf-a</italic> expression in the gut epithelium, leading to elevated apoptosis, barrier dysfunction, and immune cell localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marjoram et al., 2015</xref>). In a chemically induced mouse model of IBD, inhibition of DNA methylation aggravated the inflammatory response, suggesting DNA methylation acts to protect against inflammation and IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kominsky et al., 2011</xref>). Our data support the hypothesis that DNA methylation supports intestinal epithelial homeostasis and helps to maintain crypt architecture.</p><p>Current dogma holds that deletion of Dnmt1 is lethal in all dividing somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2015</xref>); conversely, we find that the rapidly dividing intestinal epithelium can survive without Dnmt1. Following acute loss of <italic>Dnmt1, Dnmt3b</italic> expression is induced, and methylation of repetitive elements is restored. However, if <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> is ablated concurrently with <italic>Dnmt1,</italic> restoration of DNA methylation is prevented, resulting in massive DNA damage, and cell death. It is important to note that our data does not provide direct evidence for methyltransferase activity of Dnmt3b at hemimethylated CpG sites, which are targeted by Dnmt1. Indeed, it is also possible that Dnmt3b is compensating for the loss of Dnmt1 via repeated cycles of de novo methylation, in which Dnmt3b remethylates regions that are demethylated following Dnmt1 deletion after each cycle of DNA replication.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that Dnmt3a cannot compensate adequately for the loss of both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b, nor is Dnmt3a required in the absence of Dnmt1. Indeed, we see that the pressure to maintain Dnmt1 and/or Dnmt3b expression is so high that Dnmt3b<sup>+</sup> escaper cells proliferate in excess to recover the intestinal epithelium in a small subset of mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the basal levels of Dnmt3a mRNA in the control intestinal epithelium are much higher than those of Dnmt3b or Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), Dnmt3a does not appear to be necessary to maintain intestinal homeostasis or DNA methylation patterns. This may be due to a number of factors, such as differing abilities of the methyltransferases to interact with cofactors and epigenetic complexes. Both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b interact with the polycomb group repression complexes (PRC1 and PRC2), and regulate distinct sites in colorectal cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, different methyltransferases are required in distinct ways in certain tissue and cell types. For example, in the hematopoietic system, loss of Dnmt3a leads to elevated proliferation rates and cancer development, while loss of Dnmt3b has little to no effect on hematopoietic stem cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Challen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b cooperate to maintain methylation in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium. Loss of Dnmt1 results in short-term hypomethylation, genomic instability, and apoptosis, followed by recovery over time. Dnmt3b is upregulated in response to deletion of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in the adult intestine, and is required to recover DNA methylation and epithelial integrity. These results provide the first example of a rapidly dividing somatic tissue that can survive in the absence of Dnmt1, and suggest that the strict division of the Dnmt enzymes into ‘de novo’ and ‘maintenance’ methyltransferases might not fully represent the situation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice were provided by Rudolf Jaenisch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson-Grusby et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Dnmt3a<sup>loxP/loxP </sup></italic>mice were provided by En Li (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaneda et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>Villin-CreERT2</italic> mice were received from Sylvie Robine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Marjou et al., 2004</xref>).

Your manuscript has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Eliott et al., the authors report their analysis on the important cooperation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Their experiments led to the demonstration of the dramatic rescue, by <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, of the phenotypes, hypomethylation and genomic instability caused by the loss of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> in the intestinal epithelium. In general, this is a very interesting and well-written manuscript. The results are clearly presented and provide important new information to this particular field. All experiments shown here support the conclusion drawn by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;The 'de novo' DNA methyltransferase <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> compensates the <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-deficient intestinal epithelium&quot;, Elliott et al. examine the role of DNA methylation in mammalian epithelial homeostasis by investigating the effect of <italic>Dnmt1, Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> knockout in murine intestine. Using appropriate genetic methods, they proved that <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, but not <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, can replace or at least compensate for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> to keep the integrity of the gut epithelia. Thus, this manuscript presents solid genetic evidence that these enzymes are functionally redundant in the gut epithelium. Considering the popular dogmatic view that Dnmt enzymes can be divided into two classes: 'de novo' and 'maintenance' methyltransferases, this novel finding is very important and I therefore recommend its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There are few additional points that the authors may discuss further:</p><p>1) It seems appropriate to specify the region where the authors have observed global hypomethylation at the end of the subsection “<italic>Dnmt1</italic> ablation results causes weight loss, hypomethylation, and genomic instability “by adding 'in LINE1 repeats and H19 imprinting region'.</p><p>2) <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> are closely related methyltransferases both in sequence homology and domain architecture. It is therefore very interesting that <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> couldn't compensate the loss of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> even though the basal level of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> is higher than that of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>. The authors may discuss this interesting point in the Discussion.</p><p>3) <italic>Dnmt1;Dnmt3b</italic> compound mutants showed severe phenotype and more than 50% lethality. However, after two weeks, the phenotype of these animals stabilized with regards to both survival rate and weight loss. Does this mean that there are additional methyltransferases that can further compensate for the loss of the two enzymes? Do the authors have any idea which methyltranserases could be involved in this compensatory mechanism?

Using appropriate genetic methods, they proved that Dnmt3b, but not Dnmt3a, can replace or at least compensate for Dnmt1 to keep the integrity of the gut epithelia. Thus, this manuscript presents solid genetic evidence that these enzymes are functionally redundant in the gut epithelium. Considering the popular dogmatic view that Dnmt enzymes can be divided into two classes: 'de novo' and 'maintenance' methyltransferases, this novel finding is very important and I therefore recommend its publication in eLife. There are few additional points that the authors may discuss further: 1) It seems appropriate to specify the region where the authors have observed global hypomethylation at the end of the subsection “Dnmt1 ablation results causes weight loss, hypomethylation, and genomic instability “by adding 'in LINE1 repeats and H19 imprinting region'.</italic></p><p>We altered the text, to read “Overall, these results suggest a phenotype in which loss of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> results in hypomethylation of LINE1 repeats and the H19 imprinting control region, increased DNA damage, and apoptosis.”</p><p> <italic>2) Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are closely related methyltransferases both in sequence homology and domain architecture. It is therefore very interesting that Dnmt3a couldn't compensate the loss of Dnmt1 even though the basal level of Dnmt3a is higher than that of Dnmt3b. The authors may discuss this interesting point in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We added a new paragraph to the Discussion to review the different functions of de novo methyltransferases, and to examine why <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cannot compensate for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> loss.</p><p><italic>3) Dnmt1;Dnmt3b compound mutants showed severe phenotype and more than 50% lethality. However, after two weeks, the phenotype of these animals stabilized with regards to both survival rate and weight loss. Does this mean that there are additional methyltransferases that can further compensate for the loss of the two enzymes? Do the authors have any idea which methyltranserases could be involved in this compensatory mechanism? Can the authors perform for example qPCR analysis to further investigate this?</italic></p><p>Reviewer #2was concerned about <italic>Dnmt1;Dnmt3b</italic> double mutants that were able to survive, and wanted us to provide evidence of a compensatory mechanism. Thank you for this comment, as we believe answering this question in more detail adds to the quality of our manuscript. As mentioned in the text, we believe that <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-positive cells, which escape Cre-loxP recombination, proliferate and repopulate the intestinal epithelium. We have provided a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows an example of a <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-positive escaper crypt in the double mutant small intestine. We show that this escaper crypt does not display the DNA damage phenotype present in mutant crypts by co-staining for <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> and γH2AX. γH2AX is only present in the mutant crypts, and is not present in the <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>-positive escaper crypts.</p><p> <italic>4) The number of goblet cells seems to be altered in the Dnmt1;Dnmt3b compound mutant intestine. It is recommended to provide higher magnification images of H&amp;E and staining for markers of goblet cells (Alcian blue), Paneth cells (Lysozyme), enteroendocrine cell (Chromogranin) and intestinal stem cells (Olfm4/Lgr5).

He suggested staining for goblet cells, Paneth cells, enterocytes, and Olfm4 and Lgr5 to mark intestinal stem cells. This amount of staining, in multiple biological replicates, would take several months to complete, and would probably not yield data to further the main point of our manuscript. Furthermore, Olfm4 and Lgr5 would require sensitive in situ hybridization, because antibodies are not readily available. We have preliminary evidence to suggest that differentiation (goblet cells, Paneth cells, enterocytes) is largely unaffected in these double mutants, which we have indicated in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
