We found a slowly-inactivating MS current in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and characterized it throughout their differentiation into motor-neurons to investigate its components. MS currents were large and slowly-inactivating in the stem-cell stage, and became smaller and faster-inactivating throughout the differentiation. We found that Piezo1 is expressed in mES cells, and its knockout abolishes MS currents, indicating that the slowly-inactivating current in mES cells is carried by Piezo1. To further investigate its slow inactivation in these cells, we cloned Piezo1 cDNA from mES cells and found that it displays fast-inactivation kinetics in heterologous expression, indicating that sources of modulation other than the aminoacid sequence determine its slow kinetics in mES cells. Finally, we report that Piezo1 knockout ES cells showed a reduced rate of proliferation but no significant differences in other markers of pluripotency and differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piezo1</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>inactivation kinetics</kwd><kwd>mechanosensitive ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>del Mármol</surname><given-names>Josefina Inés</given-names></name><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Piezo1 exhibits markedly different kinetic behavior in different cellular contexts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of mechanosensation stands as one of the most exciting challenges in sensory biology. The complexity of the physiological stimuli involved (e.g. osmotic changes, shear stress, cell contact) and the broad timescales in which they operate suggest the existence of equally complex underlying transduction machineries. The recent identification of a structurally unique family of mechanosensory ion channels, the Piezos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>), and the plethora of mechanosensory processes to which they have since been associated, certainly re-kindled the enthusiasm. Piezos are present in most eukaryotes (with the notable exception of yeasts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xiao and Xu, 2010</xref>) where they mediate light-touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>), vascular endothelial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2014</xref>), and respiratory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nonomura et al., 2017</xref>), to name just a few. Though modest variations have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Woo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ikeda et al., 2014</xref>), in their canonical forms, they inactivate quickly following stimulation with a time constant less than 20 ms and in a voltage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>). In mammals, loss of function by knockout of either member of the Piezo family is either unviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2014a</xref>), or severely debilitating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chesler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delle Vedove et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haliloglu et al., 2017</xref>) but gain of function mutations can also result in severe defects: mutations in the human <italic>PIEZO1</italic> gene that cause slow inactivation have recently been associated with hereditary xerocytosis, a disorder of ionic imbalance in red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). These discoveries highlight the importance of a tight regulation in expression and kinetics of mechanosensory ion channels.</p><p>Notably, multiple cell lines exhibit a variety of undescribed stretch-activated currents that differ from Piezos in their kinetics. For example, dorsal root ganglia cells display three types of mechanosensory ionic currents when directly stimulated with a probe: rapid-, intermediate-, and slow-inactivating currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). Piezo2 only accounts for the rapid-inactivating responses, with slow- and non-inactivating conductances still uncharacterized. Other cultured cell lines like C2C12 also express a form of slow-inactivating mechanosensory current, also not yet characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). Understanding the components of slow-inactivating mechanosensory responses would not only help complete the landscape of mechanosensory ion channels and molecules, but also provide insight into the cellular fine-tuning of responses to diverse stimuli.</p><p>We found a large mechanosensitive current in mouse embryonic stem cells with distinctively slow-inactivating kinetics that resembles currents present in C2C12 cells and slow-inactivating DRGs. In addition to a self-standing interest in identifying slow-inactivating mechanosensory components, we found its presence in stem cells particularly interesting. Although not part of a mechanosensory organ, stem cells are extremely alert to environmental cues. Multiple reports show that the cellular fate of multipotent stem cells can be influenced by mechanical strain, shear stress, substrate stiffness or elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumenthal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ivanovska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>). Given the magnitude of these effects, increasing efforts are now focused on elucidating the molecular details of the transduction process.</p><p>We describe in this manuscript a large mechanosensitive, slowly-inactivating current in mouse embryonic stem cells. We investigated the evolution of this stem cell mechanosensory current along a model differentiation pathway into motor neurons, and found it to be carried by Piezo1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse embryonic stem cells exhibit a slowly-inactivating mechanosensitive current</title><p>We screened multiple cell lines searching for slow inactivating mechanosensitive (MS) currents using the ‘poking’ assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). In this assay individual cells can be mechanically stimulated with a round-end probe controlled by a piezo-actuator, while a second probe located at a distant part of the cell performs patch-clamp recordings. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells) exhibited robust, slow inactivating MS currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Currents ranged from 0 to over 2100 pA over baseline, with an average value of 465 ± 112 pA (n = 30). MS currents could not be reliably fit to mono- or bi- exponential functions due to the large variability of the initial decay step. In order to quantify the inactivation behavior we used as a metric the slow inactivating component (slow fraction), defined as the relative fraction of peak current at the beginning of the stimulus that still remained 75 ms into the poking step. For a canonical fast-inactivating channel such as Piezo1 the slow fraction is typically less than 0.2. In mES cells the slow fraction of MS current had an average value 0.67 ± 0.04 (n = 30) and in some cells it approached 1.0.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33149.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mechanosensitive currents in mouse embryonic stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ionic currents recorded from mouse embryonic stem cells in response to mechanical stimulation.

(<bold>B</bold>) Mechanosensitive currents were recorded at different voltages under diverse bi-ionic conditions (inset) to establish ion selectivity. Briefly, the current’s reversal potential (E<sub>rev</sub>) will shift towards that of its permeant ion for each particular condition. The internal solution always contains KCl. The purple trace corresponds to NaGluconate in the bath, to analyze chloride permeation. If chloride were to permeate the pore, the E<sub>rev</sub> should move towards that of chloride, infinitely positive in these conditions. The fact that the E<sub>rev</sub> did not move in that direction at all indicates that chloride does not permeate the pore (the slight shift to negative values can be accounted for by the difference in motility of gluconate, a much slower ion than chloride). The pink curve is done using NaCl in the bath solution. The E<sub>rev</sub> sits at 4 mV, roughly in between the E<sub>rev</sub> for potassium and sodium in these conditions, indicating that both ions are equally likely to travel through the pore. The blue curve is in the presence of NMDG in the bath. The E<sub>rev</sub> moves towards that of potassium, indicating very low permeability for NMDG. Finally, the green curve taken with calcium as the only cation in the bath shifts the E<sub>rev</sub> to +15 mV, closer to the E<sub>rev</sub> of calcium than to that of potassium in these conditions, indicating a slightly higher permeability for calcium than for potassium. The observed permeability sequence is then: P<sub>Ca</sub> &gt; P<sub>K</sub> = <sub>PNa</sub>&gt; P<sub>NMDG</sub>. Raw traces are shown with no voltage corrections. Liquid junction potentials are not corrected, they were estimated as: 4.3 mV for NaCl/KCl, 8.2 mV for CaCl<sub>2</sub>/KCl, −6.7 mV for NaGluconate/KCl, and 9.3 mV for NMDG-Cl/KCl.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33149-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>A detailed study of the MS currents in mES cells revealed that they are selective for cations with a permeability sequence as defined by the reversal potential under bi-ionic conditions: P<sub>Ca</sub> &gt; P<sub>K</sub> = P<sub>Na</sub>&gt; P<sub>NMDG</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hille, 1992</xref>, pg 19).

To initiate the differentiation, growth factors are removed from the media to which mouse embryonic stem cells are exposed, which terminates their pluripotent stage and sends them to a state of responsiveness to patterning signals. Retinoic acid (RA) is then applied, which induces differentiation into spinal nerve cells. Further addition of Smoothened agonist (SAG) at day three controls ventralization of nascent spinal neurons. Finally, addition of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) turns on a host of motor neuron-specific genes. To monitor the differentiation we used Hb9-GFP stem cells, in which the motor neuron specific promoter Hb9 drives GFP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>). We achieved approximately 30% efficiency as assessed by GFP expression and morphological and functional characterization.

Around day five voltage-dependent potassium currents became larger and some cells began to exhibit small voltage-dependent sodium currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This, along with low GFP expression, indicated the presence of immature motor neurons. By day 7, GFP expression increased and GFP-positive cells acquired a typical neuronal profile of large voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> currents and were able to fire action potentials.

When ‘naïve’ mESC cultures were converted to the next developmental stage, ‘primed,’ epiblast-like stem cells (EpiSC), no change in marker expression or colony organization was observed between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D</xref>). Gastrulation was triggered by presentation of the in vivo cue BMP4, and differentiation to multiple germ lineages (SOX2, ectoderm; Brachyury, mesoderm) was not significantly different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Finally, we asked if Piezo1 affected mESC response to substrate stiffness. Wild type mESC showed a lower rate of spontaneous differentiation under pluripotency conditions when cultured on a soft (28 kPa, PDMS) substrate compared to standard tissue culture plastic (100,000 kPa) following previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2010</xref>). Piezo1 knockout clones showed the same relationship, indicating no effect of Piezo1 in mediating this response to substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We conclude that while Piezo1 is expressed during pluripotency and mediates normal proliferation rate, it does not grossly affect the pluripotency per se, early germ layer differentiation, or response to substrate stiffness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An initial observation of this study is that mES cells have large MS currents. These currents exhibit single channel conductance and cation selectivity similar to Piezo1 channels recorded in other cells under similar ionic conditions, and depend on the <italic>Piezo1</italic> gene. The identity of this MS current is therefore unequivocally assigned to Piezo1. Less clear is why embryonic stem cells would express high levels of a mechanosensitive ion channel. Until recently, growth factors were the most recognized factor influencing stem cells homeostasis and differentiation. However, recent reports have begun to show that mechanical cues are also able to sharply affect stem cell fate. For example, mechanical properties of the growth substrate can modulate the lineage choice of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>). Other multipotent stem cells, like mesenchymal stem cells, have long been known to be influenced by matrix elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engler et al., 2006</xref>). Although the action pathway of these variables is not fully understood, the presence of mechanosensitive ion channels such as Piezo1 suggests a role for MS channels as potential transduction molecules in stem cells.</p><p>Another derivation of this study is that Piezo1 forms a slowly-inactivating MS current in mES cells. Having excluded the possibility of an intrinsically slow inactivating channel by virtue of its amino acid sequence, we are left to assume that Piezo1 is somehow regulated to have slow inactivating kinetics. Regulation of its kinetics can arise from either additional components (e.g. beta subunits) or from mechanical properties of the particular cellular environment, or a combination of both. It is interesting to note that the mRNA expression of <italic>Piezo1</italic> throughout the differentiation of mES cells into motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) correlates with the fast component of the MS current. The total MS current observed follows a slightly different evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In light of the results of this work, it is foreseeable that there could exist additional components that shape the Piezo1 currents throughout the differentiation to modify their amplitude and kinetics into their final observed form. In summary, these results point to a modification of the Piezo1 protein or the environment in which it functions, which alters the Piezo1 gating properties. These results advance our understanding in two respects. First, they point to a role for Piezo1 in stem cell function, and second, they suggest that an additional regulatory mechanisms that shape the gating properties of Piezo1.</p><p>We still know very little about modulation of Piezo1 behavior. In a recent work, Bae et al showed that the kinetics of human PIEZO1 can be regulated by pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, Sack’s group observed that in certain conditions a fast inactivating Piezo1 channel can be ‘converted’ into a slow one by repeated stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>). They postulate that Piezos could be located in confined arrays (‘corrals’) that can be disrupted through strenuous stimulations, and that the gating mechanism is somehow linked to these spatial arrays. Protein modulators of Piezo1 have also been found: Stoml3, the mammalian counterpart of MEC-2, is required for mechanosensation in ~40% of myelinated mechanosensory fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). This protein is reported to tune up the threshold of sensitivity of Piezo2 currents in DRGs, such that its absence increases the threshold of activation of Piezo2 by an order of magnitude. The effect on Piezo2 is not specific: Piezo1 currents can too be increased and their thresholds lowered by expression of Stoml3. These results were reproduced by heterologous expression of Stoml3 with either Piezo1 or Piezo2 in HEK293 cells. Additionally, Stoml3 protein co-precipitates with Piezo1 or Piezo2 after heterologous expression in HEK293 cells, indicating some degree of association. Polycystin-2 (PC2) is another proposed modulator of Piezo1 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Peyronnet et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of this protein reduced endogenous Piezo1 currents in proximal convoluted tubule cells and in overexpression experiments in COS cells. PC2 also co-precipitates with Piezo1 when overexpressed in COS cells.</p><p>Lastly, it is likely that other unknown mechanosensory ion channels exist. The Patapoutian group reported that only the fast-inactivating component of the mechanosensory currents in DRG neurons can be attributable to Piezo2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). Piezo1 is not supposedly expressed in those cells, so we are left to assume that there is still at least one novel source of slow- and/or intermediate- inactivating mechanosensitive currents present in DRGs. A most fascinating challenge in the field will be to identify the source of that current and unveil the mechanisms behind its behavior and function.</p><p>Overall Piezo1 KO ES cell lines showed minimal changes in pluripotency or differentiation in vitro compared to wild type lines. This finding fits with the normal early development reported for Piezo1 KO mice. However, outside of the lethal ~e14 vascularization defect reported for these mice, little specific or functional phenotyping was done, leaving open the possibility of subtle functional defects occurring early in development, which may be compensated by homeostatic developmental mechanisms. Based on functional channel expression during pluripotency and early differentiation, we originally hypothesized that Piezo1-mediated mechanoreception in epiblast cells would affect early development. This hypothesis was based on the crucial but poorly defined role for mechanical forces in the tissue morphogenesis, which establishes and defines gastrulation, as well as in vitro studies using mouse and human ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Przybyla et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings failed to directly support this hypothesis, but they do not exclude a role for Piezo1 mediated mechanotransduction in peri-gastrulation development. This is partly due to the limitations of established and informative in vitro stem cell models of gastrulation, especially the lack of stereotypical in vivo egg cylinder architecture, which suggests a role for mechanical feedback in the first place. It is therefore possible that as more sophisticated, reproducible and in vivo-like in vitro models are developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morgani et al., 2018</xref>, e.g.) a role for Piezo1 at this stage may yet be uncovered in vitro, but further in vivo or ex vivo approaches will likely be more relevant at present. The proliferation activity we identified could well play a role in normal gastrulation, by regulating the size of the epiblast, therefore influencing the functional geometry of the egg cylinder and ectoplacental cone, which triggers and organizes gastrulation. If so, the viability of Piezo1 KO mice argues that this activity must be almost fully compensated for by an unknown homeostatic mechanism, which could be identified in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>HEK293 tsA201 cells were obtained from Sigma and maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco) and 1% L- Glutamine (Gibco).

Sequences were then ran through the Cufflinks package which assembles transcripts and estimates their abundances to obtain, for each sample, a list of transcripts with their associated transcript counts. Transcript counts are obtained as FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). Finally, Cufflinks (CuffDiff) was used to calculate differential expression of transcripts between samples.</p><p>High-throughput data is publicly available at the GEO database, for public access (accession number GSE106526).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Crispr-CAS9 knockout of Piezo1</title><p>px459 (Addgene) was used to express Cas9 and guide RNA sequence along with a Puromycin resistance cassette according to published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). Two guide RNA sequences were cloned separately to obtain two independent knock-out colonies. Sequences were ACGCTTCAATGCTCTCTCGC and AGAGAGCATTGAAGCGTAAC, both located in the beginning of the second exon of the mouse <italic>Piezo1</italic> gene. hB9-GFP mES cells were then transfected with the px459 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with 1 µg/ml Puromycin for 2 day. After 1 day of recovery in Puromycin-free medium, transfected cells were dissociated and sparsely re-plated into 10 cm dishes. Single colonies were isolated after 7 days, expanded, and DNA was extracted using QuickExtract DNA Extraction solution (Epicentre). A 500 bp region containing the Cas9 target was amplified by PCR using the following primers: CGTGTGCATCCACGTATGA and AGGTGTGCACTGAAGGAACC. Obtained fragment was then sequenced. Sequencing results showed that some colonies contained a mix of 2 sequences, indicating differential mutations in both alleles of the <italic>Piezo1</italic> gene. However, four colonies showed a clear single sequence, indicating a homozygous mutation near the PAM sequence. Two of those colonies were selected for electrophysiological studies. A third colony was added to the studies for figure 7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cloning of Piezo1 cDNA from mouse embryonic stem cells</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from mES cells using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and cDNA was made using Quantitect Reverse Kit (QIAGEN).

PCRs were done using Phusion HF (NEB) or Pfu Ultra II (Agilent). For some difficult reactions 5% DMSO was added to the PCR reaction. The Piezo1 construct from N2A cells was obtained from the Patapoutian lab. For whole cell poking of both constructs transfected into HEK293 cells the following solutions were used (mM): 150KCl, 10Hepes, 10EGTA (pH 7.3 with NaOH, 310 mOsm/kg; intracellular) and 150NaCl, 3KCl, 2CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10Hepes, 10Glucose (pH 7.3 with NaOH, 310 mOsm/kg; extracellular).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ESC phenotyping and data analysis</title><p>ESC proliferation was measured by seeding in 250 ESC per well in 96 well plates coated with 5 ug/ml laminin5,2,1 (biolamina). Wells were stained with markers for all nuclei (Hoechst, NucBlue, Thermo) and dead cells (SytoxOrange, Thermo) and whole wells were imaged and quantified for live cells on days 0, 1, 3 and 6 using ImageExpress and Metamorph. ‘Naïve’ (Inner cell mass-like) ESC were maintained in ‘2i + LIF medium’ and transitioned to ‘primed’ (epiblast-like stem cells) EpiSC by incubation for 48 hr with mouse embryonic fibroblast conditioned medium with 20% ES cell grade FCS (CM) containing activin (from feeders) and added bFGF (20 ng/ml, Thermo) without LIF or 2i used for naïve culture, and germ layer differentiation was triggered by adding 50 ng/ml human recombinant BMP4 (R &amp; D) to CM and incubating for 48 hr.

editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Piezo1 forms a slowly-inactivating mechanosensory channel in mouse embryonic stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kenton J Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and well executed study showing that mouse embryonic stems cells express mechanosensitive ion channels that exhibit slowly desensitizing properties in response to poking with mechanically actuated probe. Measurements of whole-cell mechanosensitive currents with different cations in the extracellular solution suggest that the channels are relatively non-selective between cations, with a small preference for calcium over sodium or potassium. Single channel measurements with excised patches show similar kinetic properties when elicited with pressure-clamp and compared to whole-cell measurements obtained with the poking assay, and they show that the mechanosensitive channels have a single channel conductance of ~25 pS. When ES cells are differentiated into motor neurons the mechanosensitive currents become more rapidly desensitizing before they disappear, as voltage-gated conductances become larger. Interestingly, the authors show that expression of Piezo1 correlates with the amplitude of the mechanosensitive currents during differentiation, and KO of Piezo1 leads to loss of mechanosensitive currents. Finally, the authors clone Piezo1 from the ES cells and although they identify three residues differing from the previously cloned Piezo1 subunit, expression in mammalian cells gives rise to rapidly desensitizing currents that resemble those previously reported for the Piezo1 channel. The interesting take home message is that a regulatory mechanism must exist in ES cells that converts Piezo1 from rapidly desensitizing to slowly desensitizing. The manuscript was easy to read and comprehend and it makes a valuable contribution to the literature.</p><p>Although all three reviewers were enthusiastic about this study, the consensus was that the work would be more appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors could provide evidence for what function Piezo1 might have in mES cells or for the mechanism by which extrinsic factors might be shaping Piezo1 kinetics in different cellular environments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Piezo1 has known to be widely expressed, so the observation they are in mES is interesting, but perhaps not particularly surprising. More to the point, both Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels have already been shown to have different kinetics depending on the cell types where they are found. Piezo2-dependent currents in Merkel cells have a shoulder current not commonly observed in sensory neurons (Woo et al., 2014; Ikeda et al., 2014). Very recently, it was shown that Piezo2 mediates at least some of the slower adapting currents in duck sensory neurons (Schneider et al., 2017). Perhaps more to the point, the currents reported here look remarkably similar to those previously reported to be found in some types of HEK293 cells (Dubin et al., 2017).</p><p>2) While the authors discuss possible implications of Piezo1 function in mES cells (Discussion section), they do not attempt to test those hypotheses experimentally. This is puzzling given the authors took the time to create Piezo1 KO mES cells. There seems to be a missed opportunity to experimentally examine the role of mechanosensitive signaling in mES cells differentiation, outgrowth, survival etc. At a minimum, the authors could have tested their hypothesis about a role for Piezo1 in sensing substrate stiffness.</p><p>3) The authors do a nice job of showing that the mES mechanosensitive currents are mediated by Piezo1 (Figure 5D) and that the kinetics change over the course of experimental differentiation into motor neuron-like cells (Figure 3C). Furthermore, they provide evidence that channels cloned for mES display faster kinetics when heterologously expressed in HEK293 (Figure 6). These observations provide a strong foundation, but the work would have considerably more impact if the authors could provide more mechanistic information about how these two cellular environments alter the kinetics of desensitization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33149.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and well executed study showing that mouse embryonic stems cells express mechanosensitive ion channels that exhibit slowly desensitizing properties in response to poking with mechanically actuated probe.

When ES cells are differentiated into motor neurons the mechanosensitive currents become more rapidly desensitizing before they disappear, as voltage-gated conductances become larger. Interestingly, the authors show that expression of Piezo1 correlates with the amplitude of the mechanosensitive currents during differentiation, and KO of Piezo1 leads to loss of mechanosensitive currents. Finally, the authors clone Piezo1 from the ES cells and although they identify three residues differing from the previously cloned Piezo1 subunit, expression in mammalian cells gives rise to rapidly desensitizing currents that resemble those previously reported for the Piezo1 channel. The interesting take home message is that a regulatory mechanism must exist in ES cells that converts Piezo1 from rapidly desensitizing to slowly desensitizing. The manuscript was easy to read and comprehend and it makes a valuable contribution to the literature.</p><p>Although all three reviewers were enthusiastic about this study, the consensus was that the work would be more appropriate for eLife if the authors could provide evidence for what function Piezo1 might have in mES cells or for the mechanism by which extrinsic factors might be shaping Piezo1 kinetics in different cellular environments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviews for their helpful comments on our manuscript. We have addressed all of the points by either modifying the text, adding experiments, or commenting on the issue.</p><p>A major point brought up by the reviewers concerned the lack of a functional model that makes sense of the expression of Piezo1 in stem cells. To address this issue, we attempted several lines of experiments aimed to address what the potential role of Piezo1 in stem cells is. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a direct effect of Piezo1 expression in several quantitative and qualitative measures of stem cell differentiation. However, we did note a proliferation defect in Piezo1 knockout cells, indicating that expression of Piezo1 could be involved in setting the normal division rate of cells. We must point out that while our efforts tried to span a broad set of conditions, there is as of yet no clear model for the role of mechanosensory processes in early stem cells, and therefore it is possible that the role of Piezo1 could be involved in untested conditions.</p><p>Another major point concerned the lack of model explaining how the Piezo1 channel changes its kinetics in different cellular contexts. We believe that, although of major interest, it escapes the scope of our current work. Below we address the reviewer’s comments in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Piezo1 has known to be widely expressed, so the observation they are in mES is interesting, but perhaps not particularly surprising. More to the point, both Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels have already been shown to have different kinetics depending on the cell types where they are found. Piezo2-dependent currents in Merkel cells have a shoulder current not commonly observed in sensory neurons (Woo et al., 2014; Ikeda et al., 2014). Very recently it was shown that Piezo2 mediates at least some of the slower adapting currents in duck sensory neurons (Schneider et al., 2017). Perhaps more to the point, the currents reported here look remarkably similar to those previously reported to be found in some types of HEK293 cells (Dubin et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment, we have added the recommended references to broaden our cited sources. Conceptually, indeed, Piezo1 has been shown to be expressed in several cell types, and its kinetics have been shown to be modestly variable. For example, in Schneider et al. (2017), the authors report a shift in inactivation constant from 3.1 ± 0.17 ms in mouse Piezo2 to 5.1 ± 0.47 ms in duck Piezo2. The other reports do not measure inactivation constants but from the figures they appear to be in the same range. Though these reports obviously bear great significance, to our knowledge, no paper has reported such dramatically slowed kinetics – turning the channel at times into a non-inactivating channel – for Piezo1 as we can unequivocally attribute exclusively to Piezo1 in stem cells. In addition, we believe that the discovery of a specific developmental program that drastically modifies the desensitizing behavior of Piezo suggests the relevance of the regulation of Piezo kinetics as an unexplored novel regulatory mechanism. Finally, although the Piezo1 gene has been shown to be widely expressed, as the reviewer rightly points out, the level of current that we found in mES cells is many times greater in magnitude larger than those observed in other non-sensory types such as HEK293 cells. This is interesting, given that mouse embryonic stem cells are the most ‘stem’ state of mammalian cells, that can give rise to any other cell type and whose development program is still widely undescribed. The potential effect of mechanosensory components in the development of embryos is as of yet understudied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the authors discuss possible implications of Piezo1 function in mES cells (Discussion section), they do not attempt to test those hypotheses experimentally. This is puzzling given the authors took the time to create Piezo1 KO mES cells. There seems to be a missed opportunity to experimentally examine the role of mechanosensitive signaling in mES cells differentiation, outgrowth, survival etc. At a minimum, the authors could have tested their hypothesis about a role for Piezo1 in sensing substrate stiffness.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the encouragement to pursue these experiments, and in response have done extensive additional research. The new data has been added as Figure 7 and Table 1, and the resulting conclusions are now incorporated in the relevant sections. As a summary, we compared Piezo1 knockout to wild type mES cells at pluripotency and during early differentiation. Using both qualitative and quantitative measures we found a proliferation defect in the Piezo1 knock out mES cells, but no difference between both phenotypes in any other parameter. We can attribute the proliferation defect to cell cycle interphase lengthening, but we were not able to link it to any mechanosensory process. As suggested by the reviewer, our experiments also included testing mES response to differential substrate stiffness, however Piezo1 genotype did not affect this response to the tested substrates. While we were unable to find a specific role for Piezo1 in mES cells, it is also unclear what the overall role of mechanosensory processes in stem cell differentiation is, and therefore it is possible that we have not tested the appropriate parameters, as it is unknown which assay would be the appropriate one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors do a nice job of showing that the mES mechanosensitive currents are mediated by Piezo1 (Figure 5D) and that the kinetics change over the course of experimental differentiation into motor neuron-like cells (Figure 3C). Furthermore, they provide evidence that channels cloned for mES display faster kinetics when heterologously expressed in HEK293 (Figure 6). These observations provide a strong foundation, but the work would have considerably more impact if the authors could provide more mechanistic information about how these two cellular environments alter the kinetics of desensitization.</p></disp-quote><p>We kindly thank the reviewers for their overall positive comments. We agree with the observation that a more impactful result would derive from studying the contribution of cellular environment to channel function, however, we think that the initial observation and careful testing reported in this work stands on its own to contribute to the increasingly complex field of mechanosensory ion channels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
