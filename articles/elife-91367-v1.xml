activation linked to sex differences in gene expression and liver disease susceptibility, but little is understood about the fundamental underlying, GH pattern-dependent regulatory mechanisms. Here, DNase-I hypersensitivity site (DHS) analysis of liver chromatin accessibility in a cohort of 18 individual male mice established that the endogenous male rhythm of plasma GH pulse-stimulated liver STAT5 activation induces dynamic, repeated cycles of chromatin opening and closing at several thousand liver DHS and comprises a novel mechanism conferring male bias to liver chromatin accessibility. Strikingly, a single physiological replacement dose of GH given to hypophysectomized male mice restored, within 30 min, liver STAT5 activity and chromatin accessibility at 83% of the dynamic, pituitary hormone-dependent male-biased DHS. Sex-dependent transcription factor binding patterns and chromatin state analysis identified key genomic and epigenetic features distinguishing this dynamic, STAT5-driven mechanism of male-biased chromatin opening from a second GH-dependent mechanism operative at static male-biased DHS, which are constitutively open in male liver. Dynamic but not static male-biased DHS adopt a bivalent-like epigenetic state in female liver, as do static female-biased DHS in male liver, albeit using distinct repressive histone marks in each sex, namely, H3K9me3 at male-biased DHS in female liver and H3K27me3 at female-biased DHS in male liver. Moreover, sex-biased H3K36me3 marks are uniquely enriched at static sex-biased DHS, which may serve to keep these sex-dependent hepatocyte enhancers free of H3K27me3 repressive marks and thus constitutively open. Pulsatile chromatin opening stimulated by endogenous, physiological hormone pulses is thus one of two distinct GH-determined mechanisms for establishing widespread sex differences in hepatic chromatin accessibility and epigenetic regulation, both closely linked to sex-biased gene transcription and the sexual dimorphism of liver function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNase-I hypersensitive sites</kwd><kwd>growth hormone-regulated histone marks</kwd><kwd>sex-dependent hepatocyte identity</kwd><kwd>STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>sex differences in liver disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIDDK R01DK121998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waxman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pulsatile chromatin opening stimulated by naturally-occurring plasma growth hormone pulses is one of two GH-determined mechanisms that establish widespread sex differences in hepatic chromatin accessibility and epigenetic regulation, both closely linked to sex differences in liver gene transcription and function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth hormone (GH) regulates hepatic expression of enzymes and transporters that play critical roles in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vázquez-Borrego et al., 2021</xref>) and in the detoxification of many drugs and other lipophilic foreign chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waxman and Holloway, 2009</xref>). Dysregulation of hepatic GH signaling can lead to liver metabolic disorders, including the development of fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, with males more susceptible than females, as seen in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dichtel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaltenecker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oxley et al., 2023</xref>). Correspondingly, GH regulates many liver-expressed genes in a sex-dependent manner, enabling each sex to meet its specific metabolic and hormonal requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wauthier et al., 2010</xref>). This program of sex-dependent gene expression is controlled by the sex-dependent temporal patterns of pituitary GH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farhy et al., 2007</xref>), which emerge at puberty but are programmed earlier in life by neonatal exposure to androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramirez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waxman et al., 1985</xref>). Pituitary GH secretion and, consequently, plasma GH profiles are intermittent (pulsatile) in pubertal and adult males, whereas they are near-continuous (persistent) in pubertal and adult females, as seen in rats, mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waxman and O’Connor, 2006</xref>). These plasma GH profiles, in turn, regulate sex-specific gene transcription in the liver through both positive regulatory mechanisms (class I sex-biased genes) and negative regulatory mechanisms (class II sex-biased genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wauthier et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The sex-dependent hepatic actions of GH require the transcription factor STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clodfelter et al., 2006</xref>), which is activated by phosphorylation on a single tyrosine residue catalyzed by the GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waters, 2016</xref>). Each successive male plasma GH pulse induces a cycle of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation, followed by tyrosine dephosphorylation and recycling of STAT5 back to the cytosol in time to reset the overall signaling pathway for the next plasma GH pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waxman and Holloway, 2009</xref>). In male mouse liver, GH pulse-activated STAT5 binds to the DNA motif TTCNNNGAA at genomic sites strongly enriched for proximity to male-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), but the mechanistic relationship between STAT5 binding and sex differences in chromatin accessibility and epigenetic marks is unknown. In female liver, persistent activation of STAT5 by the near-continuous presence of circulating GH is associated with a significant enrichment of STAT5 binding nearby female-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); however, the underlying mechanisms, including chromatin features that distinguish these STAT5 binding sites from male-biased STAT5 binding sites, are poorly understood.</p><p>Liver STAT5 is activated by male plasma GH pulses within minutes, enabling STAT5 to rapidly induce the transcription of several male-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connerney et al., 2017</xref>); however, a majority of male-biased genes respond slowly to the feminization of GH secretory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau-Corona et al., 2017</xref>), which likely reflects the time required for secondary changes, including changes in histone modifications and the underlying chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>). Thus, continuous infusion of GH in male mice overrides the endogenous plasma GH pulses and substantially feminizes liver gene expression over a period of days, with female-biased genes already in an active chromatin state in male liver often responding earlier than genes in an inactive chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau-Corona et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in chromatin accessibility occur at genomic regions identified as DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHS), a hallmark of epigenetic regulation. These DHS can be discovered by DNase-seq, which has identified ~70,000 DHS in male and female mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2010</xref>), including thousands of enhancers, promoters, and insulator regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matthews and Waxman, 2018</xref>). More than 4000 of the 70,000 liver DHS show sex differences in chromatin accessibility, as well as sex-biased binding of STAT5 and other GH-regulated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2010</xref>). These transcription factors reinforce sex differences in liver gene expression and are key regulators of downstream sex differences in disease susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Waxman and Kineman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nikkanen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baik et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, male-biased transcription factor binding is strongly enriched at male-biased DHS located nearby male-biased genes, and female-biased transcription factor binding is strongly enriched at female-biased DHS found nearby female-biased genes. Sex differences in chromatin structure and accessibility are thus key features of sex-differential liver gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau-Corona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>). However, little is understood about the mechanisms linking the sex-dependent temporal GH secretion patterns to the robust sex differences in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding that regulate liver gene expression.</p><p>Here, we elucidate the relationship between the sex-dependent patterns of plasma GH stimulation of hepatocytes and sex differences in liver chromatin accessibility. We identify more than 800 male-biased enhancer DHS regions, where the direct binding of plasma GH pulse-activated STAT5 induces a dynamic cycle of male liver chromatin opening and closing at sites that comprise 31% of all male-biased DHS. Thus, the pulsatility of plasma GH stimulation per se confers significant male bias in chromatin accessibility, and of STAT5 binding, at a substantial fraction of the genomic sites linked to male-biased liver gene expression. Furthermore, we establish that a single physiological replacement dose of GH given as a pulse to hypophysectomized (hypox) mice recapitulates, within 30 min, the pulsatile reopening of chromatin seen in pituitary-intact male mouse liver. Pulsatile chromatin opening is thus a novel mechanism controlling sex differences in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding closely linked to sex differences in gene expression and liver disease. Further, we elucidate key epigenetic features distinguishing this dynamic, STAT5-driven mechanism of male-biased chromatin opening from that operative at a second, distinct class comprised of static male-biased DHS, which are constitutively open in male liver but closed in female liver. Finally, our analysis of histone marks enriched at each class of male-biased DHS, and at a third sex-biased DHS class, comprised of static female-biased DHS, elucidates distinct epigenetic mechanisms mediate sex-specific gene repression in each sex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sex-biased DHS are primarily distal enhancers that target sex-biased genes</title><p>Open (accessible) chromatin regions identified in mouse liver by DNase-seq analysis have been classified as enhancers, insulators, and promoters based on their chromatin mark patterns and CTCF binding activities (n = 70,211 standard reference DHS set) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matthews and Waxman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

These sex-biased DHS regions were enriched for enhancer histone marks, with &gt;85% classified as enhancers or weak enhancers in mouse liver, compared to 66% for all sex-independent DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Cumulative plots of the distance from each DHS to its target gene revealed that a majority of sex-biased DHS classified as enhancers or insulators are distal to their target genes, whereas sex-biased DHS with H3K4me3 marks, which comprise only 1–2% of all sex-biased DHS, are proximal to their target genes, validating their classification as promoter DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, a majority of sex-biased DHS have the marks of positively acting distal enhancers, consistent with our finding that sex-dependent DNA looping at an intra-TAD scale is common in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matthews and Waxman, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Liver DNase-I hypersensitivity site (DHS) classification and mapping to liver-expressed genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distributions of DHS classified as weak enhancer, enhancer, insulator, or promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matthews and Waxman, 2018</xref>) for the indicated three DHS sets.

This regulation requires the GH-activated transcription factor STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hao and Waxman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holloway et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesize that the pulsatile activation of STAT5 seen in male liver in direct response to plasma GH stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connerney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tannenbaum et al., 2001</xref>) dynamically alters the chromatin accessibility landscape of male mouse liver. More specifically, we propose that the repeated activation of STAT5 in male mouse liver by plasma GH pulses induces dynamic cycles of chromatin opening and closing at a subset of liver DHS, and that this response can be discovered by comparing chromatin accessibility profiles in livers from individual male mice euthanized at a peak vs. at a trough of hepatic STAT5 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed DNase-seq libraries prepared from liver nuclei purified from 21 individual adult male mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In parallel, we determined the STAT5 DNA-binding activity of each liver by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) of whole-liver extracts. Of the 21 livers, 10 had high STAT5 EMSA activity (STAT5-high-activity livers) and 11 had very low or no detectable STAT5 EMSA activity (STAT5-low-activity livers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we performed DNase-seq analysis on genomic DNA fragments released by light DNase-I digestion of nuclei purified from each liver, followed by diffReps analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2013</xref>) comparing the DNase-seq-released DNA fragments from each group of livers. We thus discovered genomic regions showing significant differential chromatin accessibility between STAT5-high and STAT5-low male livers. Principal component analysis using either the top 200 or the top 600 most significant diffReps-identified differentially accessible regions revealed that 18 of the 21 livers gave patterns of DNase-released fragments that correlate with STAT5 activity. Two of the STAT5-high livers and one of the STAT5-low livers were outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These same three outliers could also be identified by their discordant DNase-seq read count distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and were excluded from all downstream analyses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Discovery and characterization of dynamic and static male-biased DNase-I hypersensitivity site (DHS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model showing pulsatile male plasma growth hormone (GH) pattern, with mice sampled between GH pulses, when STAT5 is inactive and cytoplasmic (STAT5-low, blue), or at a peak of plasma GH, when liver STAT5 is activated to its homodimeric, nuclear DNA-binding form, which enables STAT5 to open chromatin and bind to its consensus motif, TTCNNNGAA (STAT5-high, red).

As each liver represents a time point of peak (STAT5-high livers) or trough (STAT5-low livers) levels of GH pulse-activated liver STAT5 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the STAT5-high/STAT5-low differential sites identify genomic regions where chromatin dynamically opens or closes in male mouse liver in close association with GH pulse activation of STAT5.

In contrast, only 0.5% of female-biased liver DHS and 2% of sex-independent liver DHS showed this dynamic response to STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, green). This strong enrichment of GH/STAT5 pulse-induced chromatin opening at male-biased DHS compared to sex-independent DHS (ES = 12.9; p&lt;1E-05) identifies intermittent chromatin opening induced by male plasma GH pulses as a mechanism that can explain the male bias in chromatin accessibility for a significant subset (31%) of male-biased DHS.</p><p>To determine whether STAT5 binding per se is an important feature of the observed pulsatile changes in chromatin accessibility at these sites in male liver, we examined normalized DNase-I cut site aggregate plots for the subset comprised of n = 1307 male-biased DHS that bind STAT5 in ChIP-seq analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). STAT5-high livers showed the highest mean level of chromatin opening, followed by up to a 2.8-fold lower level of chromatin opening at those same genomic regions in STAT5-low male livers and in female livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, plot 1). In contrast, male-biased DHS that did not bind STAT5 (n = 1422 DHS) showed nearly equal chromatin accessibility in STAT5-high vs. STAT5-low male livers but approximately twofold lower accessibility in female livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, plot 2). Thus, the male bias in accessibility at the STAT5-bound but not at the non-STAT5-bound male-biased DHS can be explained by STAT5-induced pulsatile chromatin opening in male liver. It is also apparent that the male bias of the non-STAT5-bound DHS set is associated with chromatin closing in female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, plot 2, black). The conclusion that chromatin is relatively closed at these 1422 DHS in female liver is also evident by comparing their mean normalized DNase cutting frequency to that of the full genome-wide set of 53,404 STAT5-unbound, sex-independent DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, plot 2, black, vs. plot 4). Chromatin accessibility was much higher at the subset of sex-independent DHS that bound STAT5 (n = 12,712 DHS, plot 3). Importantly, the high chromatin accessibility at these sex-independent DHS was seen in livers of both sexes and was largely invariant between STAT5-high and STAT5-low male livers. We conclude that STAT5 binding is associated with an open chromatin state, and that STAT5-associated dynamic chromatin opening and closing is a defining characteristic of a specific subset of male-biased DHS but occurs infrequently at female-biased and sex-independent DHS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dynamic and static male-biased DNase-I hypersensitivity sites (DHS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized DNase-I cut site aggregate plots for STAT5-high (red) and STAT5-low male livers (blue) and female livers (black) across the genomic regions included in the sets of male-biased DHS (plots 1 and 2) and sex-independent DHS (plots 3 and 4), separated into subsets of DHS that either do (plots 1 and 3) or do not bind STAT5 by ChIP-seq analysis (plots 2 and 4).

Moreover, STAT5 binding alone is not sufficient to ensure dynamic, male-biased chromatin opening and closing, insofar as 90% of all sex-independent DHS that bind STAT5 do not undergo dynamic chromatin opening and closing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, plot 5A [11,473 sites, 90.3%] vs. 4A [1239 sites, 9.7%]).

We examined two GH/STAT5-regulated transcriptional repressors that reinforce STAT5 regulation of liver sex differences. One factor, BCL6, is a male-biased protein that can compete for STAT5 binding to chromatin and preferentially represses expression of female-biased genes in male liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nikkanen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>).

Building on this classification, we hypothesized that DHS that close following hypophysectomy are enhancers mapping to sex-biased genes subject to either positive regulation by GH (class I sex-biased genes) or negative regulation by GH (class II sex-biased genes). Supporting this proposal, the DHS that close in male liver following hypophysectomy showed strong, specific enrichment (ES = 5.7, p=1.3E-69) for mapping to class I male-specific genes, which are downregulated in hypox male liver, whereas the DHS that close in hypox female liver showed strong, specific enrichment (ES = 7.8, p=6.6E-46) for mapping to class I female-specific genes, which are downregulated in hypox female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, the DHS that open in hypox male liver were specifically enriched for mapping to class II female-specific genes (ES = 3.6, p=1.8E-15), which are upregulated (de-repressed) in male liver following hypophysectomy, whereas the DHS that open in hypox female liver were specifically enriched albeit only moderately (ES = 1.9, p=4.8E-04) for mapping to class II male-specific genes, which are upregulated in female liver following hypophysectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The enrichment patterns exhibited by these four sets of hypophysectomy-responsive DHS mirror the corresponding sex-specific gene response patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom). Thus, all four DHS sets respond to hypophysectomy in a manner consistent with positively acting regulatory elements linked to sex-biased genes. DHS that are linked to class I sex-biased genes, and whose chromatin closes following hypophysectomy, require pituitary hormone to maintain open chromatin; when pituitary hormones are ablated by hypophysectomy, chromatin closes and their class I sex-biased target genes are repressed. In contrast, DHS that are linked to class II sex-biased genes of the opposite sex bias, and whose chromatin opens following hypophysectomy, are kept in a closed chromatin state by pituitary hormone; when pituitary hormones are ablated, chromatin opens locally at those DHS and their class II sex-biased target genes are de-repressed: expression of female-biased class II genes increases in hypox male liver and expression of male-biased class II genes increases in hypox female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, model).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>A single exogenous GH pulse rapidly reopens chromatin at dynamic DHS in hypox male liver</title><p>Next, we investigated whether GH is the pituitary factor whose loss accounts for the widespread chromatin closing seen in hypox male liver. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows that exogenous GH treatment induces chromatin opening within 30 min at more than 3500 DHS, including 71% of the 1487 dynamic DHS that closed in male liver following hypophysectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Each DHS set was separated into subsets based on STAT5 binding, as determined by ChIP-seq (top row: STAT5-bound DHS subsets; bottom row: corresponding non-STAT5-bound DHS subsets). Thus, MHx mice treated with GH for either 30 or 90 min show the largest degree of chromatin opening in the set of 710 dynamic male-biased DHS that bind STAT5. Chromatin opening decreased substantially after 240 min (plot 1A), at which time the activation of liver STAT5 DNA-binding activity is fully reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connerney et al., 2017</xref>). Smaller increases in chromatin opening were observed with GH pulse treatment at the subset of 124 dynamic male-biased DHS that did not bind STAT5 (plot 1B), consistent with their dynamic responses to endogenous GH pulsation, and suggesting that chromatin opening at these sites proceeds by a distinct mechanism than at the STAT5-bound dynamic male-biased sites. Static male-biased DHS with STAT5 bound (597 sites) showed a more modest increase in chromatin opening with GH pulse treatment (c.f., higher basal level in MHx control and lower induced level with GH pulse; plot 2A), while static male-biased DHS without STAT5 binding (1298 sites) showed little or no GH pulse responsiveness (plot 2B). Importantly, the increase in chromatin opening at the STAT5-bound static male-biased DHS largely persists at 240 min (plot 2A), in contrast to the more substantial decline in chromatin opening seen for at STAT5-bound dynamic male-biased DHS (plot 1A). This suggests that, while STAT5 can open chromatin at the static male-biased DHS, it is not required to maintain chromatin accessibility between the naturally occurring endogenous plasma GH pulses. Chromatin opening at female-biased DHS was decreased by hypophysectomy, both at the 258 sites bound by STAT5 and at the 1101 sites that did not show STAT5 binding (plots 3A and 3B). Further, GH pulse treatment of MHx mice stimulated a modest decrease in liver chromatin accessibility at both sets of female-biased DHS. Finally, the dynamic, but not the static, sex-independent DHS showed large increases in chromatin opening following GH pulse treatment (plots 4A and 5A), similar to the dynamic male-biased DHS. Overall, DHS that bind STAT5 showed higher levels of chromatin opening than DHS that do not bind STAT5 (top row vs. bottom row). Notably, this difference in chromatin accessibility is preserved in hypophysectomized male and female liver, even though liver STAT5 is inactive and cannot bind DHS under these conditions due to the absence of GH stimulation, indicating a role for other pituitary-determined factors in chromatin opening.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91367-fig5-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Hypophysectomy led to the closure of many fewer static male-biased DHS than dynamic male-biased DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Histone H3 marks are shown by small colored ovals attached to histone tails (see legend in box). H3K27me3 is specifically used to repress chromatin at female-biased DHS in male liver, and H3K9me3 is specifically used to repress chromatin at both classes of male-biased DHS in female liver. Sex-biased H3K36me3 marks are uniquely associated with static male-biased DHS in male liver and with static female-biased DHS in female liver.

The data in (<bold>B</bold>) show that there are not large differences in chromatin state distributions between dynamic and static male-biased DHS.

Much smaller percentages of both male-biased DHS subsets were in other chromatin states, primarily enhancer states E5 and E11, promoter state E7, and bivalent state E12, which is characterized by the presence of both activating marks (H3K4me1) and repressive marks (H2K27me3).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91367-fig6-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Examination of two repressive histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, revealed their use in a unique way in each sex to enforce sex differences in chromatin states at sex-biased DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Thus, in female liver, dynamic male-biased DHS contain histone marks that typify an active enhancer but are inactive due to the comparatively closed state of their chromatin.

However, the underlying mechanisms controlling sex differences in liver chromatin accessibility, which occur at more than 4000 distinct sites across the mouse genome, are poorly understood. GH, working through its sex-dependent temporal patterns of secretion by the pituitary gland, is the major hormonal factor controlling STAT5-dependent sex differences in liver gene transcription, but little is known about the potential of GH to directly regulate sex differences in the epigenetic landscape required for sex-dependent transcriptional outputs. To address this question, we elucidated the impact of male plasma GH pulses on global patterns of liver chromatin accessibility by analyzing livers from a population of 18 individual male mice euthanized at either a peak or a trough of plasma GH pulse-stimulated hepatic STAT5 DNA-binding activity. Our findings establish that the naturally occurring, endogenous plasma GH pulses characteristic of males induce dynamic cycles of chromatin opening and closing at several thousand DHS in male mouse liver and that these events comprise one of two major mechanisms regulating the male bias in liver chromatin accessibility. Analysis of sex-dependent transcription factor binding patterns, histone marks, and chromatin states elucidated key features distinguishing this dynamic mechanism of male-biased enhancer activation from that of static, GH pulse-unresponsive male-biased DHS and from female-biased DHS (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). GH thus acts at three distinct steps to regulate sex-dependent hepatocyte gene expression, all three involving the GH-activated transcription factor STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): GH pulse-induced chromatin opening at dynamic male-biased DHS driven by pulsatile GH activation of STAT5, as discussed further below; direct transcriptional activation of sex-biased genes by GH-activated STAT5; and GH/STAT5-dependent transcriptional regulation of downstream repressors, such as the female-specific CUX2, which binds to male-biased enhancers in female liver to reinforce sex differences in gene transcription.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>STAT5 regulates sex-dependent hepatocyte gene expression at three distinct steps.</title><p>(1) Sex-biased chromatin opening: growth hormone (GH) pulse-induced chromatin opening at dynamic male-biased DNase-I hypersensitivity sites (DHS) is driven by pulsatile GH activation of STAT5 in male liver, whereas persistent activation of STAT5 in female liver is associated with static female-biased chromatin opening.

The GH pulse-regulated chromatin regions identified here responded to changes in plasma GH levels in a rapid and dynamic manner, with extensive GH-induced chromatin opening occurring within 30 min, as seen when hypophysectomized male mice were given a physiological replacement dose of GH pulse by intraperitoneal injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This time course is consistent with the rapid activation of GH receptor signaling to STAT5, which occurs within 5 min in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebert et al., 1997</xref>) and within 15 min in vivo in a hypophysectomized rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waxman et al., 1995</xref>). Importantly, 85% of the dynamic male-biased DHS identified here (710 of 834 dynamic male-biased DHS) were bound by STAT5, which appears to be a key driver of these GH pulse-induced chromatin opening events. Chromatin closing followed the termination of nuclear STAT5 signaling, which is complete within 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connerney et al., 2017</xref>) and occurs in sufficient time to reset the GH receptor-JAK2 signaling complex and resensitize hepatocytes before the next plasma GH pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). STAT5 binding and chromatin opening at dynamic male-biased DHS were both significantly lower in livers of female mice, where plasma GH levels and liver STAT5 activity are persistent (near-continuous) yet ineffective at maintaining an open chromatin state. Indeed, the extent of chromatin opening at these male-biased DHS in female liver is very similar to the level in livers from male mice euthanized when liver STAT5 activity is low, a time inferred to be between plasma GH pulses (STAT5-low male livers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, panel 5). Pulsatile chromatin opening stimulated by endogenous plasma GH pulses is thus a unique mechanism for establishing and maintaining male-biased chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding at 834 male-biased DHS, corresponding to 31% of all male-biased DHS in the liver.</p><p>GH pulse-responsive DHS were discovered by comparing global chromatin accessibility patterns in a set of 8 livers collected from mice euthanized at a peak of GH-activated STAT5 DNA-binding activity (STAT5-high livers) to those of 10 other livers from mice euthanized between pulses of STAT5 DNA-binding activity, that is, when liver STAT5 activity is very low or undetectable (STAT5-low livers). Three other male livers gave DNase-seq profiles inconsistent with their EMSA-determined STAT5 DNA-binding activity. These outlier livers may have come from male mice euthanized just after the onset of a STAT5 pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tannenbaum et al., 2001</xref>), when more time is needed to induce chromatin opening (two outliers), or shortly after STAT5 is deactivated by tyrosine dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Able et al., 2017</xref>) but prior to the reversal of chromatin opening (one outlier). Importantly, the top 200 genomic regions showing differential chromatin opening between STAT5-high and STAT5-low livers also separated a group of nine C57Bl/6 male mouse liver DNase-seq samples from the ENCODE consortium into two distinct classes, corresponding to the accessibility patterns of STAT5-high-activity livers (n = 4) and STAT5-low-activity livers (n = 5), respectively. Thus, the plasma GH-induced signaling pathways and downstream epigenetic events leading to dynamic chromatin opening and closing at these specific genomic regions are robust across studies and mouse strains.</p><p>STAT5-high male livers showed the highest levels of chromatin accessibility among the male-biased DHS that bind STAT5. Similarly, a higher level of chromatin opening was seen at sex-independent DHS that bind STAT5 compared to those that do not bind STAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, panel 3 vs. 4). There is thus a close linkage between STAT5 binding and the extent of chromatin opening. This finding is consistent with the proposal that STAT5 acts as a pioneer factor to enable chromatin opening, as was reported for STAT5 action at the <italic>Il9</italic> gene locus in Th9 T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). It should be noted, however, that pulsatile chromatin opening also occurred at a small subset (15%) of dynamic male-biased DHS that do not bind STAT5, suggesting that other GH receptor signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank, 2020</xref>) play a role in male-biased chromatin opening at those sites. It is also apparent that pulsatile STAT5 activation and pulsatile STAT5 DNA binding alone are not sufficient to ensure pulsatile chromatin opening insofar as many sex-independent DHS do bind STAT5, yet are constitutively open in both male and female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, plot 5A). Finally, plasma GH pulse stimulation decreased chromatin accessibility at a small number of liver DHS, most of which were sex-independent. The mechanism for this GH-stimulated decrease in accessibility and its physiological significance are unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sex-dependent GH regulation of static male-biased DHS</title><p>We identified a second, less well-defined mechanism that controls the male bias in chromatin accessibility at a distinct DHS set, comprised of 1895 static male-biased DHS. These DHS, which represent 69% of all male-biased DHS, mapped to a set of target genes and enriched biological processes distinct from but overlapping with those of the dynamic male-biased DHS set. These static male-biased DHS are constitutively open in male liver, with chromatin accessibility largely unchanged across the peaks and valleys of GH-induced liver STAT5 activity. Nevertheless, GH regulates the sex bias of these DHS, as evidenced by their extensive closure in livers of male mice given a continuous infusion of GH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>), which mimics the female plasma GH pattern and substantially feminizes liver gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau-Corona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau-Corona et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, in contrast to dynamic male-biased DHS, the sex-biased chromatin accessibility of static male-biased DHS is primarily due to their closed chromatin state in the persistent GH signaling environment of female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Static male-biased DHS are relatively deficient in STAT5 binding compared to dynamic male-biased DHS, but showed significant enrichment for binding the female-specific repressor protein CUX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conforto et al., 2012</xref>), which we infer contributes to their closure in both female liver and in continuous GH-infused male liver (where CUX2 is induced to female-like levels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau-Corona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laz et al., 2007</xref>) through its established transcriptional repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gingras et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, static male-biased DHS showed strong enrichment of male-biased binding sites for the pioneer factors FOXA1 and FOXA2, which may help maintain their constitutively open chromatin state in male liver.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Novel insights into the underlying mechanisms from chromatin state analysis</title><p>Both dynamic and static male-biased DHS are largely (~95%) promoter-distal enhancer DHS, as indicated by their flanking histone modifications.

Dynamic male-biased DHS were enriched for the active enhancer state E6 in male liver but were enriched for enhancer states E9 and E10 in female liver. Enhancer states E9 and E10 are characterized by a high frequency of same activating chromatin marks as chromatin state E6, namely H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (E9) or H3K27ac alone (E10), but unlike E6 they are both deficient in open chromatin (DHS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, in female liver, dynamic male-biased DHS regions contain active histone marks but are in a comparatively closed chromatin state. This may in part be due to their enrichment for female-biased H3K9me3 (repressive) histone marks, which gives them bivalent character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A bivalent chromatin state may protect dynamic male-biased DHS from irreversible silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>) and confer the potential for chromatin opening leading to activation of their latent enhancer activity in female liver, for example, in response to chemical exposure or biological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lodato et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, static male-biased DHS are depleted of female-biased enhancer marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) and are in an inactive chromatin state in female liver. Notably, the bivalent female chromatin state of dynamic male-biased DHS is distinct from the poised state these genomic regions apparently adopt in male liver between plasma GH pulses (i.e., in STAT5-low male liver) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and in hypophysectomized male liver, where a single GH pulse is all that is required to induce rapid chromatin opening, even after several weeks of pituitary hormone ablation.</p><p>The set of female-biased DHS identified here is almost entirely (99%) static, that is, GH pulse-unresponsive, and showed strong enrichment for three female-biased activating chromatin marks, H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3. These DHS also showed strong enrichment for female-biased FOXA2 binding, which likely contributes to their high chromatin accessibility in female compared to male liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The static female-biased DHS also showed strong enrichment for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in male liver, which is expected to contribute directly to their closed, inactive male liver chromatin state. Moderate enrichments for several chromatin states characterized by the presence of activating chromatin marks but lacking in DHS (states E10, E11, and E12) were also observed. This indicates heterogeneity within the set of static female-biased DHS, some of which have bivalent chromatin character in male liver. Evidence for heterogeneity of these female-biased DHS also comes from their varied time-dependent loss of H3K27me3 marks and from their differential time courses for chromatin opening when male mice are given GH as a continuous infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau-Corona et al., 2017</xref>). Heterogeneity was also seen in the extent of female-biased target gene de-repression when H3K27me3 marks are lost from livers of male mice deficient in the H3K27-trimethylase enzyme complex PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau-Corona et al., 2020</xref>).

Whereas male-biased H3K27me3 repressive marks are highly enriched at and are specifically associated with static female-biased DHS, in agreement with our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau-Corona et al., 2020</xref>), we show here that female-biased H3K9me3 repressive marks are specifically enriched at both dynamic and static male-biased DHS, without a corresponding enrichment of male-biased H3K9me3 marks at static female-biased DHS. This unexpected finding supports the proposal that sex-specific gene repression is mediated by two distinct mechanisms: H3K9me3 marks are specifically used to repress certain male-biased regulatory sites in female liver, and H3K27me3 marks are specifically used to repress female-biased regulatory sites in male liver.</p><p>We also discovered that sex-biased H3K36me3 marks are a unique distinguishing feature of static sex-biased DHS, with male-biased H3K36me3 marks being highly enriched at static male-biased DHS but not at dynamic male-biased DHS, and female-biased H3K36me3 marks highly enriched at static female-biased DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). H3K36me3 marks are classically associated with the demarcation of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>) but are also used to maintain cell type identity by inhibiting the spread of H3K27me3 repressive marks at cell type-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoetker et al., 2023</xref>). The enrichment of H3K36me3 marks at static male-biased DHS described here could thus be an important mechanism to maintain sex-dependent hepatocyte identity by keeping static male-biased enhancers constitutively open and free of H3K27me3 repressive marks in male liver, and correspondingly for H3K36me3 marks enriched at static female-biased DHS in female liver.

These chromatin sites are maintained in a primed (poised) state in hypox male liver over a period of several weeks, despite the prolonged deficiency of GH and other pituitary hormones, including gonadal steroids, and the dysregulation of several thousand liver-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wauthier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connerney et al., 2017</xref>). DHS that close in male liver following hypophysectomy were enriched for proximity to class I male-specific genes, which are downregulated in hypox male liver, and DHS that close in hypox female liver showed the strongest enrichment for class I female-specific gene targets, which are downregulated in hypox female liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, model). Furthermore, DHS that open in male liver following hypophysectomy were enriched for proximity to class II female-specific genes and DHS that open in female liver were enriched for proximity to class II male-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These enrichments are consistent with the definition of class II sex-biased genes, that is, genes that are upregulated by hypophysectomy in the sex where they show lower expression in intact mice. Together, these findings lend strong support for the functional role of each class of sex-biased and pituitary hormone-dependent DHS as regulatory elements with intrinsic, positively acting enhancer potential, keeping gene expression on in intact liver by maintaining open chromatin, for example, at male-biased DHS repressed in hypox male liver in the case of class I male-biased genes, or keeping gene expression off by maintaining a closed chromatin state, for example, at female-biased DHS induced in hypox male liver in the case of class II female-biased genes. Further study will be required to elucidate the regulatory factors and molecular mechanisms governing these gene regulatory circuits, in particular those controlling the de-repression of class II sex-biased genes following pituitary hormone ablation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Pituitary GH secretory patterns vs. gonadal steroids as regulators of sex-biased liver chromatin accessibility and gene expression</title><p>Testosterone has a well-established role in early postnatal programming of the hypothalamic control of pituitary GH secretory patterns beginning at puberty and lasting through adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramirez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waxman et al., 1985</xref>). While it is also possible that testosterone, as well as estrogens, could also regulate sex differences in hepatocytes directly at the epigenetic or transcriptional level, our findings support the proposal that plasma GH patterns, and not gonadal steroids, dominate the epigenetic control of liver sex differences. First, the ability of a single exogenous plasma GH pulse to rapidly reopen dynamic male-biased DHS closed by hypophysectomy – in the face of ongoing ablation of pituitary stimulated gonadal steroid production and secretion – implicates GH signaling <italic>per se</italic> in the direct regulation of chromatin accessibility for this class of male-biased DHS. Second, the sex biased accessibility of static male-biased DHS is also regulated by the pattern of plasma GH stimulation, as evidenced by the widespread closure of those DHS in male liver following continuous GH infusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). On the other hand, it is important to note that hepatocyte-specific knockout of androgen receptor (AR) does, in fact, dysregulate ~15% of sex-biased genes in the liver, albeit with a much lower effect size than global AR knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 2023</xref>), which may be due to disruption of the somatotropic axis and circulating GH secretory profiles in the case of global AR loss. Conceivably, AR could regulate these sex-biased genes via a direct binding mechanism, by acting alone, or perhaps in concert with GH-activated STAT5, to keep chromatin open constitutively at a subset of static male-biased DHS, of which 32% undergo at least partial closure in male liver following hypophysectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Supporting this possibility, AR binding sites were recently reported to be enriched at male-biased genes in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodríguez-Montes et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, estrogen receptor (ERα) likely plays only a minor role in regulating sex-biased liver DHS enhancers, given the lack of major effect of hepatocyte-specific ERα knockout on sex-biased liver gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nikkanen et al., 2022</xref>) and our finding that only 12% of static female-biased DHS close in female liver following hypophysectomy, despite the decrease in circulating estradiol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Greenwald, 1993</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal treatments and EMSA analysis</title><p>All mouse work was carried out in accordance with ARRIVE Essential guidelines 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>) for study design, sample size, randomization, experimental animals and procedures, and statistical methods, and with approval of the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The diffReps nucleosome option (200 bp window size) was used and the option (-frag) was set to zero for all comparisons. The differential sites that diffReps identified as significant were further analyzed by two methods, principal component analysis and boxplot analysis, to determine the distributions of normalized sequence read counts (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) for each individual DNase-seq library. Three outlier DNase-seq samples were thus identified: two from livers designated STAT5-high activity based on EMSA (samples G74A_M1 and G74A_M2), which gave DNase-seq read count distributions (top 200 and top 600 diffReps-identified differential sites, ordered by decreasing fold-change in chromatin opening) more similar to STAT5-low-activity livers; and one from a STAT5-low EMSA activity liver (sample G92_M5), which gave a DNase-seq read count distribution more similar to STAT5-high-activity livers. The three outlier liver DNase-seq libraries were excluded from all downstream analysis. Next, we implemented diffReps analysis using the same cutoffs described above to compare the DNase-seq activity profiles of the remaining EMSA-identified STAT5-high-activity (n = 8) and STAT5-low-activity (n = 10) DNase-seq samples.

For example, for male liver, we generated a single combined STAT5-high DNase-seq FASTQ file by merging the n = 8 biological replicate STAT5-high liver FASTQ files, and separately, we generated a single combined STAT5-low sample by merging the n = 10 biological replicate STAT5-low DNase-seq FASTQ files (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Combined replicate FASTQ files were generated for intact female, hypox female, hypox male, and each of the hypox male + GH treatment time point DNase-seq samples in the same manner. Second, for each combined replicate file, a BED file comprised of positive and negative strand reads was processed to identify each DNase-I cut site, which corresponds to the 5′-end of each sequence read. Third, the set of input genomic regions was processed to generate a list of 2 kb regions centered at the midpoint of each DHS. The BEDTools <italic>Coverage</italic> command using the (-d) option was then used to count the number of DNase-I cut sites at each nt position across each 2 kb midpoint-centered region, thus producing a read count matrix composed of 2000 read counts for each input genomic region. Fourth, a custom R script was used to load the read count matrix, calculate the sum of read counts at each nt position, normalize the raw read counts by the number of reads in the subset of 70,211 standard reference DHS to be analyzed, normalize by the number of input genomic regions, and then generate a plot of the DNase-I signal across the input genomic regions. The resultant normalized DNase-I cutting profiles were then smoothed using a LOWESS smoother as implemented in R (package: gplots v3.0.1.1). An offset was applied to the profile by subtracting an average read count (calculated from the first 200 nt positions) from the normalized read count intensity to standardize the baseline of each profile.

Enrichments with adjusted p-value&lt;1E-03 were considered statistically significant. Enrichments of sex-biased DHS for being enhancer, promoter, or insulator regions (e.g., male-biased DHS for being enhancers compared to the background set of sex-independent DHS) were calculated as follows: enrichment score = (ratio A)/(ratio B), where ratio A = the number of sex-biased DHS that are enhancers, divided by the number of sex-biased DHS that are not enhancers; and ratio B = the number of sex-independent DHS that are enhancers, divided by the number of sex-independent DHS that are not enhancers. For example, 2551 male-biased DHS were classified as enhancers, and 178 other male-biased DHS were not enhancers (2551/178 = 14.3), whereas 43,591 sex-independent DHS were classified as enhancers, and 22,525 sex-independent DHS were not enhancers (43,591/22,525 = 1.93), which gives an enrichment score A/B = 14.3/1.93 = 7.41. The set of 66,116 sex-independent DHS was used as the background for these enrichment calculations.</p><p>Enrichments of sex-biased DHS subsets (enhancer, insulator, or promoter) for mapping to sex-biased genes were calculated (e.g., male-biased enhancer DHS mapping to male-specific genes) as follows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>): enrichment score = (ratio A)/(ratio B), where ratio A = the number of male-biased enhancer DHS that map to male-specific genes, divided by the number of male-biased enhancer DHS that map to sex-independent genes; and ratio B = the number sex-independent enhancer DHS that map to male-specific genes, divided by the number of sex-independent enhancer DHS that map to sex-independent genes. For example, among the male-biased DHS classified as enhancers, 404 male-biased enhancer DHS map to male-specific genes, and 525 male-biased enhancer DHS map to sex-independent genes (404/525 = 0.77), whereas 1495 sex-independent enhancer DHS map to male-specific genes, and 15,457 sex-independent enhancer DHS map to sex-independent genes (1495/15,457 = 0.097), which gives an enrichment score A/B = 0.77/0.097 = 8.0. The set of 66,116 sex-independent DHS was used as the background for these enrichment calculations.</p><p>Enrichments of hypophysectomy-responsive DHS for mapping to class I or II sex-biased genes (e.g., DHS that close in response to hypophysectomy in male liver and that map to male class I genes) were calculated for male and female liver as follows: enrichment score = ratio A/ratio B, where ratio A = the number of DHS that open (or that close) following hypophysectomy and that map to class I (or to class II) sex-biased genes, divided by the number of DHS that open (or that close) following hypophysectomy and that map to sex-independent genes; and ratio B = the number of hypophysectomy-unresponsive DHS (static DHS) that map to class I or II sex-biased genes, divided by the number of static DHS that map to sex-independent genes. For example, in male liver, 217 DHS that close following hypophysectomy map to a male class I sex-specific gene, and 1203 other DHS that close map to sex-independent genes (217/1203 = 0.1803), whereas 444 static DHS map to a male class I sex-specific gene, and 14,053 static DHS map to a sex-independent gene (444/14,053 = 0.0316), which gives an enrichment score A/B = 0.1803/0.0316 = 5.7. The static DHS used for these enrichment calculations correspond to the set of 35,562 static DHS in male liver and 30,394 static DHS in female liver.</p><p>Enrichments for overlap with genomic regions containing biologically relevant sets of transcription factor binding sites, chromatin marks, and combinations of epigenetic features (chromatin states) were calculated for each of the following four sets of DHS: (1) dynamic male-biased DHS (834 sites), (2) static male-biased DHS (1895 sites), (3) dynamic sex-independent DHS (1532 sites), and (4) static female-biased DHS (1359 sites) relative to a background set of static sex-independent DHS (64,584 sites) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Briefly, these sets of DHS were identified based on their sex specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ling et al., 2010</xref>) and were classified as ‘dynamic’ if they overlapped a STAT5-high vs. STAT5-low differential DHS, otherwise they were classified as ‘static.’ Characterization of the 70,211 reference set DHS members as static or dynamic and their sex-specificity designations are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. Biologically relevant regions annotated include sex-biased transcription factor binding sites for STAT5 and BCL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), CUX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conforto et al., 2012</xref>) and FOXA1/FOXA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2012</xref>). We also examined DHS enrichment for sex-biased chromatin marks and chromatin states defined for male and female liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>). FOXA1 and FOXA2 ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2012</xref>) was processed and reanalyzed with MAnorm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shao et al., 2012</xref>) in analyses performed by Gracia Bonilla of this laboratory, which identified sex-biased FOXA1 and sex-biased FOXA2 binding sites in mouse liver. Data from the MAnorm analysis of FOXA1 and FOXA2 ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>) was filtered by log2(fold-change) value (i.e., M-value) to define male-biased and female-biased binding sites. Genomic coordinates for each of the sex-biased transcription factor binding sites, chromatin marks, and chromatin states are provided (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp7">Supplementary files 3 and 7</xref>). Enrichments for the overlap of DHS with various biologically relevant regions were calculated (e.g., dynamic male-biased DHS for containing STAT5-high [male] binding sites compared to the background set of static sex-independent DHS) as follows: enrichment score = ratio A/ratio B, where ratio A = the percentage of dynamic male-biased DHS with a STAT5 binding site; and ratio B = the percentage of static sex-independent DHS with the same type of binding site. For example, 235 dynamic male-biased DHS contain a STAT5-high (male) binding site (235/834 = 0.2818), whereas 311 static sex-independent DHS contain such a binding site (311/64,584 = 0.0048), which gives an enrichment score A/B = 0.2818/0.0048 = 58.7. The set of 64,584 static sex-independent DHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) was used as the background for these enrichment calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chromatin state map analysis</title><p>Chromatin state maps (14 state model), developed for male mouse liver, and separately for female mouse liver, are based on epigenetic data from a panel of six histone marks and DHS data in each sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugathan and Waxman, 2013</xref>). These maps were used to identify sex differences in chromatin state and chromatin structure at each DHS region and their relationships to sex-biased gene expression as follows. BEDTools was used to assign one of the 14 chromatin states to each of the 70,211 reference DHS based on the overlap of the DHS with the male liver chromatin state map, and separately, based on its overlap with the female liver chromatin state map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>, columns AN–AQ). DHS whose genomic coordinates span two or more different chromatin states were assigned to the state with the largest number of overlapping base pairs, or in case of equal numbers of base pairs, the chromatin state with the smaller genomic coordinates. Enrichments of sets of static and dynamic male-biased DHS for being in one of the 14 chromatin states in male liver (e.g., dynamic male-biased DHS for being in chromatin state E6, which is an enhancer-like state) were calculated as follows: enrichment score = (ratio A)/(ratio B), where ratio A = the number of male-biased DHS that are in a particular chromatin state, divided by the number of male-biased DHS not in that chromatin state; and ratio B = the number of static sex-independent DHS in that chromatin state, divided by the number of static sex-independent DHS not in that chromatin state. For example, 604 dynamic male-biased DHS are classified as chromatin state E6, and 230 other dynamic male-biased DHS are not classified as chromatin state E6 (604/230 = 2.626), whereas 24,082 static sex-independent DHS are classified as chromatin state E6, and 40,502 static sex-independent DHS are not classified as chromatin state E6 (24,082/40,502 = 0.5946), which gives an enrichment score A/B = 2.626/0.5946 = 4.4. The set of 64,584 static sex-independent DHS was used as the background set for these enrichment calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>DHS peak normalization</title><p>DNase-seq data to be visualized in the UCSC Genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>) was normalized using the number of sequence reads in each DHS peak region per million mapped sequence reads (reads-in-peaks-per-million [RiPPM]) as a scaling factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lodato et al., 2018</xref>). Normalization was carried out using a comprehensive list of DHS peak regions merged across each dataset (peak union list), obtained by concatenating FASTQ files for biological replicates of each control and treatment group, as described above. DHS peak regions identified in both individual liver samples and by analysis of the combined samples were concatenated into a single list, and then the BEDTools <italic>Merge</italic> command was used to combine overlapping features to generate a single list of non-overlapping DHS peaks. The fraction of reads in peaks for each sample was then calculated to obtain a scaling factor. Raw sequence read counts were divided by this per-million scaling factor to obtain RiPPM normalized read counts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Data processing, primary computational analysis, preparation of analysis scripts, and data visualization were carried out by AR.

The Waxman lab has previously implicated GH control of STAT5 as a critical event leading to a masculine pattern of gene expression. The present study separates male-biased regulatory sites associated with the male-biased genes into different classes based on their responsiveness to the cyclic male pattern of STAT5 activity, and investigates DNAse hypersensitivity sites (DHS) of different classes showing cyclic sex-bias or not. It further reports on the binding of transcription factors to STAT5-sensitive DHS, and involvement of specific histone marks at these sites. The study argues that STAT5 is the proximate factor regulating chromatin accessibility in about 1/3 of male-biased DHS that are sexually differentiated by GH secretion. The authors propose the pulsatile GH secretion as a novel proximate mechanism of regulating chromatin accessibility to cause sex differences.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study offers new insight into the effects of hypophysectomy and injection of GH on different classes of sex-biased genes in mouse liver. The results support the general conclusion of the authors. Cyclic secretion of other hormones (for example, estrous secretion of estrogens and progesterone) are well known to cause sex differences in multiple organs in rodents, and it will be interesting to assess if these cyclic secretions induce similar changes in chromatin accessibility causing female tissue gene expression to differ from that of males.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors argue for two major mechanisms controlling sexual bias in liver gene expression, and analyze in depth one of these mechanisms. The focus is on the group of DHS (about 1/3 of all male-biased DHS) in which the sex bias is controlled by cyclic secretion of growth hormone (GH) in males, compared to static and low growth hormone in adult females. The sex difference in pituitary secretion of GH is induced by permanent effects of androgens acting on the hypothalamus perinatally. The manuscript study would be improved by further discussion of the mechanistic relationship between this class of sex-biased DHS and the other 2/3 of liver DHS that also show male-biased accessibility but whose chromatin does not respond directly to GH-stimulated STAT5. Previous studies, including those in the Waxman lab (PMIDs: 26959237, 18974276, 35396276) suggest castration of males or gonadectomy of both sexes eliminates most sex differences in mRNA expression in mouse liver, and/or that androgens such as DHT or testosterone administered in adulthood potentially reverses the effects of gonadectomy and/or masculinizes liver gene expression. It is not clear from the present discussion whether the GH/STAT5 cyclic effects to masculinize chromatin status require the presence of androgens in adulthood to masculinize pituitary GH secretion. Are there analyses of the present (or past) data that might provide evidence about a dual role for GH and androgen acting on the same genes? For example, are sex-biased DHS bound by androgen-dependent factors or show other signs of androgen sensitivity? Are histone marks associated with DHS regulated by androgens? Moreover, it would help if the authors indicate whether they believe that the &quot;constitutive&quot; static sex differences in the larger 2/3 set of male-biased DHS are the result of &quot;constitutive&quot; (but variable) action of testicular androgens in adulthood. Although the present study is nicely focused on the GH pulse-sensitive DHS, is there mechanistic overlap in sex-biasing mechanisms with the larger static class of sex-biased liver DHS?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91367.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The present work addresses the mechanisms linking the sex-dependent temporal GH secretion patterns to the robust sex differences in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding that ultimately regulate sexually dimorphic liver gene expression. Using DNAseq analysis genomic sites hypersensitive to cleavage by DNase I, DNase hypersensitive sites [DHS] were studied in hepatocytes from male and female mice. DHS in the genome correspond to accessible chromatin regions and encompass key regulatory elements, including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and silencers, often flanked by specific histone modifications, and all of these players were described in different settings of GH action. Importantly, the dynamics of sex-dependent and independent chromatin accessibility linked to STAT5 binding were evaluated. For that purpose, hepatic samples from mice were divided into STAT high and STAT low binding by EMSA screening. With this information changes in DHS related to STAT binding were calculated in both sexes, giving an approximation of chromatin opening in response to STAT5, or alternatively to hypophsectomy, or a single GH pulse. More the 800 male-biased DHS (from a total of more than 70000 DHS) regions were identified in the STAT5 high groups, implying that the binding of a plasma GH pulse activates STAT5, and evokes a dynamic cycle of male liver chromatin opening and closing at sites that comprised 31% of all male-biased DHS. This proves that the pulsatility of plasma GH stimulation confers significant male bias in chromatin accessibility, and STAT5 binding at a fraction of the genomic sites linked to sex-biased liver gene expression and liver disease. As a proof of concept, authors show that a single physiological replacement dose or pulse of GH given to hypophysectomized mice recapitulate, within 30 min, the pulsatile re-opening of chromatin seen in pituitary-intact male mouse liver.</p><p>In another male-biased DHS set (69% of male-biased DHS), chromatin accessibility was static, that is unchanged across the peaks and valleys of GH-induced liver STAT5 activity and mapped to a set of target genes and processes distinct though sometimes overlapping those of the dynamic male-biased DHS.</p><p>In view of these distinct dynamic and static DHS in males, authors evaluated key epigenetic features distinguishing the dynamic STAT5-driven mechanism of chromatin opening from that of static male-biased DHS, which are constitutively open in the male liver but closed in the female liver. The analysis of histone marks enriched at each class of sex-biased DHS indicated exquisite differences in the epigenetic mechanisms that mediate sex-specific gene repression in each sex. For example, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, two widely used repressive histone marks, are used in a unique way in each sex to enforce sex differences in chromatin states at sex-biased DHS.</p><p>Finally, the work recapitulates and explains the classifications of sex dimorphic genes made in previous works. Sex-biased and pituitary hormone-dependent DHS act as regulatory elements with a positive enhancer potential, to induce or maintain gene expression in the intact liver by sustaining an open chromatin in the case of class I male-biased DHS and class I male-biased genes in the male liver. Contrariwise DHS may participate in the inhibition of gene expression by maintaining a closed chromatin state, as in the case of class II male-biased DHS and class II female-biased genes in male liver.</p><p>These results as a whole present a complex mechanism by which GH regulates the sexual dimorphism of liver genes in order to cope with the metabolic needs of each sex. In a complete story, the information on chromatin accessibility, histone modification, and transcription factor binding was integrated to elucidate the complex patterns of transcriptional regulation, which is sexually dimorphic in the liver.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work presents a novel insight into the fundamental underlying epigenetic mechanisms of sex-biased gene regulation.</p><p>Results are supported by numerous Tables, and Supplementary Tables with the raw data, which present the advantage that they may be reanalyzed in the future to prove new hypotheses.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>It is a complicated work to analyze, even though the main messages are clearly conveyed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91367.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rampersaud</surname><given-names>Andy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Boston University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Connerney</surname><given-names>Jeannette</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Boston University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Waxman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Boston University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>1.

Further, we now discuss the potential mechanistic significance of this mark in insuring the sex-biased chromatin accessibility at Static sex-biased DHS:</p><p>“Finally, we discovered that sex-biased H3K36me3 marks are a unique distinguishing feature of static sex-biased DHS, with male-biased H3K36me3 marks being highly enriched at static male-biased DHS but not at dynamic male-biased DHS, and female-biased H3K36me3 marks highly enriched at static female-biased DHS (Fig. 6C). H3K36me3 marks are classically associated with the demarcation of actively transcribed genes [50] but are also used to maintain cell type identity by inhibiting the spread of H3K27me3 repressive marks at cell type-specific enhancers [35, 51]. The enrichment of H3K36me3 marks at static male-biased DHS described here could thus be an important mechanism to maintain sex-dependent hepatocyte identity by keeping static male-biased enhancers constitutively open and free of H3K27me3 repressive marks in male liver, and similarly for H3K36me3 marks enriched at static female-biased DHS in female liver. Further study is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms whereby these and the other sex-specific histone marks discussed above are deposited on chromatin in a sex-dependent and site-specific manner and the roles that GH plays in regulating these epigenetic events”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Previous studies, including those in the Waxman lab (PMIDs: 26959237, 18974276, 35396276) suggest castration of males or gonadectomy of both sexes eliminates most sex differences in mRNA expression in mouse liver, and/or that androgens such as DHT or testosterone administered in adulthood potentially reverses the effects of gonadectomy and/or masculinizes liver gene expression. It is not clear from the present discussion whether the GH/STAT5 cyclic effects to masculinize chromatin status require the presence of androgens in adulthood to masculinize pituitary GH secretion. Are there analyses of the present (or past) data that might provide evidence about a dual role for GH and androgen acting on the same genes? For example, are sex-biased DHS bound by androgen-dependent factors or show other signs of androgen sensitivity? Are histone marks associated with DHS regulated by androgens? Moreover, it would help if the authors indicate whether they believe that the &quot;constitutive&quot; static sex differences in the larger 2/3 set of male-biased DHS are the result of &quot;constitutive&quot; (but variable) action of testicular androgens in adulthood. Although the present study is nicely focused on the GH pulse-sensitive DHS, is there mechanistic overlap in sex-biasing mechanisms with the larger static class of sex-biased liver DHS?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The Reviewer poses an intriguing set of question regarding the potential role of androgens in directly regulating, perhaps by working together with GH or GH-activated STAT5 at the level of chromatin, to co-regulate the set of Static male-biased DHS. We have now addressed these questions in full in a new Discussion paragraph, entitled, “Pituitary GH secretory patterns vs. gonadal steroids as regulators of sex-biased liver chromatin accessibility and gene expression” (lines 640-661), as follows:</p><p>“While testosterone has a well-established role in programming hypothalamic control of pituitary GH secretory patterns [9-11], it is also possible that androgens and estrogens could regulate sex differences in hepatocytes directly at the epigenetic or transcriptional level. However, our findings support the proposal that plasma GH patterns, and not gonadal steroids, dominate epigenetic control of liver sex differences. First, the ability of a single exogenous plasma GH pulse to rapidly reopen dynamic male-biased DHS closed by hypophysectomy – in the face of ongoing ablation of pituitary stimulated gonadal steroid production and secretion – implicates GH signaling per se in the direct regulation of chromatin accessibility for this class of male-biased DHS. Second, GH regulates the sex bias of static male-biased DHS as well, as evidenced by their widespread closure in male liver following continuous GH infusion (Table S2E). It is important to note, however, that hepatocyte-specific knockout of androgen receptor (AR) does, in fact, dysregulate ~15% of sex-biased genes, albeit with a much lower effect size than global AR knockout [52] due to the systemic disruption of the somatotropic axis and circulating GH secretory profiles [53, 54]. Conceivably, AR could regulate these genes by a direct binding mechanism, acting either alone or in concert with GH-activated STAT5 to keep chromatin open constitutively at a subset of static male-biased DHS, of which 32% undergo at least partial closure in male liver following hypophysectomy (Fig. 4C). Estrogen receptor (ERa) likely plays only a minor role in regulating sex-biased liver DHS enhancers, given the lack of effect of hepatocyte-specific ERa knockout on sex-biased liver gene expression [22] and our finding that only 12% of static female-biased DHS close in female liver following hypophysectomy, which decreases circulating estradiol levels [55].”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer did not raise any points of criticism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 Recommendations:</bold></p><p>Line 121. &quot;highly enriched for genes of the corresponding sex bias&quot; is unclear.
