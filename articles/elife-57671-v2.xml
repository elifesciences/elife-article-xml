aligned with specific seasons to maximise reproductive success. A major seasonal cue used to time the transition to flowering is temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hancock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrés and Coupland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manzano-Piedras et al., 2014</xref>). Many plants overwinter in a vegetative form and flower in spring. This alignment of the floral transition with spring is achieved through a process called vernalization, in which flowering is accelerated by previous exposure to prolonged winter cold. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and its relatives, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a MADS-box transcription factor, delays the transition to flowering in warm temperatures until its expression is downregulated by exposure to cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheldon et al., 1999</xref>). On return to warm, spring-like conditions, <italic>FLC</italic> remains epigenetically silenced, permitting expression of <italic>FT</italic> and floral meristem identity genes that trigger the floral transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helliwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Searle et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The vernalization mechanism has been genetically dissected using controlled laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloomer and Dean, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whittaker and Dean, 2017</xref>). <italic>FLC</italic> expression is upregulated by the coiled-coil protein FRIGIDA (FRI), which establishes an active transcription state at <italic>FLC</italic> through interactions with chromatin modifiers including the H3K36 methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP8 (SDG8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hyun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2018</xref>). This upregulation is antagonised by the autonomous pathway, a group of interacting RNA-processing factors, (eg. FCA and FY) and chromatin modifying factors (eg. FLD and FVE). These promote a low expression state at <italic>FLC</italic> through interactions with the long non-coding antisense transcript group, <italic>COOLAIR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ausín et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). A high <italic>FLC</italic> transcription state is associated with plants that overwinter before flowering. Cold transcriptionally downregulates <italic>FLC,</italic> and the locus is maintained in an epigenetically silenced state by a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gendall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sung and Amasino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helliwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>). This PRC2 mechanism requires the temperature-integrating accessory protein, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sung and Amasino, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bond et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018</xref>). Cold-induction of <italic>VIN3</italic> expression leads to formation of a PHD-PRC2 complex that also contains the PHD protein VERNALIZATION5 (VRN5) and the specific Su(z)12 component VRN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sung et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Lucia et al., 2008</xref>). This complex is nucleated at <italic>FLC</italic> by the B3-binding protein VP1/ABI3-LIKE 1 (VAL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qüesta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). The PHD-PRC2 methylates histone H3 lysine 27 residues in a ~ 3 nucleosome domain at <italic>FLC</italic> to epigenetically ‘switch’ each allele off in a stochastic manner that over the population of cells produces a quantitative memory of the length of cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). When plants return to warm conditions, the PHD-PRC2 spreads over the locus to maintain long-term epigenetic memory, and this requires the action of LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN1 (LHP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mylne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sung et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>FLC</italic> expression and memory is influenced by natural non-coding cis polymorphism at the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shindo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qüesta et al., 2020</xref>). Different Arabidopsis accessions need different lengths of cold to epigenetically silence <italic>FLC,</italic> and this requirement is determined by non-coding SNPs at <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shindo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, within the Arabideae tribe, cis regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> orthologues contributes to perennial-vs.-annual flowering differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiefer et al., 2017</xref>). Within the worldwide <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> population, non-coding variation defines a small number of <italic>FLC</italic> haplotypes, which confer quantitatively different flowering time responses to different lengths of vernalization in constant cold in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>). These haplotypes appear to have been maintained in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> population due to their contributions to life history diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sánchez-Bermejo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Méndez-Vigo et al., 2016</xref>), and they show different geographic distributions, suggesting that they are adapted to different climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Méndez-Vigo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has shown the importance of analysing flowering in natural field conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), ‘in natura’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kudoh, 2016</xref>). Such studies have highlighted how the influence of genes of major effect, including <italic>FLC</italic>, changes depending on the field environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fournier-Level et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ågren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, the investigation of RNA levels in natura has identified genetic mechanisms in the field that were previously unknown from laboratory observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nagano et al., 2019</xref>). For example, field work in Sweden and the UK with the vernalization reference genotype Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>SF2</sup> and mutants in <italic>VIN3</italic> (<italic>vin3-4</italic>) has shown that initial VIN3-independent <italic>FLC</italic> downregulation requires cold temperatures, whereas VIN3-mediated epigenetic silencing requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>). Autumn conditions greatly influence when epigenetic silencing initiates, sometimes leading to temporal separation of the two phases, which in laboratory constant-condition experiments and some natural environments occur concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Field experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map showing locations of field sites (dots) and the origins of five of the accessions (flowers) used in this study.

These haplotypes conferred different flowering time responses to vernalization at constant 5°C, with the accessions carrying them clustered broadly into ‘Rapid Vernalizing’ (RV) and ‘Slow Vernalizing’ (SV) types. To investigate their function in field conditions, we selected accessions to represent each of the five most populous haplotypes, representing more than 60% of tested accessions, as well as a further accession, Löv-1, for which there is evidence of local adaptation to the climate in the region of our North Sweden field site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qüesta et al., 2020</xref>).

The three field sites in Norwich, UK, in Ullstorp, Sweden (‘South Sweden’) and in Ramsta, Sweden (‘North Sweden’) were chosen to represent climates with different winters. Norwich has a temperate oceanic climate and a mild winter, Ullstorp has a warm-summer continental climate with a winter in which temperatures are often below freezing, and Ramsta is subarctic, usually with snow cover during winter (hence the 0°C flatline in temperatures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beck et al., 2018</xref>). The Swedish sites are also close to the source sites of several of the tested accessions; Vår2-6 and Ull2-5 in Skåne, near or at Ullstorp; Löv-1 near Ramsta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the second year of experimentation, we also included the <italic>vin3-1</italic> mutant in the Col <italic>FRI</italic> background. The experiments ran from August/September 2014 until spring 2015 and again from August/September 2016 to the spring of 2017, with sowing times adjusted to each site (earlier in the colder climates). In the first year, two plantings were performed in North Sweden, two weeks apart. The temperatures that the plants experienced are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>. We measured the levels of spliced and unspliced <italic>FLC</italic>, and mRNA levels of <italic>VIN3,</italic> to follow the progress of vernalization in the field. The transition to flowering (bolting) was assessed both in the field and by transfers to warm inductive conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Natural variation in different phases of <italic>FLC</italic> silencing in the field</title><p>Across all the genotypes we tested and all seven field experiments, as expected, <italic>FLC</italic> expression reduced over weeks in response to autumn and winter temperatures, and <italic>VIN3</italic> was upregulated. Previously, we had noted that in 2014–5 in Norwich, substantial <italic>VIN3</italic> upregulation did not occur until ~58 days after sowing, although temperature conditions were suitable for VIN3-independent <italic>FLC</italic> downregulation for most of this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>). In the following field season, this pattern occurred again, with <italic>VIN3</italic> upregulation delayed until 48 days after sowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018</xref>). For the Col <italic>FRI</italic> reference, we had found that we could fit two separate exponential decay curves to <italic>FLC</italic>; the first for the initial, slow, VIN3-independent phase and the second for the faster, VIN3-dependent phase of the downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>). Thus three features of the <italic>FLC</italic> profile contribute to the level of <italic>FLC</italic> at any time: firstly the ‘Starting level’ of <italic>FLC</italic> before vernalization, secondly the rate of downregulation in the initial VIN3-independent phase, and thirdly the rate of VIN3-dependent downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This pattern was consistent across the accessions and NILs, allowing us to investigate the effect of natural variation on different aspects of <italic>FLC</italic> regulation. The time of upregulation of <italic>VIN3</italic>, and thus the time of switching from the VIN3-independent to the VIN3-dependent shutdown, also affects <italic>FLC</italic> levels, but this was very similar between genotypes at the same site.</p><p>In Norwich 2014–5, the RV <italic>FLC</italic> accession Edi-0 (haplotype group RV1) behaved very similarly to Col <italic>FRI</italic> (RV2). In comparison, the SV accessions (Löv-1, Ull2-5, Bro1-6 and Var2-6) show higher levels of <italic>FLC</italic> throughout the winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ull2-5 started with similar levels of <italic>FLC</italic> as Col <italic>FRI</italic>, but slower rates of downregulation in both the VIN3-independent and VIN3-dependent phases generated higher levels of <italic>FLC</italic> throughout autumn and winter. For both Var2-6 and its NIL, an apparently slower VIN3-independent rate of downregulation contributed to a higher <italic>FLC</italic> level, although the difference in rate is not significant. The VIN3-dependent phase was also slower in Var2-6 and Löv-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In Sweden 2014–5, at both sites the VIN3-independent and -dependent phases occurred concurrently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>). There was little variation observed in the overall rate of <italic>FLC</italic> downregulation between genotypes, though the maximal <italic>VIN3</italic> induction was more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), with the fluctuations depending strongly on complex responses to the temperature profile, as expected from analysis of Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>SF2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, most of the natural variation in <italic>FLC</italic> levels throughout winter in Sweden was generated by differences in the early expression level. In North Sweden again both RV accessions had similar Starting levels whereas the SV Swedish accessions were higher to different degrees. However, in South Sweden Löv-1 started with similar levels to Col <italic>FRI</italic>.</p><p>In the first year of field experiments we observed that a high proportion of the <italic>FLC</italic> shutdown occurred early in autumn, and furthermore, a lot of the variation in total <italic>FLC</italic> between lines was during that early phase. To maximise this period, and to extend the time that the plants spent in warmer autumn conditions, so mimicing potential climate change effects, we sowed the second field experiment earlier. For the 2016–7 experiment, we sowed plants in North Sweden and Norwich two weeks earlier and South Sweden three weeks earlier than for the 2014–5 season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). The differences in daylight length due to this earlier sowing must be considered in direct comparisons between years, but the timing of both sowing dates was within the natural germination range. In North Sweden, this early sowing was followed by an usually warm autumn: September temperatures at the nearest weather station, Lungö, averaged 11.04°C between 1990–2016, whereas they were 12.60°C in 2016, the fourth highest year during that period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, 2020</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer">www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer</ext-link>).

However, the first stage of shutdown was still more rapid in North Sweden than in Norwich, despite higher average temperatures in North Sweden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), so that both VIN3-independent and VIN3-dependent phases had similar rates, resulting in the appearance of a single decline.

In Norwich, the flowering time difference between the NILs and Col <italic>FRI</italic> was small, and in Sweden not significant, suggesting that most of the variation seen between the accessions did not derive from the <italic>FLC</italic> haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, in 2016–7 we transferred plants from field conditions to heated, long-day conditions at different stages, and scored the length of time until floral buds were visible at the shoot apex (bolting). There was wide variation and substantial delay to bolting within the genotypes for plants transferred to the warm greenhouses early in autumn, at all sites, indicating that vernalization requirement had not been saturated at this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C,E</xref>). Indeed, in both Swedish sites many plants did not flower within the experimental time (136 days after transfer for South, and 104 days for the North) when transferred 25 days after sowing. Some genotypes (particularly Löv-1) required more than 46 days in the field before most individuals were competent to flower in warm, long-day conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). There was also clear variation between genotypes in their time to flowering in the earlier transfers. However, as winter progressed, time to bolt after transfer reduced quantitatively and became more uniform for plants within and between each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D,F</xref>), although vernalization saturated at different rates in different genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). All accessions and NILs bolted broadly synchronously and rapidly after removal on 21st December in Norwich, in North Sweden NILs and accessions were almost synchronous by 24th November, in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>), and in South Sweden FRI-containing lines were broadly synchronous by the last transfer on 17th December (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>).

However, in the field in North Sweden 2017 silique production occurred only after winter, after saturation of vernalization requirement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

However, in 2014–5, winter conditions in Norwich generated a subtly different response to those in Sweden, activating the VIN3-independent transcriptional shutdown before the VIN3-dependent epigenetic pathway (delay in <italic>VIN3</italic> onset and slow then fast shutdown of <italic>FLC</italic> in Norwich, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the following season, this pattern was triggered again, not only in Norwich, but also in North Sweden, implying that this is a common occurrence that plants must adjust to across climates, although with different frequencies at different locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We find that variation in <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA levels in both accessions and NILs is largely due to differences in both the starting <italic>FLC</italic> level and the VIN3-independent rate of shutdown (collectively called autumnal expression), which vary widely between accessions but not between field sites or years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This variation in rate of response, as well as absolute levels of <italic>FLC,</italic> partly explains why <italic>FLC</italic> levels measured at any one time may not correlate with the final flowering time phenotype in different accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In Norwich, we investigated the mechanisms of the responses.

However, the reduced response of the <italic>fve</italic> mutants in the VIN3-independent phase, though not significant in each year, may be worth further investigation, as FVE has been implicated in intermittent cold-sensing through histone deacetylation at <italic>FLC,</italic> independently of vernalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jung et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>All three factors that set <italic>FLC</italic> levels in the field (starting levels, VIN3-independent and VIN3-dependent phases) require chromatin modifiers for their correct function. The VIN3-independent phase involves chromatin-modifier regulation of transcription, with the VIN3-dependent phase using a similar set of modifiers. These chromatin regulators are rarely found in genome-wide-association studies for flowering time, likely because their alteration would have pleiotropic effects. In the natural accessions we find that the VIN3-dependent (epigenetic) phase is indeed the least variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Given the intricate regulation of <italic>VIN3</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018</xref>), identifying the source of this difference will require detailed investigation.</p><p>The importance of <italic>FLC</italic> variation in adaptation for natural populations is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Méndez-Vigo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sánchez-Bermejo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dittmar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ågren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloomer and Dean, 2017</xref>). However, we found that even in a challengingly warm year, vernalization requirement saturated before midwinter across three climates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This response had been seen previously in North Sweden in the locally-adapted Löv-1 accession as a reaction to the extreme winters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>). However, we find that this is a general response in all our tested accessions. The principle exceptions were the <italic>vin3</italic> and <italic>vrn</italic> mutants, which had notably delayed flowering in both years at the Norwich site. The consequences of incomplete vernalization are severe – in our 2016–7 transfer experiments this led to delayed flowering and reduced fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>), and several field experiments have found a general trend towards earlier flowering promoting fitness in environments with warmer winters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ågrena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fournier-Level et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dittmar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ågren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Exposito-Alonso et al., 2018</xref>). In 2014–5, the high synchronicity of flowering in all the accessions and NILs after winter and the fact that flowering aligned with spring across our field sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggests that in most plants vernalization has adapted to reduce the delaying effect of <italic>FLC</italic> on flowering as early as possible.</p><p>Nevertheless, we observed that the Swedish, cold-winter-adapted accessions and <italic>FLC</italic> haplotypes associated with slow vernalization expressed the highest <italic>FLC</italic> levels throughout autumn and early winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In North Sweden in 2016–7, we captured behaviour for a warmer growing season that revealed an adaptive role for these high <italic>FLC</italic> expression levels. There was a relatively warm September that year with a long period with less precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, 2020</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer">www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer</ext-link>), which required us to water the plants to avoid drought stress. This, in combination with the earlier sowing (warmer and longer days) meant that the equivalent period of growing time for the plants (relative to their germination time) was more inductive to growth and flowering. This allowed us to capture a different behaviour. Plants are exposed to both types of the years we recorded, since the timing of both sowing dates was within the natural germination range, although in natural environments seed dormancy has a strong influence on phenology and is highly responsive to temperature and microclimate, and affected by <italic>FLC</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerdaffrec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marcer et al., 2018</xref>). In our experiments, in plants with a haplotype characteristic of a slow-vernalizing accession, including the locally-adapted Swedish accessions, the higher level of <italic>FLC</italic> expression protected against precocious flowering and its consequent reduced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These rare, but highly selective occurrences, may play a role in local adaptation, although we do not know the reason behind the high mortality in this year. However, that the effects of these haplotypes are only revealed occasionally is a logical consequence of the fact that the flowering time genes can have strong or weak effects depending on the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burghardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fournier-Level et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>FLC</italic> also controls fecundity as well as survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ågrena et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref> found that <italic>FLC</italic> haplotypes from SV accessions produced lower seed weight compared to those from RV accessions in non-saturating vernalization conditions, though the mechanism for this effect is unknown. In the field, silique production is closely linked to branch production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). In Arabidopsis, saturation of vernalization requirement is known to increase flowering branch production, particularly rosette branch production, and this effect is linked to <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, <italic>FLC</italic> levels in autumn did not correlate with branch production in spring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2H</xref>), and in Norwich 2014–5, there was little variation in branch production. However, we found that under the conditions in the field in North Sweden, branch production was negatively related to a factor we named ‘<italic>FLC</italic> post-vern’, which encoded the relationship between <italic>FLC</italic> levels and subsequent flowering in warm controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Variation in this factor probably derives from regulatory differences at <italic>FLC</italic> post-cold, such as the reactivation phenotype of the Löv-1 <italic>FLC</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shindo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qüesta et al., 2020</xref>), allowing <italic>FLC</italic> repression of flowering to saturate at the shoot apical and axillary meristems at different rates, a phenomenon that occurs in the perennial relative <italic>Arabis alpina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lazaro et al., 2018</xref>). Why the field conditions in Sweden, but not Norwich, revealed this effect is not yet clear.</p><p>In summary, our detailed analysis of the different phases of <italic>FLC</italic> silencing through winters in distinct climates, over multiple years, has shed light on adaptive aspects of the vernalization mechanism. Autumnal <italic>FLC</italic> expression, made up from <italic>FLC</italic> starting levels and early phases of <italic>FLC</italic> silencing, is the major determinant for variation in <italic>FLC</italic> levels during vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>FLC</italic> downregulation aligns flowering response to spring and non-coding variation affects this alignment in different climatic conditions and year-on-year fluctuations in natural temperature profiles. In a changing climate, understanding the complex genotype-by- environment interactions that govern timing mechanisms will become ever more important.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Sources of previously described mutant lines and transgenics are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

Briefly, seeds were stratified at 4°C for three days.

The experiment site in the North was at Ramsta (62° 50.988´N, 18° 11.570´E), and in the South at Ullstorp (56° 06.6721´N, 13° 94.4655´E). Expression sample-sets were randomised in three blocks.

major role in determining flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in response to vernalization. In this manuscript, the authors analysed <italic>FLC</italic> silencing in natural variants throughout winter in three field sites over multiple years, and revealed that <italic>FLC</italic> starting levels and early phases of its silencing are the major determinants underlying the vernalization response. These findings suggest that the initial expression of <italic>FLC</italic> in natural variants is important for the adaption of vernalization response to natural fluctuating temperature profiles.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Natural variation in autumn <italic>FLC</italic> levels, rather than epigenetic silencing, aligns vernalization to different climates&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hao Yu as the Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sureshkumar Balasubramanian (Reviewer #1); Ilha Lee (Reviewer #2); Xavier Picó (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors suggest that <italic>FLC</italic> starting levels and early phases of its silencing are the major variables underlying the vernalization response via analysing <italic>FLC</italic> silencing in natural variants throughout winter in three field sites (Norwich, Northern Sweden, Southern Sweden).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While there was a common interest about the topic and the relevant findings, some major concerns on the description of methodologies and the interpretation of results as listed below need to be addressed to support the conclusion.</p><p>1) The Introduction could be further improved with more attractive description of the background and a working hypothesis to be uniquely tested by expression data from field settings in this study.</p><p>2) The definition of &quot;aligning vernalization response to different climatic conditions&quot; is unclear.

The authors use Col FRI in Norwich condition to show that there are 3 aspects of the regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> expression. Initial levels, initial decay in <italic>FLC</italic> expression prior to the induction of <italic>VIN3</italic> and later stages of decay in <italic>FLC</italic> expression that is <italic>VIN3</italic> dependent. The authors argue that primarily the initial levels of <italic>FLC</italic> &quot;aligns vernalization to different climatic conditions&quot;.

For example, Table 1 shows the m-value for Col to be 486 and Col FRI to be 36.5 (Norwich). Both genotypes have the same <italic>FLC</italic> allele. It is unclear to me how meaningful the conclusions of the m-value of <italic>FLC</italic> alleles are if the same allele has such different values?

It is very difficult and time-consuming research to use natural environments with several accessions and mutants of Arabidopsis. In addition, to get some realistic idea about the evolutionary adaptive mechanism, we have to analyze the phenotypic response to natural environments. Thus, I think the work presented here is very useful information to not only plant scientists but also to the general readers. So, basically I recommend accepting this paper.</p><p>But I would like to suggest major revision as below. In that way, I think the manuscript will be easier to read. Otherwise, it will be too difficult to understand.</p><p>The major problem with this manuscript is the definition of the words.</p><p>For example, I could not understand the exact meaning of 'aligning vernalization response'. Could it be evolutionary fitness of vernalization? If it is, I think the authors should explain what kinds of phenotype are involved in the fitness (survival rate or seed number). Thus, I could not understand which data support the author's suggestion, 'starting <italic>FLC</italic> levels is critical for aligning vernalization to different climates'. I hope the manuscript revised to make it clear that how fitness and phenotypes of each accession are connected to the aligning vern.</p><p>Also, the meaning of <italic>FLC</italic>-post-vern value (m) should be clearly defined. I think this value is quite important to understand the whole manuscript. The value m does not look like <italic>FLC</italic> level right before transfer to warm temperature. As shown in Table 1, Col has much higher value than Col FRI (13 times higher). Thus, I feel there must be some equation to get the value and it must be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I have reviewed the manuscript entitled &quot;Natural variation in autumn <italic>FLC</italic> levels, rather than epigenetic silencing, aligns vernalization to different climates&quot; by Hepworth et al. This is an interesting manuscript dealing with an important topic in plant biology: the genetic mechanisms underlying flowering time, the most important fitness-related life-cycle trait in plants. Given the solid knowledge in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> on the topic, the authors designed and carried out an array of experiments with various materials to address the role and interplay of <italic>FLC</italic> and <italic>VIN3</italic> genes in flowering time. The most remarkable and strongest aspect of this study has to do with the field experiments conducted over several years, which in my opinion is the right scenario to address all study questions in plant evolutionary genetics. Although I have enjoyed the manuscript, some conclusions seem not to be supported by the results or read too speculative. In addition, I consider that some methodological issues also require some clarification because they are affecting the interpretation of the results. Below I go through all my major concerns:</p><p>1) The Introduction could be developed further and make it more attractive to specialized and non-specialized readers. As it is, it reads too general and I do not understand why. It seems that the major motivation of this study is that &quot;the importance of cis <italic>FLC</italic> polymorphism in delivering the different phases of <italic>FLC</italic> silencing in different climates (is) unknown&quot;. Given the extensive knowledge on the study system by the co-authors and the whole research community, this Introduction deserves a more extended development of the theoretical background, and most importantly, a working hypothesis to be put to the test. In other words, be ambitious (conceptually speaking) because this study deserves it. In addition, expression data from natural field settings is still rare in the literature, which should also be highlighted as a promising avenue to increase and improve our knowledge on the genetic mechanisms underlying flowering time.</p><p>2) It is said that one of the study years was unusually warm (Introduction and elsewhere). However, the reader does not know how unusual that year was in comparison with the historical weather records at the experimental facilities. Given that 10 of the hottest years ever recorded across the planet have been documented in the last 12-15 years, it is clear that we are experiencing an unstoppable warming (on top of many other evidences). The odds of having &quot;unusual years&quot; are high from now on. In any case, the authors could show deviances from historical weather records in a very simple manner to reinforce their point. I understand that weather data obtained from loggers are not from official weather data, but data from local meteorological stations for the study years could be compared to historical weather records (means and deviances). Actually, differences between data loggers and meteorological stations inform about micro-environmental variation at the experimental facilities, which could also be the case here.</p><p>3) The authors confound weather (or environment) by climate (Introduction and elsewhere). The authors are not comparing <italic>FLC</italic> expression between temperate and tropical climates, but across different weather or environmental conditions represented by the three experimental facilities (all of them within the same climate type). Please check it out throughout the text.</p><p>4) I am confused about the different sowing and moving (to field sites) dates for each experiment (subsection “Field experiments”). Ideally, the comparison among sites or years should be based on experiments established at the same time to avoid undesirable sources of variation, such as differences in environmental conditions (even in a period of weeks) and day length. I cannot assess how this problem affected the results because plants from different sites and years have been exposed to different environmental conditions during their development due to variation in sowing and moving dates (particularly for all the winter experiments). However, given one of the main results of this study (the uniform vernalisation response across haplotypes in different years and environments) the problems posed by this flaw were probably mitigated (I am speculating here). In any case and for the sake of clarity, the authors should explain the reasons of such sowing and moving schedule and the problems that such variability may cause on this sort of experiments.</p><p>5) My other major concern about this work is the treatment of fitness as a concept. The authors clearly state that survival and fecundity are the two major fitness components (subsection “Variation at <italic>FLC</italic> affects fitness in the field through branching and silique number”), the two traits are treated and analyzed separately. In my opinion, the authors have all the data to estimate fitness as the product between such two components, that is, survival (survival to seed set) by fecundity (number of fruits per plant). Expressions like &quot;… silique production, and hence fitness, in surviving plants.…&quot; should be avoided because they are not correct. In line with this, I consider branching as a secondary parameter that increases fruit fecundity. Somehow, the authors pay more attention to branching pattern than to survival throughout the manuscript (I do see the effects of <italic>FLC</italic> on it though). In any case, this work could gain clarity and consistency if the authors focus on how the interesting parameters found (<italic>FLC</italic> starting levels to name a relevant one) affect fitness. Then they will have the means to infer the evolutionary implications (in terms of local adaptation) of their results.</p><p>6) In relation to the previous point, I found that conclusions on the adaptive variation value of the results are speculative throughout the text, mainly because fitness has not been tackled appropriately. For example, the following sentence is quite obscure and hard to follow: &quot;What we describe as the starting level was measured after some days in the field, so it is not equivalent to a non-vernalized control. Some <italic>FLC</italic> shutdown, most likely <italic>VIN3</italic>-independent, will have occurred at that time. Therefore, it is likely that the combination of these two determinants of <italic>FLC</italic> levels early in the field (starting levels, <italic>VIN3</italic>-independent shutdown) provides most of the potentially adaptive variation&quot;. I simply cannot see how the authors reach this conclusion, which deserves some work disentangling the effects of FLV and VIN-3 variation on fitness. There are further examples about this and overall the authors should tone-down the evolutionary implications of their results (see also &quot;… our detailed analysis of the different phases of <italic>FLC</italic> silencing through winters in distinct climates, over multiple years, has given a clear picture of the mechanistic basis of adaptation in vernalization response”).</p><p>7) Finally, there are many style issues, particularly in the graphical material. For example, panels in Figure 1 should be lined up and have the same size and scale. Overall, I would increase symbol size to identify all haplotypes within panels and across figures or change the way to indicate that. Coefficients of variation are normally given as percentages. Letter size and type varies among figures. Chose the format (number of digits) to present data and be consistent (see the huge heterogeneity in Table 1). Crosses in Figure 6 are expected to be means (SE).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57671.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While there was a common interest about the topic and the relevant findings, some major concerns on the description of methodologies and the interpretation of results as listed below need to be addressed to support the conclusion.</p><p>1) The Introduction could be further improved with more attractive description of the background and a working hypothesis to be uniquely tested by expression data from field settings in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for this comment.

We have modified the manuscript to make this assumption clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, what is the coefficient of variation at final FLC levels? I am presuming these levels differ to between genotypes. Is this distinctly different from CoV of initial FLC levels?</p></disp-quote><p>Prof. Balasubramanian raises an interesting and complex point. There are two obvious candidates for final <italic>FLC</italic> level – the level in spring, and the threshold that allows flowering in any given context. In the 2014-15 experiment, <italic>FLC</italic> levels in spring did not correlate with flowering time, likely because they were far below the point at which <italic>FLC</italic> had a detectable effect on flowering. We have now made this point in section “High autumnal FLC reduces precocious flowering in a warm autumn”.</p><p>Threshold is also difficult as figures Figure 6G and H shows that for almost all plants (except Lov1 and Var accessions) <italic>FLC</italic> levels are low enough to only delay, rather than totally prevent, flowering. Nevertheless, the <italic>FLC</italic> effects are quantitative over most of the range of expression during autumn. We therefore concentrated on autumn <italic>FLC</italic> dynamics, as at this time <italic>FLC</italic> was detectably delaying flowering in the transfer experiments, Figure 6, and in the field Figure 7. We have modified the text to make this clearer.</p><p>(N.B. in N Sweden 2016, we note that in the week preceding flowering, regardless of whether this was before or after winter, maximum daily temperatures were at least 15.5 and averaged 19.8°C, even though overall average daily temperatures were very cold (&lt;10°C), strongly suggesting limitation by the ambient temperature pathway in parallel with that of the <italic>FLC</italic> effects, but that only part of the day need reach these temperatures to remove FLM/SVP repression).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the data it appears the second aspect (VIN3-independent shut down) is primarily seen in Norwich climate and not much in other sites.

In previous work (Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018) we showed that for Col <italic>FRI</italic> the temperature profile of these field studies could be used to predict <italic>VIN3</italic> expression using a mathematical model. Since the <italic>VIN3</italic> measurements follow similar patterns of response between the different genotypes at the same site (although with different maxima and minima), we would conclude the same complexity for the natural accessions and mutants presented in the current work.

Both genotypes have the same FLC allele. It is unclear to me how meaningful the conclusions of the m-value of FLC alleles are if the same allele has such different values?

Ideally, the comparison among sites or years should be based on experiments established at the same time to avoid undesirable sources of variation, such as differences in environmental conditions (even in a period of weeks) and day length.

However, given one of the main results of this study (the uniform vernalisation response across haplotypes in different years and environments) the problems posed by this flaw were probably mitigated (I am speculating here).

The sowing and moving schedule in Sweden was used because of the difficulty of sowing directly into the field, and to ensure sufficient germination. A note has been made in the Materials and methods to explain this. For the different germination dates, reasons have been given in the main text, and a paragraph discussing this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) My other major concern about this work is the treatment of fitness as a concept. The authors clearly state that survival and fecundity are the two major fitness components (subsection “Variation at FLC affects fitness in the field through branching and silique number”), the two traits are treated and analyzed separately. In my opinion, the authors have all the data to estimate fitness as the product between such two components, that is, survival (survival to seed set) by fecundity (number of fruits per plant). Expressions like &quot;… silique production, and hence fitness, in surviving plants.…&quot; should be avoided because they are not correct. In line with this, I consider branching as a secondary parameter that increases fruit fecundity. Somehow, the authors pay more attention to branching pattern than to survival throughout the manuscript (I do see the effects of FLC on it though). In any case, this work could gain clarity and consistency if the authors focus on how the interesting parameters found (FLC starting levels to name a relevant one) affect fitness. Then they will have the means to infer the evolutionary implications (in terms of local adaptation) of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>A previous version of this manuscript had investigated the effect of delayed flowering on mortality in our North Sweden transfers in more explicit detail, but the Editor and other reviewers suggested removing it, particularly as we do not know the cause of death of these plants (a point we have now added to the Discussion). Hence, we do not concentrate too much on <italic>FLC</italic> effects on survival. We have reduced the section on branching in the Discussion, and removed it from the Abstract. Within the final section, we have changed the language to make it clear when we are discussing individual plant fitness versus genotype fitness, and attempted to convey better how we have brought these elements together. We have changed the problematic sentence to:</p><p>“In the field, silique production is closely linked to branch production”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In relation to the previous point, I found that conclusions on the adaptive variation value of the results are speculative throughout the text, mainly because fitness has not been tackled appropriately. For example, the following sentence is quite obscure and hard to follow: &quot;What we describe as the starting level was measured after some days in the field, so it is not equivalent to a non-vernalized control.

Therefore, it is likely that the combination of these two determinants of FLC levels early in the field (starting levels, VIN3-independent shutdown) provides most of the potentially adaptive variation&quot;. I simply cannot see how the authors reach this conclusion, which deserves some work disentangling the effects of FLV and VIN-3 variation on fitness.</p></disp-quote><p>This was poorly phrased, we were not intending to imply an effect on fitness in this section, just highlighting that these metrics result in the different levels of <italic>FLC</italic> between the different accessions, and that if different levels of <italic>FLC</italic> have a fitness effect (which we investigate later) then these are the mechanisms that produce this variation.
