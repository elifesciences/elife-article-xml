Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this site-clearance mechanism. However, the physiological significance of this mechanism at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this in a physiologically optimized condition using action potential evoked EPSCs at fast calyx synapse and relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapse, in post-hearing mice brain slices at 37°C and in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at the hippocampal synapse. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx but had no effect at the hippocampal synapse. At the fast calyx synapse, block of endocytosis or scaffold protein activity significantly enhanced synaptic depression as early as 10 ms after the stimulation onset. Unlike previous reports, neither endocytic blockers nor scaffold protein inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that the release-site clearance by endocytosis can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment at both fast and slow synapses, whereas the presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>release site-clearance</kwd><kwd>presynaptic scaffold mechanism</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle replenishment</kwd><kwd>physiological condition</kwd><kwd>calyx of Held synapse</kwd><kwd>hippocampal CA1 synapse</kwd><kwd>synaptic depression</kwd><kwd>synaptic facilitation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004199</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K06445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahapatra</surname><given-names>Satyajit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physiologically, vesicle replenishment at the fast calyx synapse requires both fast-endocytosis and scaffold machinery to support rapid neurotransmission, whereas at the slow hippocampal CA1 synapse only endocytosis is necessary.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical synaptic transmission depends upon fusion of transmitter-filled vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. At presynaptic terminals, there are a limited number of vesicular release sites, which can become refractory while discharged vesicles are remaining at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Katz, 1993</xref>), inhibiting subsequent vesicle fusion. Following inactivation of the temperature-sensitive endocytic protein dynamin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant <italic>Shibire</italic>, short-term depression (STD) of neuromuscular synaptic currents evoked by action potentials (APs) are enhanced within 20 ms from the stimulation onset at 33°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that endocytosis plays a significant role in rapid release site-clearance in addition to its well-established role in vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). The enhancement of STD by blocking endocytosis was reproduced at the calyx of Held in slices from rodent brainstem, associated with a pronounced prolongation in the recovery from STD of EPSCs evoked by paired command pulses under voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescence imaging with synaptopHluorin at cultured hippocampal synapses also showed that endocytic blockers, but not the vesicle acidification blockers, enhance steady state depression of exocytosis induced by high-frequency stimulation, suggesting slow clearance of vesicular component from release-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hua et al., 2013</xref>). Also, in cell culture studies, genetic ablation of the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2μ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jung et al., 2015</xref>), synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rajappa et al., 2016</xref>), or the secretory carrier membrane protein SCAMP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2018</xref>) enhances STD.</p><p>However, it remains open whether the endocytosis-dependent release site-clearance phenomenon reported at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>) plays a physiological role at mammalian central synapses.</p><p>The presynaptic scaffold protein intersectin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which activates the Rho-GTPase CDC42, thereby regulating the filamentous (F) actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marie et al., 2004</xref>). At the calyx of Held in slices from pre-hearing rodents, genetic ablation of intersectin 1 or pharmacological block of CDC42 abolishes the fast component of the rate of recovery from STD of EPSCs evoked by a pair of square pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakaba et al., 2013</xref>). They suggest that the scaffold protein cascade, comprising intersectin, CDC42, and F-actin, contributes to rapid vesicle replenishment, possibly through release site-clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jäpel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Like the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance mechanism, its physiological significance at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. To address these issues, we evoked EPSCs by afferent fiber stimulations in post-hearing (P13-15) mice brain slices, without presynaptic intracellular perturbation, at brainstem calyces of Held and hippocampal CA1 synapses at physiological temperature (PT, 37°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanchez-Alavez et al., 2011</xref>) and in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in reference to rodent CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones and Keep, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silver and Erecińska, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Inglebert et al., 2020</xref>). The post-hearing calyx of Held is a fast-signaling auditory relay synapse that can respond to inputs up to 500 Hz without failure in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>) and displays STD during repetitive stimulation. In contrast, the hippocampal synapse from Schaffer collaterals (SCs) to pyramidal cells (PCs) in the CA1 area is a relatively slow synapse that starts to fail transmission already at 40 Hz in slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Combe et al., 2018</xref>) and at 37°C and in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], short-term facilitation masks depression. At these synapses, we tested the effect of blocking endocytosis or scaffold protein cascade activity on EPSCs evoked by repetitive afferent fiber stimulations (30x) at different frequencies. These experiments indicated that the endocytosis-driven site-clearance mechanism activity-dependently supports vesicle replenishment, thereby counteracting synaptic depression at brainstem calyceal synapses and boosting synaptic facilitation at hippocampal CA1 synapses. In contrast, the vesicle replenishing role of the scaffold mechanism is activity and endocytosis independent and restricted to fast calyceal synapses, where it co-operates with the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance mechanism to upregulate synaptic strength, thereby maintaining the high-fidelity fast neurotransmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Potency of endocytic blockers on slow and fast endocytosis at the calyx of Held</title><p>To clarify physiological roles of endocytosis in high-frequency synaptic transmission, we first examined the effect of different endocytic inhibitors on fast and slow endocytosis, using presynaptic membrane capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>) at post-hearing calyces of Held (P13-15) at PT (37°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</xref>).

Thus, the presynaptic scaffold cascade proteins F-actin or CDC42 unlikely plays a regulatory role on short-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal synapses.

This enhancement of synaptic depression was significant already at the 2nd EPSC (10 ms) after the stimulation onset and proceeded bi-exponentially with a fast (5–6 ms) and slow (24–35 ms) time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These slow time constants were comparable to control time constant (37 ms) undergoing mono-exponential depression. Thus, the depression-counteracting effect of endocytosis was restricted to the early epoch of high-frequency transmission when many vesicle residues occupy the release sites. As number of vesicles undergoing exocytosis during repetitive stimulation gradually reduces, the site-clearance likely becomes less demanding.</p><p>At the calyx of Held, Dynasore or Pitstop-2 blocked both fast and slow endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The fast endocytosis is characterized with a rate of ~350 fF/s, which was slowed by endocytic blockers to ~150 fF/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This reduction of endocytic rate (200 fF/s) corresponds to 2.54 vesicles/ms (1 fF = 12.7 vesicles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; 200 fF/s x 12.7 vesicles x 1/1000ms). Since the mean amplitude of miniature EPSCs, representing a single vesicle response, was ~55 pA in 1.3 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] at PT (data not shown), endocytic block is estimated to reduce EPSC amplitude by ~1.4 nA in 10 ms (2.54 vesicles/ms x 55 pA x 10 ms x 1/1000 nA). This is close to the average amplitude difference between control and endocytic blockers (1.6 nA) at the 2nd EPSC (10 ms after the 1st EPSC) under 100 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, during high-frequency transmission, the site-clearance by fast endocytosis can fully compensate the initial strong depression. However, the rate of slow endocytosis (29 fF/s) is ~10 times slower than fast endocytosis (250–350 fF/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), therefore slow endocytosis unlikely contributes to the millisecond-order site-clearance. However, without slow endocytosis, the vesicular membrane remaining after spontaneous exocytosis would accumulate and congest release sites. Thus, slow endocytosis may play a house-keeping role in release site-clearance.</p><p>At the calyx of Held, scaffold protein inhibitors significantly enhanced the early phase of synaptic depression (starting at the 2nd stimulation at 100 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B1</xref>) like endocytic blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), despite that they do not block endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to the endocytic blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the STD-enhancing effect of scaffold protein inhibitors was stronger and independent of stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Co-application of endocytic and scaffold protein cascade inhibitors revealed that the synaptic strengthening effects of endocytosis and scaffold machinery are complementary rather than additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results together suggest that fast endocytosis quickly clears vesicle residues, whereas scaffold machinery simultaneously mobilizes and replenishes transmitter-filled vesicles to release sites during high-frequency transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Through these combinatory mechanisms, synaptic strength and high-fidelity neurotransmission (up to 500 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sonntag et al., 2009</xref>) can be maintained at fast synapses such as the calyx of Held auditory relay synapse.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical vesicle replenishment scheme by endocytosis and scaffold-machineries during repetitive transmission at fast calyx and slow hippocampal CA1 synapses.</title><p>During high-frequency transmission, endocytosis driven site-clearance allows activity-dependent replenishment of new vesicles to release sites.

This endocytosis driven synaptic strengthening function augments synaptic facilitation at slow-plastic synapses like hippocampal CA1 synapses that exhibit long-term plasticity, thereby boosting its induction capability for memory formation. Whereas, the presynaptic scaffold machinery plays a powerful direct vesicle replenishment role, independent of endocytosis and activity, thereby rapidly translocating new vesicles to open release sites including those just opened by endocytic site-clearance. This scaffold function is specifically devoted to fast synapses, with high release probability but not to slow synapses, where vesicle depletion is minimal due to low release probability.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90497-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>At hippocampal CA1 synapses the roles of endocytosis and scaffold machineries in fast vesicle replenishment were different from those at the calyx of Held. Under physiological conditions in slices, short-term plasticity at hippocampal CA1 synapses was facilitatory, in contrast to depression at calyceal synapses. Endocytic blockers attenuated the synaptic facilitation, suggesting that endocytosis boosts synaptic facilitation at this synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since synaptic strength at facilitatory synapses is determined by a sum of facilitation and depression mechanisms, attenuation of synaptic depression by endocytosis can boost synaptic facilitation. At hippocampal excitatory synapses, short-term increase in glutamate release induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory transmission. Thus, from physiological viewpoints, endocytosis-dependent site clearance may play a critical role in the induction of LTP underlying memory formation.</p><p>In clear contrast to fast calyceal synapses, the scaffold protein inhibitor ML141 or Latrunculin B had no effect on EPSC facilitation at relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This was somewhat unexpected since in hippocampal culture Latrunculin-A blocks ultra-fast endocytosis (UFE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>), which occurs preferentially at physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>). Since Latrunculin A and B are equipotent in enhancing STD at calyceal synapses in 1.3 mM [Ca <sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at PT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), the physiological role of UFE in hippocampal synaptic transmission remains unclear. Latrunculin-B reportedly inhibits vesicular docking by limiting replacement pool filling during high-frequency inputs at parallel fiber (PF)-molecular layer interneuron synapses in cerebellar slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). This synapse is adapted to respond to high-frequency inputs, like other cerebellar synapses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the actin-dependent scaffold-machinery operates for rapid vesicular replenishment predominantly at fast synapses, whereas it is non-functional at relatively slow synapses. In contrast, the endocytosis-dependent site-clearance mechanism seems to be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicular replenishment among fast and slow mammalian central synapses.</p></sec><sec

id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan and animal experiment regulations at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University. C57BL/6J mice of either sex after hearing onset (postnatal day 13–15) were used for the experiment and animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Slice preparation (brainstem and hippocampal) and electrophysiology</title><p>Following decapitation of C57BL/6J mice under isoflurane anesthesia, brains were isolated and transverse slices (200 μm thick) containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) or parasagittal slices (300 μm) containing the hippocampus were cut using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, see below) with reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM) and increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> (2.9 mM) concentrations and with NaCl replaced by 200 mM sucrose. Slices were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in standard aCSF containing (in mM); 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 or 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 3 myo-inositol, 2 sodium pyruvate, and 0.4 sodium ascorbate (pH 7.3–7.4 when bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 285–290 mOsm). Unless otherwise noted, EPSCs were recorded in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] aCSF at 37°C. During recording, a brain slice in a temperature-controlled chamber (RC-26GLP, PM-1; Warner instruments) was continuously perfused with aCSF solutions without (control) or with the pharmacological blockers using a peristaltic pump (5–6 µl/s). Recordings with or without the blockers were made from separate cells in different slices from a minimum of 3–4 animals for each set of experiment. In experiments at PT, solutions kept in a water bath (37°C) and passed through an in-line heater (SH-27B, Warner instruments) placed immediately before the recording chamber and maintained at 37°C (±0.2°C) by a controller (TC-344C, Warner instruments). For RT experiments, no heating was used, and the temperature was within 22–24°C. Recordings in the presence of pharmacological blockers were made within 10–60 min of drug application and for control experiments a slice was kept in the recording chamber no longer than 1 hr.</p><p>Whole-cell recordings were made using a patch-clamp amplifier (EPC 10 USB, HEKA Elektronik, Germany) from the calyx of Held presynaptic terminals, postsynaptic MNTB principal neurons, or hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons visually identified with a 60X water immersion objective (LUMPlanFL, Olympus) attached to an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus, Japan). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 50 kHz using Patchmaster software (for EPC 10 USB) after online filtering at 5 kHz. The patch pipettes were pulled using a vertical puller (PIP6, HEKA) and had a resistance of 3–4 MΩ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Membrane capacitance recordings from presynaptic calyx terminal (at PT)</title><p>The patch pipettes for presynaptic capacitance recording were wax coated to reduce stray capacitance and had a series resistance of 6–15 MΩ, which was compensated by up to 60% for its final value to be 6 MΩ. To isolate presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (I<sub>Ca</sub>) during membrane capacitance measurements (C<sub>m</sub>), tetrodotoxin (1 µM) and tetra-ethyl-ammonium chloride (TEA, 5 mM) were routinely added to block Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, respectively. Calyx terminals were voltage clamped at a holding potential of –70 mV and a sine wave (peak to peak = 60 mV at 1 kHz) was applied. A single pulse (5 ms) or a train of 20 ms pulses (15 stimuli at 1 Hz or 10 stimuli at 10 Hz) to +10 mV were given to induce slow, fast-accelerating, and fast endocytosis. The capacitance trace within 450 ms after the stimulation pulse was excluded from analysis to avoid capacitance artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). The exocytic capacitance jump (∆C<sub>m</sub>) in response to a stimulation pulse was measured as difference between baseline and mean C<sub>m</sub> at 450–460 ms after the stimulation pulse. The endocytic rate was measured from the C<sub>m</sub> decay phase 0.45–5.45 s from the end of 5 ms stimulation pulse, 0.45–0.95 s for 1 Hz train stimulation and 0.45–1.45 s after the last (10<sup>th</sup>) pulse for 10 Hz train stimulation. The average C<sub>m</sub> traces were calculated from individual C<sub>m</sub> traces, and error bars were analyzed from resampled individual C<sub>m</sub> traces in low frequency for clarity (every 10 ms for 10 Hz train stimulation and every 20 ms for both 5 ms single and 1 Hz train stimulations).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>EPSC recordings from brainstem and hippocampus</title><p>For EPSC recordings, brainstem MNTB principal neurons or hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were voltage-clamped at the holding potential of –80 mV. To evoke EPSCs, a bipolar electrode was placed on afferent fibers between MNTB and midline in brainstem slices or on the Schaffer collateral fibers in the stratum radiatum near the CA1 border in hippocampal slices.</p><p>The patch pipettes had a series resistance of 5–15 MΩ (less than 10 MΩ in most cells) that was compensated up to 80% for a final value of ~3 MW for EPSC recording from MNTB neurons. For EPSC recording from hippocampal pyramidal cells, no compensation was made, and capacitance artifacts were manually corrected. Stimulation pulses were applied through an isolator (Model 2100, A-M Systems) controlled by EPC10 amplifier (HEKA).</p><p>During EPSC recordings, strychnine-HCl (Sigma, 2 µM), bicuculline-methiodide (Sigma, 10 µM) and D-(-)–2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5, Tocris, 50 µM) were added to isolate AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. In some experiments, to minimize AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization, kynurenic acid (Sigma, 1 mM) was added to aCSF. Unless otherwise specified, the internal pipette solution for presynaptic capacitance measurements contained (in mM): 125 Cs gluconate, 10 HEPES, 20 TEA-Cl, 5 sodium phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP and 0.5 EGTA (pH 7.2–7.3, adjusted with CsOH, adjusted to 305–315 mOsm by varying Cs-gluconate concentration). For EPSC recording, the internal pipette solution contained QX-314 bromide (2 mM) and EGTA, either 5 mM (for MNTB cells) or 0.5 mM (for pyramidal cells), but otherwise identical to the presynaptic pipette solution. Dynasore (100 µM), Pitstop-2 (25 µM), ML 141 (10 µM), Folimycin (also known as Concanamycin A; 67 nM), Latrunculin-A (20 µM), Latrunculin B (15 µM), and Bafilomycin A1 (5 µM) were dissolved in DMSO (final concentration 0.1%, except for Latrunculin-A, 0.2%). Since Latrunculin A, Latrunculin-B and Folimycin are light sensitive, precautions were taken to minimize light exposure during handling and recording. Dynamin 1 proline-rich domain (PRD) peptide (sequence: PQVPSRPNRAP; GenScript) was dissolved in presynaptic pipette solution (1 mM). Membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) recordings in the presence of Dyn-1 PRD peptide were initiated 4–5 min after whole-cell membrane rupture to allow its time of diffusion inside presynaptic terminals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Experiments were designed as population study using different cells from separate brain slices under control and drug treatment, rather than on a same cell before and after the drug exposure. All data were analyzed using IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics) and Microsoft Excel. All values are given as mean ± SEM. The significance of effects of multiple drug applications were determined by one-way ANOVA, keeping the significance level set at p&lt;0.05, denoted with asterisks (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001). Once found to be significantly different, each drug effect was compared with the control using Student’s t-test with Bonferroni-Holm method of post-hoc test to correct the p level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan and animal experiment regulations at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Membrane capacitance and calcium current amplitudes with or without endocytic blockers or presynaptic scaffold inhibitors during slow, fast-accelerating, or fast endocytosis.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90497-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Parameters of recovery from STD at 37°C and 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> with or without endocytic- or presynaptic scaffold-blockers.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90497-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90497-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All source data for main and supplementary figures contain the numerical data used to generate the figures.

After acute block of endocytosis by pharmacology, deeper synaptic depression or less facilitation was observed in two types of synapses.

My only criticism concerns the interpretation of the ML 141 and Lat B data. With respect to the Calyx data, I am missing a detailed discussion of the effects observed here in light of the different RRP subpools SRP and FRP. This is very important since Lee at al. (2012, PNAS 109 (13) E765-E774) showed earlier that disruption of actin inhibits the rapid transition of SRP SVs to the FRP at the AZ. The whole literature on this important concept is missing. Likewise, the role of actin for the replacement pool at a cerebellar synapse (Miki et al., 2016) is only mentioned in half a sentence. There is quite some evidence that actin is important both at the AZ (SRP to FRP transition, activation of replacement pool) and at the peri-active zone for compensatory endocytosis and release site clearance. Both possible underlying mechanisms (SRP to FRP transition or release site clearance) should be better dissected.</p></disp-quote><p>We dissected the latrunculin effect further by referring to the related literature within the scope of this study in the revised Discussion section (last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Mahapatra and Takahashi addresses the role of presynaptic release site clearance during sustained synaptic activity. The authors characterize the effects of pharmacologically interfering with SV endocytosis (pre-incubation with Dynasore or Pitstop-2) on synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) at two different CNS synapses (calyx of Held synapses and hippocampal SC to CA1 synapses) using patch-clamp recordings in acute slices under experimental conditions designed to closely mimic a physiological situation (37{degree sign}C and 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]). Endocytosis blocker-induced changes in STP and in the recovery from short-term depression (STD) are compared to those seen after pharmacologically inhibiting actin filament assembly (pre-incubation with Latrunculin-B or the selective Cdc42 GTPase inhibitor ML-141). Presynaptic capacitance (Cm) recordings in calyx terminals were used to establish the effects of the pharmacological maneuvers on SV endocytosis.</p><p>Latrunculin-B and ML-141 neither affect SV endocytosis (assayed by Cm recordings) nor EPSC recovery following conditioning trains, but strongly enhances STD at calyx synapses. No changes in STP were observed at Latrunculin-B- or ML-141-treated SC to CA1 synapses.</p><p>Dynasore and Pitstop-2 slow down endocytosis, limit the total amount of exocytosis in response to long stimuli, enhance STD in response to 100 Hz stimulation, but profoundly accelerate EPSC recovery following conditioning 100 Hz trains at calyx synapses. At SC to CA1 synapses, Dynasore and Pitstop-2 reduce the extend of facilitation and lower relative steady-state EPSCs suggesting a change in the facilitation-depression balance in favor of the latter.</p><p>The authors use state-of-the art techniques and their data, which is clearly presented, leads to authors to conclude that endocytosis is universally important for clearance of release sites while the importance of scaffold protein-mediated site clearance is limited to 'fast synapses'.</p><p>Unfortunately, and perhaps not completely unexpected in view of the pharmacological tools chosen, there are several observations which remain difficult to understand:</p><p>(1) Blocking site clearance affects release sites that have previously been used, i.e. sites at which SV fusion has occurred and which therefore need to be cleared. Calyces use at most 20% of all release sites during a single AP, likely fewer at 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]. Even if all those 20% of release sites become completely unavailable due to a block of release site clearance, the 2nd EPSC in a train should not be reduced by &gt;20% because ~80% of the sites cannot be affected. However,~50% EPSC reduction was observed (Fig. 2B1, lower right panel) raising the possibility thatDynasore does more than specifically interfering with SVs endocytosis (and possibly Pitstop as well). Non-specific effects are also suggested by the observed two-fold increase in initial EPSC size in SC to CA1 synapses after Dynasore pre-incubation.</p></disp-quote><p>This study compares different experimental conditions to conclude the physiological role of endocytosis on rapid neurotransmission at the large calyceal synapse in mice. A related study at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (Kawasaki et al., Nat. Neuroscience 2000) reported similar findings in comparable experimental settings (physiological conditions and acute block of endocytosis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) More severe depression was observed at calyx synapses after blocking endocytosis which the authors attribute to a presynaptic mechanism affecting pool replenishment. When probing EPSC recovery after conditioning 100 Hz trains, a speed up was observed mediated by an &quot;unknown mechanism&quot; which is &quot;masked in 2 mM [Ca2+]&quot;. These two observations, deeper synaptic depression during 100 Hz but faster recovery from depression following 100 Hz, are difficult to align and no attempt was made to find an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>By varying temperature (PT vs RT), calcium concentration (1.3 mM vs 2.0 mM), and stimulation frequency (10, 100, and 200 Hz; some data are not shown), the effect of endocytosis block on EPSC STD and recovery from STD kinetics at the post-hearing calyx were compared in these settings: (PT, 1.3 mM [Ca2+]), (PT, 2.0 mM Ca2+), and (RT, 2.0 mM [Ca2+]), to dissect their respective role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) To reconcile previous data reporting a block of Ca2+-dependent recovery (CDR) by Dynasore or Latrunculin (measured at 2 mM external [Ca2+]) with the data presented here (using 1.3 mM external [Ca2+]) reporting no effect or a speed up of recovery from depression, the authors postulate that &quot;CDR may operate only when excessive Ca2+ enters during massive presynaptic activation&quot; (page 10 line 244). While that is possible, such explanation ignores plenty of calyx studies demonstrating fiber stimulation-induced CDR and elucidating molecular pathways mediating fiber stimulation-induced CDR, and it also completely dismisses the strong change in recovery time course after 10 Hz conditioning (single exponential) as compared to 100 Hz conditioning (double exponential with a pronounced fast component).</p><p>Strong presynaptic stimuli such as those illustrated in Figs. 1B,C induce massive exocytosis. The illustrated Cm increase of 2 to 2.5 pF represents fusion of 25,000 to 30,000 SVs (assuming a single SV capacitance of 80 aF) corresponding to a 12 to 15% increase in whole terminal membrane surface (assuming a mean terminal capacitance of ~16 pF). Capacitance measurements can only be considered reliable in the absence of marked changes in series and membrane conductance. Documentation of the corresponding conductance traces is therefore advisable for such massive Cm jumps and merely mentioning that the first 450 ms after stimulation were skipped during analysis or referring to previous publications showing conductance traces is insufficient.</p><p>All bar graphs in Figures 1 through 6 and Figures S3 through S6 compare three or even four (Fig. 5C) conditions, i.e. one control and at least two treatment data sets. It appears as if repeated t-tests were used to run multiple two-group comparisons (i.e. using the same control data twice for two different comparisons).
