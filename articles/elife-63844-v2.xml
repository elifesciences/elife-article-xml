Wild-type rods filled with high (10 mM) or low (0.5 mM) concentrations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer EGTA created a readily releasable pool (RRP) of 87 synaptic vesicles (SVs) that emptied as a single kinetic phase with a τ&lt;0.4 ms. The lower concentration of EGTA accelerated Ca<sub>v</sub> channel opening and facilitated release kinetics. In contrast, ribbonless rods created a much smaller RRP of 22 SVs, and they lacked Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation; however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-release coupling remained tight. These release deficits caused a sharp attenuation of rod-driven scotopic light responses. We conclude that the synaptic ribbon facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and establishes a large RRP of SVs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic ribbon</kwd><kwd>rod photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>calcium channels</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leibniz Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moser</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ExC 2067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moser</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1286 project C08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moser</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Multiscale Bioimaging Cluster of Excellence ExC 2067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moser</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mouse rod photoreceptor ribbon creates a large number of releasable vesicles with uniform release kinetics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals use their sensory systems to interact with and navigate through their environment, and sensory maps are created for this purpose. This is especially true for vision, where perception of a real-world scene invariably asserts the location of objects in space. The building blocks for visual percepts originate from a visual field that is often in motion, and can vary greatly in luminance. Therefore, vertebrates have evolved complex processes that stabilize the eyes on the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Straka and Baker, 2013</xref>), focus images on the back of the eye, and transform light of varying intensities into neural signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rivlin-Etzion et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian neural retina lines the concaved inner surface of the eye, and it forms a thin, multi-layered network. The outermost layer is a dense lawn of photoreceptors (PRs) (PR&gt;1×10<sup>5</sup> mm<sup>−2</sup>). Each PR has a photosensitive outer segment, and at its opposite pole a single synaptic terminal forms in the first synaptic layer of the retina, the outer plexiform layer (OPL). There are two classes of PRs in the outer retina: rods and cones, which differ in several ways (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grünert and Martin, 2020</xref>). For example, rods are ~10<sup>3</sup>-fold more sensitive to light than cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), they only express rhodopsin while cones express one of the multiple types of opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fain et al., 2010</xref>), and they outnumber cones at a ratio of 30:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grünert and Martin, 2020</xref>). These features allow the outer retina to begin sorting light properties into neural signals. A variety of bipolar cell types carry PR signals to the inner retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Light et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2016</xref>), whereupon a plethora of chemical and electrical synapses are assembled into circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demb and Singer, 2015</xref>) that serve in visual behaviors like night vision, color perception, and motion detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sterling, 2013</xref>).</p><p>PRs and bipolar cells form ‘ribbon synapses’ that are named after the electron-dense plate that projects from the presynaptic AZ into the cytoplasm. A subset of vertebrate sensory neurons express the protein ribeye, which is localized to ribbons (reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lagnado and Schmitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moser et al., 2020</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>Ribeye</italic> gene eliminates synaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>), but a unifying role for ribbons in synaptic transmission has not been identified. For instance, paired recordings between ribbonless rod bipolar cells (rbcs) and AII amacrine cells showed that synaptic transmission was greatly reduced without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents. The release deficit was reasoned to result from an uncoupling of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels from SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, ribbonless hair cells showed a milder impairment in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jean et al., 2018</xref>), and they produced well-defined substitute AZs that were largely capable of compensating for the loss of ribbon AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jean et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>More recent investigations into Ribeye-ko mice have used functional assays to probe how the ribbonless retinal circuitry behaves. First, recordings from on-α-ganglion cells showed that on-responses to increments in light were robust in the absence of ribbons; however, significant alterations were also documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okawa et al., 2019</xref>). Interpreting the results was challenged by the complexity of the retinal circuitry; in particular the overlap in rod and cone pathways (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seilheimer et al., 2020</xref>). In a subsequent study based on electroretinograms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairless et al., 2020</xref> assigned the deficits in ribbonless circuitry to the rod pathway; however, the defects in the pathway were not identified. Therefore, in the current study, we examined how the ribbon influenced transmitter release from mouse PRs, which has not been tested directly; and in addition, studied the biophysics of exocytosis from mammalian PRs about which relatively little is known.</p><p>Mammalian rods express a single, large horseshoe-shaped ribbon that surrounds one or two rod bipolar dendrites that are on average ~250 nm away from the ribbon (for mouse; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hagiwara et al., 2018</xref>). In the dark, rods are maximally depolarized to produce a steady influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that drives the continual turnover of SVs. This keeps synaptic glutamate high enough to activate the postsynaptic inhibitory mGluR6→TRPM1 pathway in rbc dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koike et al., 2010</xref>), which equates to the ‘dark signal.’ A weak flux of photons is sufficient to hyperpolarize the rod and momentarily slow exocytosis to create a ‘light signal’ (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field and Sampath, 2017</xref>). Mathematical models have predicted that a rod ribbon needs to achieve a release rate ≥40 SVs-s<sup>−1</sup> for the rbc mGluR6 pathway to activate and create a dark signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rao-Mirotznik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hasegawa et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, high-resolution measurements of evoked SV exocytosis were made directly from mouse rods. The results demonstrated that the mouse rod ribbon creates multiple, uniformly primed sites for the release of 87 SVs. Their Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels activated rapidly (~200 µs) and exhibited unique forms of facilitation that influenced ultrafast release. These features were dependent on the ribbon, as ribbonless rods formed a much smaller readily releasable pool (RRP), and lacked Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation. The study provides experimental results that support longstanding proposals on the function of the rod ribbon synapse, and we discuss how synaptic ribbons contribute to retinal signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Super-resolution readout of SV turnover at an individual rod ribbon</title><p>The majority of rod somata reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and send a spindly axon to their singular presynaptic terminal in the OPL, which contains an individual synaptic ribbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The minority of rod somata that lack an axon are positioned in the OPL, and they contain the synaptic ribbon within the soma compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These axonless rods have been described before at the EM level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously reported making whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents from them (referred to as the rod ‘soma-ribbon’ configuration) in an attempt to better control the membrane potential about the ribbon AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hagiwara et al., 2018</xref>). This point is illustrated here by assessing the membrane time constant for the soma-ribbon configuration. A −10 mV voltage step from a holding potential of −70 mV relative to the AgCl<sub>2</sub> reference electrode, generated a rapidly decaying membrane current with a τ&lt;30 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the RC time constant calculated from the average access resistance (R<sub>a</sub> ~30 MΩ) and whole-cell membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub> ~1 pF; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) produces a τ<sub>RC</sub> ~ 30 µs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Example recording from a rod photoreceptor (PR) that lacks an axon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image of a retinal slice centered on PR terminals in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and somata in the outer nuclear layer (ONL).

A series of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current (I<sub>Ca</sub>) traces, generated with depolarizing voltage steps (V<sub>step</sub>) to −18 mV for different durations, highlights the tight voltage control of I<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; 10 mM EGTA in the whole-cell pipette). Next, to assess the extent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered SV fusion associated with each depolarization, the sine wave-based, lock-in amplifier method was implemented to measure changes in whole-cell C<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lindau and Neher, 1988</xref>). A depolarization evoked increase in C<sub>m</sub> can be attributed to the incorporation of SV membrane, as long as there are no corresponding changes in conductance that can interfere with the estimation of C<sub>m</sub> (see Materials and methods for details). The examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> illustrate these points. First, the response to a 9 ms step depolarization generated a robust increase in C<sub>m</sub>, which remained elevated at a fixed level for the 0.5 s post-stimulation period captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Second, a sequence of evoked responses presented over a longer time span showed a pronounced jump in C<sub>m</sub> following each stimulation, while G<sub>m</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> were not noticeably changed by the stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This presentation also shows that subsequent to the evoked ΔC<sub>m</sub>, the membrane was endocytosed in the following ways: linearly, exponentially, and/or as abrupt downward steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Rarely were large (&gt;2 fF) downward steps in C<sub>m</sub> observed, such as the one between the 3 and 9 ms stimulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (downward arrow).

To quantify stimulated and baseline changes in C<sub>m</sub>, ΔC<sub>m</sub> was estimated as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and then plotted in sequence over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Finally, the evoked ΔC<sub>m</sub> was plotted per stimulation (pulse duration). In addition, the number of SVs corresponding to each ΔC<sub>m</sub> was plotted on the opposite axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which was calculated by dividing ΔC<sub>m</sub> by the C<sub>m</sub> of a single SV: 37.6 aF (1 aF=10<sup>–18</sup> F; see Materials and methods for estimates of SV C<sub>m</sub>); hence, a ΔC<sub>m</sub> ~4 fF is equivalent to the fusion of 106 SVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ca<sub>v</sub> channels activate rapidly and exhibit moderate inactivation</title><p>The type of voltage-gated calcium channel that supports exocytosis from rod ribbons is the L-type, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel. A feature that sets Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels apart from other L-type channels is that their expression is limited to PR terminals (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McRory et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pangrsic et al., 2018</xref>). By comparison, other L-type channels, such as Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 and 1.3, are expressed throughout the nervous system, and additionally in cardiac, endocrine, and neuroendocrine cells, and such prevalence has led to significantly more insight into their biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>). Therefore, some of the basic biophysical properties of mouse rod Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels, which have not been described to our knowledge, are reported next.</p><p>The voltage-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current activation was examined over a range of voltage steps when the rods were filled with 10 mM EGTA to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup>-currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bader et al., 1982</xref>). The depolarization stimulated I<sub>Ca</sub> showed a steep dependence on voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and this was quantified by measuring peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and calcium tail-current (I<sub>Ca</sub>-tail) amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Specifically, a depolarizing V<sub>step</sub> to −40 mV produced a peak-I<sub>Ca</sub>: −0.89±0.34 pA, and by −10 mV the maximal peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> was reached: −14.15±0.75 pA (9 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (the liquid junction potential: E<sub>lj</sub>=8.9 mV was not subtracted from V<sub>step</sub>; see Materials and methods). Fitting the peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> versus V<sub>step</sub> curve with a Boltzmann equation from −60 to −10 mV (point of maximal I<sub>Ca</sub>) gave a half-maximal peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> at a voltage of −28.7±0.4 mV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Next, to better estimate the point when half of the available Ca<sub>v</sub> channels opened (V<sub>1/2</sub>), a modified Boltzmann I-V equation was used, one that accounted for V<sub>rev</sub> and G<sub>max</sub> (see Materials and methods). This approach gave a V<sub>1/2</sub>=−23.4±1.0 mV (fit presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for additional statistics). Finally, I<sub>Ca</sub>-tail amplitudes were measured to determine the fraction of channels that opened at each V<sub>step</sub>, and this gave a half-maximal amplitude at approximately −30 mV (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, fitting the curve with a sigmoidal equation to estimate V<sub>1/2</sub> was not possible, because the I<sub>Ca</sub>-tail amplitudes appeared to decrease at V<sub>step</sub> values positive to −10 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This behavior may indicate a degree of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel inactivation within the 10 ms voltage step (see below). Therefore, the best estimate for half-maximal channel activation was derived from the modified Boltzmann I-V equation, and after subtracting <italic>E</italic><sub>lj</sub>, the V<sub>1/2</sub> is estimated to be ~ −33 mV.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Voltage-dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Presents a subset of individual I<sub>Ca</sub> traces taken from a rod filled with 10 mM EGTA.

To evaluate this, first peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> had to be measured over the range of V<sub>step</sub> values, under the condition of low intracellular EGTA. The results show that peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> values were virtually identical for the two intracellular EGTA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>); however, differences in activation kinetics were apparent (described below). Next, the peak-I<sub>Cl(Ca)</sub>-tail currents were measured as a function of V<sub>step</sub>. Since the I<sub>Cl(Ca)</sub>-tail amplitudes were measured at −70 mV (V<sub>rest</sub>), regardless of the preceding depolarizing V<sub>step</sub>, the I<sub>Cl(Ca)</sub>-tail amplitudes should be proportional to the number of TMEM16 channels opened; whereas, the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering depended on the V<sub>step</sub>. The results show that peak-I<sub>Cl(Ca)</sub>-tail and peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> currents followed a similar voltage-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

Interestingly, when comparing results from experiments with 0.5 and 10 mM EGTA in the pipette, the activation kinetics were slowed to a greater extent at negative voltages when 10 mM EGTA was used. Specifically, with 10 mM EGTA, the time constant for I<sub>Ca</sub> activation (τ<sub>activ</sub>) was lengthened sixfold when changing the V<sub>step</sub> from 0 to −30 mV (0.18±0.03 to 1.09±0.15 ms, respectively; 9 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), compared to the 3.4-fold lengthening of τ<sub>activ</sub> when 0.5 mM EGTA (0.16±0.03 to 0.55± 0.03 ms, respectively; 8 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Furthermore, in the physiological range for Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation, τ<sub>activ</sub> was twofold faster at −30 mV (−40 mV after correction for <italic>E</italic><sub>lj</sub>) when 0.5 mM EGTA was used (p: 0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Comparison of activation kinetics for low (0.5 mM) and high (10 mM) EGTA shows that they converged at more depolarized voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Assuming basal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was higher when less EGTA was used, then the results can be interpreted as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borst and Sakmann, 1998</xref>); but not peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We first used this approach to determine how many SVs were near Ca<sub>v</sub> channels and ready for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mennerick and Matthews, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moser and Beutner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Singer and Diamond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thoreson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graydon et al., 2011</xref>). This was achieved by using 10 mM EGTA in the pipette to restrict the evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-domain to within nanometers of the Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, and a series of brief depolarizing voltage steps were given to map out the initial phase of release (V<sub>rest</sub>=−70 mV, and V<sub>step</sub>=−18 mV; ordering of steps: 0.5, 1, 3, 9, 15, and 30 ms, with 8 s of rest between stimulations). Inspection of the plot of ΔC<sub>m</sub> versus step duration shows that the greatest change occurred within the first 3 ms of depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This point is documented in a couple of ways. First, the ΔC<sub>m</sub> generated with 3 ms steps reached 86% the amplitude of responses evoked with a 30 ms step (2.99±0.48 vs. 3.54±0.50 fF; p: 0.033, paired sample t-test; 7 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The second approach involved making a comparison of exponential fits (τ<sub>depletion</sub>) to the average ΔC<sub>m</sub> versus step duration over different ranges of stimulations. Specifically, a fit from 0.5 to 9 ms gave a τ<sub>depletion</sub>=348 µs and an amplitude=3.27 fF (adjusted R-square=0.999), which was similar to the result attained when the fit was extended out to 30 ms: τ<sub>depletion</sub>=383 µs and amplitude=3.43 fF (adjusted R-square=0.992; 7–15 cells per step duration; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests the initial kinetic release phase, referred to here as the fusion of the RRP of SVs, expired with a time constant &lt;0.4 ms and amounted to 3.27 fF (~87 SVs). It is worth noting that only slightly more time was needed to empty the RRP than indicated by τ<sub>depletion</sub>. The 0.5 ms steps produced negligible changes in ΔC<sub>m</sub> (0.14±0.19 fF ~4 SVs; 8 cells); whereas, the 1 ms steps released ~70% of the RRP (ΔC<sub>m</sub>: 2.11±0.74 fF ~56 SVs; 14 cells). This indicates a fusion delay of ~0.5 ms, involving Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of SV fusion, which was followed by ultrafast depletion of the RRP in under a millisecond.

The first expectation was that the RRP of SVs refilled in &lt;8 s, which was the inter-stimulus interval used in the short step duration protocols. The second assumption was that evoked responses adapted over the cumulative time course of the experiment. To the first point, AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs recorded from ground squirrel cb2 bipolars, paired to either a presynaptic rod or green-cone, recovered from paired-pulse depression within 0.3 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2010</xref>). However, longer recovery times of ~1 s have been reported for green-cones paired to cone bipolars that express a majority of kainate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeVries, 2000</xref>). Finally, presynaptic release (ΔC<sub>m</sub>) measured from green-cones recovered from paired-pulse depression in 0.7 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grabner et al., 2016</xref>). Without additional studies on mammalian PRs to point to, we note that salamander rods and cones recovered from paired-pulse depression (assayed as EPSCs or ΔC<sub>m</sub>) with a τ<sub>recovery</sub> ~1 s or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rabl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Innocenti and Heidelberger, 2008</xref>). On this backdrop, one can assume that 8 s was enough time for mouse rods to recover their RRP of SVs. Furthermore, the data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: ΔC<sub>m</sub> versus step duration, show a drastic difference between the first two stimulations given at 0.5–1 ms, but subsequent, longer duration stimulations (3–30 ms) showed only a modest incremental increase in ΔC<sub>m</sub>. This is interpreted as depletion of a finite pool of primed SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mennerick and Matthews, 1996</xref>). Based on the literature and data, a stimulation interval &lt;8 s would be justified; however, we also had to accommodate experiments on <italic>Ribeye</italic>-ko mice, described below, that may need more time to recover from stimulation. In addition, experiments with an intracellular concentration of 0.5 mM EGTA may need more time to clear intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> between stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Hook and Thoreson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To address the second concern: time-dependent adaptation after whole-cell entry, the overall experimental time was minimized. This effort entailed starting stimulations ~ 35 s after gaining whole-cell access, and the protocol was circumscribed to mapping out the RRP of SVs (the stimulation protocol is described above). This protocol amounted to less than 2 min from the time of entry. Furthermore, an infusion time of 35 s was sufficient to affect Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering, because Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated currents only appeared when 0.5 mM EGTA was in the pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This conclusion was reinforced in the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, and described below. These features suggest that rod terminals were adequately infused. For reference, a comparison to experiments performed on mouse rbcs is made.

A limitation here was that Q<sub>Ca</sub> was not calculated for steps &gt;3 ms when 0.5 mM EGTA was used, because I<sub>Cl(Ca)</sub> interfered with determination of Q<sub>Ca</sub>. The second comparison made here was ΔC<sub>m</sub> versus I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude. This is an alternative to Q<sub>Ca</sub> for indexing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and since peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> does not appear to be impacted by I<sub>Cl(Ca)</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), all of the peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude data points from experiments with low EGTA were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; and a combination of I<sub>Ca</sub>-tail (from 0.5 and 1 ms steps) and peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> (steps≥3 ms) were plotted against ΔC<sub>m</sub>. A simple linear or exponential process was not realized; but instead, the data points were scattered into groups. The steps≥3 ms were grouped within a range of ΔC<sub>m</sub> values between 3 and 4 fF (equivalent to the RRP), and with a peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> of approximately −12 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The remaining data points were generated with 0.5 and 1 ms steps, and they produced a broad range of ΔC<sub>m</sub> values (0.2–2 fF) and I<sub>Ca</sub>-tail amplitudes (−7.5 to −18 pA) that suggest ΔC<sub>m</sub> scaled with I<sub>Ca</sub>-tail amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, plotting ΔC<sub>m</sub> against step duration demonstrates ultrafast depletion of an RRP of ~90 SVs in response to a moderate amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (~10,000 ions). These features point to a critical role for Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics, and can be interpreted as a primed SV fusing once its neighboring channel(s) opens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jarsky et al., 2010</xref>). To this point, our experiments with low intracellular EGTA led to the majority of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels activating in ~0.6 ms (I<sub>Ca</sub> onset delay: 300 µs plus the τ<sub>activ</sub>: 310 µs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This length of time was all that was needed to fuse the majority of the RRP of SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Since 10 mM EGTA slowed Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics, we propose that the small time delay in Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is what produced a delay in exocytosis. For comparison, changing intracellular EGTA levels has been shown to accelerate the onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry and in turn accelerated release kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borst and Sakmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2011</xref>). However, it is also expected that the different EGTA levels will significantly alter the size of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-domain formed about Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. This raises the possibility that a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-domain might access additional releasable SVs, which release at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>); however, the size of the RRP was not influenced by the two intracellular EGTA concentrations used in our study. For these reasons, we conclude that rods use a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-nanodomain that tightly couples Ca<sub>v</sub> channels and SVs to control their release (reviewed here: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moser et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Since high-resolution immuno-fluorescence imaging showed that Ca<sub>v</sub> channels were concentrated at the base of the rod ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dembla et al., 2020</xref>), we assume that this is where the RRP of SVs are docked. From electron microscopy (EM) studies on mouse rod ribbons, the number of SVs estimated to be docked at the base of the ribbon range from 60 to 86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zampighi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabner et al., 2015</xref>); thus, approximately the size of the RRP of 87 SVs we have measured in this study.

This former study did not measure release from rods; therefore, we tested whether the loss of SVs from the AZ would affect the size of the RRP of SVs. The measurements were first performed with 10 mM EGTA in the pipette.

Interestingly, the different EGTA concentrations did not significantly influence RRP size within either genotype, nor were the kinetics of depletion altered.

In the intact animal, this deficit is expected to preferentially impact rod signaling in the dark, a period when the rate of glutamate release is the highest. Normally, presenting a dim light flash to a dark-adapted retina will cause a momentary pause in glutamate release from rods, which in turn causes a depolarization (dis-inhibition) of postsynaptic rbcs. The magnitude of the light response, as assessed with electroretinogram (erg) recordings, will reflect the extent of rbc depolarization. If <italic>Ribeye</italic>-ko rods are unable to keep synaptic glutamate levels high enough to inhibit rbcs in the dark, then their scotopic-erg light responses should reflect this. To test this hypothesis, ergs were performed on dark-adapted mice, under scotopic test conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). The amplitude of the erg a-wave reflects phototransduction in the outer segments.

This hypothesis was made decades earlier, motivated in part by results from EM studies on cat rod synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rao-Mirotznik et al., 1995</xref>; in addition, several quantitative computational studies have modeled how this synapse operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rao-Mirotznik et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Rossum and Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hasegawa et al., 2006</xref>). What has been missing from the literature is evidence that the mammalian rod ribbon actually creates a large RRP of SVs. Therefore, the first question addressed was how many SVs were primed for release. High resolution, whole-cell C<sub>m</sub> measurements of evoked release showed that the mouse rod was able to fuse 87 SVs in a single kinetic phase with a τ<sub>depletion</sub> of ~0.4 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The ultrafast rate of depletion indicated the SVs were highly primed (super-primed) for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mennerick and Matthews, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). The significance of a single-exponential release phase is that the RRP was uniformly primed for fusion, rather than formed from a heterogeneous pool of ultrafast and fast primed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grabner and Zenisek, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the size of the RRP of SVs was not altered when intracellular EGTA levels were changed, which is interpreted as proof that the release sites were within a few nanometers from the Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Since the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels are concentrated along the base of the ribbon, this is where the SV release sites are presumed to be located (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>); but, is there enough room to accommodate a RRP of 87 SVs? Confocal images of immuno-labeled mouse rod ribbons have a contour length of 1.6 µm ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabner et al., 2015</xref>), and a length of 1.7 µm has been estimated from a study using Focused Ion Beam-EM,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hagiwara et al., 2018</xref>).

This shrinkage in pool size corresponded with previously published studies that described the ribbonless rod AZ as shortened and accompanied by fewer SVs. Specifically, an EM study observed that the density of docked SVs was reduced by 60% (for definition of docking see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>), and the rod AZ identified with Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4/RIM2 immuno-staining was 50% shorter in length and rounded in the absence of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dembla et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the altered Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel staining pattern, and absence of I<sub>Ca</sub> facilitation in ribbonless rods (discussed below), did not alter the tight coupling of the SVs with Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Overall a close correspondence between the size of the RRP of SVs (our study) and the number of SVs docked at the AZ (published work) was observed for wt rods.

Given the 75% reduction in evoked ΔC<sub>m</sub> measured from ribbonless rods, the altered erg b-wave amplitudes were likely, if not entirely, caused by the deficit in presynaptic release. Comparing the results from the erg and C<sub>m</sub> measurements suggests that the impairment measured with ΔC<sub>m</sub> was greater than that derived from ergs by ~15%, which may reflect an under or over representation of the ΔC<sub>m</sub> results. For instance, if in the dark wt rods released more glutamate than the postsynaptic rbc transduction pathway could encode, then the excess glutamate would not be registered in the ergs; while, a substantial release deficit may fall within the coding range of the rbc postsynaptic transduction system. Such a scenario would lead to an under representation of the deficit when probed with ergs. On the other hand, the non-physiological, strong stimulation conditions used to evoke ΔC<sub>m</sub> may have exaggerated the differences between wt and ribbonless rods.</p><p>How does ribbon loss influence retinal function under low light? Normally, synaptic glutamate concentrations at rod-rbc synapses are elevated in the dark. The consequence of a release deficit in the dark will be a reduction in synaptic glutamate, which should leave rbcs depolarized relative to wt rbcs. If true, then the ribbonless circuitry will effectively put rbcs in an ‘on-state’ while in the dark, which may impair the ability of the ribbonless circuitry to encode dim light stimuli (i.e., single photon responses). In the wt mouse retina, the ‘primary rod pathway’ handles single photon responses, and this pathway consists of the following sequence of connections (synapse type): (1) rods to rbcs (ribbon synapse), (2) rbcs to AIIs (ribbon synapse), (3) AIIs to on-cone bipolar cells (on-cbcs; gap junction), and (4) on-cbcs to on-α-ganglion cells (on-α-gcs; ribbon synapse) (for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seilheimer et al., 2020</xref>). To encode an on-response at the output layer, the rate of excitatory (glutamatergic) input to on-α-gcs is increased by light increments. When the retina is dark adapted, this pathway encodes the rate of photons captured by rods (rhodopsin isomerizations: R*) over the following range of flash intensities: 0.01–2 R*/(rod·s); while, stronger flashes saturate the primary rod pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ke et al., 2014</xref>). As long as a dim background luminance is applied (&lt;0.5 R*/(rod·s)) small increments and decrements in light can be encoded by modulating the rate of tonic excitatory inputs to on-α-gcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>). However, as background luminance &gt;1 R*/(rod·s), the primary rod pathway rapidly adapts to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>). The adaptation is characterized by a withdrawal of tonic excitatory inputs to on-α-gcs, progressively diminishing the pathways ability to encode light decrements; thus, with light adaptation the on-α-gc responses become strongly rectified in the direction of light increments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>On this backdrop, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okawa et al., 2019</xref> addressed how the ribbonless retina responded to sinusoidal-chirp light stimuli. By making whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from on-α-gcs, they showed that the ribbonless retina encoded increments in light robustly, but light decrements were poorly encoded; which was interpreted as resulting from a reduction in tonic excitatory inputs to on-α-gcs. This basic outline is comparable to the behavior of a light-adapted primary rod pathway in as far as the responses were rectified in the direction of light increments. However, additional functional deficits indicated the ribbonless circuitry was not functioning as a normal, light adapted retina. For example, rod and cone on-pathways normally collaborate to encode contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ke et al., 2014</xref>) and spatial frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>) on a background luminance between 10–100 R*/(rod·s), but the ribbonless retina exhibited the greatest deficits in coding these features within this range of luminance (50 R*/(rod·s); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okawa et al., 2019</xref>). To assign the deficits in functional coding to the ribbonless primary rod pathway is tempting given deficits in the rod pathway outlined above; however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okawa et al., 2019</xref> further showed that a normal frequency of action potentials (using on-cell patch-clamp) was generated by on-α-gcs in response to light steps from dark to 10 R*/(rod·s) for 0.5 s. This finding is consistent with their whole-cell voltage-clamp results: robust on-responses, but it illustrates a surprising degree of functional resiliency that likely involved compensatory mechanisms. One possible explanation is that the ribbonless cone pathway, which responded normally to photopic light flashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairless et al., 2020</xref>), helped compensate by rerouting rod signals through the secondary rod on-pathway: rods−cones−on-cbcs−on-α-gcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Seilheimer et al., 2020</xref>). A step luminance of 10 R*/(rod·s) marks the point where the secondary on-pathway is normally just starting to get engaged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ke et al., 2014</xref>; thus, it is hard to imagine this pathway alone could compensate so robustly. Another possibility is that the ribbonless primary rod pathway utilized compensatory mechanisms in the inner retina at the rbc-AII synapse, where light adaption is normally thought to be mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>; for review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demb and Singer, 2015</xref>). Whether the primary and/or secondary rod pathway were involved will require further study. For example, by selectively deleting electrical synapses formed between rods and cones, it should be possible to study the ribbonless rod primary on-pathway more directly.</p><p>To begin to examine the biophysics of exocytosis in more detail, we first compare results from mouse rods to studies carried out on isolated Mb1 bipolars. The comparisons are rather straightforward to make since SV fusion at Mb1 synaptic terminals has been studied extensively with the whole-cell C<sub>m</sub> technique. A subpopulation of Mb1 SVs fuse with a τ<sub>ultrafast</sub> ~0.5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heidelberger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mennerick and Matthews, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>), which are rate limited by Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics (<italic>τ</italic> ~ 0.6 ms at −10 mV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mennerick and Matthews, 1998</xref>), and their release is unimpeded by elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering (5 mM EGTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mennerick and Matthews, 1996</xref>). An additional population of SVs are considered to reside at greater distances from Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, because they only enter the RRP when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering is reduced (0.1 mM EGTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>). Such heterogeneity in rates of fast release were not apparent in the recordings from mouse rods; however, we find that facilitation of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics occurs on a timescale that can influence the timing of ultrafast release. In response to 0.5 ms voltage steps, the RRP was depleted by 50% with 0.5 mM EGTA in the pipette, but only 4% of the RRP emptied when 10 mM EGTA was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The faster release onset is attributed to the acceleration of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel activation kinetics in 0.5 mM EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which enhanced Q<sub>Ca</sub> selectively at 0.5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrone et al., 2002</xref> showed something very similar with respect to release, specifically a tail-current released 50% of the RRP when the Mb1 bipolars were loaded with 0.1 mM EGTA, but with higher Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering (endogenous) the tail-current released only 5% of the RRP. They attributed the enhanced rate of release to the expansion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-domain, but differences in I<sub>Ca</sub> were not reported. For comparison to mammalian bipolar cells, mouse rbcs also support ultrafast release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oltedal and Hartveit, 2010</xref>), and this is mediated through tight, nano-domain coupling to Ca<sub>v</sub> channels to SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jarsky et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Auditory hair cells also support a robust form of facilitation when they are pre-conditioned to elevated concentrations of free, intracellular-Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which was achieved by pre-depolarizing the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2011</xref>) and/or lowering intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2011</xref>). Release facilitation was characterized by shorter onset latencies and higher release synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and von Gersdorff, 2019</xref>). Notably, rat IHCs showed facilitation of I<sub>Ca</sub> onset, but without a change in steady-I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2011</xref>); similar to what we report for rods. However, frog HCs did not exhibit a change in I<sub>Ca</sub> onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2011</xref>). These studies show that mammalian IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2011</xref>) and rods accelerate Ca<sub>v</sub> channel opening (this study), and this in turn expedited release. In contrast, frog HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2011</xref>) and Mb1 bipolars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrone et al., 2002</xref>) accelerate release through a distinct process that may involve a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent priming step or differences in the spatial coupling between Ca<sub>v</sub> channels and SVs, respectively.</p><p>In this study, we also found that wt I<sub>Ca</sub> decayed by a third with a τ of 19 ms, suggestive of Ca<sub>v</sub> channel inactivation. This was observed with 10 mM EGTA in the pipette, which is sufficient to block Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) in salamander rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corey et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rabl and Thoreson, 2002</xref>); however, Ca<sup>2+</sup> will need to be substituted with Ba<sup>2+</sup> to more definitively demonstrate the process is CDI. Voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) may be involved, but this was not observed in salamander rods when 10 mM EGTA was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corey et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rabl and Thoreson, 2002</xref>); furthermore, VDI was not apparent in recordings from porcine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cia et al., 2005</xref>) or ground squirrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2010</xref>) rods when experiments were performed with 2 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup> or 10 mM BAPTA. Though we do not have a definitive answer from our recordings on rods, both CDI and VDI have been reported in studies carried out on human Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels heterologously expressed in HEK cells. The molecular details are being worked out for CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haeseleer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sang et al., 2016</xref>); whereas, VDI has only been described as highly temperature-dependent. For instance, raising the recording temperature from 23 to 37°C increased peak-I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude by 3-fold and accelerate VDI by 50-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peloquin et al., 2008</xref>, with 20 mM BaCl2). Future studies will need to assess if VDI and/or CDI are involved.</p><p>Both of the Ca<sub>v</sub> channel gating phenomena observed in wt rods were eliminated in ribbonless rods. I<sub>Ca</sub> activation kinetics measured with 10 mM EGTA in the pipette showed slower activation kinetics in wt than ribbonless rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and I<sub>Ca</sub> inactivation was more apparent in wt rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7F</xref>). Given the steady-I<sub>Ca</sub> amplitude measured from wt and ko rods were similar, there were arguably comparable numbers of open channels at ~30 ms; however, ribbonless rods appeared to lack a transient facilitation in I<sub>Ca</sub>. To better set the context, it is important to note that normal levels of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (α1F-subunit) protein were reported to be expressed in the retina of <italic>Ribeye</italic>-ko mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>); nonetheless, immuno-fluorescence staining for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (α1F) and RIM2α revealed the ribbonless AZ was 50% shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dembla et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates that ribeye directly influenced the structure of the rod AZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>, and either directly or indirectly facilitated the opening of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels (this study; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jean et al., 2018</xref>). The ribbons stabilization of RIM2α and its higher molecular weight splice variants is of interest, because deletion of long forms of RIM1/2α selectively from rods significantly reduced I<sub>Ca</sub>, reduced the frequency of miniature glutamate transporter events, and reduced the evoked ΔC<sub>m</sub>, but this did not alter Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 (α1F) channel or ribeye staining patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabner et al., 2015</xref>). In a separate study of RIM2α-ko mice, OPL organization and rod ribbon structure were normal, but the rod pathway exhibited impaired scotopic light responses based on ergs, and excitatory inputs to horizontal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Löhner et al., 2017</xref>). From these studies, perturbation of RIM2α impaired synaptic function (i.e., Ca<sub>v</sub> channel function) without an essential role in shaping rod ribbon size or OPL organization; therefore, loss of ribeye may impair the ability of RIM2α and its splice vatiants to positively impact synaptic function at rods. Whether ribeye influences other AZ scaffolding proteins has not been thoroughly addressed, but it seems unlikely that loss of ribeye greatly impacted CAST/ELKs. When deleted individually as was done in the CAST-ko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">tom Dieck et al., 2012</xref>), or simultaneously in the CAST/ELKs-dko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hagiwara et al., 2018</xref>), the following deficits were reported: dramatic degeneration of the OPL, diminished photopic- and scotopic-erg responses, shortening of rod ribbon length, and a near elimination of rod I<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hagiwara et al., 2018</xref>). A dramatic structural and functional phenotype is also observed in bassoon-ko mice. Bassoon deletion significantly impacted the anchoring of the ribbon to the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dick et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike ribeye and RIM2α, CAST/ELKs and bassoon are essential for normal development and maintenance of synapses in the OPL.</p><p>Our study provides new insight into the biophysics of SV fusion at the mammalian rod ribbon synapse. The results demonstrate that the rod ribbon creates multiple release sites with similar release probability in response to strong stimulations (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This is driven by Ca<sub>v</sub> channels that activate at ultrafast rates. The coupling between Ca<sub>v</sub> channels and SVs is on a nano-scale, with no sign of heterogeneity in spatial coupling. Instead, release heterogeneity arose from alterations in Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation, which was specific to the timing of release onset. These features were dependent on the synaptic ribbon, as ribbonless rods lacked Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation and the RRP was greatly scaled down. Future studies will need to determine the stoichiometry of a release site, starting with how many Ca<sub>v</sub> channels open to trigger an SV(s) to fuse and what mechanisms impact release probability (i.e., PKA). Better insight into these matters will further our understanding of how rods convert depolarizations into synaptic signals, and ultimately how the mammalian rod pathway helps encode object motion and position.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal handling</title><p>Animals were handled in accord with institutional and German national animal care guidelines.

A needle reference electrode was inserted subcutaneously above the nose, and a ground electrode was inserted near the tail. A custom-designed Ganzfield illuminator with 25 white LEDs was used to deliver 0.1 ms light flashes every 5 s, which were incrementally increased in intensity from 0.0003 to 0.278 cds/m<sup>2</sup> (calibrated with a Mavolux, IPL 10530). Recorded potentials were amplified, low-pass filtered at 8 kHz, and sampled at a rate of 24 kHz. Ten responses were averaged per light intensity. The ergs were low-pass filtered using an FFT set to a corner frequency of 400 Hz or 20 Hz for measurement of a- or b-wave parameters, respectively. All analyses were performed with Origin software (OriginLab Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Converting ΔC<sub>m</sub> into the number of fusing vesicles</title><p>To calculate the capacitance per vesicle we relied on published data.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Fred Rieke as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joshua H Singer (Reviewer #2); Wallace B Thoreson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The reviewers were all impressed with the quality of the data, and recognized the technical difficulty of the experiments. Concerns focused primarily on presentation, and these fell into three areas. First, the paper is dense in places and needs to be made more accessible for a general reader. One example is that the figures are quite packed, and could be split into more figures and reduced in complexity. Second, controls for rundown need to be described more clearly. Third, the changes in the ERG in the ribeye knockouts appear much smaller than would be expected from the direct measurements of exocytosis from the rods. A discussion of this apparent discrepancy is needed. In discussion, all reviewers agree these concerns were important. These and several other points are detailed in the individual reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes synaptic vesicle release from rod photoreceptors. The single-cell measurements are impressive, and provide a clear set of biophysical properties of transmitter release from rods. I have few concerns, and only a few questions/suggestions, about these experiments. I found the erg measurements and their interpretation less compelling. These and some smaller comments are below,</p><p>The reduction in the erg in the RIBEYE knockout is less than might be expected given the decrease in the RRP. Similarly, retinal ganglion cells in mice lacking RIBEYE have modest response alterations when compared to control cells (see Wang et al., 2019 – this paper is relevant here and could be discussed). The robust alterations in transmitter release and seemingly smaller changes in overall circuit function seem inconsistent with each other. I do not expect the authors to have a resolution of this issue, but a discussion of it would be helpful.</p><p>Related to the above point, the biophysical measurements provide a wealth of detailed mechanistic information about the operation of the synapses. But there is much less in the paper that can be related to the operation of the synapse at physiological voltages. This may be part of why the mechanistic and functional measurements appear in conflict. This again is not a request for this data (the associated changes in capacitance and currents would be small given the small physiological changes in voltage), but it is an issue that should be clarified and discussed. A consequence of this is that the early part of the discussion about the relation of the present results to physiological function seems much less concrete than the rest of the paper.</p><p>Some descriptions are quite technical and might not be easily interpreted by a general reader. An example of this is the description of the calcium-activated chloride current as being &quot;fully nested&quot; in the calcium current (first full paragraph, page 8). The entire paper could be revised with an interested but non-expert reader in mind.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This submitted manuscript by Grabner and Moser presents an electrophysiological study of the mouse rod presynaptic active zone (AZ). Recordings of presynaptic Ca currents and evoked exocytosis are used to assess Ca channel-release site coupling and the dynamics of exocytosis from the readily-releasable vesicle pool (RRP) under a variety of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering conditions in wild-type and RIBEYE-knockout animals. The results show that although the RRP size is reduced in RIBEYE-knockout animals (consistent with other studies supporting the general notion that the presynaptic ribbon is an essential component of the AZ and an organizing site for the RRP), Ca channel-release site coupling is not disrupted significantly: Ca channels remain located quite close to the releasable vesicles although they are modulated differently in the absence of the ribbon.</p><p>The strength of this study is the rigorous electrophysiological analysis-the combination of Ca current and membrane capacitance recording from rod terminals-that yields high temporal resolution recordings of molecular events underlying exocytosis. Conceptual and technical problems are absent.</p><p>My major criticism addresses the presentation of the study: personally, I find that the most interesting results are obscured by the very detailed presentation of specific measurements (e.g. time constants, etc…). Revising the writing to highlight these really surprising (to me, at least) findings would make the paper far more accessible:</p><p>1) Given that the ribbon is thought to be an organizing site for exocytosis and that Ca channels are tethered to ribbon-interacting proteins, that Ca channels remain close to release sites in the absence of the ribbon is quite a surprise and provides some significant insight-or reveals limitations-about the types of protein-protein interactions that are important for Ca channel-release site coupling.</p><p>2) The fact that the absence of the ribbon affects Ca current properties but not Ca channel localization is also really interesting and, again, sets some constraints on which proteins might be interacting directly with the ribbon.</p><p>3) The finding that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl channels potentially are mislocalized or disfunctional in the absence of the ribbon perhaps speaks to the role of the ribbon as a general organizer of the presynapse rather than a specific organizer of vesicles.</p><p>I leave it to the authors to bring these points forward as they see fit, but I do believe that some revision would improve the presentation.</p><p>A few additional points are worth considering and addressing:</p><p>1) Mehta et al. showed that spontaneous EPSCs were reduced in frequency and size at the cone-cone bipolar cell synapse in hibernating ground squirrels, in which the ribbon is reduced dramatically in size (and its subcellular location is altered). This speaks to a correlation between ribbon size and location and RRP size and should be mentioned.</p><p>2) Given the detailed measurements of Ca current properties that were taken, why wasn't single channel conductance estimated from noise in the tail currents? It would be worthwhile to assess this parameter, as there appear to be significant differences between single channel conductance of Cav1.4 channels in expression systems (Doering et al. 2005) and in rod bipolar cell terminals (Jarsky et al. 2010), which likely express Cav1.4.</p><p>3) I'm not sure that I like the rundown correction: doesn't it assume linearity? Is there any evidence for this?</p><p>4) The points in the discussion about RRP dynamics in fish retinal Mb1 cells and inner hair cells are well taken-there are many synapses, including these, at which the dynamics of release are quite rapid-though Mb1 cells are quite a bit different from mammalian rods as well as from mammalian rod bipolars, in which the RRP and correlations between RRP measurements and anatomical counts of vesicles have been performed (Singer and Diamond 2006; Zhou et al. 2006). The authors either should expand this section to make it more comprehensive or pare it down to remove extraneous information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a carefully done study describing key properties of vesicle release from mouse rods. The study is well-written and describes a series of very technically challenging experiments involving membrane capacitance measurements of vesicle fusion in mouse rods. The responses are exceedingly small, averaging only 4 fF when strongly stimulated. But the authors show very nice recordings and describe the measurements in great detail. The data describing the size of the readily releasable pool, capabilities of sustained release, properties of rod calcium currents, effects of calcium buffering on release, and changes in release observed in Ribeye KO mice that lack ribbons are all important information for understanding release at this key first synapse in the rod pathway for vision.</p><p>I recommend a greater discussion of the potential impact of rundown and depletion on their measurements. There is a mention of rundown in the calculations of sustained release in supplemental Figure 1, but it is clear from the fact that recordings were confined to the first two minutes of recording that this was a significant issue. Also, the interpulse intervals of 8 s may not be enough time for the entire releasable pool to be replenished, based on measurements in other species (e.g., Innocenti and Heidelberger, 2008; Van Hook et al., 2014). Were measurements inter-leaved to limit order effects? Were pool size measurements also adjusted for rundown?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The mammalian rod synaptic ribbon is essential for Ca<sub>v</sub> channel facilitation and ultrafast synaptic vesicle fusion&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>This is a revision of a paper studying exocytosis from mouse rod photoreceptors. The paper provides elegant biophysical measures of calcium entry and vesicle fusion in wild-type and ribeye knockout mice. These are used to estimate the size of the ready-releasable pool of vesicles and the coupling of calcium entry to release. The paper has improved in revision, and is now much easier to follow. I have a few remaining suggestions for clarity:</p><p>I personally find it interesting that the functional deficits in the ribeye knockout mice are smaller than those that might be expected from the direct measurements of synaptic properties. For example, in Okawa et al. (2019), steps from darkness elicited near-identical spike responses in On-α RGCs. As you point out on the paper, the substantial alterations in operation of both rod and rod bipolar synapses might predict a strong alteration in RGC responses. The similarity of the responses to steps from darkness is not immediately consistent with the argument that you give in the discussion based on adaptation. It seems instead (or in addition) possible that there is compensation occurring. If you agree, you could add this to the discussion.</p><p>Lines 55-56: this sentence is confusing because it relates the peripheral retina and the outer retina – can you just say &quot;the peripheral retina covers 95% of the total retinal area.&quot; Related – this paragraph treats different mammalian retinas similarly, but the distinction between central and peripheral is not very clear in mice, but obviously a big deal in primates. You might make that clearer in this paragraph.</p><p>Figure 1: the stimulus trace in Figure 1A (and in Figure 3) appears incorrect as the calcium currents recover before the stimulus ends.</p><p>Lines 130-131: I think here you mean that the Cm traces were similar across depolarizations. In any case, I would clarify what was similar.</p><p>Figure 2G: Can't you adjust the right axis scale so that you only need to plot one set of points, and can then read corresponding Cm (left axis) or SV count (right axis)? This would reinforce how you convert Cm to SVs.</p><p>Section starting on Line 139: a transition sentence stating the CaV1.4 is the calcium channel controlling release would be helpful here.</p><p>Line 336: I would consider deleting the reference to Figure 6 here since that figure has not yet been introduced – so referring to it forces the reader to look ahead. Or you could give the statement about the delay and then say something like &quot;This conclusion was reinforced in the experiments illustrated in Figure 6A and B and described below.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63844.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers were all impressed with the quality of the data, and recognized the technical difficulty of the experiments.

We made the same comparisons for the ribeye-ko, which we characterized as showing a 75 % reduction in the RRP, 60 % reduction in SV density (published work), and 60 % reduction in erg b-wave amplitude. However, we did not broaden the Discussion to consider how our study related to retinal circuitry.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we highlight that both rod-to-rbc and rbc-to-AII signaling are highly dependent on ribeye (at least when probed with strong stimulations, and ergs), and then we propose how this might influence signaling to the ganglion cell layer. Importantly we discuss how our study may help advance the interpretation of the work by Okawa et al. 2019 (Nat Comm; Results section), who have studied the Ribeye-ko animals at the systems level. The following excerpts from that study highlight (1) how Ribeye-ko impacted signaling to the output layer of the retina, and (2) a need for more studies like ours which probe the influence of ribeye per synapse:</p><p>(1) ''the larger increment/decrement ratio in the absence of ribbons was due to smaller decrement responses. This in turn indicates less tonic excitatory synaptic input to RGCs, likely due to a lower rate of spontaneous glutamate release from bipolar cells…</p><p>(2).… These functional analyses indicate that, while RGCs continue to respond robustly in the absence of ribbons, their responses are significantly altered. More directed experiments are needed to interpret these differences mechanistically since ribbon synapses are normally present in both the photoreceptors and bipolar cells (see Discussion).''</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some descriptions are quite technical and might not be easily interpreted by a general reader.

Also, the interpulse intervals of 8 s may not be enough time for the entire releasable pool to be replenished, based on measurements in other species (e.g., Innocenti and Heidelberger, 2008; Van Hook et al., 2014).

First response letter:</p><p>The reduction in the erg in the RIBEYE knockout is less than might be expected given the decrease in the RRP. Similarly, retinal ganglion cells in mice lacking RIBEYE have modest response alterations when compared to control cells (see Wang et al., 2019 – this paper is relevant here and could be discussed). The robust alterations in transmitter release and seemingly smaller changes in overall circuit function seem inconsistent with each other. I do not expect the authors to have a resolution of this issue, but a discussion of it would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current version (rv2, lines 554-560) we have briefly discussed how the conditions used for assaying evoked release (dCm) may have overrepresented the release deficit. In addition, we suggest a scenario in which the ergs may have underestimated the magnitude of a rod release deficit. In the end, a major portion (60 to 75 %) of the transmission (erg) or release (dCm) are absent from ribbonless rods. Furthermore, release from ribbonless rbcs is estimated to be reduced by 80% (Maxeiner 2016). Together the deficits identified along the first two synapses of the rod primary pathway (rod-rbc and rbc-AII synapses) are significant, especially when considered in tandem. How do these defective connections influence the overall circuitry in response to light stimuli?</p><p>561 to 582 outline of the functional circuitry</p><p>583 to 611 for our detailed Discussion of Okawa et al. 2019.</p><p>Review of what was in the first revision, and what of this is maintained in the current rv2:</p><p>In the first revision, we discussed the piecewise deficits in the context of the study by Okawa et al. 2019. They measured functional light responses from on-α-ganglion cells in wt and Ribeye-ko mice. We focused on their whole-cell voltage-clamp (WC VC) recordings, because those measurements (in response to light chirps) represented the 'more detailed' dataset. Furthermore, we were motivated to Discuss their WC VC results because those results were most relatable to the seminal works by Grimes, Schwatz and Rieke 2014 (Neuron), and Ke et al., 2014 (Neuron). Notably, the WC VC results from Okawa et al. 2019 indicated significant alterations in the light responses measured from ko mice (see Figure 7d-g); in particular, light decrements were greatly reduced in the ko responses. We tried to explain the lack of response to light decrements as reflecting an impairment in the primary rod pathway. The reasoning is that in the wt retina, when weak light decrements are presented on a very dim background luminance, the primary rod pathway plays a major role. In contrast, when the pathway is light adapted, the decrements in light are poorly coded and the primary rod pathway is repurposed (Grimes et al. 2014 and Ke et al. 2014).</p><p>In revision 1, we also noted that on-responses (depolarizations in response to light increments) were robust at on-α-gcs. However, we did not attempt to explain why on-responses were strong and near normal in the ribbonless retina. The reasoning was as follows. First, in the wt retina as the primary rod pathway adapts to light, onresponses stay robust while responses to light decrements diminish. In other words, the light adapted wt retina given a sine-light stimuli has an output similar to a halfwave rectifier, rectified in the on-direction. Second, we propose that the rod secondary pathway becomes engaged (rod to cone transfer via gap junctions) as the background luminance increases and eventually cones are activated directly. Therefore, with more light the primary rod pathway might become mixed with other on-pathways that feed excitation into on-a-gcs. This introduction of other pathways is problematic since the primary rod pathway is what we have identified as being piecewise defective. In addition, the finding by Fairless et al. 2020 that photopic responses are normal in the ko mice, raises the possibility that the ribbonless cone pathway may allow the secondary rod pathway to function in near normal fashion as luminance increases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Response from regarding our first revision.</p><p>For example, in Okawa et al.

However, we appreciate the finding and have added this to rv2. To introduce this finding, we had to better describe at what point the different rod pathways are engaged (what luminance), and how they shape the outputs at the level of on-a-gcs. In the end, we propose that the rbc-AII synapse may have compensated (reset) in ways that allow the primary pathway to respond normally to light steps. In addition, we suggest that the ribbonless rods may shuttle signals to the rod-cone pathway via the secondary rod pathway (Ke et al., 2014).</p><p>In rv2, we clarify our proposal that the ribbonless retina behaves similar to a dark adapted retina. We draw the analogy to the point that the outputs of the ribbonless retina (to on-a-gcs) are rectified to on-responses, comparable to a light adapted wt retina. However, as noted by the Reviewer our interpretation was: not immediately consistent with the argument that you give in the discussion based on adaptation<italic>.</italic> This was a very helpful point. First in the context of discussing the AP results, one may have assumed we were suggesting the outer segments were also light adapted (in the dark). Second, if the ribbonless dark adapted retina had adapted its inner retina circuitry similar to a light adapted wt retina, then dim light should be less efficiently transmitted via the rbc-AII pathway; thus, less likely to produce a normal frequency of APs.</p><p>Therefore, here we addressed compensation as outlined above (resetting of the rbc-AII synapse, or rerouting rod signals via the secondary rod-cone pathway). Third, and apart from APs, we took into consideration that a light adapted wt primary rod pathway influences contrast and spatial coding between 10 to 100 R*/(sec/rod) (Ke et al. , 2014). In the paper by Okawa et al. 2019 the Ribeye-ko responses to chirps on a mean luminance of 50 R*/(sec/rod) were the most significantly impaired with respect to encoding spatial frequency and contrast (Figure 7g; Owaka). This finding is inconsistent with a light adapted primary rod pathway, but instead indicates a</p><p>functional impairment that may reflect deficits in the primary pathway; however, the</p><p>rod secondary on-pathway or cone deficits may also contribute to the impaired responses.</p><p>We did not discuss the AP-4 induced slowing of miniEPSC frequency as reported by</p><p>Okawa et al. 2019.
