changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) that initiate mechano-homeostasis dysregulation are not defined in human disease. By integrated multiscale biomechanical and biological analyses of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung tissue, we identify that increased tissue stiffness is a function of dysregulated post-translational collagen cross-linking rather than any collagen concentration increase whilst at the nanometre-scale collagen fibrils are structurally and functionally abnormal with increased stiffness, reduced swelling ratio, and reduced diameter. In ex vivo and animal models of lung fibrosis, dual inhibition of lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) 2 and LOXL3 was sufficient to normalise collagen fibrillogenesis, reduce tissue stiffness, and improve lung function in vivo. Thus, in human fibrosis, altered collagen architecture is a key determinant of abnormal ECM structure-function, and inhibition of pyridinoline cross-linking can maintain mechano-homeostasis to limit the self-sustaining effects of ECM on progressive fibrosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36354.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of the lung, which scars the tissue and gradually destroys the organ, ultimately leading to death. It is still unclear what exactly causes this scarring, but it is thought that increasing amounts of proteins in the space surrounding the cells of the lungs, the extracellular matrix, could play a role.</p><p>These proteins, including collagen, normally form a ‘scaffold’ to stabilize cells, but if they accumulate uncontrollably, they can render tissues rigid. It has been assumed that these changes are a consequence of the disease. However, recent evidence suggests that the increased stiffness itself could stimulate cells to produce even more extracellular matrix, driving the progression of the disease. A better understanding of what exactly causes the tissue to become gradually stiffer may identify new ways to block the progression of IPF.</p><p>Now, Jones et al. compared measurements of the tissue stiffness and the collagen structure taken from samples of patients with IPF. The results showed that the collagen fibres were faulty and had an abnormal shape. This suggests that these problems, rather than an increased amount of collagen, alter the flexibility of the lung tissue.</p><p>Jones et al. also found that a specific family of proteins, which helps to connect the collagen fibres, was increased in the tissue of patients with IPF. When these proteins were blocked with a newly developed drug, the collagen structure returned to normal and the stiffness of the tissue decreased. As a consequence, the lung capacity improved.</p><p>This suggests that treatment approaches that help to maintain a normal collagen structure, may in future prevent the stiffening of the lung tissue and so limit feed-forward mechanisms that drive progressive IPF. Moreover, it indicates that measurements of the structure of collagen rather than the its total concentration could serve as a more suitable indicator for the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>lysyl oxidase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100638/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Mark G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-136950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ask</surname><given-names>Kjetil</given-names></name><name><surname>Gauldie</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolb</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009187</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conforti</surname><given-names>Franco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>638258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahajan</surname><given-names>Sumeet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thurner</surname><given-names>Philipp J</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Donna E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000351</institution-id><institution>British Lung Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG14-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Donna E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000351</institution-id><institution>British Lung Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IPFPG12-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Donna E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nanoscale changes to individual collagen fibrils drive lung fibrosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibrotic diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and their prevalence is increasing with an ageing population. Within the lung, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is considered the prototypic chronic progressive fibrotic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raghu et al., 2011</xref>). Treatment options are limited, and with a median survival of less than 3 years from diagnosis, more effective therapies are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richeldi et al., 2017</xref>). Whilst the exact mechanisms of progressive lung fibrosis are uncertain, IPF is thought to result from repetitive micro-injuries to the alveolar epithelium promoting fibroblast differentiation into extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myofibroblasts. Persistent myofibroblast activation results in ECM deposition which eventually destroys normal alveolar architecture and disrupts gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirk et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>Excessive deposition of fibrillar collagens is considered synonymous with fibrosis. Fibrillar collagens are a major component of lung ECM that form a scaffold to support tissue architecture and are a primary determinant of tissue stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Senior et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2015</xref>). During biosynthesis, collagen molecules acquire several post-translational modifications, including lysine hydroxylation and oxidation that are critical to the structure and biological functions of this protein. Oxidative deamination of lysine or hydroxylysine initiates cross-linking reactions that are essential to stabilise the supramolecular assembly of collagen and produce stable collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shoulders and Raines, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadler et al., 1996</xref>). The lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzymes are a family of five secreted copper-dependent amine oxidases (LOX and LOX-like (LOXL) 1 to 4) that are responsible for post-translational modification of collagen in the ECM to initiate covalent cross-linking. LOX family members have been implicated as possible therapeutic targets in cancers and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trackman, 2016</xref>). The type of LOX/LOXL mediated collagen cross-link is determined by the hydroxylation of telopeptidyl and helical lysine residues in collagen prior to cross-link formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamauchi and Sricholpech, 2012</xref>), with increased hydroxylation of telopeptide lysine residues by lysyl hydroxylase 2/procollagen lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (LH2/PLOD2) proposed to be a general fibrotic phenomenon causing increased hydroxyallysine derived pyridinoline cross-links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brinckmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van der Slot et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Both ECM amount and altered post-translational modifications are postulated to increase matrix stiffness and this stiffening has been proposed to induce self-sustaining mesenchymal cell activation and progressive fibrosis in a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wipff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Whilst there is a growing understanding of mechanosensitive cellular pathways that are activated by increased ECM stiffness, the specific changes in ECM structure and function that disrupt mechano-homeostasis have not been defined in human fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgstaller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tschumperlin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrera et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate this, we performed the first integrated multiscale structure-function analysis of human fibrosis tissue, and then extended our findings into mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo. We identify that, at the time of diagnosis, in human lung fibrosis tissue altered collagen architecture rather than collagen concentration is a key determinant of abnormal ECM structure-function, and that targeting pathways which dysregulate collagen architecture may restore ECM homeostasis and so prevent persistent mechanosensitive cellular activation and fibrosis progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased mature collagen cross-linking but not total collagen content increases stiffness of IPF tissue</title><p>We performed an integrated biochemical and biomechanical characterisation comparing human IPF lung tissue with age-matched control lung tissue.

Rats received either a replication-defective adenoviral vector producing active TGF-β<sub>1</sub> (AdTGF-β<sub>1</sub>) or vector only control (AdDL) on day 0, and then oral administration of PXS-S3B (15 or 30 mg/kg/day) from day 1 to day 28 at which point lung function was assessed before the animals were euthanised for biochemical and histological analysis of the lungs. There was no effect of PXS-S3B on total collagen content of the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), but there was a significant reduction in fibrosis compared to vehicle-treated AdTGF-β<sub>1</sub> rats, as assessed by modified Ashcroft scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>), and a significant improvement in lung function (i.e. a reduction in lung stiffness as measured by pressure-driven pressure volume-loops and elastance) at day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>), reflecting our in vitro finding that LOXL2/LOXL3 inhibition reduces tissue stiffness. This was accompanied by a reduction in mature pyridinoline collagen cross-links compared with the AdTGF-β-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>), as well as immature (DHLNL + HLNL) cross-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). We also determined that the DHLNL:HLNL ratio was reduced in the treated rats suggesting a reduction in lysine hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Consistent with this, analysis of mRNA expression in the lungs of animals treated with LOXL2/LOXL3 inhibitor, revealed a decrease in LH2, which is required for telopeptide hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links. In addition, expression of other modulators of fibrillogenesis including collagen V, TGM2, dermatopontin, fibulin, fibrillin, and periostin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>) were reduced. Thus, inhibition of LOXL2/LOXL3 not only modifies collagen cross-linking but also modulates fibrillar collagen homeostasis.

A major goal of this study was to perform an integrated biomechanical and biochemical characterisation of fibrillar collagen and its pathological role in human fibrosis. We demonstrate that dysregulated collagen fibrillogenesis is a key pathway of human lung fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, with structurally and functionally abnormal collagen – rather than collagen content - increasing lung tissue stiffness as a consequence of pathologic pyridinoline cross-linking. To advance our mechanistic understanding of these findings, we employed small molecule LOXL inhibitors and demonstrate that dual inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3 is sufficient to prevent accumulation of these pyridinoline cross-links. This normalises the structure and biomechanical properties of fibrillar collagen, and reduces tissue stiffness without the need to significantly disrupt fibril assembly. Our findings suggest that this targeted inhibition reduces the disruption of mechano-homeostasis to limit the self-sustaining effects of ECM on progressive fibrosis.</p><p>A thought provoking finding of our studies is that total collagen concentration, as determined by measurement of hydroxyproline that quantifies all collagen irrespective of whether it is assembled into fibrils, was not significantly increased in IPF tissue. Whilst Selman <italic>et al</italic> identified an increase in collagen of fibrotic lung biopsy samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Selman et al., 1986</xref>), other studies have reported no significant increase in collagen deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nkyimbeng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fulmer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Westergren-Thorsson et al., 2017</xref>), or have reported increased collagen deposition only in late stage disease at autopsy, but not in diagnostic lung biopsy samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirk et al., 1986</xref>). This suggests that, at the time of diagnosis, any increase in collagen is paralleled by changes in other proteins (most likely other ECM and myofibroblastic cellular proteins), but that by late-stage fibrosis there may be a progressive increase in collagen accumulation, perhaps as the fibrotic tissue becomes more acellular and/or the collagen resists degradation. Furthermore, although we identified an increase in stiffness of IPF lung tissue using AFM micro-indentation, this was not related to collagen concentration. Rather, increased mature fibrillar collagen pyridinoline cross-linking secondary to dysregulated post-translational modification was a primary determinant of tissue stiffness.</p><p>Fibrillar collagen is a predominant component of the ECM which provides tissues with essential tensile strength by forming a hierarchical assembly of substructures dependent upon their cross-linking: tropocollagen molecules assemble into fibrils and the fibrils further assemble into fibres. Here, we identified that collagen hierarchical assembly is altered at the nanoscale/ultrastructural level in IPF. Collagen fibrils were structurally and functionally abnormal with reduced diameter and increased stiffness, suggesting that at a molecular level they have the potential to influence the microenvironment of individual cells to affect their biomechanical sensing. Covalent cross-links have been proposed to increase fibril stiffness by forming a lateral network of linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miles et al., 2005</xref>). In models of artificially cross-linked collagen fibrils, it was observed that by drawing the collagen molecules closer together there was a reduction in water between molecules; as a consequence, the density of collagen fibrils increased and this was proposed to affect their mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miles et al., 2005</xref>). Whether a similar effect occurs after enzymatic cross-linking, especially pathological cross-linking involving pyridinoline cross-links, remains to be determined. However, the reduction in fibril diameter and lesser fibril swelling with hydration of IPF fibrils would be consistent with this concept. Whilst direct experimental evidence is required to determine whether collagen swelling is directly related to cross-linking, collagen hydration alone has been shown to significantly influence individual collagen fibril mechanics and the mechanism of molecular slippage and stretching within fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andriotis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gautieri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Several different mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to alterations in tissue stiffness including LOX/LOXL and transglutaminase 2 (TGM2)-mediated enzymatic cross-linking and non-enzymatic glycation. Here we have focussed on the LOX and LOXL enzymes which play key roles in the process of fibrillar collagen production, with expression being tightly controlled in normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trackman, 2016</xref>). Whilst LOXL2 has been proposed to have pathologic roles in cancer and fibrosis (Barker et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry-Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>), and increased LOXL2 expression in IPF stroma has been observed previously, less is understood regarding LOXL3. Previous studies have identified that it is expressed in human IPF lung tissue, has amine oxidase activity for collagens, is induced by fibroblast culture on IPF cell-derived ECM, and is an enhancer and key regulator of integrin signalling in myofibre formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraft-Sheleg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Kim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philp et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, both LOXL2 and LOXL3 were identified to be crucial for fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in in vitro models of lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aumiller et al., 2017</xref>). In keeping with our finding of increased LOXL expression together with increased LH2 expression in IPF tissue, we identified an increase in mature hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links in IPF lung tissue, consistent with a previous report of an increase in mature DPD cross-links in fibrotic lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Last et al., 1990</xref>). The extent of lysine hydroxylation can vary from 15 to 90% depending on the collagen types and, even within type I collagen, it varies significantly from tissue to tissue and under physiological or pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamauchi and Sricholpech, 2012</xref>). Although it is unknown whether LOXL2 and/or LOXL3 have a substrate preference for hydroxylysine, the shift from a skin (allysine-derived) to a bone-type (hydroxyallysine-derived) of collagen cross-link appears of pathogenetic importance in IPF.</p><p>Various approaches have investigated the roles of collagen cross-linking by LOX/LOXL enzymes in fibrosis. Multiple studies have tested BAPN as a broad-spectrum LOX/LOXL inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trackman, 2016</xref>), although this approach has no therapeutic potential as it does not enable specific enzyme targeting and has undesirable effects on LOX leading to unwanted vascular and skeletal side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wawzonek et al., 1955</xref>). A monoclonal antibody which binds and partially inhibits LOXL2, showed efficacy in the bleomycin mouse model of lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry-Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). However, recently, a Phase 2 study in IPF of simtuzumab, the humanised version of this antibody, was terminated due to lack of efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raghu et al., 2017</xref>). Our finding of differential expression of LOXL2, LOXL3 and LOXL4 in IPF tissue suggests that therapeutic targeting of additional LOXL family members is required to inhibit pathologic collagen cross-linking. To investigate this finding, we used dual LOXL2 and LOXL3-selective inhibitors which irreversibly inhibit LOXL2 and LOXL3 but are reversible and more than a hundred times less potent for inhibition of LOX and LOXL1. Characterisation in a novel 3D in vitro model of human fibrosis enabled direct measurement of the influence of LOXL2/LOXL3 inhibition upon pathological changes in collagen structure-function.</p><p>A key finding of our study is that approximately 70% of maximal reduction in tissue stiffness in vitro occurred following selective inhibition of only LOXL2/LOXL3 when pyridinoline cross-links were significantly reduced and fibril diameter was normalised, whilst fibril architecture was preserved and only a small increase in protease-sensitive collagen solubility was evident. Together our data suggest that in lung fibrosis reducing pathological collagen cross-linking normalises fibril architecture and is sufficient to reduce tissue stiffness without the need to completely disrupt fibril assembly. While LOXL4 was also increased in IPF, our dose-response findings from the parallel plate compression system suggest that it does not make a significant contribution to tissue stiffness. In comparison with selective LOXL2/LOXL3 inhibition in the current study, previous studies treating tendon constructs from days 14 to 21 with the pan LOX/LOXL inhibitor BAPN showed that collagen fibrils were irregular with widely dispersed diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herchenhan et al., 2015</xref>) and we observed a similar effect of BAPN in the current study. Thus, while pan LOX/LOXL inhibition disrupts normal collagen fibrillogenesis, selective LOXL2/LOXL3 inhibition was sufficient to prevent pathological collagen crosslinking and restore fibrillar collagen homeostasis.</p><p>Although reduction in hydroxyproline measurements of collagen is recommended as a primary measure of anti-fibrotic efficacy during preclinical animal model testing of putative therapeutics for lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">ATS Assembly on Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology et al., 2017</xref>), our data from human tissue obtained at time of diagnosis identifies that effects on collagen fibrillogenesis are more relevant pathogenic mechanisms with abnormal collagen cross-linking and increased tissue stiffness likely to precede any accumulation of collagen in late-stage human pulmonary fibrosis. Consistent with our proposal, in a rat carbon tetrachloride-induced model of liver injury, increased liver stiffness was associated with increased collagen cross-linking and this was proposed to prime the liver to respond quickly to injury via mechanical feed-forward mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perepelyuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georges et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The relevance of LOXL2/LOXL3-selective inhibition was demonstrated in a TGF-β-driven rat model of lung fibrosis. The model leads to persistent and severe interstitial fibrosis and does not have the confounding robust inflammatory response observed in the commonly studied bleomycin induced mouse model of fibrosis so enabling direct assessment of fibrotic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sime et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">ATS Assembly on Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology et al., 2017</xref>). Selective targeting of LOXL2 and LOXL3 in this model reduced pyridinoline collagen cross-links, reduced fibrosis, and improved lung function without a significant effect on hydroxyproline content. Whilst this did not completely restore lung function back to normal, there was a significant beneficial effect even in this model of fibrosis which is very strongly driven by TGF-β. An interesting finding was that inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3 reduced expression of genes known to influence collagen fibrillogenesis including LH2, collagen V, TGM2, dermatopontin, fibulin, fibrillin, and periostin. As these genes, as well as LOXL2 and LH2 are induced by TGF-β, one possible explanation is that TGF-β plays a causal role in fibrosis by disrupting collagen homeostasis to drive abnormal collagen cross-linking and promoting assembly of stiffer collagen fibrils. This change in stiffness initiates self-sustaining mechanosensory signalling pathways in a feed-forward mechanism to drive fibroblast activation and progressive fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tschumperlin et al., 2018</xref>). Given the important contribution of fibrillar collagen in forming a scaffold that supports tissue architecture, our data identify that normalising the biomechanical properties of fibrillar collagen in lung fibrosis may reset mechanosensitive cellular mechanisms and aid restoration of tissue function more effectively than approaches that promote extensive collagen degradation, since significant loss of ECM structure is itself pathological, as evidenced by the emphysematous lung.</p><p>In summary, this integrated study identifies that altered collagen architecture is a key determinant of abnormal ECM structure-function in human lung fibrosis at time of diagnosis. Dual inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3 reduces pathological pyridinoline cross-links, normalises collagen morphology, reduces tissue stiffness, and improves lung function. Thus, targeting pathways which dysregulate collagen architecture may restore ECM homeostasis and so prevent persistent mechanosensitive cellular activation and fibrosis progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Lung tissue sampling</title><p>All human lung experiments were approved by the Southampton and South West Hampshire and the Mid and South Buckinghamshire Local Research Ethics Committees (ref 07/H0607/73), and all subjects gave written informed consent.

After 6 weeks the spheroids were either harvested into RNA<italic>later</italic> (Sigma) for RNA extraction, snap frozen for parallel-plate compression testing, analysis of cross-linking, and histochemical staining, or fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for histochemistry or 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4 for electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tinctorial stains</title><p>4–7 μm sections were analysed using PicroSirius Red (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or Masson’s Trichrome (Sigma, Poole, UK) stain according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Images were acquired using a Dot-Slide scanning system (Olympus, Southend-on-Sea, UK) with PicroSirius Red staining visualised under polarised light. PicroSirius Red images were converted to 16-bit and pseudo-coloured through application of the Yellow Lookup Table within Fiji (version 1·49 c).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Protein, hydroxyproline and collagen cross-link analysis</title><p>Samples were thawed and reduced with KBH<sub>4</sub> before acid hydrolysis in 6M HCl at 102°C for 18 hr. Cooled hydrolysed samples were evaporated to dryness under vacuum and then resuspended in 200 μL HPLC-grade H<sub>2</sub>O. Total protein was quantified in the hydrolysed samples using a genipin-based amino acid assay (QuickZyme Biosciences, Leiden, The Netherlands), using standard hydrolysed bovine serum albumin as standard.</p><p>Total collagen content was estimated using either ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) or by colorimetric assay of hydroxyproline (Hyp) based on the reaction of oxidized hydroxyproline with 4-(Dimethylamino)benzaldehyde, as per manufacturer’s instruction (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). The molar content of collagen was estimated from hydroxyproline using a conversion factor of 300 hydroxyprolines per triple helix, and mass of collagen was estimated using a molecular weight of 300 kDa per triple helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Collagen cross-links were determined using either UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS or ELISA as indicated in the figure legends. Total mature pyridinium cross-links (PYD +DPD) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, cross-links were first extracted from the hydrolysate using an automated solid phase extraction system (Gilson GX-271 ASPECA system) employing reversed-phase C18-Aq columns (GracePure, ThermoFisher Scientific, Australia) followed by SCX strong cation exchange columns. After extraction and drying, the cross-links were converted into heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) salts for analysis by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS on a Thermo Dionex UHPLC and TSQ Endura triple quad mass spectrometer. UHPLC separation of cross-links was achieved with an Agilent Rapid Resolution High Definition (RRHD) SB-C18 column. UHPLC was performed using a 12-min gradient flow of the mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid, 0.1% HFBA in H<sub>2</sub>O) from 96.2% to 0% and mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid, 0.1% HFBA in 80% MeOH) from 3.8% to 100% at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and with a column temperature of 40°C. Positive ESI-MS/MS with Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode was performed using the following parameters: Spray voltage 4000 V; sheath gas 35 (Arb); aux gas 20 (Arb); sweep gas 0 (Arb); ion transfer tube temperature 350°C; vaporiser temperature 300°C. Standards used for quantitation of collagen cross-links or total collagen in hydrolysates by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS were: DHLNL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scoresby, Australia), HLNL (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada), PYD and DPD (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, USA) and hydroxyproline (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). Quantitation of the collagen cross-links and total collagen was achieved by comparing to a standard curve. Sample values were interpolated using GraphPad Prism seven software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Parallel plate compression testing</title><p>To determine the stiffness characteristics (Young’s modulus, <italic>E</italic>) of the 3D in vitro model of fibrosis, cultures were subjected to parallel plate compression testing using a CellScale MicroSquisher fitted with a round tungsten cantilever (thickness 406.4 nm) and accompanying SquisherJoy V5.23 software (CellScale, Ontario, Canada). The fluid bath test chamber was filled with sterile PBS, and the stage and optics calibrated following the manufacturer’s instructions. Example test sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>. Samples were subjected to five testing cycles under hydrated conditions, each achieving 25% engineering strain (deformation) over a 15 s compression phase, followed by a 2 s hold, recovery over 15 s, and a 2 s resting period. The first four cycles allowed preconditioning of the tissue, and the resulting force vs time curves could be seen to have stabilised by the fifth compression cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Analysis of stress vs strain relationships was carried out using the compression phase of the fifth cycle from where sample stiffness can be inferred. Here, we restrict ourselves to the estimation of the Young’s modulus of the biological material in hydrated state.</p><p>Force and displacement data were transformed to engineering stress versus engineering strain plots using the horizontal cross-sectional diameter of the sample immediately before the start of each test. Young’s modulus (<italic>E</italic>), a measure of stiffness, was calculated using a modified Hertzian half-space contact mechanics model for elastic spheres as previously described (Kim et al., 2010), averaging between values of <italic>E</italic> calculated for both the horizontal and vertical radii of the quasi-spherical cultures. This calculation requires the value of the Poisson’s ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>ν</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Given the narrow range in which this value lies, the relative insensitivity of the calculations to this material parameter, and significant difficulty in their direct measurement for small biological samples, here we make use of estimated values taken as 0.5, which is realistic for a range of biological matter. All stress-strain curves show an initial 'toe' region, where the stress increases slowly, followed by a linear region, approximately between 10% and 20% strain. The stiffness of the tissue was obtained by averaging the computed values of <italic>E</italic> within this linear range.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Samples were post-fixed sequentially in osmium/ferrocyanide fixative, thiocarbohydrazide solution, osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate and Walton’s lead aspartate solution before dehydration in graded ethanol and acetonitrile. Samples were embedded in Spurr resin and 100 nm ultra-thin sections visualised using an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA). For measurement of fibril diameters images were acquired at 87,000x magnification. Measurements of fibril diameter from two independent experiments were made by two operators in parallel blinded to the treatment conditions using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) (Version 1.50 g). The shortest axis of each fibril was measured with a total of 300 measurements per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Collagen matrix solubility assay</title><p>To assess collagen solubility samples from the 3D in vitro model of lung fibrosis were subjected to sequential collagen extraction under increasingly stringent conditions as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, samples were subjected to sequential overnight incubations in 1) neutral salt (Tris buffered saline containing protease inhibitors); 2) 0.5M acetic acid with protease inhibitors; and 3) 0.5M acetic acid containing 700 units/mL pepsin (Sigma, Poole, UK). Each fraction, and the remaining solid (insoluble highly cross-linked) fraction, was hydrolysed in 6M HCl at 102°C for 18 hr and the collagen content of each fraction determined by colorimetric hydroxyproline assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Adenovirus TGF-β model</title><p>Studies in rats were performed at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) according to guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of McMaster University under protocol # 16-04-14. Sample sizes were based on previous studies in the laboratory where the studies were performed and were chosen to balance the ability to measure significant differences while reducing the number of animals used. Female Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Montreal, Canada) were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> pfu of either a replication-deficient adenoviral vector carrying an active TGF-β1 (AdTGF-β1) expression construct to induce progressive pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sime et al., 1997</xref>) or vector only control (AdDL) on Day 0. Treatment groups received LOXL2/LOXL3 inhibitor (15 or 30 mg/kg/day dosed daily via the oral route) from day 1 to day 28; control groups received vehicle (PBS). On day 28, lung function was assessed using forced oscillation manoeuvres with a FlexiVent system (SCIREQ Scientific Respiratory Equipment, Montreal, Canada) to measure pressure-volume loops, resistance (R), compliance (C), and elastance (E) of the respiratory system. Animals were then euthanised and the left lung lobe inflated under constant pressure and fixed in 10% formalin for histological examination of tissue sections by staining with picrosirius red and viewing under polarised light. Fibrosis was assessed by six independent, trained individuals who were blinded to the treatment conditions using a modified Ashcroft score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonniaud et al., 2005</xref>). All right lung lobes were combined, flash frozen and ground into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen and stored for quantitation of collagen and its cross links, and for RNA analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism v7.02 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) unless otherwise indicated. No data were excluded from the studies and for all experiments, all attempts at replication were successful. For each experiment, sample size reflects the number of independent biological replicates and is provided in the figure legend. Normality of distribution was assessed using the D’Agostino-Pearson normality test. Statistical analyses of single comparisons of two groups utilised Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for parametric and non-parametric data respectively. Where appropriate, individual <italic>t</italic>-test results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test or Kruskal-Wallis analysis with Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. In the in vitro studies, repeated measures (RM) ANOVA was used in order to treat data from each donor as a matched set. Sphericity of the repeated measures was assumed since the experiments were designed as randomised blocks. Multivariate correlations were performed using JMP software v13.1.0 (SAS, Marlow, UK) applying the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method to handle missing data. Results were considered significant if p&lt;0.05, where *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Training Fellowship (100638/Z/12/Z), the Medical Research Council (MRC, Grant number G0900453), the Medical Research Foundation (MRF-091–0003-RG-CONFO), the British Lung Foundation (RG14-4 and IPFPG12-2), and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (MOP-136950).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bela Suki (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an excellent and very interesting manuscript that shows that the collagen structure and its mature cross-linking, rather than the collagen quantity, change during pulmonary fibrosis, leading to the disruption of mechanobiological homeostasis of the lung. It is clearly demonstrated that the fibrotic lung matrix is stiffer than normal lung matrix, and that this stiffness is secondary to changes in collagen nanostructure rather than in the collagen content. Although some of the conclusions reported here have been reached by some other authors using animal models, this manuscript is a more comprehensive study, with strong focus on the human lung. Notably, the authors also show that the selective inhibition of one set of LOX genes, LOXL2/LOXL3 may provide therapeutic benefits. The studies are rigorous and will be of major interest to the field.</p><p>The reviewers also raised some concerns that can be addressed through revisions of the manuscript, and in one instance by including some additional experimental data. We would encourage the authors to address these comments and further increase the already high value and impact of this manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is intuitively difficult to see how there cannot be a difference in total collagen content, given the severely thickened interstitium in fibrotic lung tissue. Please clarify if this thickening can be fully explained by accumulation of mesenchymal cells, and if the hydroxyproline content is the only way (or the right way) to assess the collagen contents in this case. Also, It would be useful to better reconcile some of the data obtained here with previous publications that show clear evidence of increased collagen deposition.</p><p>2) The major claim of the study is that it is not collagen deposition, but cross-linking that really matters in lung fibrosis. Related to this claim, total collagen concentration in Figure 1E showed no difference between normal and IPF lungs. However, the cellular behavior is affected by the what could matter is the local concentration of collagen, and the images in Figure 1 indicate that there is a heterogeneity in collagen density of collagen between different areas of the lung. Apparently, the AFM measurements were also taken in a single location. The heterogeneity of the diseased lung is an important factor, possibly even more important that the measured mean values. The authors should provide additional measurements that would address the issue of heterogeneity of the lung composition and stiffness.</p><p>3) The authors downplayed the importance of immature as opposed to mature crosslinks on tissue stiffness. In Figure 3, it's surprising that the mature cross-links are so strongly associated with stiffness. Please explain and document if there is a relationship between stiffness and DHLNL alone. In Figure 5 I, J, immature crosslinks appear more important contributors to stiffness than the authors acknowledge in the text.</p><p>4) Another important issue is collagen hydration, as it has large influence on both collagen stiffness (Yang et al., 2008) and collagen fibril diameter up to a max diameter after which it shows a plateau (Fratzl and Daxer. Biophys J 1993, 64, (4), 1210-4). The stress-strain curves of hydrated and dry fibrils are very different and the mechanism of molecular slippage and stretching within the fibrils depend on the hydration of the fibril (Gautieri et al., 2011). Thus, it is possible that the fibrotic lungs are dry compared to the normal lung which, next to cross-linking, also contributes significantly to the difference in stiffness. Notably, cross-linking could change collagen hydration and thereby have important contribution to stiffness. Even though hydration is touched upon in the discussion, it should be addressed in more detail.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36354.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is intuitively difficult to see how there cannot be a difference in total collagen content, given the severely thickened interstitium in fibrotic lung tissue.

Whilst visualisation of a 2D histological section through immunohistochemical or second harmonic generation imaging may identify an increase in collagen in these areas, it is not able to identify whether this increase is in isolation, or proportional to other ECM and cellular components i.e. the absolute amount of collagen may increase without any increase in the relative amount. We applied hydroxyproline as it is a reference standard for biochemical quantitation of all forms of collagen irrespective of whether it is assembled into fibrils. We identified that total collagen relative to dry weight or total protein (i.e. in proportion to other lung constituents) is not increased at the time of diagnosis. Consistent with our findings, the largest comparable study (Kirk et al., 1986) identified no increase in collagen concentration assessed by hydroxyproline in biopsy samples vs control samples. Only in autopsy samples was an increase in collagen concentration identified. This suggests that any long-term increase in collagen concentration is a downstream event is of less pathogenetic relevance than the changes in cross-linking and structure we have identified to be present at time of diagnosis. We have expanded our Discussion to further discuss these points (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The major claim of the study is that it is not collagen deposition, but cross-linking that really matters in lung fibrosis. Related to this claim, total collagen concentration in Figure 1E showed no difference between normal and IPF lungs.

The authors should provide additional measurements that would address the issue of heterogeneity of the lung composition and stiffness.</p></disp-quote><p>In lung fibrosis there is marked histological heterogeneity over the micrometre scale in tissue sections (usually 3-4 μm thick). The AFM analyses were performed on 50 μm thick sections, with 80 to 150 force-displacement curve measurements taken at 6 to 11 sites across the tissue sample, and so the measurements are representative of the whole tissue sample studied. We have included these specific details in the Materials and methods (subsection “Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Experiments”, second paragraph). Whilst IPF tissue is heterogeneous, our in vitro model of fibrosis is homogeneous, and our data are consistent with our tissue findings: thus, within the model (Figure 6H) collagen concentration did not influence tissue stiffness whilst cross-linking did. To directly investigate the heterogeneity of lung composition and stiffness at a cellular level would require consideration of multiple factors, not only those influencing collagen mechanics (collagen cross-linking, concentration, topology, hydration) at that site but also the presence of other ECM proteins and the cells themselves. This would require significant methodological development to enable co-registration of these multiple readouts at the μm scale which is beyond our current capabilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors downplayed the importance of immature as opposed to mature crosslinks on tissue stiffness.

As requested by the reviewer, we examined the relationship with DHLNL cross-links alone in our tissue analysis and found a trend towards a correlation however this was not statistically significant (correlation 0.407, p=0.09); with HLNL no correlation was observed (correlation 0.242, p=0.33). We have included a statement describing this within the results (subsection “Increased mature collagen cross-linking but not total collagen content increases stiffness of IPF tissue”, last paragraph). Within our in vitro analyses a relationship with immature cross-links was identified, although that with mature cross-links was stronger. We have now directly commented upon this contribution of immature cross-links (subsection “LOXL2/LOXL3-selective inhibition of collagen cross-linking reduces tissue stiffness”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another important issue is collagen hydration, as it has large influence on both collagen stiffness (Yang et al., 2008) and collagen fibril diameter up to a max diameter after which it shows a plateau (Fratzl and Daxer.

It is an interesting idea that fibrotic lung tissue is drier than normal lung. It is notable that in IPF the sites of active fibrosis have multiple ECM components with high affinity for water such as hydrophilic proteoglycans (Bensadoun et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1996;154:1819-1828). Conceivably these could compete locally with the collagen fibrils for water molecules to further affect fibril stiffness.</p></body></sub-article></article>
