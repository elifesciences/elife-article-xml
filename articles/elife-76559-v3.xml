disparities in the publishing process. We used longitudinal publication data on 431,207 authors in four disciplines - basic medicine, biology, chemistry and clinical medicine - to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on the annual publishing rates of men and women. In a difference-in-differences analysis, we estimated that the average gender difference in publication productivity increased from –0.26 in 2019 to –0.35 in 2020; this corresponds to the output of women being 17% lower than the output of men in 2109, and 24% lower in 2020. An age-group comparison showed a widening gender gap for both early-career and mid-career scientists. The increasing gender gap was most pronounced among highly productive authors and in biology and clinical medicine. Our study demonstrates the importance of reinforcing institutional commitments to diversity through policies that support the inclusion and retention of women in research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>scientific productivity</kwd><kwd>publishing</kwd><kwd>gender bias</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>academia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008395</institution-id><institution>Samfund og Erhverv, Det Frie Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-0133-00165B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madsen</surname><given-names>Emil Bargmann</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Mathias Wullum</given-names></name><name><surname>Bjørnholm</surname><given-names>Josefine</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Jens Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002739</institution-id><institution>Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AUFF-F-2018-7-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Jens Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9130-00029B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Mathias Wullum</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The gender gap in publication productivity has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with potential implications for the careers of women working in research.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gender disparities in academic publishing have widened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gender gaps in self-reported research activities have also increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lerchenmüller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muric et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ribarovska et al., 2021</xref>). However, the longitudinal effects of the pandemic on differences in annual publication outputs remain uncertain. In this study, we used individual-level panel data on the publication activities of 431,207 authors globally to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on the publishing rates of women and men.</p><p>Research on gender and publication productivity suggests that women (on average) publish fewer articles than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mairesse and Pezzoni, 2015</xref>), although the magnitude of this difference varies by career stage, discipline and country, and has diminished over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sax et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie and Schauman, 2005</xref>). The gender imbalance in publishing rates should be understood in the context of broader disparities in the science system. Structural variables such as employment rank, access to resources, university prestige, appointment type, teaching loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eagly, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>) and available time for research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guarino and Borden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leišytė, 2016</xref>) all partially explain the observed gender imbalances in publication productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Long, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xie and Shauman, 1998</xref>). In addition, research finds that women scientists (compared to men) tend to span more topics in their research activities, face stricter editorial standards in peer reviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hengel, 2017</xref>), and take on greater shares of parenthood responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derrick et al., 2021</xref>), which also likely perpetuate publishing disparities.</p><p>Recent research has identified two primary mechanisms through which the pandemic may have amplified existing disparities in publishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King and Frederickson, 2021</xref>). First, evidence from national and international surveys indicates that women scientists have taken the lion’s share of the extra childcare and domestic responsibilities imposed by lockdowns of schools and daycares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deryugina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Staniscuaski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yildirim and Eslen-Ziya, 2020</xref>). According to surveys of self-reported research activities, women scientists – especially those with young dependents – have seen notable productivity decreases in the wake of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deryugina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Myers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Staniscuaski et al., 2021</xref>). Second, transitions to online teaching during university lockdowns required extra hours of planning and preparation and may have affected women scientists more than men due to observed disparities in average teaching loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eagly, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King and Frederickson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>). Survey-based evidence from the United States also indicates that the extra time spent on teaching partially accounts for observed decreases in scientists’ self-reported publication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2021</xref>). In clinical medicine, service demands related to care for COVID-19 patients and transitions to virtual care delivery for many others may also have disproportionately affected women, who are more likely to be represented on clinician-educator rather than traditional tenure tracks at medical schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This study is, to our knowledge, the first to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on the annual publishing rates of women and men. We used a linked dataset of 431,207 authors and 2,113,108 publications and a difference-in-differences specification to estimate how the gender difference in average publishing rates changed from 2019–2020.</p><p>We rely on author-disambiguated publication data from Clarivate’s Web of Science, restricting our focus to scientists with &gt;2 publications within basic medicine, biology, chemistry and clinical medicine. We chose these fields as they are well-represented in Web of Science (more than 90% of references are included in Web of Science), their primary knowledge production mode is through journal publication (unlike, for example, computer science, many fields of engineering, and the humanities), research is comparatively collaborative (although some areas of clinical research have somewhat more authors), publishing is relatively fast (compared to, for example, the social sciences). Basic medicine, biology and clinical medicine also have some of the highest shares of women scientists in the natural sciences.</p><p>We report annual, per-author publishing rates based on a full and fractional counting. The full counting gives the raw sum of all papers published by a scientist in a given year. The fractional counting gives the sum of the reciprocal of the number of authors per paper published by a scientist.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The following results use a main sample consisting of two scientist cohorts, one with first publication year in 2009 or 2010 (&quot;mid-career&quot;, n = 137,767) and one with first publication year in 2016 or 2017 (&quot;early-career&quot;, n = 293,440). Unless mentioned otherwise, the combined cohort (n = 431,207) is used. A third, counterfactual cohort (n = 276,793) is used to contrast the early-career sample, as a means of estimating the expected attrition in the early-career stage, when a proportion of scientists leave academia.

For this sample, we observed a small but consistent annual increase in the marginal gender difference across years (from 2011–2015). In this case, the gender difference in productivity increased by 1/20 of a full publication (full count: –0.05, 99% CI: –0.0665; –0.0337) between year four (2014) and five (2015), amounting to 53% of the treatment effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Career-stage differences</title><p>Research suggests that the working conditions of early-career women scientists have been especially affected by the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krukowski et al., 2021</xref>).

Using individual-level panel data on a global sample of 431,207 authors, we observed small but consistent average increases in the gap between women’s and men’s annual publishing rates. This finding is consistent with extant research suggesting amplified gender disparities in manuscript submissions, first and last authorships, and self-reported research activities during COVID-19. However, unlike prior studies, we find that the gendered effects of COVID-19 are salient for early-career-scientists with four years of publication experience as well as for mid-career scientists with ten years of publication experience. While the numerical increase in the gender gap is largest for mid-career scientists, the relative change in the gender gap is biggest for early-career scientists. Moreover, we add to existing evidence by showing that the increase in the gender gap (in absolute terms) was most pronounced among highly productive authors and scientists working in clinical medicine and biology. Lastly, the widening gender gap appears to represent a genuine decline in publication productivity and not just a shift in author roles, as women continue to first author publications at similar rates as in prior years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Despite clear country variations in the observed effects, we found negligible and inconsistent associations between local COVID-19 restrictions and estimated changes in the productivity gender gap. Further, the ordering of countries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not seem to suggest that the gender-differentiated changes in productivity rates vary systematically according to a country’s level of gender equality, welfare model, or infection rate.</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that the publication productivity of already prolific women scientists have been affected the most by the pandemic. Those designing interventions to promote equity in academic science and medicine should strive to understand the reasons why highly prolific men appeared able to maintain their annual publication rates while highly prolific women were not. Prior research suggests that it is possible that men with the highest levels of productivity may have been more likely to have been rewarded with access to additional workplace supports, such as endowed professorships, in recognition of their achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gold et al., 2020</xref>). If so, this might have served as a cushion against the impact of the pandemic on those individuals. Moreover, if institutions prioritized protecting a few &quot;superstar&quot; researchers from teaching or clinical demands without clear processes for identifying which individuals received preferential treatment, the vast literature on unconscious bias suggests that such efforts might preferentially have protected outstanding men as compared to similarly outstanding women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">NASEM, 2007</xref>). Prior research also suggests that high-achieving women scientists may be more likely than their male peers to state that their partners’ careers take priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mody et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, it is possible that high-achieving men scientists’ partners may be particularly likely to be willing to make sacrifices in their own careers to take on additional domestic labor to allow continuation of their extraordinary partners’ work. If partners of extraordinarily productive women scientists are less willing to do so, and if this difference is even more marked than any differences that may exist when a scientist is less highly productive, this could also serve as a mechanism to drive the differences observed. Further research is necessary to investigate these and other possibilities.</p><p>The amplified effect in clinical medicine may be due to the dual research and clinical roles taken on by scientists in this discipline. Early research suggested that initial funding for COVID-19 related research was biased toward applications from men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Witteman et al., 2021</xref>), supporting a hypothesis that women spent disproportionally more time on clinical work or other demands around the time of the outbreak. However, further research is required to provide conclusive evidence on this question. The consequences of a systematically biased change in the work priorities for men and women in particularly clinical medicine can potentially reach far beyond the individual careers of those women affected by it. Research suggests a positive association between women’s participation as leading authors in medical research and a study’s likelihood of including sex and gender as analytical variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>). The omission of gender and sex analysis has been widespread in COVID-19-related clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brady et al., 2021</xref>), despite early evidence of sex-differences in the prognosis and outcome of the disease.</p><p>The widening gender-gap in publishing may be a detectable symptom of larger setbacks on issues of gender equity in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King and Frederickson, 2021</xref>). Indeed, recent research also shows widening gender disparities in research project initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2021</xref>) and clinical-trial leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cevik et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our study demonstrates the importance of reinforcing institutional commitments to gender equity through policies that support the inclusion and retention of women researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fulweiler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King and Frederickson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narayana et al., 2020</xref>). While our study focuses on gender, other marginalized groups are likely to suffer from similar set-backs, potentially to an even higher degree. These groups are generally under-studied in the the literature on productivity gaps, as they are much more difficult to identify quantitatively. Further research, with reliable data on especially ethnicity, and with an inter-sectional perspective is needed.</p><p>Data on individual publication rates gives us a better estimate of the effects of the pandemic on researcher productivity than most previously published analyses focusing on publication-level effects. Despite this, the data do not allow us to disentangle how much of the widening gender gap is due to attrition. If the relative share of women scientists opting out of an academic career is higher in 2020 compared to 2019, this may inflate the observed change in productivity. Future research should examine the potential changes in women’s and men’s attrition rates in closer detail. Further, the counter-factual analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> suggests a consistent increase in the size of gender productivity gap over time with a marginal annual change in the gender difference from year four to five amounting to 53% of the treatment effect observed in our main analysis. The estimated change from a 17% lower output for women than men in 2019 compared to 24% percent lower output for women than men in 2020 should thus be interpreted with some caution. However, both mechanisms - lower publication productivity and attrition - result in lower total publication outputs for women and lead to enlarged gender disparities. While we can not currently estimate the relationship between the two mechanisms, the conclusions above remain the same.</p><p>Our study design has four limitations. First, our analysis focused on annual publishing rates, which may obscure some of the potential effects of e.g. school closures on the immediate publishing rates. A more granular analysis of monthly publishing rates may reveal a more direct correlation between lockdowns and decreased publishing rates. However, information on when something is published is not available on a monthly basis for a large proportion of articles, and information on submission and review dates are even harder to obtain, often completely missing. Further, many of the delays occurring in the publishing process are out of the hand of authors and thus unrelated to the lockdown effect that they may be experiencing. By looking at annual data, we can estimate a more reliable effect overall. We strongly encourage publishers to make available transparent, open machine- and human-accessible information on which date a manuscript was received, reviewed, revised, accepted and published. Similarly, the weak relationship between country-level gender gaps and the severity of lockdown policies could be due to aggregation. Using survey data on self-reported time-use, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deryugina et al., 2022</xref> show that e.g. the fraction of days with at least partial primary school closures negatively affected time loss for women researchers relative to men in the period Feb. 16 - July 31, 2020. To compare our yearly publication data with lockdown severity, we aggregated day-to-day data on school closures, workplace closures, stay at home requirements, and overall lockdown severity across the entire year of 2020.</p><p>Second, the author-disambiguation approach used to establish individual-level panel data unavoidably introduces some level of uncertainty into our analysis, and errors are more likely to occur for individuals with East Asian names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nielsen and Andersen, 2021</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). The country-specific evidence for China and South-Korea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) should thus also be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Third, the gender-assignment algorithm used in this study did not infer the gender of 20% of the author sample. This introduces potential sampling bias into our analysis. Moreover, the algorithm reduces author gender to a binary category (woman or man), but not all individuals identify as women or men. Despite this clear limitation, we find the algorithm useful in quantifying COVID-19-related disparities on a large scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, academic publishing is a slow endeavor, and article submissions may undergo many rounds of revisions before they are published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Homolak et al., 2020</xref>). This introduces two types of potential bias into our analysis: (a) some of the articles published in 2020 are based on research conducted in 2019; and (b) some of the research conducted in 2020 will not appear in print before 2021, or later. Thus, in the coming years, scientists should continue to monitor disparities in women’s and men’s publishing rates.</p><p>In science, even small negative kicks or setbacks may add up over time and become cumulative disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole and Singer, 1991</xref>). We observe a decreased growth in publications for all but the most productive men, and especially early-career researchers. This has the potential to reinforce disparities in an already heavily skewed system, if not given special attention, especially with regard to women. The widening gender gap in publishing observed in this study should thus be taken seriously by universities and funding agencies and factored into policies that allocate resources and support, as well as those that determine advancement and compensation, in order to mitigate inequities resulting from the unequal impact of the pandemic and its associated disruptions. Such inequities are deeply troubling both because they demonstrate how morally arbitrary characteristics like gender affect the opportunity to succeed in science and because they hinder the inclusion of diverse perspectives necessary to optimally advance scientific inquiry itself.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data on authors and their publications.

Although, not a randomized treatment, we treated the yearly gender difference in publication numbers (for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020) relative to the difference in 2019 as our key estimand.

This provides average predicted publications counts for each group at each time.

A consistent gap between men and women is present in all years prior to 2020 for our full sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

When the pandemic began early in 2020, a number of studies of preprints predicted that gender gaps in productivity would get larger. Using data on a global sample of 431,207 authors (2,113,108 publications), this paper documents a small but consistent average worsening in the gap between women's and men's annual publishing rates. The largest differential impacts by gender were observed for particularly prolific researchers, in the top-10% of the productivity distribution. The paper also performs heterogeneity analyses by career stage and discipline. In addition, the authors compared their results to a counterfactual sample of authors and their publications from 2011 to 2015, to see how much the gender gap widened over a 5-year period with no pandemic. Overall, this is a well-designed study with compelling results. However, there are a number of points that need to be addressed to make the article suitable for publication.</p><p>Major/Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I am curious as to why the authors decided to focus on the particular disciplines they do. In terms of generalizability of findings, this particular selection might present difficulties if these fields had different post-covid policy responses, as well as unique challenges due to the pandemic, as compared to others. It would be important to understand why these fields were selected and how this might affect the overarching conclusions.</p><p>2) The study looks at the annual publication rate pre and post covid, focusing on how the gender gap in 2020 compared to 2019. The disruptions due to the pandemic did not start in most parts of the world until March of 2020. I would encourage the authors to conduct the analysis at a more granular level (by, say, looking at monthly publications rather than annual averages)? This could also potentially enrich the country-level analysis, as there was considerable time variable in lockdowns.</p><p>Note from editor: Addressing this point is optional, but I would encourage you to perform this analysis if possible. If you decide not to address this point, please discuss it as a topic that could be explored in future research.</p><p>3) One of the contributions that the paper emphasizes on p. 1 line 30 is that the study considers longer-term publication impacts. I would caution against using &quot;long-term&quot; to refer to 2020. As the paper rightly points out on p. 9, line 212, publishing takes quite a long time. From the start of the research project to the publication stage, we might expect to see much longer lags than just a few months. Even in the sciences, where the publication process is quicker than in other disciplines, it's highly unlikely that we are seeing an impact on new projects. The 2020 papers being published are likely old projects that were already in the publication pipeline and are now coming out at journals. Therefore, these are much more likely to pick up the pre-pandemic trend, which we see in fact – Figure 2 shows a slight widening of the gender gap pre-treatment (from -.2 to roughly around -.27 or so). I would encourage the authors to reframe the article with this in mind.</p><p>4) The analysis can be expanded to look at the quality dimension of publications (control for journal rankings in some systematic manner), as well as how the female authors stack up against male authors in terms of contributions. In science, we can tell clearly which author contributed the most to the project (first author). It would be interesting to see an analysis by first author only.</p><p>Note from editor: Addressing this point is optional: however, if you decide not to address it please discuss it as a topic that could be explored in future research.</p><p>5) I would like to know more details about the country-level comparisons. In a recent NBER Working Paper 29668, Deryugina et al. (2022) show that school openness at the country level correlates with a reduction in the gender gap in research time lost by men and women. It would also be important to know how the data sources treats partial closures, timing of closures, as well as academic breaks.</p><p>6) As regards severity, I am not sure why the authors lump countries into severity bins rather than using country-level openness measures. There also needs to be greater discussion of the results of the lockdown severity analysis. Why did you find no pattern? Is it because there is too much within-country heterogeneity in the timing, type, and severity of lockdown measures to observe a pattern, and finer-grain analyses (e.g., on a city-by-city basis) are needed? Is it that the demographics of women scientists differ substantially among countries, affecting, for example, the fraction of women scientists with young children? Is it that institutional responses and supports counteracted lockdown effects in some places but not others?</p><p>7) My main criticism is that the paper's Discussion section is rather boilerplate; it covers much of the same ground as previous papers on the pandemic's effects on women academics. Instead, I think I would be better to highlight some of the unique insights derived from the present analysis that currently get little attention in the Discussion. For example, I was struck by the analysis in Figure 4, which clearly shows that the gender gap is widest among the most productive scientists. This was true before COVID-19 and has become more pronounced during the pandemic. Why is this? What does it suggest about the pandemic's impacts on women versus men scientists? At the risk of over-interpreting Figure 4, it appears from panel B that the most productive men either maintained or improved their productivity during the pandemic, while the pandemic hurt the productivity of everyone else. Are highly productive men, but not women, most likely to have partners that do not work and who could thus shoulder additional caregiving or domestic duties? Are highly productive men, but not women, most likely to be spared the additional teaching or service burdens during the pandemic? I realize the present analysis cannot answer these questions, but the authors should discuss these possibilities.</p><p>8) Several figures (Figure 2 and the early-career panel of Figure 3, as well as the fractional-count versions in the supplement) suggest that publication rate declined for both men and women authors during the pandemic, it just declined more among women. This is worth discussing as it suggests that tenure committees and grant panels, etc., need to revise their expectations vis-à-vis productivity for all researchers, and especially so for women scientists.</p><p>9) The discussion says, &quot;unlike prior studies, we find that the gendered effects of COVID-19 are salient for early career-scientists with four years of publication experience as well as for mid-career scientists with ten years of publication experience&quot; (Lines 154-156), but I found this a bit misleading. Similarly, Lines 16-17 in the abstract imply that the gender gap widened similarly for early-career and mid-career scientists. But from Figure 3, it appears there is a growing gender gap during the pandemic for both early-career and mid-career researchers, but that the gender gap grows larger for mid-career than for early-career scientists. Please rephrase the abstract and discussion to reflect Figure 3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76559.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major/Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I am curious as to why the authors decided to focus on the particular disciplines they do.

We agree, there needs to be a justification of the field selection, which we added in the introduction, as follows:</p><p>“We chose these fields as they are well-represented in Web of Science (more than 90% of references are included in Web of Science), their primary knowledge production mode is through journal publication (as opposed to e.g. computer science and most engineering fields, or the humanities), research is comparatively collaborative (although some types of clinical research has somewhat more authors), publishing is relatively fast (compared to the social sciences). Biology, clinical and basic medicine also have some of the highest shares of women scientists in the natural sciences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study looks at the annual publication rate pre and post covid, focusing on how the gender gap in 2020 compared to 2019.

However, data on publication month is surprisingly not available or representable for all publications (and even when it is, journals may use labels such as “Summer 2020”). In addition, while we look into the effect of lock-downs (and don’t find a clear one), there are many other reasons the pandemic has influenced the publication productivity of men and women differently, e.g. differences in funding, teaching workloads, burnout, expectations of academic service and care etc.</p><p>As a final reason behind the choice not to use per-month data, is the fact that for most scientists, publishing a paper is a somewhat rare event that does not happen on a monthly basis. We would not have been able to use the panel-based difference-in-difference design allowing this type of analysis, if we should have analysed differences on a per-month basis.</p><p>We have added the following as a limitation in the discussion:</p><p>“Our analysis focused on annual publishing rates, which may obscure some of the potential effects of e.g. school closures on the immediate publishing rates. A more granular analysis of monthly publishing rates may reveal a more direct correlation between lock-downs and decreased publishing rates. However; information on when something is published is not available on a monthly basis for a large proportion of articles, and information on submission and review dates are even harder to obtain, often completely missing even through manual process. Furthermore, many of the delays in the publishing process are out of the hand of authors and thus unrelated to the lock-down effect they may be experiencing, and many other pandemic factors may be related to an increasing gender gap than the very specific lock-downs. By looking at annual data, we see a more robust effect overall. We strongly encourage publishers to publish transparent, open machine- and human-accessible information on which day a manuscript was received, reviewed, revised, accepted and published.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the contributions that the paper emphasizes on p. 1 line 30 is that the study considers longer-term publication impacts.

We added a descriptive analysis of the trends in women’s first authorship shares between 2016 and 2020 for each of the four disciplines. For each year, women were more likely to occupy the first authorship compared to a baseline of all authorships, showing no clear decline in women’s first authorships. Only chemistry showed a slight decline in women’s first authorships relative to all authorships, but these are not dramatic changes. We have added this clarification to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I would like to know more details about the country-level comparisons. In a recent NBER Working Paper 29668, Deryugina et al. (2022) show that school openness at the country level correlates with a reduction in the gender gap in research time lost by men and women. It would also be important to know how the data sources treats partial closures, timing of closures, as well as academic breaks.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion and relevant citation. We have added considerations in the Discussion section specifically focusing on why lock-down severity does not seem to correlate to gender gap levels. A likely factor is the need to aggregate day-to-day levels of policy severity across almost the whole year of 2020 (305 days, as stipulated in the Materials and methods section) to compare these to yearly publication gaps. Furthermore, we have clarified that these indicators pertain to the national policy level, but ignoring sub-national variation. This may be inappropriate in some countries where Covid-19 policies have largely been enacted at state or regional levels. However, with such a large country sample it would be impossible to compare gender gaps across countries where relevant policies are mostly sub-national or nation. As our sample comprises many researchers from the US, an idea for future studies could be to conduct a case study on individual researchers in US universities and state-level genders gaps vis-à-vis Covid-policies. This is, nevertheless, beyond the scope of this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As regards severity, I am not sure why the authors lump countries into severity bins rather than using country-level openness measures. There also needs to be greater discussion of the results of the lockdown severity analysis. Why did you find no pattern? Is it because there is too much within-country heterogeneity in the timing, type, and severity of lockdown measures to observe a pattern, and finer-grain analyses (e.g., on a city-by-city basis) are needed? Is it that the demographics of women scientists differ substantially among countries, affecting, for example, the fraction of women scientists with young children? Is it that institutional responses and supports counteracted lockdown effects in some places but not others?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have changed the severity-related figure to instead show the individual country-level gender gaps plotted against the openness measures. The revised figure show a similar lack of relationship to national gender gaps in publications. As stated above, we think it highly likely that within-country, and across-time, variation in Covid-response policies makes it hard to discern any decisive patterns from the more aggregate data. A city-by-city analysis would not be feasible as large scale data on city policies are not available, and given the lack of wide-covering data on monthly publications, a more fine-grained analysis over time is not possible either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) My main criticism is that the paper's Discussion section is rather boilerplate; it covers much of the same ground as previous papers on the pandemic's effects on women academics. Instead, I think I would be better to highlight some of the unique insights derived from the present analysis that currently get little attention in the Discussion. For example, I was struck by the analysis in Figure 4, which clearly shows that the gender gap is widest among the most productive scientists. This was true before COVID-19 and has become more pronounced during the pandemic. Why is this? What does it suggest about the pandemic's impacts on women versus men scientists? At the risk of over-interpreting Figure 4, it appears from panel B that the most productive men either maintained or improved their productivity during the pandemic, while the pandemic hurt the productivity of everyone else. Are highly productive men, but not women, most likely to have partners that do not work and who could thus shoulder additional caregiving or domestic duties? Are highly productive men, but not women, most likely to be spared the additional teaching or service burdens during the pandemic? I realize the present analysis cannot answer these questions, but the authors should discuss these possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point, and we have made a number of revisions based on the other comments which we believe alleviates some of the “boilerplate” phrasing. To address the prolific-perspective, we also added the following paragraph to the discussion:</p><p>“Those designing interventions to promote equity in academic science and medicine should strive to understand the reasons why highly prolific men appeared able to maintain their annual publication rates while highly prolific women were not. Prior research suggests that it is possible that men with the highest levels of productivity may have been more likely to have been rewarded with access to additional workplace supports, such as endowed professorships, in recognition of their achievements (Gold et al. 2020). If so, this might have served as a cushion against the impact of the pandemic on those individuals. Moreover, if institutions prioritized protecting a few “superstar” researchers from teaching or clinical demands without clear processes for identifying which individuals received preferential treatment, the vast literature on unconscious bias suggests that such efforts might preferentially have protected outstanding men as compared to similarly outstanding women (NASEM, 2007). Prior research also suggests that high-achieving women scientists may be more likely than their male peers to state that their partners’ careers take priority (Mody et al., 2020). Indeed, it is possible that high-achieving men scientists’ partners may be particularly likely to be willing to make sacrifices in their own careers to take on additional domestic labor to allow continuation of their extraordinary partners’ work. If partners of extraordinarily productive women scientists are less willing to do so, and if this difference is even more marked than any differences that may exist when a scientist is less highly productive, this could also serve as a mechanism to drive the differences observed. Further research is necessary to investigate these and other possibilities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Several figures (Figure 2 and the early-career panel of Figure 3, as well as the fractional-count versions in the supplement) suggest that publication rate declined for both men and women authors during the pandemic, it just declined more among women. This is worth discussing as it suggests that tenure committees and grant panels, etc., need to revise their expectations vis-à-vis productivity for all researchers, and especially so for women scientists.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree with the observation, and that grant panels, promotion committees etc. need to be aware of this. However, in many of those cases, comparisons between candidates occur at the same career stage and when not, evaluators are aware of career stage differences. We therefore consider the increasing gender gap more crucial and still focus our discussion on this. We included the following in the concluding paragraph of the discussion to give attention to the more overall problem:</p><p>“We observe a decline in publications for all but the most productive men, and especially early career researchers. This has the potential to further skew an already heavily skewed system, if not given special attention, especially with regard to women.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The discussion says, &quot;unlike prior studies, we find that the gendered effects of COVID-19 are salient for early career-scientists with four years of publication experience as well as for mid-career scientists with ten years of publication experience&quot; (Lines 154-156), but I found this a bit misleading. Similarly, Lines 16-17 in the abstract imply that the gender gap widened similarly for early-career and mid-career scientists. But from Figure 3, it appears there is a growing gender gap during the pandemic for both early-career and mid-career researchers, but that the gender gap grows larger for mid-career than for early-career scientists. Please rephrase the abstract and discussion to reflect Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing to this inconsistency in the representation and discussion of our results. While the numerical difference is indeed larger for mid-career scientists, the relative change in the gender gap is larger for early career scientists. We have revised the results and Discussion sections to make this point clearer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
