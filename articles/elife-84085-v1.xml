For this reason, stem cells are ideally studied in contexts that maintain this precisely constructed microenvironment while still allowing for live imaging. Here, we describe a long-term organ culture and imaging strategy for hematopoiesis in flies that takes advantage of powerful genetic and transgenic tools available in this system. We find that fly blood progenitors undergo symmetric cell divisions and that their division is both linked to cell size and is spatially oriented. Using quantitative imaging to simultaneously track markers for stemness and differentiation in progenitors, we identify two types of differentiation that exhibit distinct kinetics. Moreover, we find that infection-induced activation of hematopoiesis occurs through modulation of the kinetics of cell differentiation. Overall, our results show that even subtle shifts in proliferation and differentiation kinetics can have large and aggregate effects to transform blood progenitors from a quiescent to an activated state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>blood cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>blood progenitor</kwd><kwd>lymph gland</kwd><kwd>blood cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanentzapf</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005247</institution-id><institution>University of British Columbia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4-Year Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Kevin Yueh Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A long-term multi-organ co-culture system coupled with quantitative imaging to visualize blood cell cycle progression, analyze polarized blood cell mitosis, and track blood cell differentiation kinetics during <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis in homeostatic condition and following infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because of their key role in tissue maintenance and the inherent risk associated with their unchecked proliferative capacity, stem cell behavior is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klein and Simons, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2009</xref>). This regulation is often mediated by controlling the biochemical composition of the microenvironment surrounding the stem cells, including the presence of signaling molecules and metabolic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones and Wagers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). Additionally, physical inputs, such as mechanical cues and the architecture and topography of the extracellular matrix, also play an important role in controlling stem cell behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chacón-Martínez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Ffrench-Constant, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Díaz-Torres et al., 2021</xref>). The complex and precisely constructed in vivo microenvironment of stem cells can be very challenging to mimic in the laboratory and, when possible, it is best to study stem cells in their endogenous environment. There has been significant emphasis over the last decade on the development and optimization of imaging tools and methodologies to allow live imaging of stem cells in their in vivo environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheng and Matunis, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Hematopoiesis, the production of the cellular components of blood, is a well-known paradigm for stem cell regulation through a niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinez-Agosto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tokusumi et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a powerful and genetically tractable model to study hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). During fly hematopoiesis, a specialized population of blood progenitors gives rise to blood cells. <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitors exhibit many stem-cell-like properties, such as being controlled by a specialized population of cells that act as a hematopoietic niche, the Posterior Signaling Centre (PSC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tokusumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). They can give rise to three highly differentiated blood cell types: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). However, whether they are true stem cells has not been conclusively resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Vertebrate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been associated with several well-defined attributes: self-renewal, the ability to differentiate into all blood lineages, and their dependence on a niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitors have been shown to exhibit most of these criteria but so far, there has been no clear evidence of either self-renewal or asymmetric cell division in the progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, previous studies provided evidence for the existence of HSCs in the lymph gland (LG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Minakhina and Steward, 2010</xref>). For example, a population of cells in first instar larvae were identified, which gave rise to progenitors in later larval stages and behaved in ways consistent with the idea that they were equivalent to vertebrate HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dey et al., 2016</xref>). Another study employed MARCM-based lineage tracing technique to identify distinct sub-populations of progenitors within third instar larvae, one of which exhibited characteristics such as ‘persistence’ that were consistent with the HSC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Minakhina and Steward, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The main site of hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is the primary lobe of a specialized organ known as the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). The primary lobe contains three distinct zones: the PSC niche, the medullary zone (MZ) which houses the blood progenitors, and the cortical zone (CZ) that contains differentiated blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). The progenitors in the MZ express markers such as the JAK-STAT receptor Domeless (Dome), while differentiated blood cells express unique markers depending on their terminal mature blood cell fate. For example, plasmatocytes express the marker P1, while crystal cells express the marker Lozenge (Lz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, a small population of cells has been described that lack the expression of terminal differentiation markers such as P1 but express both the progenitor marker Domeless and early differentiating blood cell markers such as Hemolectin (Hml) and Peroxidasin (Pxn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). These P1<sup>-</sup>, Dome<sup>+</sup>, and Pxn<sup>+</sup>/Hml<sup>+</sup> cells were typically found in the boundary between the MZ and CZ and were proposed to represent a separate population of cells, commonly referred to as intermediate progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spratford et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girard et al., 2021</xref>). Although this population is currently not well characterised, it is thought to contain cells in a transitional state as they go from a relatively quiescent multipotent state to a terminally differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>More recent data has supported the view that rather than being a homogenous population, progenitors in the MZ are heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girard et al., 2021</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the LG revealed a surprising level of heterogeneity of the developing blood cells and uncovered novel blood cell types including adipohemocytes, stem-cell like blood progenitors, and intermediate progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a distinct subpopulation of progenitor cells in the LG has been recently identified and termed ‘distal progenitors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). These cells, named after their location at the distal part of the MZ near the boundary with the CZ, express some progenitor markers (Dome) but not others (Tep4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). A further subpopulation of distal progenitors, known as ‘committed progenitors’ is distinguished by its expression of the plasmatocyte marker gene <italic>eater</italic> but not the mature blood cell marker Hml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). The population of progenitors that are close to the heart tube additionally exhibit distinct features in terms of regulation by Hh signalling, a key regulator of blood cell differentiation in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that rather than being composed of a simple and clearly defined population of progenitors, the LG contains multiple subpopulations of progenitors at various stages and states of differentiation. These observations show the limitations of using fixed tissue approaches to study blood progenitor fate which is inherently a dynamic and evolving cell state.</p><p>The main function of mature blood cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is to fight infection and assist in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlisidou and Wood, 2015</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that in healthy intact flies, few mature blood cells are made in late larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). During early larval stages, blood progenitors undergo expansion and are typically found to be in S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dey et al., 2016</xref>). However, once progenitor expansion is completed in the late larval stages, they for the most part stay in the G2 phase through the action of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapoor et al., 2022</xref>), although some intermediate progenitors remain in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Upon infection, there is a strong and rapid induction of mature blood cell production, which depends on the type of immune challenge and involves large scale differentiation of lamellocytes, crystal cells, or plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>). How this induction is mediated, for example, whether it is primarily driven by changes in the cell cycle in the progenitors, predominantly by altered dynamics or patterns of differentiation, or by both factors in equal measure, is currently unclear. The key to answering these important remaining questions is to develop the ability to visualize and track fly hematopoiesis for extended periods in real time.</p><p>Here, we describe analysis of proliferation and differentiation patterns observed during long-term live imaging of intact LGs in healthy and infected larvae. This analysis utilises whole organ culture methodology and quantitative imaging tools that we developed, optimised, verified, and applied. By tracking markers for cell proliferation and division in real time as well as cell fate and differentiation, we are able to confirm that blood progenitors undergo symmetric cell divisions. Using quantitative automated image analysis of progenitors in healthy and infected flies, we elucidate the dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns of blood cell differentiation and proliferation. We describe how the modulation of key differentiation and proliferation behaviours underlies the activation of mature blood cell production following infection. These results provide a novel system-level framework for understanding how <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis is regulated in the context of the intact whole organ in real time.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development and optimization of a long-term ex vivo whole organ LG culture and imaging technique</title><p>In order to image fly hematopoiesis in real time, we developed a whole organ culture system for the LG. A large number of protocols for culturing various organs were explored and, through trial and error, we found that optimal results were obtained with a modified version of protocols used for imaging whole testes, CNS, and wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zartman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reilein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheng and Matunis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anllo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kakanj et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morris and Spradling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiepas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Icha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenspan and Matunis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koyama et al., 2020</xref>). This method used Schneider’s cell culture medium and relied upon three key features that we found to dramatically improve outcomes: (1) dissection methodology, wherein the LG was removed while maintaining its association with the CNS, ring gland and the heart tube with which it was then co-cultured, (2) the addition of intact larval fat bodies to the culture, and (3) the use of spacers to prevent mechanical force from being applied to the tissue by the presence of the cover slip and agar pad (see Materials and methods). With this technique, LG ultrastructure and proliferative capacity were maintained, and it was found we could successfully culture LGs overnight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We used a genetically encoded marker for oxidative stress, gstD-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008</xref>), to show that oxidative stress in the LG does not increase substantially over the course of 13 hrs of ex vivo culture and imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As a control and to illustrate the ability of gstD-GFP to detect oxidative damage, we omitted the fat bodies from the culture medium and observed a large increase in oxidative stress in the LGs over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Furthermore, direct comparison of LGs that were kept in ex vivo culture conditions and physiological in vivo conditions over the course of 12 hours showed comparable levels of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Similarly, the cell death stain Sytox green was used to monitor cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2018</xref>) and showed that, while there is a very small baseline level of cell death in the progenitors and in the whole LG, this baseline did not increase in a substantial way over the course of LG culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). As a control and to illustrate the ability of Sytox green to monitor cell viability, we cultured LGs in PBS instead of Schneider’s medium in the presence of fat bodies, which led to a marked increase in cell death over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref> right panel). Moreover, the baseline level of cumulative cell death that we observed under ex vivo culture conditions during 12.5 hr of culture was 2–12 cells per LG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref> left panel) which was in line with what was observed in previous in vivo studies (0–10 cells)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khadilkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu and Govind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>).

Scale Bar: 15 µm.</p></caption></media><p>To test and demonstrate the ability of our culture system to allow tracking of cell behaviour in the LGs over extended periods of time, we utilised the Fly-FUCCI system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>) to monitor cell cycle progression in the progenitors. Fly-FUCCI is based on the expression of fluorescent protein-tagged degrons from the Cyclin B and E2F1 proteins, which are degraded during mitosis or the onset of S phase, to distinguish the G1, S, and G2 phases of interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>). Expressing Fly-FUCCI using a progenitor-specific driver (Tep4-Gal4) allowed us to track in real-time the cell cycle phase of individual progenitors using colour as an indicator: green during G1, red during S phase, and yellow during G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). We applied automated quantitative imaging tools (see Materials and methods) to track the trajectory of a single progenitor through the cell cycle in order to analyse the dynamics of the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The Fly-FUCCI system allowed us to examine if our ex vivo culture methodology recapitulated the in vivo behaviour of LGs. Specifically, we compared the cell cycle profile of LGs in vivo (in intact stage-matched larvae) and in ex vivo culture. We observed little change in the proportion of cells in the LGs at each stage of the cell cycle over time in ex vivo culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), while, if we deliberately stressed LGs by leaving out the spacers and allowing them to be compressed, we saw cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Moreover, tracking the proportion of cells in the LGs at each stage of the cell cycle over time either in ex vivo culture or in vivo showed little difference between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Notably, the cell cycle data we obtained using ex vivo cultured LGs showed ~20% of cells were in G2,~40% of cells were in S, and ~40% of cells were in G1, numbers that were similar to previous in vivo observations from mid-third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, comparing proliferation in in vivo or ex vivo conditions by EdU labelling showed similar proliferative capacity in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>). Importantly, there was no reduction in proliferation over long-term ex vivo culture and our observation of ~100 EdU<sup>+</sup> cells per primary lobe was in line with previous data collected in fixed LGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2014</xref>). Further evidence for the health of the ex vivo cultured LGs over the course of long-term imaging was provided by noting that the duration of the mitosis remains largely consistent over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>). Taken together, the data illustrate that we can track the cell cycle and proliferation in the LG using our culture technique and validate our approach as we did not detect any obvious cell cycle defects or variance from published data collected using fixed in vivo conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodrigues et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-84085-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Long-term tracking of cell cycle progression of blood progenitors in a wild-type LG.</title><p>Representative video showing cell cycle progression of a blood progenitor (highlighted in a yellow ROI) in wild-type LG over a period of 1 hr.

We used long-term LG imaging to address this question directly and found multiple lines of evidence that suggest that blood progenitors undergo symmetric cell divisions. Cultured LGs expressing both the JAK-STAT reporter and progenitor marker dome-MESO-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>) as well as the early differentiation marker eater-dsRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroeger et al., 2012</xref>) were imaged. We observed many examples in multiple videos from different LGs of symmetric cell divisions in progenitors (34 dividing progenitors from 7 videos). Since these progenitors are identified as dome-MESO-GFP expressing cells that do not express eater-dsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) they are either core progenitors or distal progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These dividing core or distal progenitors maintained their dome-MESO<sup>+</sup> eater-dsRed<sup>-</sup> fate in both daughter cells after cell division. To confirm this observation, we employed another way to label progenitors by using the dome-Gal4 driver line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2005</xref>) to drive the expression of membranous GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We found that progenitor divisions are symmetrical with respect to size, with a cleavage plane positioned in such that the cell division yields two daughter cells of similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–C’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–D’</xref>). Another hallmark of progenitor fate is a high level of JAK-STAT signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>). Quantifying the intensity of dome-MESO-GFP in daughter cells as a readout for activity of the JAK-STAT pathway shows that following progenitor division the daughter cells exhibit similar levels of the signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E’</xref>; see Methods). To account for the possibility that it is due to equal inheritance of the protein from the mother, not an equivalent maintenance of a progenitor fate, these experiments were done in the presence of eater-dsRed to confirm neither of the daughter cells differentiated. Also supporting the equivalent maintenance model, we found that tracking dome-MESO-GFP levels in daughter cells over extended periods of time showed that the marker levels remained stable and did not diverge in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, the data provide compelling evidence that blood progenitors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> undergo symmetric division that produces two identical progenitor cells that are conserved in both cell size and JAK-STAT signaling pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Blood progenitors undergo symmetric divisions in the LG.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Time-lapse images from representative videos showing a blood progenitor (labelled as “mother cell”) undergoing symmetric division over the course of 40 min (progenies labelled as ‘daughter cells’).

We found that most dividing progenitors complete cell division in 40–70 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; 57.74±27.58 minutes, n=63 progenitors). It has been shown that the cell division is often coordinated with cell size and can be initiated by cells reaching a so-called ‘critical cell size’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lengefeld et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>). For dome-positive progenitors, division occurred once cells reached an average size of 72 μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> left panel, 71.96±10.00 μm<sup>2</sup>, n=13 progenitors). Upon cell division, two similar sized progenitors are produced and undergo rapid growth such that their combined size exceeds the size of the original mother cell 3 hr after division, making cell division a potential driver for LG growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> right panel). Analysis of the growth kinetics of the two daughter cells over time showed that the two daughter cells can grow 20–30% in the first 4 hr after division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As these experiments focused on the entire progenitor population, we sought to gain more detailed insight by labelling specific sub-populations of progenitors. First, we asked which progenitor sub-populations in the LG were mitotically active by constructing a fly line that carried the following markers: Tep4-QF&gt;QUAS-mCherry, dome-MESO-GFP, and HmlΔ-dsRed. This allowed us to mark core progenitors (Tep4-mcherry<sup>+</sup> dome-MESO-GFP<sup>+</sup>), distal progenitors (only dome-MESO-GFP<sup>+</sup>) and intermediate progenitors (dome-MESO-GFP<sup>+</sup> HmlΔ-dsRed<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–A’’’</xref>). We then used a pH3 staining to determine which of the progenitor populations were mitotically active. We found that core and distal progenitors were mitotically active while intermediate progenitors were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–A’’’</xref>). This finding is consistent with published results showing intermediate progenitors are not mitotically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spratford et al., 2021</xref>). Next, we found that the critical size for distal progenitors (dome<sup>+</sup> Tep4<sup>-</sup>) was on average 76.08 µm<sup>2</sup>, while for core progenitors (dome<sup>+</sup> Tep4<sup>+</sup>) it was on average 63.81 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our analysis shows that distal progenitors have to reach a larger critical cell size than core progenitors before they can initiate mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We considered whether blood progenitor divisions were spatially polarised. In general, we described the anatomical planes of a LG and the polarity of cell division using anatomical axes of the LG coupled in relation to a cylindrical coordinate system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>), which describes organ anatomical structure in greater mathematical simplicity than other coordinate systems by allowing the radial direction from the dorsal-ventral axis to be defined explicitly with the use of trigonometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rood et al., 2019</xref>). The ρ-axis of cylindrical coordinate system corresponds to the radial axis, which is parallel to the plane formed by anterior-posterior and right-left axes of a larva and defines how far from the origin a given point lies, the θ-axis defines the absolute angle of the given point from the origin, while the z-axis corresponds to dorsal-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>; see Methods) and defines the ‘height’ of the point on the now defined ρ-θ (radial length-angle) plane. This coordinate system was chosen as divisions were found to either always radiate out from the dorsal-ventral axis (ρ-mitosis) or run along the dorsal-ventral axis (z-mitosis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Using the cylindrical coordinate system, all ρ-mitosis can be compared directly as the angle of the radial axis is a separate coordinate (compared to usual Cartesian coordinates, where radial measurements rely on both the x and y-axes). We found that approximately 90% of the divisions occurred along the ρ-axis, and that these divisions took a shorter time to complete (on average 53.90 min for ρ-axis divisions versus on average 75.04 min for z-axis divisions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>). Notably, the overall shape of the LG which is ‘longer (roughly 300 µm) and wider (roughly 150 µm)’ than it is ‘thick (roughly 40–60 µm)’ is consistent with such a polarised orientation of division. Divisions along the ρ-axis tended to occur in dividing progenitors located further away from the heart tube or PSC when compared to divisions along the z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). To statistically confirm that ρ-axis divisions are less likely to occur parallel to the heart tube (see wild-type control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>), we used a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot to compare the distribution of division orientation we observed to a randomised normal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>; see Materials and methods). This analysis showed that the orientation of ρ-axis divisions relative to the heart tube is biased or polarised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Overall, these observations uncover a previously unknown polarization in progenitor divisions in the LG as these divisions tend to occur more frequently along the plane formed by the anterior-posterior and right-left axes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reduction of blood progenitor proliferation upon infection.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Representative images (<bold>A–B</bold>) and quantification of EdU incorporation in blood progenitors (C, dome<sup>+</sup> Hml<sup>-</sup>, n=13 lobes in wild-type control, n=17 lobes in infection group, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.032), intermediate progenitors (D, dome<sup>+</sup> Hml<sup>+</sup>, n=13 lobes in wild-type control, n=17 lobes in infection group, p-value = 0.336), and mature hemocytes (E, dome<sup>-</sup> Hml<sup>+</sup>, n=7 lobes in wild-type control, n=9 lobes in infection group, p-value = 0.3465) in LGs from wild-type control and <italic>E. coli</italic> infected larvae.

Increased production of mature blood cells can be achieved by a number of possible scenarios including: (1) increased proportion of progenitor cells undergoing cell division, (2) no change in the proportion of dividing progenitors but a faster cell cycle, (3) increased proportion of progenitors undergoing differentiation, (4) no change in the proportion of progenitors undergoing differentiation, but faster differentiation, (5) any combination of these options. We analyzed LGs from larvae infected with <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria using a previously developed infection protocol (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siva-Jothy et al., 2018</xref>).

We observed a reduction in the number of dividing progenitor cells following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–A’, B–B’ , and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–A’, 1B-B’, and 1C</xref>) and there was no change in either the proliferation of intermediate progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) or mature blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) or in LG size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This data from in vivo fixed tissues was confirmed by quantifying cell divisions in long-term live imaging experiments of dome<sup>+</sup> progenitors in the LGs from wild-type control and infected larvae which showed a reduction in the number of cell division events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In terms of the duration of mitotic events, there was no significant difference between progenitors in the LGs from wild-type control and infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). There was, however, a slight change in the type of cell divisions observed in progenitors upon infection as we no longer saw divisions along the z-axis (or dorsal-ventral axis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>A custom quantitative image analysis algorithm was developed and used to explore spatial differences in the location and orientation of cell division between progenitors in the LGs from wild-type control and infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; see Materials and methods). First, the LG was segmented into regions based on distance and location relative to the heart tube and the posterior end of the LG. Second, the number of progenitor cell divisions in each segment was determined for multiple LGs from wild-type control and infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>; see Methods). This analysis showed a uniform reduction in progenitor cell divisions throughout the LGs following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>; correlation coefficient for changes in distribution upon infection compared to control = 0.44 consistent with weak correlation; see Methods). Analysis of the distribution of division frequency of progenitors and their relative angle to the heart tube showed that reduced progenitor divisions following infection were uniform across all angles within the LGs and there was no change in the duration of mitotic events at any division angle relative to the heart tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–M</xref>). The orientation of these divisions remained biased following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Taken together, the data show that, when compared to uninfected controls, following infection: (1) There is a reduction in the number of progenitors undergoing division. (2) The division of progenitors is more likely to occur along the plane formed by the anterior-posterior and right-left axes. (3) The duration and orientation of mitotic events in progenitors are unchanged. Importantly, these results show that changes in proliferation are unlikely to account for the increased number of mature blood cells produced following infection. Consequently, changes in differentiation are likely the main driver for the increased mature blood cell production following infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Quantitative imaging identifies two types of blood cell differentiation in the LG</title><p>We analyzed mature blood cell differentiation in LGs from wild-type larvae in real time using quantitative imaging of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters for cell identity and signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>; see Methods). To first confirm that the ex vivo culture condition did not impact differentiation, we compared differentiation under ex vivo and physiological in vivo conditions over the course of 12 hr and we observed comparable levels of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Next, the expression levels of the JAK-STAT reporter and progenitor marker dome-MESO-GFP as well as the early blood cell differentiation marker eater-dsRed were simultaneously tracked in individual cells for 12–14 hr. This allows us to observe individual differentiation events, where the expression of the progenitor marker dome-MESO-GFP declined in a cell, while the expression level of eater-dsRed increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). A plot of the expression levels of dome-MESO-GFP (plotted on the y-axis) and eater-dsRed (plotted on the x-axis) at each time point collected from an individual cell revealed the differentiation trajectory from progenitor to differentiated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Simultaneous tracking of dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed in differentiating cells identified two types of cell fate trajectories, which we refer to as sigmoid and linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>; see Materials and methods). In a cell following a sigmoid trajectory, named after the shape of a sigmoid function curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the initial level of dome-MESO-GFP is high while the levels of eater-dsRed is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

This is evident because there are features that distinguish the two trajectories in the later phases. Specifically: (1) A key characteristic of linear differentiation trajectory is that the dome-MESO-GFP declines throughout the process. In contrast, in the later phases of the sigmoid differentiation trajectory, dome-MESO-GFP levels become stable (comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). The kinetics of linear type differentiation is therefore different from the later phases of sigmoid type differentiation. (2) From the middle to late phase of the sigmoid differentiation trajectory, eater-dsRed levels go up after dome-MESO-GFP levels are already low or still decreasing. In contrast, in the linear trajectory eater-dsRed levels are stable in the later parts of the trajectory. Moreover, spatiotemporal analysis of differentiation trajectories suggests they occur separately, that is not in a consecutive manner whereby cells undergo a sigmoid trajectory first and subsequently a linear trajectory. In particular, in the LG regions where we identified cells following different types of trajectories, tracking the trajectories of individual cells shows that 1. They exhibit a single distinct type of differentiation throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and 2. Cells undergo sigmoid or linear type differentiation either in parallel (see Cell1 and Cell2 in 1 of Wt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or at different time points (see Box2 of Wt in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Taken together, these results identify two distinct types of differentiation events in the LG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Infection changes cell differentiation patterns in the LG</title><p>Live imaging experiments were used to track and quantify differentiation events in LGs from wild-type control and infected larvae. First, we confirmed that the general differentiation trends following infection were similar between LGs in the ex vivo culture system and physiological in vivo conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we noted a significant (&gt;2-fold) increase in the number of differentiation events observed in LGs following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Third, we determined the spatial distribution of differentiation events in the LGs from wild-type control and infected larvae. A general increase was seen in differentiation events, especially near the area that would correspond to the MZ-CZ boundary (around 60% distance to heart tube; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>; correlation coefficient for changes in distribution upon infection compared to control = 0.49 consistent with weak correlation; see Materials and methods). Finally, the spatial distribution of sigmoid and linear trajectory differentiation events was analysed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref>). This revealed that the spatial distribution of sigmoid trajectory differentiation events was not greatly altered by infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>; correlation coefficient between heat maps of 6D and 6E=0.14 consistent with no correlation).

As in control LGs, both the sigmoid and linear differentiation trajectories were observed in infected LGs. However, the differentiation trajectories exhibited some variance in infected versus control larvae. For example, progenitor cells following the sigmoid trajectory in infected LGs exhibited a prolonged intermediary phase, during which both dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed were expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’’ , and B–B’’</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>). Moreover, as a result of the prolonged intermediary phase, the average rate of differentiation for the sigmoid trajectory was lower upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We also observed a slightly modified linear type trajectory in LGs from infected larvae compared to controls. In particular, while in controls the expression of eater-dsRed was relatively constant but that of dome-MESO-GFP declined with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–C’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), in infected LGs the expression of eater-dsRed went up at first and dome-MESO-GFP expression declined later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–D’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). This does not modify the overall rate of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) but does result in a~50% increase in the ratio of expression of eater-dsRed to dome-MESO-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C’’ , and D’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B, 2E and 2F</xref>). Importantly, upon infection, there is around 20% increase in the proportion of differentiation events that follow the linear trajectory and a corresponding decrease in the number of differentiation events that follow the sigmoid trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Taken together, the data is consistent with a model whereby infection causes higher differentiation in the LGs not by increasing the rate of differentiation but rather by inducing a shift from one type of differentiation, the sigmoid trajectory, to another, the linear trajectory.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Temporal control of sigmoid and linear type differentiations upon bacterial infection.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Representative sigmoid differentiation trajectories in blood progenitors from LGs of wild-type control (<bold>A-A’’’</bold>) or <italic>E. coli</italic> infected larvae (<bold>B-B’’’</bold>) over the course of 5–6 hr.

We imaged LGs expressing eater-dsRed and dome-MESO-GFP and performed automated image analysis to determine the relative amounts of these markers in individual cells in the LG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–L</xref>; in total 2500 cells captured from 6 primary lobes of LGs in both wt and infection groups; see Materials and methods). When compared to the wild-type control, the relative distribution of expression profiles of eater-dsRed and dome-MESO-GFP was greatly altered by infection. Specifically, there was an overall increase in the expression of eater-dsRed following infection in many cells in the LGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K–L</xref>). This shift to higher eater-dsRed can indicate immune activation, as <italic>eater</italic> is transcriptionally activated as part of the immune response following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroeger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ye and McGraw, 2011</xref>), but the shift is also consistent with a greater proportion of progenitors undergoing differentiation. Cells were classified into four general categories based on their differentiation profile: GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>dsRed<sup>LOW</sup> (most stem cell-like), GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup> (most differentiated), GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup> and GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>LOW</sup> (both intermediate stages; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). While a sigmoid differentiation trajectory proceeds as GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>dsRed<sup>LOW</sup> to GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>LOW</sup> to GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup>, the linear trajectory proceeds as GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>dsRed<sup>LOW</sup> to GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup> to GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). Notably, following infection, the relative overall population of GFP<sup>HIGH</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup> increased (18 cells in wt LGs and 109 cells in LGs following infection), while GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>LOW</sup> decreased slightly (2337 cells in wt LGs and 1888 cells in LGs following infection) and there was a rise in the number of differentiated GFP<sup>LOW</sup>dsRed<sup>HIGH</sup> cells (97 cells in wt LGs and 557 cells in LGs following infection; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>: data summarized from each quadrant of 7 J and 7 L; see Materials and methods). Overall, these observations suggest a possible link between the two main features seen upon infection, increased overall differentiation and an increased proportion of cells undergoing the linear trajectory of differentiation. In particular, these findings confirm the view that there are different subpopulations of progenitors in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>), and raise the possibility that changes in the proportion of these different subpopulations are involved in the activation of mature blood cell differentiation following infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By employing organ culture, using genetically encoded markers for cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation, and implementing quantitative image analysis, we are able to study the process of fly hematopoiesis at a single cell resolution in its endogenous context. This has allowed us to observe features of hematopoiesis that only become apparent upon system- and organ-level analysis. Our observations lead us to four main conclusions. First, our results illustrate that certain populations of blood progenitors in the fly can undergo symmetric cell divisions. Second, we find that the timing of blood progenitor division is more likely to occur once cells reach a specific cell size and the division is spatially oriented with respect to the heart tube and anatomical axes. Third, we identify and characterise two distinct modes of differentiation. Fourth, we show that the induction of mature blood cell production in response to infection is not achieved by modulating progenitor proliferation or speed of differentiation but by increasing the size of a population of progenitors that expressed high levels of both differentiated and progenitor cell markers.</p><p>The ex vivo culture and imaging protocol we describe provides a powerful new way to study hematopoiesis over a prolonged time using quantitative imaging. Although such an approach holds much promise, its use calls for caution and for the consideration of certain caveats. For example, following infection, while LGs in vivo would be exposed to systemic immune signals, cultured LGs may not have access to such continuous extrinsic signals which may change their behaviour. During our work, we have looked at a number of parameters of differentiation, proliferation, and tissue homeostasis and did not see any strong differences between in vivo and ex vivo organ culture. Nonetheless such differences may exist in some circumstances. Another caveat is that due to the combination of tagged markers available for live imaging, we were only able to follow differentiation events leading to plasmatocytes and not crystal cell fate. Future work will focus on addressing this to provide a more complete view of blood cell differentiation. Finally, our observations show the existence of a large population of LG cells that expresses low levels of both dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed. This would suggest that a substantial proportion of progenitors begin to differentiate but pause at this stage. However, we did not observe in our live trajectory tracking experiments this sort of paused trajectory. We can only speculate at this point that cells in the paused trajectory are produced before the early third instar larval stage, which is the stage we chose for live imaging. In our future work, we will extend our analysis to earlier larval stages, which we hope will test this hypothesis directly.</p><p>Our work supports earlier studies that described the presence of distinct subpopulations of progenitors in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). According to this emerging model, the progenitor pool is not homogenous during hematopoiesis but rather contains subpopulations at different levels of differentiation. Importantly, these studies used single-cell transcriptomic, a different approach to ours, but also suggest that multiple paths exist for blood progenitors to differentiate into plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, they identified a path that contains an intermediate mixed lineage stage of differentiation and a more direct path that does not include intermediate steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). Additional subpopulations that have been proposed to exist in the LG include the intermediate progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spratford et al., 2021</xref>) as well as the distal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>), which express a mixture of both progenitor and differentiated cell markers. Intermediate progenitors express the progenitor marker Dome and early differentiation marker Pxn but not mature blood cells markers like P1 or Lz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>). Distal progenitors also exhibit a mixed fate: expressing the progenitor marker Dome, but also hallmarks of differentiated cells such as the expression of the plasmatocyte marker eater and absence of the progenitor marker Tep4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies suggested the existence of PSC-dependent and PSC-independent progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). In our live imaging experiments, we observed a substantial population of cells in the LG that simultaneously express high levels of both progenitor and differentiated cell markers, which likely includes cells belonging to one or more of these mixed lineage subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). Our studies suggest that these mixed lineage cells play a crucial role in hematopoiesis as they represent the linear differentiation trajectory which drives increased differentiation in response to infection. Consistent with this idea, spatial analysis of where progenitors that follow the different trajectories are located shows that the linear trajectory occurs mostly in the region thought to hold intermediate progenitors.</p><p>Surprisingly, the linear differentiation trajectory is substantially slower than the sigmoid differentiation trajectory. This appears to be in contradiction to another one of our observations, that a very large proportion of the progenitors following the sigmoid trajectory are found in an intermediate state where both the progenitor and differentiation markers are expressed at low levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref> area #2). The accumulation of sigmoid-trajectory progenitors at the intermediate phase would suggest this is a long-lasting phase, but this is not what we saw in our direct tracking of differentiation trajectories. We propose that a possible explanation to resolve this potential contradiction is that only a small proportion of the cells that are found in the intermediate state where both the progenitor and differentiation markers are expressed at low levels go on to differentiate. Furthermore, it is unclear why the linear, slower trajectory, would be favored under conditions where we would expect a need for rapid production of immune cells. We can speculate the benefits of expanding the population of cells undergoing the linear trajectory exceed the disadvantages conferred by the slower differentiation time. We would propose, based on our observations, that the various subpopulations with mixed progenitor and differentiated cell fate have an important role during infection by acting as transit amplifying cells that allow rapid induction of the cellular immune response. Understanding the behavior of these intermediate state cells should be a focus of future investigation.</p><p>Multiple systems and approaches have been used to track HSCs and blood progenitors during hematopoiesis in their native environment in real time. Key examples include studies in zebrafish that used intravital imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang and Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frame et al., 2017</xref>), studies in mice that combined diverse approaches such as inducible lineage tracing, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Upadhaya et al., 2018</xref>), as well as mouse studies based on intravital imaging of the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christodoulou et al., 2020</xref>). Zebrafish have proven to be particularly useful for live studies of hematopoiesis, due to the relative ease of intravital imaging, and its wealth of transgenic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang and Liu, 2011</xref>). Zebrafish have been a powerful system for studying the embryonic development of HSCs and the hematopoietic niche as well as for drug, chemical and genetic screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arulmozhivarman et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, zebrafish have been proven to be very useful for modeling blood malignancies and tracking their development and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gore et al., 2018</xref>). In the mouse system, which holds many challenges for intravital imaging, alternative approaches have been used to capture the dynamics of the process of hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Upadhaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grinenko et al., 2018</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Upadhaya et al., 2018</xref> used a drug inducible HSC labeling technique to isolate HSCs and their progeny at set time points and follow the transcriptional landscape of the progenitors as they progress along their developmental trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Upadhaya et al., 2018</xref>). This type of analysis yields several intriguing insights into hematopoiesis, such as the differences in the time it takes for various blood lineages to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Upadhaya et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, despite the technical challenges, there have been several successful attempts to image the process of hematopoiesis in vivo by using the bone marrow of the mouse skull. While initially this approach was limited to the use of isolated, labelled, and transplanted HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lo Celso et al., 2009</xref>), more recent studies used an endogenously labelled HSC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christodoulou et al., 2020</xref>). Although they constitute important technical breakthroughs, these studies still suffer from several challenges and allow the visualization of a relatively short time window compared to the actual time it takes progenitors to differentiate in the mouse. Consequently, these studies were limited to describing the architecture of the bone marrow niche and the location of HSCs within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lo Celso et al., 2009</xref>), or to general descriptions of a small subset of cell behaviors such as HSC/progenitor motility and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christodoulou et al., 2020</xref>). Our approach offers the ability to perform real time functional studies that can complement observations from these other models of hematopoiesis.</p><p>In particular, compared with these earlier studies our approach offers several key innovations. First is our ability to track multiple markers simultaneously in a quantitative way during long-term live imaging. Specifically, our approach allows us to quantitatively track, for 12 or more hours, markers of cell fate in combination with multiple other markers for proliferation, metabolism, cell signaling, and cell morphology. Moreover, the relatively short duration of the differentiation process in the fly, approximately 6–8 hr versus 1–3 weeks for various leukocyte lineages in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Upadhaya et al., 2018</xref>), allows us to observe differentiation in its entirety. Second, the ability to track a large number of progenitors and quantitate both their behavior and the expression of markers using imaging analysis tools allows the deployment of system-level approaches. This offers the capability to track hematopoiesis at a cellular and even subcellular spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of a few seconds, well beyond previous studies. Third, the ability to combine these powerful analysis tools with an infection model facilitates the ability to visualize the induction of the cellular branch of the immune response in real time in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Fourth, the vast genetic toolkit and short generation time of the fly, the accessibility of the LG multi-organ co-culture system to drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho et al., 2021</xref>) and organ-organ communication studies, and the detailed and extensive transcriptomic analysis of blood cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girard et al., 2021</xref>) all make it a superb system for real time analysis of hematopoiesis. Specifically, a major goal of our future work will focus on combining the analysis pipeline we describe here with markers and tools to analyze and manipulate the various cell signaling pathways that have been implicated in the regulation of hematopoiesis under homeostatic, infection, and pathogenic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Organs including larval LGs, fat bodies, ring gland, central nervous system, and heart tube were dissected in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider’s medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number 21720001) in room temperature. The connection between CNS, ring gland, LG, and heart tube should be maintained during all steps from larval dissection, organ mounting and to confocal imaging. The dissected organs were then placed and mounted in the Schneider’s medium supplied with 15% FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number 12483–020) and 0.2 mg/mL insulin (Sigma I0516) in a glass bottom dish. The medium was prepared fresh in 10 min prior to dissection in room temperature. The LG was mounted in such a manner to align the dorsal-ventral axis of the tissue with the z-axis of the confocal optical section. To stabilize the LG, the organs were covered with a 1% agar pad and spacers made from 1% agar were placed in between agar pad and glass bottom dish to shield the organs from mechanical force. Optimal moisture conditions during live imaging was maintained by the addition of 2 ml of the medium on top of the agar pad. All live imaging experiments were performed at 25<sup>ο</sup>C in a microscope incubation chamber (TOKAI HIT, Catalog number: INU-ONICS F1). LGs were imaged using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal microscopy with a numerical aperture 1.30 UPLFLN 40 X oil immersion lens. Imaging duration varied due to movement caused by occasional heart tube contractions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The middle two planes of LGs spaced by 1.5 μm were imaged at a 15 seconds interval using lasers with the excitation wavelength at 488 nm (green laser) and 561 nm (red laser). The parameters were chosen to minimize phototoxicity, increase temporal resolution, and maximize the number of cells captured in each experiment. To avoid phototoxicity and photobleaching in the LGs, the laser was kept at 1% power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Icha et al., 2017</xref>), which is the weakest laser power that provides a good signal for live LGs in the FV1000 confocal microscopy. Using the laser power setting, no noticeable photobleaching (i.e. the signal levels did not drop down substantially over the course of imaging; see multiple videos and time-lapse images in this study as pieces of evidence) or phototoxicity (the main cause of which is an increased ROS level in a sample upon strong laser illumination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Icha et al., 2017</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> as an evidence showing the ROS level remained low and stable in LGs during imaging). No correction for photobleaching was performed. Time-lapse recordings of LGs and the resulting t-series images were processed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and MATLAB software.

Larvae were washed using PBS three times, quickly rinsed with 70% ethanol, and then washed and dissected in the Schneider medium in room temperature. The LGs (with CNS, ring gland, heart tube, and fat bodies) were cultured in the Schneider medium (with 15% FBS and 0.2 mg/mL insulin) supplied with EdU solution with the final concentration of 10 μM for an hour. Following incubation in the EdU solution, the LGs were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min, rinsed with 16% Normal Goat Serum twice, washed with 0.1% PTX for 20 min, and then incubated in a Click-iT reaction cocktail (430 μl 1xClick iT reaction buffer, 20 μl CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 μl Alexa Fluor azide, and 50 μl 1xClick iT EdU buffer additive) for 30 min at room temperature in dark. After the incubation, the cocktail solution was removed and the LGs were washed twice using 16% Normal Goat Serum (each 10 minutes) and mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI in glass bottom dishes. The EdU signal from the LGs was imaged using a laser with the excitation wavelength at 488 nm. Number of EdU-positive cells per primary lobe were counted manually in Fiji using a Cell counter plugin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Cell death monitoring during live imaging</title><p>Cell death during long-term live imaging was monitored using the nucleic acid stain Sytox Green (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog number S7020). The Sytox Green dye functions as an indicator of dying cells as the dye is impermeable to the plasma membrane of live cells.

The Fly-FUCCI system consists of two major UAS transgenes carrying GFP or RFP-tagged degrons: a UAS-GFP.E2f1.1–230 (the N terminus amino acid 1–230 of E2f1 was fused to GFP) and a UAS-mRFP1.CycB.1–266 (the N terminus amino acid 1–266 of CycB was fused to RFP). E2f1 is degraded by the S phase-dependent ubiquitin ligase CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> while CycB is targeted by the APC/C for proteasomal degradation from mid-mitosis throughout G1 phase. By combining the two probes, cells that are in G1 phase are labelled in green (E2f1-GFP accumulation), in S phase are labelled in red (CycB-mRFP accumulation), and in G2 phase are labelled in yellow (presence of both E2f1-GFP and CycB-mRFP). The fluorescent intensities of GFP and RFP of individual cells in the LG in each time point were tracked and exported using the Fiji TrackMate plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>) and plotted using GraphPad Prism (Ver. 6).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Heat map construction</title><p>Spatial information of cellular events (including cell division and differentiation) from long-term LG videos was extracted using 2 MATLAB scripts and an image analysis workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; Data and Code Availability; Tanentzapf lab GitHub). The workflow contained 9 steps: (1) The frame where cellular events were identified was saved as an image (in.tiff) using Fiji. The heart tube (as a landmark structure) was annotated based on the well-defined location of it with respect to the two lobes of the LG (see step 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, heart tube was highlighted in a white line next to the LG lobe). The image was then loaded into the first custom written script (Data and Code Availability; Tanentzapf lab GitHub). (2) The image was rotated to align the heart tube along the y-axis so that the heart tube was in parallel to the y-axis. (3) For later comparison, the image was then flipped so that the lobe was facing the right side and the heart tube was facing the left side. The step was designed to adjust all LG lobes facing the same direction with respect to the landmark structure. (4) The boundary of the lobe and the location where a cellular event was observed were manually selected. (5) A bounding box was created by the script and the width and height of the bounding box were defined. (6) The total width and height of the bounding box were divided equally into five segments (each as 20% of the total width and height, respectively) to create a grid. (7) A single heatmap showing the location of a cellular event was created. (8–9) Multiple heatmaps from different videos were combined as a final heatmap using the second custom script (Data and Code Availability; Tanentzapf lab GitHub). To statistically compare heat maps, correlation coefficients between heat maps were calculated using a corrcoef function in MATLAB. A correlation coefficient value from 0 to 0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–0.75, and 0.75–1 was defined as no correlation, weak correlation, moderate correlation, and strong correlation, respectively. A weak correlation suggested that a shift but not a complete relocation of cellular events was observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Spatiotemporal analyses of progenitor mitotic events</title><p>Mitotic events were tracked in blood progenitors labelled by dome-Gal4 &gt;UAS mGFP or dome-MESO-GFP in long-term LG videos using Fiji. The following quantitative analyses were performed on the mitotic events: (1) Duration of mitotic events was defined as the time a mother progenitor spent from the onset of mitosis throughout to the end where the nucleus of two progenies reformed and were clearly visualized (approximately in telophase; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The onset of mitosis was defined as 40 frames (roughly 10 min) before the nucleus breakdown (which happens in prophase) was observed. The same criteria were applied to all mitosis analysis in our study. (2) The cell size of individual daughter cells post-mitosis was tracked over 3 hr and measured in Fiji using a Polygon ROI Selection tool. The ROI was drawn along the cell membrane marked by dome-Gal4 driven membranous GFP. A z stack with 2 slices was projected in Fiji using maximum projection before the measurement. (3) The position of a contractile ring was inferred based on the location where the cleavage furrow occurred in dividing cells. The distance of the contractile ring to the two poles of a dividing cell was measured in Fiji using a Straight Line ROI Selection tool. A z stack with 2 slices was projected in Fiji using maximum projection before the measurement. (4) The JAK-STAT signaling activity (reflected by dome-MESO-GFP intensity) of daughter cells were measured in Fiji using a Circle ROI Selection tool. (5) ρ-mitosis: as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, a ρ-mitosis was defined as a mitosis occurs on the plane formed by right-left and posterior-anterior axes. Progenitors divide away or towards heart tube on this plane at any angles ranging from 0 to 180 degree are classified as ρ-mitosis. (6) z-mitosis: as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, a z-mitosis was defined as a mitosis occurs along the dorsal-ventral axis at any angles ranging from 0 to 180 degree. (7) The orientation of a ρ-mitosis relative to the heart tube was determined based on the angle between the mitosis direction (the direction that was perpendicular to cleavage furrow and parallel to the positions of two newly formed nuclei of daughter cells) and the heart tube. The newly formed nuclei of daughter cells were used to determine the relative position of the cells and infer the plane of division. The angle was manually measured in Fiji using the Angle tool function. To test if the orientation of mitosis follows normal distribution or shows a bias towards a certain direction in the LGs, a Q-Q plot statistical analysis was performed in R. The orientation data from individual progenitors undergoing mitosis were loaded into R and the Q-Q plot was produced using a qqnorm function in the R Stats package. To add a theoretical Q-Q line onto the plot, the QQline function was used. The linearity of the points lining along the Q-Q line suggests that the data follows normal distribution. (8) Distances of ρ- and z-mitosis to the heart tube and posterior end of the LG on the heart tube (a well-defined position where the PSC localized) was measured manually in Fiji using the Straight Line ROI Selection tool. (9) The mitotic index of progenitors was calculated by dividing the number of pH3 labelled progenitors (pH3<sup>+</sup> dome<sup>+</sup>) by the total number of progenitors (dome<sup>+</sup>) in the LG. Number of pH3<sup>+</sup> progenitors were counted in Fiji using the Cell Counter plugin. (10) The positions where blood progenitors divide inside a LG were recorded and the information from multiple long-term videos was then summarized in a heat map (as described above in the Heat map construction section) to visualize regions with different level of mitotic activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-9"><title>Information of main markers used to track differentiation</title><p>To track blood progenitor differentiations in real-time, dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed were used in combination throughout the study to indicate the differentiation status of a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Pieces of critical information of the two markers were provided. (1) dome-MESO-GFP: The dome-MESO-GFP line is a marker of JAK-STAT positive blood progenitors and was generated by swapping the LacZ part of dome-MESO-LacZ line with a GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hombría et al., 2005</xref>). The construct of the dome-MESO-LacZ transgene was not a complete enhancer trap containing the entire <italic>domeless</italic> gene promoter sequence but rather a 2.8 kb fragment from the first exon and first intron, containing multiple STAT binding sites. The expression of dome-MESO construct has been further shown to be dependent on JAK-STAT signaling, demonstrating that JAK-STAT signaling forms a positive feedback loop where the activity of itself can promote the expression of its own receptor Dome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hombría et al., 2005</xref>). This indicates, together with the original study where the dome-MESO-LacZ was developed, that the dome-MESO-GFP/LacZ lines are reliable JAK-STAT signaling reporters to track progenitor cell fate. (2) eater-dsRed: The eater-dsRed line was chosen to track the differentiation status of a progenitor for the following reasons: (a) It was an enhancer-trap line made and verified to be able to accurately reflect spatial-temporal expression of the <italic>eater</italic> gene in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroeger et al., 2012</xref>). (b) A further study confirmed that eater-dsRed marks both differentiated plasmatocytes (high eater-dsRed level) and distal progenitors that already commit to a plasmatocyte fate (lower eater-dsRed level than mature plasmatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>). By tracking eater-dsRed level in combination with dome-MESO-GFP, the full range of the transition of a cell undergoing differentiation can be captured (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–N</xref> as examples). (c) The reason of choosing eater-dsRed instead of HmlΔ-dsRed to track differentiation events was because, as verified and demonstrated in other two studies using genetics and single cell sequencing approaches, the HmlΔ-dsRed line marks both plasmatocytes and crystal cell precursors (Hml<sup>+</sup> Lozenge<sup>+</sup>, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girard et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, using HmlΔ-dsRed as a differentiation marker brings up the possibility of mixing up crystal cells and/or plasmatocytes when cells were tracked in live imaging experiments, which can make analyzing and interpreting data of differentiation kinetics complicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Spatiotemporal analyses of differentiation</title><p>Differentiation events were tracked in videos of LGs carrying dome-MESO-GFP (a JAK-STAT signaling activity reporter that marks blood progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>) and eater-dsRed (a marker that starts to appear from distal committed progenitors to mature plasmatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroeger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tokusumi et al., 2009</xref>). Blood progenitors stay in a steady state (cells expressing either dome<sup>high</sup> eater<sup>low</sup> before sigmoid differentiation or dome<sup>high</sup> eater<sup>high</sup> before linear differentiation) prior to the beginning of changes in dome and/or eater levels following differentiation. The time point where we can record such changes was therefore the exit point from the steady state and was denoted as ‘frame 0 or 0 hr’. To quantify differentiation, the videos were saved as RGB stacks for the Fiji TrackMate plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). All pixel intensities were preserved equivalent as original data without adjustments on brightness and contrast. A tracking function implanted in TrackMate toolbox with a LoG (Laplacian of Gaussian) detector was applied to follow differentiating blood progenitors in a video. The raw intensity values of GFP and RFP of a cell at individual time points were exported to a spreadsheet (.xml format). The ratio of dsRed:GFP in each cell at individual time points was then calculated from raw dataset and plotted to visualize the curve shape. The dsRed:GFP ratio over time reflected how the two markers change over time relative to each other and how fast a blood progenitor loses its identity. Sigmoid or linear type of differentiation was categorized based on the shape of the ratio curve (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). The terms ‘sigmoid’ and ‘linear’ were used for descriptive purposes in this study but not mechanistic and are interchangeable with a more detailed description: a ratio curve in sigmoidal shape showed that at the beginning cells express dome<sup>high</sup> eater<sup>low</sup> following up by slow and fast phases of transition, while a ratio curve in linear shape showed that at the beginning cells express dome<sup>high</sup> eater<sup>high</sup> following up by a transition in a consistent rate. To normalize real-time fluorescent signals of dome-EMSO-GFP and eater-dsRed to be able to compare signals across samples/videos, a modified version of fluorescence normalization method for live fly guts was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). The original normalization method required modifications since it was designed for a situation where one marker gradually changes over time while the other marker does not change over time. In comparison, the current study on LGs was dealing with a scenario where the two markers gradually change over time (dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed) and the differences between the two markers at any time points are required to be preserved after normalization. The signals were normalized as follow: First, the RGB stack of a video was inputted into the Fiji TrackMate plugin to obtain the raw intensities of dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed at individual time points. Second, the raw intensities were imported into MATLAB and normalized using the equations (Norm.G = (G<sub>t</sub> - min (G,R))/(max (G,R) - min (G,R)); Norm.R = (R<sub>t</sub> - min (G,R))/(max (G,R) - min (G,R))) where the difference between the fluorescent values at every time point (G<sub>t</sub> and R<sub>t</sub> representing dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed, respectively) and the minimum fluorescent value was divided by the difference between the maximum fluorescent value and the minimum fluorescent value. Minimum and maximum fluorescent values were obtained across the two markers, as shown by the ‘min’ and ‘max’ functions of the equation. By using this approach, the patterns, trends, and relative differences between two markers were all preserved to make comparisons across the videos. Moreover, we confirmed that the normalization method preserved the trends of the markers during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>) compared to the raw values before normalization. The custom-written MATLAB code used to perform normalization was deposited in the Tanentzapf lab Github (Data and Code Availability). To quantify the rate of each type of differentiation, a linear regression fit was applied to the fast phase of a sigmoid differentiation curve and to the entire linear differentiation curve using a custom written R script (Data and Code Availability, Tanentzapf lab GitHub). The slope of the fitted line was calculated as follows: Slope = Changes of dsRed:GFP ratio/Time. To analyse the spatial distribution of differentiations in the LGs, a heat map was constructed (as described above in the Heat map construction section). The locations where blood progenitors differentiate inside a LG were recorded and the information from multiple long-term videos was then summarized in a heat map to visualize hot and cold spots of differentiation events.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-11"><title>In vivo analysis of LGs</title><p>To perform in vivo analysis on LGs, a method of histo-cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stoltzfus et al., 2020</xref>) was applied to extract fluorescent signals of dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed and the positional information of individual cells from the LGs of wild-type control and <italic>E. coli</italic> infected larvae using the TrackMate plugin. Three main steps of histo-cytometry were performed: (1) Imaging: Entire LGs of genotype dome-MESO-GFP; eater-dsRed were imaged by a FV1000 microscopy with a step size 1.5 μm using exactly equivalent laser settings across wild-type control and infection groups. Importantly, the TrackMate-based automatic method used to perform histo-cytometry analysis works best on single sections with cells clearly separated from each other. To unbiasedly select slices across samples and different groups, we took the slides that are located at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total thickness (or z axis) of the LG. The imaged LG slides were saved as OIB files in Fluoview and inputted into Fiji as RGB stacks (in.tiff) for the following analysis. (2) Segmentation: To segment individual nuclei in the imaged LGs, the automatic ROI selection tool implanted in the TrackMate plugin with a LoG detector was used. The Blob diameter was set as 13 and the threshold was set as 2.5 in TrackMate across all LG images to reliably select all nuclei. Using the method, in total 2946 cells (LG#1: 795 cells in total, LG#2: 923 cells in total, LG#3: 1228 cells in total) from the wild type LGs and 2985 cells from the LGs following infection (LG#1: 944 cells in total, LG#2: 871 cells in total, LG#3: 1170 cells in total) were captured. From these cells, an Excel-based method (using the rand() function) was performed to completely randomize their order and then took 2500 cells randomly from the two groups that were used for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–N</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref> file). (3) Visualization: The fluorescent intensities of dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed of individual nuclei were extracted and plotted as a scatter plot using R to visualize the distribution of cells based on the expression levels of dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-12"><title>Oxidative stress measurement in ex vivo LGs</title><p>A gstD-GFP reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008</xref>) was used to measure oxidative stress in ex vivo cultured LGs over 13 hr.

The GFP intensity from individual lobes of LGs was tracked in Fiji using the Polygon ROI Selection tool over 13 hr. The mean grey value of gstD-GFP intensity was measured.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Substantiate statistical analysis.</p><p>Since this study is based on the analysis of live imaging, detailed data analysis, interpretation, and presentation are all core to the paper. All the reviewers raised questions regarding data analysis/presentation or statistics. Please find Rev#1 points 5-6, Rev#2 points 1,2,4,5,6, and Rev#3 points 3,6.</p><p>2. Provide additional information about the lymph gland development following ex vivo culture.</p><p>Rev#1 and 3 raised questions about how relevant the lymph gland development/response is compared to in vivo status after ex vivo culture. How similar the lymph gland is after ex vivo culture in terms of their growth? How faithful ex vivo culture is in mimicking in vivo conditions after infection? Details can be found in Rev#1 points 2-3 and Rev#3 points 1-2.</p><p>3. Validate the two modes of differentiation.</p><p>Rev#1 and Rev#2 raised questions as to whether the two modes both give rise to the true mature blood cell. Additional spatial and temporal analysis on progenitors or mature blood cells originating from two modes needs to be performed. For example, do both modes lead to the differentiation of P1+ true mature blood cells during development or upon infection? Please find details from Rev#1 point 4.</p><p>4. Add essential references. Please find Rev#3 point 4.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite the significant advancement made in this study, there are several points to be clarified before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. It could be a trivial issue, but it was hard for the reviewer to follow the main and supplementary figures along the text as figures are not arranged linearly and some figure callings are even missing in the text.</p><p>2. For the infection experiment; although the authors showed that oral infection induces the differentiation of P1+ plasmatocytes or Hnt+ crystal cells (Khadilkar et al., 2017), it is unclear at which time point they dissected the lymph gland following infection and how much the lymph gland was differentiated at the point of observation (Figure 4-7). Lymph glands in vivo would receive systemic immune factors over the immune activation while lymph glands taken out would be devoid of such signals. Thus, differentiation phenotypes of the lymph gland could differ depending on how long the larvae were exposed to a systemic in vivo environment versus an ex vivo culture system. For example, lymph glands being dissected after 6 hours post-infection may show a different differentiation program when compared to lymph glands dissected after 12 or 24 hours post-infection.</p><p>3. Concerning the above point, how is the ex vivo culture system biologically relevant following infection, and how close is it compared to lymph glands in vivo? Do lymph glands cultured ex vivo activate immune-responsive genes or representative immune markers comparable to lymph glands in vivo following infection?</p><p>4. The authors proposed two different modes of differentiation, sigmoidal and linear. This is a compelling finding and provides interesting insights; however, it is unclear when and where the two modes of differentiation occur during lymph gland development. Given that the sigmoidal mode initiates with Dome_high &amp; eater_low progenitors, the sigmoid mode of differentiation seems to appear in the typical medullary zone. Dome_high abruptly drops to Dome_low and eater_low rises at the end but the level of eater is still low compared to the starting point of the linear mode. However, the linear mode starts with Dome_high &amp; eater_high population, which could indicate the intermediate progenitors. In fact, the authors showed that the linear mode is abundant in the prospective intermediate region (Fig6F) while the ratio of sigmoid mode is higher near the heart (Fig6D). Therefore, the two different modes of differentiation may not go parallel but are consecutive. The authors describe the two modes as if both modes take place to finally differentiate progenitors into mature hemocytes, but this may not be the case. Temporal ambiguity of the two modes hinders the significance of this finding and the authors need to clarify whether the two modes occur in parallel within the same region of the lymph gland.</p><p>5. The authors showed that the sigmoid type differentiation induces the eater and turns off the dome (Figure 5C-D). But absolute GFP/RFP intensities changed in this process are rather marginal in Fig7A compared to Figure 5C-D or Fig7A'. A similar discrepancy is seen in Fig7C-D and FigC'-D'. The infection seems to cause a significant increase in eater-RFP in Fig7D' but the absolute value change in Fig7D shows eater rises from 25 to 35ish. Thus, it is not clear how the &quot;norm intensity&quot; reliably represents the absolute value of GFP and RFP in this presentation. How do cells used in the analyses look? Which graph matches better with the real expressions? And do they divide?</p><p>6. Statistics are missing in some graphs. In Fig7N, each data points need to be presented rather than showing dynamite plots. Fig1F represents a small sample size and would be better showing each data point rather than a mean value.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The explanation in line 431 seems incorrect, as the increased number of high high cells upon infection is equivalent to the decreased number of low low cells, and thus would not lead to an increase in the absolute number of differentiated cells. upon infection</p><p>See my hypothesis in the public review; perhaps the analysis has missed that cells remain in the intermediate state in the sigmoidal path for a very long time.</p><p>2. Figure 5C-D. Not clear to me what the scatter represents.</p><p>Are these multiple different cells from the same lymph gland tracked over time?</p><p>3. Figure 6C-F, could the authors show some sort of actual graph of the LG to indicate where these changes in the division rate are?</p><p>This isn't obvious to the non-initiate if this is at the edge, or where.</p><p>4. Figure 7A', &quot;-D', &quot; should be plotted with the same x-axis time course to be able to compare the dynamics from one to the other.</p><p>5. Need higher n in Figure 7F.</p><p>6. Please show how many cells are in the P category for both conditions in Figure 7N.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To strengthen the science:</p><p>1. The authors should compare ex vivo GstD-GFP and Sytox levels to those seen in fixed samples (in vivo), similar to what was done with EdU and cell cycle in Figure S3. It is important to know whether this ex vivo system maintains similar ROS and cell death levels as that seen in vivo to help determine the limitations of the ex vivo co-culture system.</p><p>a. For example, based on past studies of ROS in the LG (Ex: Owusu-Ansah, et al. 2009), one would expect to see higher GstD-GFP levels in the progenitors/MZ than in differentiated cells/CZ. But in Figure S2C, that doesn't seem to be the case. ROS levels seem to be low throughout the LG. Please explain.</p><p>2. The authors should also compare the numbers/ratios of progenitors and differentiated cells at the beginning and end of live imaging with in vivo LGs from age-matched larvae. This would help determine whether the process of differentiation they follow ex vivo produces similar results as that seen in vivo.</p><p>a. While this is beyond the scope of the current paper, staining or imaging of key molecules that are expected to be high in progenitors (E-cad, Ci, etc) or differentiated cells (P1, lz, etc) and comparing levels in vivo vs ex vivo would be helpful validation of the system.</p><p>3. Correlation coefficient analysis is inconsistent. In the methods, the authors say 0 to 0.5 are defined as a &quot;weak correlation&quot;. 0 to 0.5 is a wide range of correlation and is not consistent with standard statistical practices that categorize 0 to 0.25 as not correlated, 0.25 to 0.5 as weak correlation, 0.5 to 0.75 as moderate correlation, and 0.75 to 1 as strong correlation.</p><p>a. In fact, on lines 385-395, a correlation coefficient of 0.14 is interpreted as &quot;not greatly altered&quot;, while 0.45 is interpreted as &quot;marked differences&quot;, and 0.49 as &quot;a general increase&quot;.</p><p>Considering a correlation coefficient below 0.25 as not correlated is more in line with standard practices but not consistent with the authors' explanation in the methods.</p><p>i. The authors should update their methods to reflect a more standard, and consistent, interpretation of correlation coefficients. If there is reason to believe this standard does not apply here, please explain.</p><p>b. Furthermore, in lines 311-314, the authors say that a correlation coefficient of 0.44 is consistent with a &quot;weak correlation&quot;. There is no substantial difference between 0.44, 0.45, and 0.49, therefore either all should be considered &quot;weak correlations&quot; or all are correlated, the authors should not use or imply different terms for these very similar values. Please update the language to reflect a more consistent interpretation of correlation coefficients.</p><p>4. In line 463, the authors say that Hml (but not Pxn) is a mature blood cell marker, and yet both this paper (Figures 4, S1, and S4), as well as Spratford et al. 2021 and Girard et al. 2021, shows Hml is an intermediate progenitor marker and therefore not a mature cell marker. It is curious that these papers are not mentioned when mentioning other papers on intermediate progenitors (e.g. lines 87-90 and lines 458-460) as they present compelling evidence that Hml/dome-meso marks intermediate progenitors (as the authors show in Figures 4/S4) and that IPs serve as a transitional state between progenitors and differentiated cells.</p><p>5. One caveat not noted in the manuscript is that because the authors use Eater-Dsred to monitor differentiation they are only able to follow differentiation events leading to plasmatocytes and not crystal cells (although the authors do point out that crystal cells are not thought to transition through an Eater positive transitional state).</p><p>6. Some statistics seem to be missing and it is not clear if statistical tests were not performed or if they were performed but found to be not significant. Several conclusions and claims that the authors state (especially in the WT vs infection section) seem to be based on data without statistics and so should either be interpreted with that in mind or it should be explained why the stats could not be performed if this is true. Examples include:</p><p>a. Figure 6B, is there any significant difference between linear diff in WT vs infection or sigmoid diff in WT vs infection?</p><p>b. Figure 7E, are there any significant differences between WT and infection in those graphs?</p><p>i. For example, whether these changes are significantly different affect the authors' conclusions in lines 413-416</p><p>c. Figure 7N, are there any significant differences between WT and infection in those graphs? (be careful here how sample size (n=) is defined because each individual lobe can be considered a replicate but not each cell.)</p><p>d. Figure 7I-N, why are there so few cells? Were the number of cells in each lobe counted in 3D? If so, there should be many more cells total for 8 lobes. Please explain.</p><p>e. Actual p-values should be included in the figure legends (stars can be kept in the figures themselves).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84085.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Despite the significant advancement made in this study, there are several points to be clarified before publication in eLife.</p><p>1.

For the infection experiment; although the authors showed that oral infection induces the differentiation of P1+ plasmatocytes or Hnt+ crystal cells (Khadilkar et al., 2017), it is unclear at which time point they dissected the lymph gland following infection and how much the lymph gland was differentiated at the point of observation (Figure 4-7).

First, we would like to state that reading the reviewer’s comments here, as well as other reviewer comments, convinced us we needed to add a paragraph to the discussion spelling out the possible limitations of the ex vivo culture method. This new paragraph is the second paragraph of the Discussion line 493-503 in the revised manuscript and directly brings up the reviewer concerns expressed above. Specifically, it is difficult to prove beyond doubt that differentiation is identical following infection in cultured, ex vivo<italic>,</italic> conditions and in vivo conditions. However, we think our data does address this issue at least partially as outlined below.</p><p>a) The reviewer asks about the persistence of systemic signals after dissection and start of the ex vivo culture procedure following infection versus in vivo LGs. In particular the reviewer is concerned that lymph glands at 6 hrs post-infection may show a different differentiation program compared to lymph glands at 12 or 24 hours post-infection. We agree this is a legitimate concern, that points to one of the limitations of the kind of ex vivo culture protocols we use here. We attempted to address this issue by using the infection protocol on the same population of larva and then splitting them into a group that was analyzed in vivo (with flies dissected at set intervals and lymph glands fixed, stained , and analyzed), and a group that was analyzed with the ex vivo culture protocol. The results are presented in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1. The in vivo data is somewhat more variable but we do not detect statistically significant differences between the two groups. This data is shown now discussed in the Results line 405-407.</p><p>b) The paper includes several other comparisons of the behavior of ex vivo and in vivo models following infection. As far as we could see, within the limit of looking at dynamic data ex vivo versus static data for the in vivo, the two groups behaved quite similarly. For example, when we looked at proliferation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 in vivo data versus Figure 4H ex vivo data), the proportion of blood progenitors undergoing mitosis decreased in a similar manner both in vivo (assayed using pH3) and ex vivo LGs (assayed using live imaging). Another example, is looking at differentiation, between the two groups we see similar trends in terms of number of differentiation events (Figure 7I-N in vivo data versus Figure 6A ex vivo data), and type of differentiation events (Figure 7I-N in vivo data versus Figure 6B ex vivo data). We now created a new section in Discussion line 493-500 to highlight potential technical limitations such as this and our efforts to mitigate them.</p><p>c) To answer the reviewer’s question we started sustained oral infection 78 hours after egg laying, and dissected at 84 hours after egg laying. This is a shorter infection protocol than the one we used previously (in Khadilkar et al., 2017) where infection lasted for 12 hours. This information is outlined in the Methods section line 1096-1097.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Concerning the above point, how is the ex vivo culture system biologically relevant following infection, and how close is it compared to lymph glands in vivo? Do lymph glands cultured ex vivo activate immune-responsive genes or representative immune markers comparable to lymph glands in vivo following infection?</p></disp-quote><p>As we highlight in the reply to point 2 above we observe similarities in the in vivo and ex vivo response following infection. The additional question asked by the reviewer here, whether we see an elevation of immune markers in the ex vivo culture is an intriguing one. We believe some of our data already provides answers. Specifically, we employed the eater-dsRed enhancer trap line to visualize plasmatocytes. The gene <italic>eater</italic> encodes the protein that is essential for plasmatocytes to phagocytose bacteria (Kocks C. et al., <italic>Cell</italic>, 2005). Eater itself has also been used previously as a readout of immune responsive gene or an immune marker (for example see Ye Y.H., McGraw E.A, <italic>BMC Res Notes</italic>, 2011). It has been shown that the expression of <italic>eater</italic> gene is transcriptionally regulated (Kroeger, P. T., JR. et al., <italic>Genesis</italic>, 2012) and that following infection, the expression of <italic>eater</italic> was upregulated (Ye Y.H., McGraw E.A, <italic>BMC Res Notes</italic>, 2011). If the reviewer looks at Figure 7J (not infected) versus Figure 7L (infected) they will notice a general shift of the blood cells to higher levels of eater-dsRed expression in essentially all the cell types. This data is by no means conclusive but is suggestive of immune activation. We now mention this in the Results section line 459-461.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors proposed two different modes of differentiation, sigmoidal and linear. This is a compelling finding and provides interesting insights; however, it is unclear when and where the two modes of differentiation occur during lymph gland development. Given that the sigmoidal mode initiates with Dome_high &amp; eater_low progenitors, the sigmoid mode of differentiation seems to appear in the typical medullary zone. Dome_high abruptly drops to Dome_low and eater_low rises at the end but the level of eater is still low compared to the starting point of the linear mode. However, the linear mode starts with Dome_high &amp; eater_high population, which could indicate the intermediate progenitors. In fact, the authors showed that the linear mode is abundant in the prospective intermediate region (Fig6F) while the ratio of sigmoid mode is higher near the heart (Fig6D).</p></disp-quote><p>Our thinking is very much in line with the reviewer’s suggestion that the cell population we identify as undergoing the linear trajectory overlaps with the population previously identified as “intermediate progenitors''. This is based on the location where they differentiate and the profile of markers they express. However we did not state this outright out of abundance of caution. The population of “intermediate progenitors” as described in Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020 <italic>Developmental Biology</italic> and Spratford et al., 2021 <italic>Development</italic> papers, are defined as expressing both the mature hemocyte marker Hml and the progenitor marker Dome. In our study, we used Dome and <italic>eater</italic>, not Dome and Hml. We used <italic>eater</italic> and not Hml is because Hml also marks crystal cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, as discussed in the section “Information of main markers used to track differentiation” in our Methods section line 994-1000 based on Blanco-Obregon et al., 2020 and Girard et al., 2021). It is possible we were cautious to a fault here so we have now added in the Discussion line 527-529 to mention that cells undergoing linear type differentiation are likely to be intermediate progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, the two different modes of differentiation may not go parallel but are consecutive. The authors describe the two modes as if both modes take place to finally differentiate progenitors into mature hemocytes, but this may not be the case. Temporal ambiguity of the two modes hinders the significance of this finding and the authors need to clarify whether the two modes occur in parallel within the same region of the lymph gland.</p></disp-quote><p>We should have mentioned this but we never observed the consecutive mode described by the reviewer in hundreds of hours imaging lymph glands. That is, we did not observe a linear type followed by a sigmoid differentiation or a sigmoid type followed by a linear differentiation. As the reviewer notes “the level of eater is still low compared to the starting point of the linear mode”, therefore our data is not consistent with a consecutive model. Nonetheless, in an attempt to address the “temporal ambiguity” pointed out by the reviewer we decided to specifically show that the two pathways could either occur in parallel or at different time points within the same region of the lymph gland. This analysis of differentiation trajectories in both space and time (which we should mention is extremely time consuming, limiting the possible number of data points) is shown in Figure 6. We searched in our data for areas where we could find cells undergoing both the sigmoid and linear types of differentiation occurring in the same area in lymph glands from control and infected larva. Shown in Figures 6D and 6F (wildtype control) and Figure 6E and 6G (infected larva) are regions where we identified cells undergoing the two types of differentiation trajectories in the same region. We then followed each of these cells individually to determine when the differentiation event took place. We identified the time point where differentiation initiated and represented it as the percentage of time into the movie (that is, 25% means 25% of the entire movie had already been recorded when differentiation started, a similar procedure to that carried out in Figure 1—figure supplement 3F). For example, in the wild type, we show two cells (cell 1 and cell 2) in box#1 that underwent sigmoid and linear type differentiation, respectively, starting at the same time while the cells in the box labeled #2 underwent differentiation that started at different time points. In infection group for example, we saw in box#1 Cell 2 and Cell 3 that underwent sigmoid and linear differentiation, respectively, starting at the same time point while other cells in other boxes all differentiate at different time points. This data shows that parallel differentiation takes place, it of course does not discount the “consecutive model” but as we mention above, we have not directly observed such a trajectory. So in conclusion, to date we clearly see the two modes of differentiation occurring in parallel or at different time points but never observed them occurring consecutively. This new data is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and discussed in line 394-400 and 420-423 of the Results section.</p><p>We now also mention in the Discussion line 508-512 that our data is in line with single cell sequencing data for the LG that has shown that there are multiple distinct paths that a progenitor can differentiate into a plasmatocyte (see Figure 5h in this publication: Cho et al., Single-cell transcriptome maps of myeloid blood cell lineages in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Nat Coms</italic>, 2020). Their data suggests that there is a PH4-PM1-PM2 path (which contains an intermediate state during differentiation) and a PH5/6-PM3/4 path (which contains no intermediate state). PH: progenitors; PM: plasmatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors showed that the sigmoid type differentiation induces the eater and turns off the dome (Figure 5C-D). But absolute GFP/RFP intensities changed in this process are rather marginal in Fig7A compared to Figure 5C-D or Fig7A'. A similar discrepancy is seen in Fig7C-D and FigC'-D'. The infection seems to cause a significant increase in eater-RFP in Fig7D' but the absolute value change in Fig7D shows eater rises from 25 to 35ish. Thus, it is not clear how the &quot;norm intensity&quot; reliably represents the absolute value of GFP and RFP in this presentation. How do cells used in the analyses look? Which graph matches better with the real expressions? And do they divide?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out as we should have explained better the data shown in Figure 7 and Figure 5, which would have prevented this misunderstanding. First we wanted to explain why and how we normalized the data shown in Figures 5C-D and in Figure 7C-D. The reason expression needs to be normalized is in order to be able to compare signals across multiple samples and several independent experiments. Our normalization protocol is a modified version of the one established by Martin et al., (2018, see Methods section “Spatiotemporal analyses of differentiation” in line 1024-1041). The original normalization method from Martin et al., 2018 required modifications since it was designed for a situation where one marker gradually changes over time while the other marker does not change over time. In comparison, in our present study on LGs we dealt with a scenario where both markers used (dome-MESO-GFP and eater-dsRed) gradually changed over time.</p><p>We have taken the reviewer’s concern to heart and went back to our dataset and re-analysed it to compare normalized and raw data. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and in Methods line 1041-1043, raw data shown in the two bars on the left and normalized data on the two bars on the right. We think this data argues that normalization does not change the overall interpretation.</p><p>We have included with the manuscript movies (Video 6-9) corresponding to Figure 7A-7D that illustrate how the cells look and how intensities of dome GFP and eater-dsRed change overtime. The colors used in the Videos S6-S9 was based on raw intensities of dome GFP and eater-dsRed. We now also included the images in Figure 7 —figure supplement 1 showing how a single cell from Figure 7A-7D looked like.</p><p>Finally, we did not observe cells undergoing differentiation and mitosis at the same time nor cells divide after they differentiate in all our live imaging videos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Statistics are missing in some graphs. In Fig7N, each data points need to be presented rather than showing dynamite plots. Fig1F represents a small sample size and would be better showing each data point rather than a mean value.</p></disp-quote><p>We again apologize for not being clearer about this but the data shown in figure 7N is simply an unprocessed raw number, not an average, from a total cell count of cells from 6 primary lobes of 3 LGs (now mentioned in Methods line 1055-1076). In other words, what is shown is the complete data set for 3 entire lymph glands, specifically the control lymph glands shown in Figure 7J and the lymph glands from infected larvae shown in Figure 7L. This was indicated in Results (line 471) and figure legend (line 780-781) sections. That is, Figure 7N showed the total number of cells (shown individually as dots) in each quadrant of 7J and 7L. The benefit of this (also brought up by the reviewer 3’s point #5) is that showing the numbers of cells in each quadrant helps the reader interpret the data more easily. We made this explicit in the figure legends now.</p><p>Also, as the reviewer suggested we modified Figure 1F to show all data points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The explanation in line 431 seems incorrect, as the increased number of high high cells upon infection is equivalent to the decreased number of low low cells, and thus would not lead to an increase in the absolute number of differentiated cells. upon infection</p><p>See my hypothesis in the public review; perhaps the analysis has missed that cells remain in the intermediate state in the sigmoidal path for a very long time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we probably overstated the link between the change in population of the two intermediate populations (dome low eater low and dome high eater high). We have rewrote this section (now in line 467-477) to be descriptive and clearly state the parts that are speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 5C-D. Not clear to me what the scatter represents.</p><p>Are these multiple different cells from the same lymph gland tracked over time?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for not making this clearer but both Figure 5C and Figure 5D represent a single cell that was tracked over time. In Figure 5C, each dot represents the fluorescent intensity of dome-GFP or eater-dsRed at that time point, while 5D shows the ratio of the green and red signal at that time point. We modified the figure legends of Figure 5C-5D in line 733-734 and line 736-737 to state this in clearer fashion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 6C-F, could the authors show some sort of actual graph of the LG to indicate where these changes in the division rate are?</p><p>This isn't obvious to the non-initiate if this is at the edge, or where.</p></disp-quote><p>To make this clearer to our readers we previously included the following image with the grid we used overlaying on actual lymph gland (the figure is now in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 #6 panel which described how a heat map was generated; see Methods). Left panel from Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 and right panel from Figure 6C show the relationship between a heatmap and an actual LG. The coordinates of the two graphs are in the same orientation (see the pink dot as a reference point).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 7A', &quot;-D', &quot; should be plotted with the same x-axis time course to be able to compare the dynamics from one to the other.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair request but a bit of a tricky one because the differences in time between the linear and sigmoid trajectory meant that the data looked compressed or elongated when plotted at identical scales in different trajectories making it hard to interpret the data. However, in line with the reviewer we now made the x axis of Figure 7A’-A’’ and 7B’-7B’’ uniform and the x axis in Figure 7C’-7C’’ and 7D’-7D’’ uniform. This makes comparison within trajectories easier to compare yet still allows the shape of the curve to be apparent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Need higher n in Figure 7F.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to assure the reviewer that we tried! When compared to a lymph gland from an infected, or immune-activated, larva, wildtype controls do not exhibit a great deal of differentiation at this developmental stage (early third instar larval stage). It took a great deal of effort to get the sample size we presented in the previous version of Figure 7F. Nonetheless, we did our best to increase the sample size for WT linear differentiation and the figure is now in Figure 7G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please show how many cells are in the P category for both conditions in Figure 7N.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information into Figure 7N.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To strengthen the science:</p><p>1. The authors should compare ex vivo GstD-GFP and Sytox levels to those seen in fixed samples (in vivo), similar to what was done with EdU and cell cycle in Figure S3. It is important to know whether this ex vivo system maintains similar ROS and cell death levels as that seen in vivo to help determine the limitations of the ex vivo co-culture system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the GstD-GFP experiment the reviewer asked for, and added it now in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2C. Our results show that our ex vivo system maintains similar ROS levels as that seen in vivo. We now mention this data in Results line 160-162.</p><p>As for analysis of cell death, we are lucky to have access to many studies that measured the numbers of dying cells in lymph glands in vivo in 3rd instar larvae which we can compare to our ex vivo culture conditions. In ex vivo culture, we showed that following 12.5 hrs of culture period, the average number of dying cells ranged from 2-10 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> which was derived from Figure 1 —figure supplement 2E left panel). This is comparable to 0~10 dying cells reported for wildtype 3<sup>rd</sup> instar lymph glands (see Figure S1K from Mondal et al., 2011, <italic>Cell</italic> doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.041); Figure 1 of Chiu H. and Govind S., 2002, <italic>Cell death &amp; differentiation</italic> (doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401134); Figure 3G of Yu S et al., 2021, <italic>eLife</italic> (doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.60870); Figure S7A from Khadilkar et al., 2020, <italic>Cur Biol</italic> (doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.027); and Figure 6A, 6B, 6C, 6H from Araki et al., 2019, <italic>Diseases Models and Mechanisms</italic> (doi.org/10.1242/dmm.037721). We therefore conclude that the number of dying cells in the ex vivo cultured LGs falls into the normal range that is expected to be observed in in vivo LGs with 12 hours of culture. We now mention this explicitly in the text in Results line 168-172. However, after about 12.5 hours the rate of cell death under the ex vivo culture conditions we begin to see a rate of cell death that is higher than that reported in the controls. Indicating that beyond 13 hours the ex vivo culture is less reliable. This is why we capped all out movies well before we got to this time point.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84085-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. For example, based on past studies of ROS in the LG (Ex: Owusu-Ansah, et al. 2009), one would expect to see higher GstD-GFP levels in the progenitors/MZ than in differentiated cells/CZ. But in Figure S2C, that doesn't seem to be the case. ROS levels seem to be low throughout the LG. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>The images in the previous Figure S2C (the figure is now in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2A-B) indeed do not display a very obvious difference in the level of gstD-GFP between MZ and CZ. However, it is hard to tell since we did not include the red channel (to image eater-dsRed) that can help to distinguish CZ from MZ or a DIC channel that can help to visualize an entire LG. In images with the DIC channel included, the difference between MZ and CZ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) is quite apparent. Importantly, the crux of our argument in doing this experiment is that whatever the overall levels of gstD-GFP in the lymph gland are, oxidative stress did not dramatically increase through the course of the live imaging period.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84085-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should also compare the numbers/ratios of progenitors and differentiated cells at the beginning and end of live imaging with in vivo LGs from age-matched larvae. This would help determine whether the process of differentiation they follow ex vivo produces similar results as that seen in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we now included data comparing the ratios of differentiated cells to progenitors at various time points from ex vivo wild-type LGs and in vivo wild-type LGs from age-matched larvae (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3G). Specifically, although slight variation was observed at different time points, which is to be expected in an evolving system such as the lymph gland, differences in the ratio observed between the ex vivo and in vivo conditions were not statistically significant. See line 345-348.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. While this is beyond the scope of the current paper, staining or imaging of key molecules that are expected to be high in progenitors (E-cad, Ci, etc) or differentiated cells (P1, lz, etc) and comparing levels in vivo vs ex vivo would be helpful validation of the system.</p></disp-quote><p>The stainings suggested by the reviewer are all excellent suggestions and we will add these to our to-do list for the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Correlation coefficient analysis is inconsistent. In the methods, the authors say 0 to 0.5 are defined as a &quot;weak correlation&quot;. 0 to 0.5 is a wide range of correlation and is not consistent with standard statistical practices that categorize 0 to 0.25 as not correlated, 0.25 to 0.5 as weak correlation, 0.5 to 0.75 as moderate correlation, and 0.75 to 1 as strong correlation.</p><p>a. In fact, on lines 385-395, a correlation coefficient of 0.14 is interpreted as &quot;not greatly altered&quot;, while 0.45 is interpreted as &quot;marked differences&quot;, and 0.49 as &quot;a general increase&quot;.</p><p>Considering a correlation coefficient below 0.25 as not correlated is more in line with standard practices but not consistent with the authors' explanation in the methods.</p><p>i. The authors should update their methods to reflect a more standard, and consistent, interpretation of correlation coefficients. If there is reason to believe this standard does not apply here, please explain.</p><p>b. Furthermore, in lines 311-314, the authors say that a correlation coefficient of 0.44 is consistent with a &quot;weak correlation&quot;. There is no substantial difference between 0.44, 0.45, and 0.49, therefore either all should be considered &quot;weak correlations&quot; or all are correlated, the authors should not use or imply different terms for these very similar values. Please update the language to reflect a more consistent interpretation of correlation coefficients.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. We needed to have a consistent standard for correlation and we now use the following suggested standard: 0 to 0.25 as not correlated, 0.25 to 0.5 as weak correlation, 0.5 to 0.75 as moderate correlation, and 0.75 to 1 as strong correlation. We modified the text in the Results accordingly as well as explained in the Methods section line 927-931.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In line 463, the authors say that Hml (but not Pxn) is a mature blood cell marker, and yet both this paper (Figures 4, S1, and S4), as well as Spratford et al. 2021 and Girard et al. 2021, shows Hml is an intermediate progenitor marker and therefore not a mature cell marker. It is curious that these papers are not mentioned when mentioning other papers on intermediate progenitors (e.g. lines 87-90 and lines 458-460) as they present compelling evidence that Hml/dome-meso marks intermediate progenitors (as the authors show in Figures 4/S4) and that IPs serve as a transitional state between progenitors and differentiated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out, we edited the text in line with the points raised and added the missing citations into line 87-88 and line 512-514 (the previous 458-460).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. One caveat not noted in the manuscript is that because the authors use Eater-Dsred to monitor differentiation they are only able to follow differentiation events leading to plasmatocytes and not crystal cells (although the authors do point out that crystal cells are not thought to transition through an Eater positive transitional state).</p></disp-quote><p>Using our long term live imaging protocol to capture crystal cell differentiation will definitely be an important goal of our future project. The reason why we did not study crystal cells currently is because we did not have a line to label crystal cells in the red channel (the BcF6GFP enhancer trap line which would work is GFP based) which we need to be used together with dome-MESO-GFP. We now inserted a mention of this caveat in Discussion line 500-503.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Some statistics seem to be missing and it is not clear if statistical tests were not performed or if they were performed but found to be not significant. Several conclusions and claims that the authors state (especially in the WT vs infection section) seem to be based on data without statistics and so should either be interpreted with that in mind or it should be explained why the stats could not be performed if this is true. Examples include:</p><p>a. Figure 6B, is there any significant difference between linear diff in WT vs infection or sigmoid diff in WT vs infection?</p></disp-quote><p>We now performed the statistical tests requested in Figure 6B. There is a statistically significant difference in the linear differentiation trajectory between wild type LGs and LGs from infected larvae while there is no statistically significant difference in the sigmoid differentiation trajectory between wild type LGs and LGs from infected larvae. We updated Figure 6B to show this. Importantly, this does not impact our interpretation of the data in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Figure 7E, are there any significant differences between WT and infection in those graphs?</p><p>i. For example, whether these changes are significantly different affect the authors' conclusions in lines 413-416</p></disp-quote><p>We now performed the requested statistical analysis on the previous Figure 7F-7H (figures are now in Figure 7E-G). The conclusion now reads “Taken together, the data is consistent with a model whereby infection causes higher differentiation in the LGs not by increasing the rate of differentiation but rather by inducing a shift from one type of differentiation, the sigmoid trajectory, to another, the linear trajectory.” and is in line with the result of the statistical test (now described in line 445-448).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Figure 7N, are there any significant differences between WT and infection in those graphs? (be careful here how sample size (n=) is defined because each individual lobe can be considered a replicate but not each cell.)</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7N was designed to show the total number of cells in each quadrant of Figure 7J and 7L. Each bar represents a single value which shows the sum of the number of cells in each quadrant. We now explicitly stated the number of cells as well in each category of wild type and infection in the text where we describe the Results of Figure 7N in line 467-471.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Figure 7I-N, why are there so few cells? Were the number of cells in each lobe counted in 3D? If so, there should be many more cells total for 8 lobes. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have to apologize, this is definitely our mistake here, and we thank the reviewer by pointing this out.</p><p>First, we made a mistake in the sample size that was listed in the previous version of the graph (however the source data file had the correct information). Specifically, the sample size is 3 LGs that contain 6 primary lobes. We now update sample size on the graph of Figure 7I-N, figure legends (line 774-776), and Results (line 454-455).</p><p>Second, the TrackMate-based automatic method we used to perform histo-cytometry analysis can only work on single sections (not a stack) with cells clearly separated from each other. To unbiasedly select slices across samples and different groups, we took the slides that are located at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total thickness (or z axis) of the LG. That means from each LG, we sampled three slides that are fed into the Fiji TrackMate plugin. Using this method, we took in total 2946 cells (LG#1: 795 cells in total, LG#2: 923 cells in total, LG#3: 1228 cells in total) from the wt LGs and 2985 cells from the LGs of infection (LG#1: 944 cells in total, LG#2: 871 cells in total, LG#3: 1170 cells in total). From these cells, we first performed an Excel-based method (using the rand() function) to completely randomize their order and then took 2500 cells randomly from the two groups that were used for the Figure 7I-N. We now corrected the sample size on the figure and include the above explanation into the Methods section line 1055-1076.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Actual p-values should be included in the figure legends (stars can be kept in the figures themselves).</p></disp-quote><p>Although all P values were already reported in the Source data files of each figure that we included, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion to put them in the actual figure legends of every figure to make them easier to find.</p></body></sub-article></article>
