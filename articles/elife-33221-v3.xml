These parasitic flatworms rely on a syncytial outer coat called the tegument to survive within the vasculature of their host. Although the tegument is pivotal for their survival, little is known about maintenance of this tissue during the decades schistosomes survive in the bloodstream. Here, we demonstrate that the tegument relies on stem cells (neoblasts) to specify fusogenic progenitors that replace tegumental cells lost to turnover. Molecular characterization of neoblasts and tegumental progenitors led to the discovery of two flatworm-specific zinc finger proteins that are essential for tegumental cell specification. These proteins are homologous to a protein essential for neoblast-driven epidermal maintenance in free-living flatworms. Therefore, we speculate that related parasites (i.e., tapeworms and flukes) employ similar strategies to control tegumental maintenance. Since parasitic flatworms infect every vertebrate species, understanding neoblast-driven tegumental maintenance could identify broad-spectrum therapeutics to fight diseases caused by these parasites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33221.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease that infects more than 200 million people and kills 200 thousand people every year. The disease is caused by parasitic flatworms known as schistosomes. These worms can live in the bloodstream for decades, even if the host has a healthy immune system. This ability to evade the immune system is thought to be partly due to the worm’s special ‘skin’, a tissue referred to as the tegument that all parasitic flatworms have. The tegument is a massive cell that covers the entire surface of the worm, and is thought to be an adaptation that enabled flatworms to become parasites.</p><p>Despite the important role that the tegument appears to play in the biology of parasitic flatworms, very little is actually known about how this tissue is made and maintained. The tegument likely experiences a great deal of damage because it serves as the interface between the parasite and the host. Can the parasite repair the tissue as it becomes damaged? If the parasite relies upon this renewal, then preventing schistosomes from repairing their tegument could be a new way to treat schistosomiasis.</p><p>Wendt et al. developed a new technique to fluorescently label a schistosome’s tegument. This revealed that the parasite does continuously repair and replace its tegument. To better understand this process, Wendt et al. identified genes that were active in the cells responsible for making the tegument. Two of these genes appear to regulate tegument production, and these genes can be found in both parasitic and non-parasitic flatworms.</p><p>Further studies of these genes could shed light specifically onto how parasitism arose in flatworms. In addition, a better understanding of how the tegument develops and functions could identify new drug targets that could be used against the many diseases caused by parasitic flatworms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic></kwd><kwd>tegument</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI121037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>James J</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107475/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berriman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>James J</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM094575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grishin</surname><given-names>Nick V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I1505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grishin</surname><given-names>Nick V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loukas</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The specification of tegumental progenitor cells in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> relies on a pair of flatworm-specific transcription factors that are related to genes regulating epidermal specification in free-living flatworms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomes cause significant morbidity and mortality in some 200 million people in the developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hotez and Fenwick, 2009</xref>). An astounding feature of these parasites is their ability to survive for decades in the vasculature of their human hosts. Indeed, the literature is rife with cases of patients harboring reproductively active schistosomes 20–30 years after leaving endemic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hornstein et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Payet et al., 2006</xref>). How these parasites flourish for years in what has been described as ‘the most hostile environment imaginable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaren, 1980</xref>) remains an open question. A skin-like tissue known as the tegument is thought to be key for the schistosome’s long-term survival inside the vasculature of the host. The tegument is a continuous syncytium that covers the worm’s entire outer surface. While the tegument itself lacks many basic cellular components (i.e., ribosomes, nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum), this tissue is connected via cytoplasmic projections to thousands of individual cell bodies that lay beneath the parasite’s muscle layers. These tegumental cell bodies (called ‘cytons’ in the classic literature) are nucleated and provide a continuous stream of proteins and secreted material to support tegumental function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilson and Barnes, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaren, 1980</xref>). Scientists have long thought that the uninterrupted architecture of the tegument and the unique molecular composition of the tegmental surface are key for evasion of host defenses and parasite survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Skelly and Alan Wilson, 2006</xref>). Despite these essential functions, little is known on the cellular and molecular level about the development and long-term maintenance of the tegument inside the parasite’s definitive host.</p><p>Schistosomes are members of the Neodermata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehlers, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Littlewood and Bray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laumer et al., 2015</xref>), a large clade of parasitic Platyhelminthes that includes some of nature’s most notorious pathogens, including both tapeworms and some 20,000 species of flukes. Aside from being parasites, all members of the Neodermata are united by the fact that they possess a tegument similar to that of the schistosome. As in schistosomes, the importance of this tegument in the biology of these parasites cannot be overstated. The tegument forms a protective barrier that guards these parasites, not only against the host immune system, but also from the physical extremes they encounter living in the digestive system, blood, or internal organs of their host. The tegument also serves as a conduit for the worms to acquire nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halton, 1997</xref>). Indeed, during the course of evolution, tapeworms have lost their gut in favor of utilizing the tegument as their primary means of nutrient acquisition. Moreover, the tegument is rapidly remodeled on a cellular and molecular level when these parasites transition between intermediate and definitive hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hockley and McLaren, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tyler and Tyler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tyler and Hooge, 2004</xref>), suggesting that this tissue may also have been pivotal in allowing the complex multi-host lifecycles that are essential for the propagation of these obligate parasites. Given the benefits that the tegument affords these parasites, and its absence in free-living members of the phylum, it is widely credited as the key innovation leading to the evolution of parasitism in the Platyhelminthes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tyler and Tyler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tyler and Hooge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Littlewood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laumer et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, a deeper understanding of the molecular regulation of tegument development could provide important insights into flatworm evolution and suggest targets for the development of novel anthelmintics.</p><p>Upon invasion of their definitive host, the schistosome tegument is rapidly remodeled in a process that appears to be fueled by the fusion of mesenchymal cells to the outer tegument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hockley and McLaren, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skelly and Shoemaker, 2001</xref>). After this fusion takes place, however, little is known about how the cellular composition of the tegument changes during parasite maturation or during the decades that these parasites can potentially live in the vasculature. One important, but virtually unexplored, question is whether the tegument is subject to physiological cell replenishment or turnover. Since the tegument is a syncytium, it is possible that aberrant function (or death) of a small fraction of cells could be compensated for by the remaining cells in the tissue. While this possibility has not been ruled out, recent studies have hinted at a role for stem cells (called neoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2013</xref>]) in contributing to the rejuvenation and maintenance of the schistosome tegument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the primary differentiation output of neoblasts appears to be a group of short-lived cells that express an mRNA encoding TSP-2, a promising anti-schistosome vaccine candidate that is present at high-levels in the tegument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pearson et al., 2012</xref>) and on tegument-derived extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sotillo et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to expressing <italic>tsp-2</italic> mRNA, these neoblast progeny cells express a collection of known tegument-specific factors, suggesting that neoblasts are important in some capacity for contributing to the maintenance of the tegument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). However, due to a lack of tools for visualizing both the outer tegument and its attached cell bodies, the relationship between <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> neoblast progeny and the tegument remains uncharacterized.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel methodology to fluorescently label the schistosome tegument and demonstrate that tegumental cells are renewed continuously by a population of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitor cells that fuse with the tegument. To define how this process is regulated on a molecular level, we characterized the transcriptomes of both neoblasts and tegumental progenitors using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using these transcriptomes as a guide, we conducted an RNAi screen to discover molecular regulators of tegument differentiation, and identify a pair of flatworm-specific zinc finger proteins, called ZFP-1 and ZFP-1–1, that are essential for the specification of new tegumental cells. Since these zinc finger proteins are flatworm-specific, and a homolog of these proteins is known to be essential for a very similar epidermal biogenesis program in free-living flatworms, we speculate that these genes are likely to be key for tegument development across the Neodermata. Our data demonstrate a formal role for neoblasts in tegumental maintenance and provide the first molecular insights into how tegumental fates are specified.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The schistosome tegument and associated cell bodies can be labeled specifically with fluorescently conjugated dextran</title><p>A prerequisite for studying the development of the tegument is the ability to visualize both the outer tegument and its associated cell bodies microscopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, this presently can only be accomplished by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaren, 1980</xref>), which is not compatible with methodologies to visualize the expression of molecular markers. Therefore, we explored a variety of live cell dyes and delivery techniques to identify an approach to specifically label the schistosome tegument fluorescently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that soaking live parasites in a hypotonic solution of 10 kDa fluorescent dextran specifically labeled the tegument surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), cytoplasmic projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the tegumental cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) that sit beneath the parasite’s body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Since isotonic dextran solutions failed to label the tegument, we suspect that specific labeling requires damage to the outer tegumental membranes. Consistent with classic ultrastructural studies, these tegmental cell bodies extend one or more projections towards the tegumental surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morris and Threadgold, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hockley, 1973</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and appear to form an elaborate interconnected network of cellular projections and cell bodies (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Since the narrowest tegumental cytoplasmic projections are much larger (~100 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hockley, 1973</xref>) than the diameter of the fluorescent-dextran conjugate, it is likely that this approach is capable of labeling all cells directly attached to the tegument.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33221.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> neoblast progeny cells fuse with the tegumental syncytium in adult schistosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting anatomy of the tegument and fluorescent dextran labeling.

In these experiments, we injected schistosome-infected mice with EdU to label proliferative neoblasts and then examined the kinetics by which these cells differentiate to produce both <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> and definitive tegumental cells. If <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells include precursors to the definitive tegument we anticipate: (I) that EdU would chase into the nuclei of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells prior to the definitive tegumental cells and (II) that as EdU signal is lost from the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cell compartment we would observe a concomitant increase in the fraction of EdU<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> tegumental cells. Consistent with this model, at D3 following an EdU pulse 45% of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are EdU<sup>+</sup>, whereas just 0.1% of definitive tegumental cells are EdU<sup>+</sup> at this time point. After D3, however, the fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup><italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells began to drop, and the fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup> tegumental cells jumped to 12% by D5 before peaking at around 20% between D7 and D11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>). By D35 the fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup> tegumental cells dropped to 2.2%, suggesting that tegumental cells are subject to physiological turnover inside a mammalian host. These data, together with our TSP-2 immunolabeling studies, are consistent with a model in which neoblasts produce a population of short-lived <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitor cells that differentiate and fuse with the tegument.

In this approach, S/G2/M phase neoblasts can be purified from non-cycling (2N DNA content) cells due to their elevated DNA content (&gt;2N) as measured by Hoechst 33342 labeling intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Tetraspanins are transmembrane proteins often localized to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charrin et al., 2014</xref>). Since our anti-TSP-2 antibody is directed to a putative extracellular loop of TSP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pearson et al., 2012</xref>), we also employed this antibody to FACS purify TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Performing FACS on cell populations labeled with both Hoechst 33342 and anti-TSP-2, we could clearly resolve cells with &gt;2N DNA content (putative neoblasts) and 2N cells with high levels of anti-TSP-2 labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cells with &gt;2N DNA content possessed typical neoblast morphology (small cells with a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio), whereas 2N cells with the highest levels of TSP-2<sup>+</sup> labeling possessed a lower nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and labeled strongly for TSP-2 on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also noted a large population of cells with intermediate levels of TSP-2 labeling (i.e., cells with 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> in relative TSP-2 labeling intensity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Visual examination of these cells found that they did not possess high levels of TSP-2 surface labeling. Instead, these ‘TSP-2 Intermediate’ cells had either no TSP-2 surface labeling or had pieces of TSP-2-labeled debris attached to their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since TSP-2 is present at high-levels on the outer tegument, we believe these cells are falsely scored as TSP-2<sup>+</sup> due to the contamination of TSP-2<sup>+</sup> tegumental debris in our FACS preparations.</p><p>To unambiguously confirm the identity of the neoblast and TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cell populations, we also performed FACS with parasites 7 days post-treatment with 100 Gy of γ-irradiation, which is sufficient to deplete both neoblasts and <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells but spare other differentiated cell types in the worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). Both the neoblasts and TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cell populations are eliminated following irradiation, confirming the specificity of our sorting procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also FACS-purified 2N TSP-2<sup>-</sup> irradiation insensitive cells, which we refer to hereafter as ‘IR Rest’ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with the idea that the IR Rest cells represent various differentiated cell types in the parasite, the FACS-purified cells displayed a range of cellular morphologies (e.g., ciliated cells) and nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To define cell-type specific expression profiles, we performed RNAseq on purified neoblasts, TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cells, and IR Rest cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). We performed pair-wise comparisons to define relative differences in gene expression between these three cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and used model-based clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Si et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to identify genes whose expression was specifically enriched in each cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). From this clustering analysis, we found clusters of genes whose expression was enriched to varying degrees in the IR Rest (clusters 1, 11, 15), neoblast (cluster 6 and to a lesser extent 10), and TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cell populations (cluster 3, 14, 5, 8). Examination of genes in these clusters identified anticipated cell-type-specific markers: the IR Rest-enriched cluster 15 included genes whose expression is associated with differentiated cells such as neurons (i.e. <italic>neuropeptide f receptor</italic>, <italic>neuroendocrine protein 7b2</italic>); the neoblast-enriched cluster 6 included known neoblast-specific factors including <italic>fgfrA, nanos2,</italic> and a variety of cell cycle-associated regulators; and the TSP-2<sup>+</sup>-enriched clusters 3, 14, 8 included <italic>tsp-2</italic> and a variety of genes previously shown to be expressed in <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells including <italic>sm13, sm25, cationic amino acid transporter</italic>, and <italic>dysferlin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2016</xref>). We also identified clusters of genes whose expression was enriched in two of the three cell populations. For instance, cluster 13 included genes enriched in both neoblasts and TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cells. Among the genes in cluster 13 was the <italic>S. mansoni p53</italic> homolog that was previously demonstrated to be highly expressed in both neoblasts and <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Since we found that TSP-2-labled cells expressed tegument-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>) we also reasoned that our FACS data might include markers of definitive tegument. Indeed, we noted that the TSP-2-enriched cluster 5 included all four of our validated markers of definitive tegumental cells (<italic>calp</italic>, <italic>npp-5</italic>, <italic>annexin</italic>, and <italic>gtp-4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To explore the significance of this observation, we performed an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization screen to characterize the expression of genes present in TSP-2-enriched clusters, giving specific attention to genes present in cluster 5. Examining the expression of genes both at the level of the tegument and deeper inside the parenchyma where most <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we found that 26/28 genes in clusters 3, 14, 5, 8 that gave discernable expression patterns were expressed in either <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells or definitive tegumental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among these genes, 15/20 in cluster five alone were expressed in definitive tegumental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting that genes in this cluster appear to be enriched for tegument-specific transcripts. We also noted from these analyses that <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are heterogeneous on a molecular level: cells deeper in the parenchyma tended to express a dynein heavy chain homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), whereas more superficial <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells expressed <italic>sm13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and <italic>sm25</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, we found a pair of transcripts encoding Endophilin B1 homologs that were expressed at high levels in a subset of mature tegumental cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This heterogeneity could highlight populations of cells at different stages of commitment to the tegumental lineage. Taken together, these data suggest that clusters 3, 5, 8, 14 are enriched for transcripts expressed in either <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells or definitive tegumental cells, providing an additional line of evidence connecting <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells and the definitive tegument.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An RNAi screen identifies <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> as potential regulators of tegument development</title><p>To define genes that regulate the development of the tegument lineage, we used our neoblast and TSP-2<sup>+</sup>-enriched datasets to select candidates for an RNAi screen of genes encoding putative transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, signaling molecules, and schistosome-specific proteins.

Not only were the three C2H2 zinc finger domains of ZFP-1 and ZFP-1–1 highly similar to one another, but we also uncovered closely-related C2H2 zinc finger domain-containing proteins in the genomes of free-living (i.e., planarians and macrostomids) and parasitic flatworms (i.e., flukes, tapeworms, monogeneans) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A thorough examination of proteins from taxa outside the Platyhelminthes failed to find any close relatives that shared both high sequence identity and a similar number of C2H2 domains, suggesting that these proteins are likely to be flatworm-specific. Phylogenetic analysis of these proteins revealed two distinct groups of these ZFP-1 family proteins: one group more similar to the schistosome <italic>zfp-1</italic> and another more closely related to <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Since we found proteins in this family shared little homology outside the three C2H2 zinc finger domains, we reasoned that these domains are likely key to the function of these proteins. C2H2 zinc finger domains are best known for their ability to function as transcriptional regulators by binding DNA, however, these domains can also participate in RNA-binding and protein:protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brayer and Segal, 2008</xref>). Thus, we examined the sequences of these proteins in more detail. C2H2 zinc finger domains contain two conserved cysteines and two conserved histidines for zinc-binding (highlighted in black background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For the ZFP-1 family proteins, we observed that the residues between the second zinc-coordinating cysteine and the first zinc-coordinating histidine of the second and third zinc fingers exhibited high sequence conservation, forming the motifs QRSNLQR and RKDHLxR, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Typically, each C2H2 zinc finger interacts with three consecutive DNA base pairs, and the first, fourth, and seventh positions in these motifs (highlighted in cyan background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are key contributors to the binding specificity of the 3'base, the middle base, and 5' base of the primary interaction DNA strand, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klug, 2010</xref>). Given this stereotypical binding, it is possible to predict target DNA binding sequences solely from amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). Using this model, we predict the that the common preferred DNA binding sequence for all ZFP-1 homologs examined is 5'-GGGGAA-3' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), based on the sequence conservation of the last two zinc fingers. Given the highly conserved nature of the residues that contribute to sequence-specific binding, we believe that ZFP-1 family proteins function by binding DNA and presumably act as transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title><italic>zfp-1–1</italic> appears to be specifically required for the production of new tegumental cells</title><p>If <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are tegumental precursors, and <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> play a role in the specification of tegumental cells, we would anticipate that loss of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells following reduction in <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> levels would block the birth of new tegumental cells.

In both cases, depletion of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells causes a reduction in the total number of tegumental cell bodies.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33221-fig6-v3"/></fig><p>One outstanding question relates to the molecular composition of cells within the tegumental lineage. Our data suggest that <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells contribute to the tegument, but it is not clear if this property extends to all <italic>tsp-2</italic>-expressing cells. Analysis of genes expressed in FACS-purified TSP-2<sup>+</sup> cells found that several genes were expressed in subsets of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). One possible interpretation of these observations is that these distinct <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> populations represent cells at different stages of commitment to a tegumental fate. However, it is possible that certain subsets of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> are destined to generate other non-tegumental lineages. Interestingly, we also observed that a pair of Endophillin B1-encoding genes are expressed in a subset of mature tegumental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), opening up the possibility that the tegument is comprised of molecular and functionally distinct cell bodies, despite being a syncytium. Based on the relative distribution of tegument-specific cytoplasmic inclusions, early ultrastructural studies hinted at the possibility that multiple classes of tegumental cell types exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morris and Threadgold, 1968</xref>). Given this possibility, different types of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells may give rise to different classes of tegumental cell bodies. Alternatively, a mechanism for tegument cell renewal independent of <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells may also exist. Detailed studies of these various cell populations using emerging single cell RNA sequencing technology are expected to improve our understanding of this cellular heterogeneity and how it relates to tegument biogenesis.</p><p>Although both <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> are essential for the normal production of tegumental cells, depletion of <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> appears to have a more profound effect on this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). This observation is curious since <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are depleted to a similar extent in either <italic>zfp-1(RNAi)</italic> or <italic>zfp-1-1(RNAi)</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). However, we did note that <italic>zfp-1-1(RNAi)</italic> resulted in a much greater depletion of cells expressing <italic>sm13</italic> compared to <italic>zfp-1(RNAi)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). One possible explanation of this observation is that <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> RNAi treatments have differential effects on cells within the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> compartment. Perhaps <italic>zfp-1</italic> acts in the stem cells to specify early tegumental <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitors, whereas <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> acts in early progenitors to control the fate of cells later during the commitment process. Given the effects of <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> on <italic>sm13<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, and the location of these cells towards the parasite’s surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), it is possible that <italic>sm13<sup>+</sup></italic> cells may represent a population of late tegumental progenitors. A more detailed examination of the various cell types within the <italic>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></italic> compartment is expected to bring clarity to this issue.</p><p>In addition to the differential effect on <italic>sm13</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, we found that <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> RNAi treatment resulted in a gradual detachment of the parasite from their culture vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Parasites rely upon their ventral sucker to attach to blood vessel walls in the host and to the bottom of culture vessels during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. As the only part of the worm that physically attaches to solid substrate, one might expect the ventral sucker to experience more ‘wear and tear’ than the rest of the organism. Like the rest of the worm, the sucker is covered in tegument. While we cannot say that the detachment phenotype is a direct result of the disruption of tegument maintenance, an attractive hypothesis is that the gross effects of loss of tegument cell renewal are first experienced by the sucker in the form of the inability to attach to substrate. Indeed, this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the effects of <italic>zfp-1-1(RNAi)</italic> are largely limited to tegumental cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). Future studies exploring the function of <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> in the context of host infection could provide important insights into the role for tegmental renewal in parasite survival <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our data highlight fundamental similarities in the cellular organization of epidermal lineages between schistosomes and the free-living planarian flatworms. Unlike schistosomes, free-living flatworms (e.g., planarians) possess a simple epidermis comprised of a single layer of epithelial cells that rests upon a basement membrane and several layers of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tyler and Tyler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tyler and Hooge, 2004</xref>). Counter to the epidermal maintenance strategies of other long-lived metazoa (e.g., cnidarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzgariu et al., 2015</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watt, 2001</xref>)), where resident stem cells support the renewal of worn out or damaged epithelial cells, the planarian epidermis is unique as it is completely devoid of proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>). To fulfill a constant demand for new epidermal cells, neoblasts in planarians specify large numbers of post-mitotic epidermal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). In many ways, these epidermal progenitors are similar to <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> tegumental progenitors: they appear to be the primary output of neoblasts, they are rapidly lost following neoblast ablation, and they express a variety of species-specific factors. Furthermore, like schistosomes, these progenitors migrate through the mesenchyme, traverse the muscles and basement membrane, and incorporate into the existing epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>). Thus, the cellular organization of epidermal maintenance lineages in planarians and schistosomes appears to be quite similar despite resulting in two very different tissues (epidermis vs. tegument).</p><p>In addition to the similarities in their cellular organization, our data, together with previous studies of planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>), suggest that flatworm epidermal lineages also rely on members of the <italic>zfp-1</italic> family of flatworm-specific transcriptional regulators. Despite the apparent conserved function of these regulators, we do note some differences in the function of <italic>zfp-1</italic> family proteins in planarians and schistosomes. The planarian and schistosome <italic>zfp-1</italic> genes are both expressed in neoblasts, and based on sequence similarity they appear to be orthologous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the planarian protein is specifically required for the maintenance of the epidermal lineage, whereas the schistosome protein appears to be essential for both tegumental and non-tegumental lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, it would appear the schistosome <italic>zfp-1</italic> homolog plays a more general role in cellular differentiation. These observations, however, do not rule out possibility that the schistosome <italic>zfp-1</italic> protein is directly responsible for specifying tegument fates. Indeed, loss of the non-tegumental lineages following <italic>zfp-1</italic> RNAi could represent a compensatory mechanism by the neoblasts to fulfill a high demand for new tegumental cells. Although a specific role for <italic>zfp-1</italic> cannot be demonstrated at this time, the schistosome <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> appears to have a specific role in tegumental fates. Like <italic>zfp-1</italic>, the schistosome <italic>zfp-1–1</italic> has a related homolog in planarians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). While this planarian homolog has not been characterized, recent single cell transcriptional analyses suggest that the expression of this gene is enriched in the epidermal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>). Clearly, more detailed studies of these zinc finger proteins, and their roles in epidermal development, in both free-living and parasitic flatworms are essential to determine the significance of these observations.</p><p>Given these apparent similarities between planarians and schistosomes, and a wealth of evidence indicating that the Neodermata are descendants of free-living flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehlers, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laumer et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the evolution of the tegument, and perhaps even the emergence of parasitism, has its roots in the epidermal biogenesis programs of the free-living ancestors to modern day Neodermata. By modulating the basic cellular behaviors of epidermal progenitor cells during the course of evolution, perhaps there was a shift from migratory epidermal progenitors that intercalate into the multi-cellular epithelium to fusogenic progenitor cells that give rise to the syncytial tegument. Given this model, we suspect that our observations of neoblast-driven tegument biogenesis in schistosomes are likely to extend to all members of the Neodermata. Therefore, further study of tegumental development is expected to provide clues relevant for understanding the evolutionary forces that gave rise to parasitism in flatworms. Furthermore, since the tegument is critical to parasite biology, understanding the tegument lineage, and the molecular targets of <italic>zfp-1</italic> homologues, in diverse flatworms could suggest novel therapies to blunt tegument development in this important group of parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasite acquisition and culture</title><p>Adult <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (6–7 weeks post-infection) were obtained from infected female mice by hepatic portal vein perfusion with 37°C DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) plus 10% Serum (either Fetal Calf Serum or Horse Serum) and heparin.

As part of this survival strategy, they maintain a tegument (outer protective epithelial layer) that aids in their survival. The authors have developed a method to label the tegument and then used this to understand the mechanisms by which the tegument is maintained by stem cell growth. They go on to identify a number of Zn-finger transcription factors that play a key role in the maintenance of this epithelium through the specification of the progenitor cells for the tegument. The work here marks a significant advance in our understanding of the biology of these fascinating animals and has important implications in the control of their life cycle.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “FACs purification and molecular characterization of neoblasts and TSP-2+ cells”: Please show the data for the imaging of cells with intermediate levels of TSP in the FACs prep. It is stated &quot;Visual examination of these cells found that they did not possess high levels of TSP-2 surface labeling. Instead, these &quot;TSP-2 Intermediate&quot; cells had either no TSP-2 surface labeling or had pieces of TSP-2-labeled debris attached to their surface.&quot; It is important to show representative images of this.</p><p>2) Figure 1K and Figure 1—figure supplement 1: Please report what fraction of tegument cells are tsp-2+? What fraction are sm13+? Relatedly, what fraction of tsp-2+ cells are sm13+, and what fraction of zfp1-1 cells are sm13+?</p><p>3) Figure 2G: Some kind of graphical summary of the findings is needed. There are deep tsp-2+ cells; superficial tsp-2+ cells; rare tsp-2+/tegument+ cells; and tsp-2-; tegument+ cells. From the in-situ survey of cluster-enriched genes, you have found genes for which expression spanned these stages – helping make the lineage argument. However, the reader has to work a bit hard to tease this information out of the images in Figure 2G, the text, and Supplementary data. A cartoon summary of the cell stages and which genes were found to be expressed in multiple categories should be provided.</p><p>4) In Figure 3, the claim that zfp-1 and zfp1-1 are exclusively expressed in neoblasts, and that they are not present in the same cells, should be supported by some quantification.

Some anatomical context should be provided for non-schistosome biologists.</p><p>5) In the Introduction, the authors state that understanding the development of the syncytial tegument is critical for bolstering knowledge of these parasites for drug development, but this aspect of tegument biology is never mentioned again. Many questions remain about the biology of this tissue which are relevant to data presented in this paper. After zfp-1-1 knockdown, does nuclear spacing increase?

What fraction are sm13+? Relatedly, what fraction of tsp-2+ cells are sm13+, and what fraction of zfp1-1 cells are sm13+?</p></disp-quote><p>Over 3 experiments we observed a total of 5 <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> tegument cells out of 3074 total tegument cells counted (~0.2%) and we have added this data to the manuscript in subsection “Definitive tegumental cells express <italic>calpain, npp-5, annexin</italic> and <italic>gtp-4</italic> but not <italic>tsp-2”</italic>. One issue with this analysis is the low expression level of <italic>tsp-2</italic> observed in tegument cells (such as in Figure 1K). In order to visualize the low levels of <italic>tsp-2</italic> in these cells, the gain on the confocal microscope had to be turned up to the point of oversaturating what we elsewhere describe as <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells. The aforementioned experiments where we quantified <italic>tsp-2</italic> expression in tegument cells were performed with a significantly lower gain in the <italic>tsp-2</italic> channel. This could result in our inability to detect rare <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>low</sup> tegument cells. As such, we are only confident in saying that <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> tegument cells are extremely rare (less than 1% of all tegument cells), and when co-expression is observed, <italic>tsp-2</italic> is expressed at very low levels.</p><p>With respect to questions regarding the expression of <italic>sm13</italic> in tegument cells, we apologize for the lack of clarity in the initial submission of the manuscript. Figure 1—figure supplement 1 H-L shows dextran/FISH experiments and double FISH experiments demonstrating that there are virtually no <italic>sm13</italic><sup>+</sup> tegument cells. We have added counts of this data to subsection “Definitive tegumental cells express <italic>calpain, npp-5, annexin</italic> and <italic>gtp-4</italic> but not <italic>tsp-2”</italic>, indicating that we observed only 1 sm13<sup>+</sup> tegmental cell in 1826 observed.</p><p>With respect to questions regarding co-expression of <italic>sm13</italic> with <italic>tsp-2</italic>, we apologize for the lack of clarity in the manuscript. Figure 1—figure supplement 1G shows a Venn diagram in the inset indicating the relative overlap of <italic>tsp-2</italic> and <italic>sm13</italic>. All <italic>sm13</italic> cells are <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup>. Though the majority of <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are <italic>sm13</italic><sup>+</sup>, some <italic>tsp-2</italic> cells are <italic>sm13</italic><sup>-</sup>. This appears to relate to the position of the cells along the dorsal-ventral axis. Virtually all dorsally located <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are <italic>sm13</italic><sup>+</sup> whereas almost no parenchymal <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are <italic>sm13</italic><sup>+</sup> (See Figure 2G). The images shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 are all taken at the level of the tegument, hence the high overlap of <italic>tsp-2</italic> and <italic>sm13</italic>. We now indicate the anatomical location of the imaging in the figure legend for Figure 1—figure supplement 1G.</p><p>With respect to questions regarding co-expression of <italic>sm13</italic> with <italic>zfp-1-1</italic>, there is almost no overlap between these two populations (1 double positive cell out 248 <italic>sm13<sup>+</sup></italic> cells examined). This result is reflected in a new supplemental figure: Figure 3—figure supplement 3. As mentioned previously, <italic>sm13</italic> is expressed almost exclusively in superficial <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, whereas <italic>zfp-1-1</italic> is expressed exclusively in more parenchymal <italic>tsp-2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 3M). We now discuss in the manuscript in subsection “An RNAi screen identifies <italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1-1</italic> as potential regulators of tegument development<bold>”</bold>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3).

Figure 3J shows that zfp-1 is expressed in nanos2<sup>+</sup> neoblasts but not in tsp-2<sup>+</sup> cells whereas zfp-1-1 is expressed in tsp-2<sup>+</sup> cells but not in nanos2<sup>+</sup> neoblasts. A direct comparison of the two cell populations also reveals no overlap between the populations as detectable by FISH (See subsection “<italic>zfp-1</italic> and <italic>zfp-1-1</italic> are members of a family of flatworm-specific DNA binding proteins whose homolog in planarians regulates epidermal lineage specification”). Additionally, we have added an arrow in Figure 3M that clarifies the dorsal-ventral axis. To further orient readers, we have added the following sentence to the Materials and methods section describing the anatomical region images were acquired from: “Unless otherwise stated all fluorescence images are taken at the anatomical level of the tegumental cell bodies (see Figure 1D for approximate location)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Introduction, the authors state that understanding the development of the syncytial tegument is critical for bolstering knowledge of these parasites for drug development, but this aspect of tegument biology is never mentioned again.

In Figure 5B-C we show that knocking down <italic>zfp-1</italic> or <italic>zfp-1-1</italic> results in a ~10% and ~30% reduction in tegument cell body density, respectively. In addition to the decrease in the total number of tegumental cells, we also observed an inability of <italic>zfp-1-1</italic>(RNAi) animals, but not <italic>control(RNAi)</italic> or <italic>zfp-1</italic>(RNAi) animals, to remain attached to the plate during the course of our RNAi experiments. We have included these data in the revised manuscript (Figure 5F). Plate attachment is mediated by the parasite’s ventral sucker and since these organs are covered by tegument, tegumental maintenance is potentially required for plate attachment. It is also possible the plate attachment phenotype reflects a secondary effect of reduced tegumental maintenance since plate attachment also certainly relies a properly functioning neuromuscular system. We believe this supports the model that <italic>zfp-1-1</italic>, and perhaps tegumental maintenance are important for the parasite. We have added a section to discuss these results (Discussion section). In addition, we have updated to the final paragraph of the discussion to include our thinking about how our understanding of <italic>zfp1-1</italic> could be used in the future to combat these worms. In particular, we say:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Furthermore, since the tegument is critical to parasite biology, understanding the tegument lineage, and the molecular targets of <italic>zfp-1</italic> homologues, in diverse flatworms could suggest novel therapies to blunt tegument development in this important group of parasites<italic>”.</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
