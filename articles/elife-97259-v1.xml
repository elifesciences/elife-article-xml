In humans, an inability to recognize kin and familiar individuals and engage in appropriate behaviors is associated with several types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Mice preferentially spend more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual. Yet, how social novelty-related information drives increased investigation of the novel animal remains poorly understood. Recent evidence has implicated the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as a key node in encoding information about conspecific identity. Of particular interest are vHPC projections to the lateral septum (LS), a region that has been implicated in driving a wide range of motivated social behaviors. In this study using chemogenetics, optogenetics, and monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified a novel vHPC-LS-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we established that LS neurons make direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Thus, we have identified a potential pathway via which conspecific identity could be transformed to drive motivated social behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>social novelty</kwd><kwd>ventral hippocampus</kwd><kwd>lateral septum</kwd><kwd>social memory</kwd><kwd>social recognition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH130755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murugan</surname><given-names>Malavika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31MH133373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isaac</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Projection-specific optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments reveal a hippocampal-lateral septal pathway that potentially acts via the ventral tegmental area to regulate social novelty preference behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most animals make daily calculations to approach or avoid a conspecific based on the quality of prior interactions. Yet, how we recognize who we interact with and how that information is transformed to guide subsequent behavior remains poorly understood. For instance, mice readily discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics, preferentially spending more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moy et al., 2004</xref>). However, it remains unknown how social novelty drives increased approach and investigation.</p><p>The vHPC and dorsal CA2 neurons are known to be causally involved in allowing mice to distinguish between novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donegan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tao et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, studies have shown that manipulating the activity of ventral CA1 but not dorsal CA1 neurons in the hippocampus disrupts the ability of mice to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, individual vHPC neurons are known to preferentially fire in the proximity of conspecifics but not objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, experiments have shown that ensembles of neurons in the vHPC encode the identity of a conspecific and that this representation changes as a function of familiarity with the conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is unclear how this social memory information in the vHPC is transformed to preferentially drive increased investigation of a novel conspecific. Moreover, there remains debate regarding which regions downstream of the vHPC play a role in promoting differential investigation of novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This study focused on ventral hippocampal projections to the LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Risold and Swanson, 1997</xref>). The LS, a subcortical structure primarily composed of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Risold and Swanson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reid et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simon et al., 2024</xref>), receives dense projections from the vHPC and is well situated to orchestrate social novelty-related approach behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard and Leroy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rizzi-Wise and Wang, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wirtshafter and Wilson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Menon et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, LS neurons in rat pups differentially respond to sibling and non-sibling odors and are necessary for the expression of non-sibling preference in older pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemens et al., 2020</xref>). Also, disrupting vasopressin receptor function in the LS modulates the ability of rodents to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bielsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bychowski et al., 2013</xref>). Most importantly, the LS is thought to directly project to the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2011</xref>), a region previously implicated in social novelty-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shan et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the lateral septum is well suited to act on social memory-related information from the ventral hippocampus to, in turn, regulate motivated social behaviors.</p><p>To determine if the vHPC-LS circuit is causally involved in preferentially investigating a novel conspecific over a familiar conspecific, we chemogenetically silenced vHPC-LS neurons and found that mice spent equal amounts of time investigating a novel and familiar conspecific. Furthermore, we found that optogenetically inhibiting the activity of vHPC-LS neurons in a temporally and spatially specific manner caused the mice to investigate the conspecific paired with the inhibition. We hypothesized that this increased social investigation with vHPC-LS inhibition might arise from disinhibition of the VTA. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing technology, we determined that LS-VTA neurons receive dense ventral hippocampal inputs. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that chemogenetically silencing LS-VTA neuron activity caused mice to no longer prefer the novel conspecific. Finally, using monosynaptic rabies tracing experiments in Th-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, we found that the LS makes direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Taken together, we have identified a vHPC-LS-VTA circuitry that appears to play a key role in transforming social memory-related information in the ventral hippocampus to subsequently drive social novelty-related approach behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons disrupts the preference for social novelty</title><p>To determine whether vHPC-LS neurons played a causal role in allowing animals to discriminate between novel and familiar mice, we chemogenetically silenced vHPC-LS neurons while evaluating the effects on behavior in the social discrimination task (SDT).

Three weeks after surgery, we injected mice (i.p.) with either saline or CNO 30 min prior to the SDT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the SDT, mice were allowed to explore an arena containing age- and sex-matched novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Dopamine neurons in the VTA show increased activity while mice investigate a novel conspecific and are known to be involved in causally driving increased investigation of a novel conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shan et al., 2023</xref>). Together, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that silencing vHPC-LS neurons could disinhibit dopamine neurons in the VTA, which, in turn, could drive increased approach and investigation of a conspecific.

Furthermore, closed-loop, spatially constrained optogenetic inhibition of vHPC-LS neurons increased investigation of the mouse paired with inhibition. These findings led us to hypothesize that inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons could increase preference for a conspecific by disinhibiting the VTA, a region heavily implicated in social novelty and social approach behaviors. Consistent with this hypothesis, through monosynaptic rabies tracing experiments, we found that vHPC-LS neurons project heavily to the VTA. We next discovered that chemogenetic silencing of LS-VTA neurons also disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially engage with a novel conspecific. Finally, using monosynaptic rabies tracing technology in Th-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, we found that dopaminergic neurons in the VTA receive direct monosynaptic inputs from the LS. Given that LS neurons synapse directly onto VTA dopamine neurons, inhibiting vHPC-LS neurons could disinhibit VTA dopamine neurons, thus driving increased social approach and investigation. We have identified a circuit necessary for mice to differentially investigate novel and familiar conspecifics.</p><p>Rodents, including mice, behave differently around novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Zerda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Winslow, 2003</xref>). When given a choice, mice preferentially spend more time near a novel mouse than a familiar mouse. In rodents, optogenetic and imaging experiments have identified the vHPC to be causally involved in distinguishing between familiar and novel conspecifics. However, how information about the conspecific identity thought to be primarily encoded in the vHPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>) is transformed to drive increased approach and investigation of a novel individual remains poorly understood. In particular, it remains unclear which structures downstream of the hippocampus play a role in regulating differential investigation of a novel over a familiar conspecific. The vHPC sends dense projections onto the nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gergues et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have suggested a key role for hippocampal projections to the mPFC and the NAc in discriminating between novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). However, some questions remain. While optogenetic inhibition of vHPC-NAc neurons disrupted the ability of mice to discriminate novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>), chemogenetic manipulation of vHPC-NAc neurons did not affect preference for a novel conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, while chemogenetic manipulation of vHPC-mPFC activity disrupted the formation of social memory, its effects on modulating social preference for the novel mouse during acute recall in wild-type mice remains less obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, raising the possibility that an alternative pathway from the vHPC could help mice engage in differential social behavior when presented with a novel and familiar conspecific. In our study, using optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations, we have found that the vHPC-LS pathway plays a key role in modulating preference for a novel conspecific.</p><p>vCA1 neurons respond robustly in the proximity of conspecifics and subsets of vCA1 neurons are known to preferentially respond in the proximity of familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, a larger fraction of vCA1 neurons respond in the proximity of a familiar conspecific compared to a novel conspecific in a social discrimination assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, raising the possibility that lowering the levels of vCA1 neuron activity could create a perception of social novelty and could result in increased investigation of a mouse. Consistent with this idea, we found that optogenetically silencing vHPC-LS neurons increased investigation of the mouse paired with investigation. Findings from our rabies tracing findings show that both vCA1 and vCA3 neurons project to the LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>). The viral injections in our study were set up to target the vHPC broadly, labeling both vCA1 and vCA3 neurons projecting to the LS. Therefore, the behavioral effects observed with the chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments cannot be localized to only the vCA1 or the vCA3 neurons specifically. A recent study showed that vCA1 and vCA3 neurons differentially modulate approach avoidance conflict task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>). While silencing vCA1 neurons induced increased avoidance of a conflict cue, silencing vCA3 neurons resulted in increased approach of the conflict cue. Additionally, recent data suggests that vCA1 and vCA3 neurons form parallel septal pathways that play differential roles in modulating approach avoidance behaviors in response to conflict cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeates et al., 2022</xref>). Given that vHPC-LS inhibition did not have any effect on object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and O</xref>) or food preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>) in our study, it is unclear if the same vHPC-LS circuits involved in conflict approach/avoidance are also involved in mediating the preference and approach elicited by a novel conspecific. Thus, future studies specifically targeting and manipulating only vCA1 or vCA3 inputs to the LS are necessary to determine if these parallel pathways play differential roles in mediating preferential investigation of a novel conspecific over a familiar conspecific.</p><p>The LS, with connections to downstream regions that are heavily implicated in mediating social behaviors, like the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Merrer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dölen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>), VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Connell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Risold and Swanson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mei et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falkner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>), is well positioned to translate the social recognition-related information it receives from the vHPC into motivated behaviors. In this study, we focused on the LS projections to the VTA, a region that has been shown to play a key role in modulating social novelty. Dopamine neurons in the VTA have been shown to be differentially modulated by novel and familiar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tapper and Molas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiti et al., 2022</xref>). Chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons in the VTA attenuates investigation of a novel conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that the LS could regulate social novelty preference by modulating the activity of dopamine neurons in the VTA. Using transsynaptic rabies tracing, we identified direct monosynaptic inputs from the LS onto dopamine neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, we found that inhibiting LS-VTA neurons disrupted the ability of mice to preferentially investigate a novel conspecific.</p><p>Unlike the socially specific effects observed with vHPC-LS inhibition, LS-VTA inhibition also disrupted the natural preference that mice exhibit towards investigating familiar foods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). These findings suggest that LS-VTA neurons are more broadly involved in mediating preference for a variety of ethologically relevant stimuli. Consistent with this idea, VTA dopamine neurons are known to play a key role in mediating the motivation to seek both food rewards and social investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willmore et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazzone et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, a large proportion of individual VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons respond to both food and social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willmore et al., 2023</xref>). VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons are active during both the consumption of familiar palatable food and during increased investigation of a novel conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solié et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willmore et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazzone et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, inhibiting LS neurons that project to the VTA (including VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons) could disrupt both social and food-seeking behaviors.</p><p>Although our data support the view that inhibition of LS-VTA neurons could be exerting an effect on social novelty preference behaviors by directly modulating the activity of dopamine neurons in the VTA, it remains unknown if LS-VTA neurons also act on GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Local infusions of GABA into the caudodorsal LS was shown to both increase and decrease the responses of VTA neurons in response to stimulation of vCA3 neurons, raising the possibility that LS neurons could project to GABAergic neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains to be determined if GABAergic neurons in the VTA receive direct monosynaptic input from the LS. Additionally, future recording and imaging experiments are needed to determine what information LS-VTA neurons encode. For instance, sibling and non-sibling odor representations are anatomically organized along the dorsoventral axis of the LS neurons in rat pups and lesions to the LS disrupt the ability of rat pups to distinguish between kin and non-kin odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemens et al., 2020</xref>). These findings raise two interesting questions. First, are social familiarity and novelty information differentially represented in the dorsal and ventral populations of LS neurons? Second, are the dorsally located LS-VTA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) necessary for kin recognition? Addressing these questions might provide insight into whether different kinds of recognition information (kin/non-kin, novel/familiar) and context information are integrated and transformed into approach and avoidance behaviors at the level of the LS.</p><p>In line with the above ideas, neurons from other hippocampal compartments, besides the vCA1 and vCA3, including the dCA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>) and dCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashimoto et al., 2022</xref>) project to the lateral septum. These hippocampal projections have also been implicated in mediating social novelty behaviors. For example, activating dCA3-LS neurons was sufficient to restore social novelty preference deficits induced by chronic social defeat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, another study found that silencing the vCA3 neurons but not dCA3 neurons disrupted the ability of mice to differentially investigate familiar versus novel animals in control mice (not defeated/stressed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that, first, social recognition information is represented in a distributed fashion across the various hippocampal compartments and that parallel hippocampal-septal pathways are differentially recruited in a context and internal state-dependent fashion to transform social novelty/familiarity information into decisions to approach or avoid a conspecific.</p><p>Mounting evidence suggests a key role for the lateral septum in modulating a broad range of motivated social behaviors. In addition to the role we are suggesting for the vCA1-LS pathway in modulating social novelty preference, a recent study demonstrated that corticotropin-releasing hormone released by infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the rostral LS acts to suppress investigation of a familiar conspecific, thus promoting a relative increase in investigation of a novel conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de León Reyes et al., 2023</xref>). Beyond social novelty/familiarity behaviors, the lateral septum plays a key role in modulating aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Chew, 1980</xref>) and in modulating social reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Dorsal LS neurons are known to inhibit ventral LS neurons via local collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this evidence, it has been hypothesized that lateral inhibition between various LS populations could allow for selecting one behavioral output while suppressing the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard and Leroy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rizzi-Wise and Wang, 2021</xref>). For example, increased activity in the ventral LS could suppress dorsal LS and disinhibit regions downstream of the dorsal LS, such as the NAc and the VTA thus promoting increased social approach and investigation while simultaneously suppressing aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, providing an exciting framework in which the LS could play a key role in regulating mutually exclusive social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard and Leroy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rizzi-Wise and Wang, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although we focused largely on social novelty-seeking behavior, there is evidence that the hippocampal-septal circuitry plays a role in context-dependent modulation of behavior in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besnard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besnard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Décarie-Spain et al., 2022</xref>). Although, we saw no effects in the ability of the mice to discriminate between novel and familiar foods with vHPC-LS inhibition in a discrimination assay in which the mice could smell but not access the food, a study found that activation of glutamatergic vHPC-LS neurons suppressed food intake in the home cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sweeney and Yang, 2015</xref>). Additionally, a recent study suggests that vHPC-LS neurons are necessary for mice to learn food reward-location associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Décarie-Spain et al., 2022</xref>). It is unclear if this finding extends to socially rewarding stimuli. It also remains to be seen if the same vHPC-LS neurons/subcircuits that are involved in mediating social preference also modulate other motivated behaviors.</p><p>In summary, we identify a novel vHPC-LS-VTA pathway that regulates social novelty preference. Our study provides insight into how social memory-related information is transformed into motivated social behaviors. Our study lays the groundwork for future experiments that could help us understand how these circuits might be disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, in which the ability of individuals to recognize and engage in appropriate social behaviors is dramatically affected.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and Emory University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

The social discrimination chamber (58.42 cm × 25.4 cm × 22.86 cm) contains two cages housing age and sex-matched stimulus mice (cage diameter = 7.62 cm) at opposite ends of the chamber. Prior to being run on the social discrimination assay, the test mouse was co-housed with a same-sex, age-matched conspecific for 72 hr to familiarize. The test mice were then allowed to explore the chamber containing both a novel and familiar stimulus mouse for 5 min. The location of the novel and familiar mice (left and versus right) was counterbalanced to eliminate side preferences. Behavior was tracked using an overhead camera and the position of the mouse in the arena was tracked using the open-source software Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>). Percent time spent was calculated by measuring the amount of time the test mouse spent around each encaged social target (diameter of the social zone - 60 mm) relative to the entire assay duration.</p><p>For chemogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), ~3–4 weeks after viral injection, mice expressing either the inhibitory DREADDs or mCherry received intraperitoneal injections of either Clozapine-N-Oxide (HelloBio, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (0.2 mL, i.p.) 30 min prior to being run on the behavioral assay. Mice were not given more than one CNO injection per day.</p><p>For vHPC-LS cell body optogenetic inhibition experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we used the Bonsai software to track the position of the test mouse in real-time and used this information to specifically inhibit the activity of vHPC-LS neurons only in the proximity of a particular conspecific (social zone diameter: 60 mm). The real-time tracking data from Bonsai was used to gate a green laser source via a TTL driver (Pulse Pal, Sanworks). Thus, the green laser source connected to the implanted fibers (532 nm, 6 mW, constant light - at the fiber tip) was turned on when the animal moved into only one of the social zones (either novel or familiar) and remained on until the animal moved out of the zone. The other social zone remained as a control zone and was not paired with light. Time spent by the mice in each zone was later estimated as described above.</p><p>For the novel versus familiar comparisons, both NpHR and EGFP mice were run on this assay across several conditions. Condition 1 - control condition- no stimulation paired with either the novel or the familiar mouse. Condition 2 - stimulation around the novel but not familiar animals. Condition 3 - stimulation around the familiar but not novel animal.</p><p>The same NpHR and EGFP mice were also run through a novel vs novel mouse experiment. In this experiment, the zone around one of the two novel mice was randomly designated as the stimulation zone, and entry into this zone was paired with green light illumination (light conditions same as above). Time spent by the mice in each of the two zones was estimated using Bonsai.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Food discrimination task</title><p>Arena and handling procedures are identical to SDT. Familiar food was the chow (3 g, LabDiet), while the novel food was 3 g of fruit-flavored cereal. Food was placed under wired cages, such that mice could sniff but not taste the food. Mice were given 5 min to explore the arena containing the novel and familiar food.

For chemogenetic manipulation, procedures were performed identically to the SDT. Novel and familiar objects were placed on either the left or the right side of the chamber in a counterbalanced fashion.</p><p>For spatially-restricted optogenetic manipulation, mice were allowed to investigate two novel objects in an arena for 5 min. In the light ON condition, one of the two objects picked randomly was paired with green light stimulation (532 nm, 6 mW at the fiber tip constant light stimulation).

Using viral circuit tracing, chemogenetics, and optogenetics in the vHPC, LS, and VTA, the authors found that vHPC to LS projections may contribute to the salience of social novelty investigations. In addition, the authors identify LS projections to the VTA involved in social novelty and familiar food responses. Finally, via viral tracing, they demonstrate that vHPC-LS neurons may establish direct monosynaptic connections with VTA dopaminergic neurons. The experiments are well-designed, and the conclusions are mostly very clear.

Although Figure 3 shows that vHPC (vCA1 and vCA3) is the source of the greatest number of monosynaptic inputs onto LS-VTA neurons, we did not perform any experiments that specifically manipulated vHPC neurons that project to LS-VTA neurons. While these experiments would be extremely interesting, they are technically challenging and beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors combined males and females in their analysis, as neural circuit manipulation affected novelty discrimination ratios in both sexes.

We can confirm that we found no significant differences in the effectiveness of our vHPC-LS inhibition between the males and females (2-factor ANOVA with sex (male/female) and drug condition (saline/CNO) as factors on the discrimination scores of hM4Di expressing animals: interaction p=0.2241, sex: p=0.1233, drug condition: p=0.0166).

We apologize for not including these crucial details in our Methods section. For both the chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition experiments, all conditions were separated by a minimum of 24 hours.

However, the data is not presented in a within-animal manner such that we can distinguish if the behavior of the same animal changes with drug treatment. Similarly, the methods specify that the optogenetic manipulations were done in three different conditions, but the analyses do not report within-animal changes across conditions nor account for multiple measures within subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We agree that a repeated measures ANOVA would be ideal, but there is sufficient behavioral variability that such analyses will be difficult without very large sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it is unclear if the order of drug treatment and conditions were counterbalanced across subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the above response to Reviewer 1, for both the chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition experiments, all conditions were separated by a minimum of 24 hours and we counterbalanced the order of chemogenetic (saline/CNO) and optogenetic (light ON/light OFF) experimental manipulations across animals.</p></body></sub-article></article>
