Nodal morphogens play critical roles in embryonic axis formation in many organisms. Models proposed to generate the Nodal gradient include diffusivity, ligand processing, and a temporal activation window. But how the Nodal morphogen gradient forms in vivo remains unclear. Here, we have measured in vivo for the first time, the binding affinity of Nodal ligands to their major cell surface receptor, Acvr2b, and to the Nodal inhibitor, Lefty, by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. We examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodal ligands and Lefty inhibitors in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We also investigated the contribution of ligand degradation to the Nodal gradient. We show that ligand clearance via degradation shapes the Nodal gradient and correlates with its signaling range. By computational simulations of gradient formation, we demonstrate that diffusivity, extra-cellular interactions, and selective ligand destruction collectively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13879.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13879.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13879.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals develop from a single fertilized egg cell into multicellular organisms. This process requires chemical signals called “morphogens” that instruct the cells how to behave during development. The morphogens move across cells and tissues to form gradients of the signal. Cells then respond in different ways depending on how much of the signal they receive. This, in turn, depends on several factors: first, how quickly or slowly the signal moves; second, how well the morphogen binds to responding cells and other molecules in its path; and third, how much signal is lost or destroyed during the movement.</p><p>Many researchers study morphogen gradients in the transparent zebrafish, since it grows quickly and it is easy to see developmental changes. However, until now it was not fully clear how the well-known morphogen called Nodal moves in live zebrafish as they develop.</p><p>Wang, Wang et al. have now investigated how well Nodal signals bind to the surface of cells that receive the signal and to a molecule called “Lefty”, which is present in the same path and interferes with Nodal signals. Advanced techniques called fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy were used to measure Nodal signals at the level of single molecules in growing zebrafish. The experiments gave insights into how far Nodal signals move and remain active. The results showed that, in addition to Nodal diffusing and binding to receiving cells, one of the most important factors determining how far and quickly Nodal moves is its inactivation and destruction. Lastly, Wang, Wang et al. built computational models to test their observations from live zebrafish.</p><p>The current work was based on forcing zebrafish to produce molecules including Nodal at locations within the fish that normally do not make them. Therefore future experiments will aim to examine these molecules and their interactions when they are produced at their normal locations in the animal over time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13879.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13879.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Nodal</kwd><kwd>gradient</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd><kwd>inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000741</institution-id><institution>University of Warwick</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2012-T2-1-101: R-154-000-543-112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wohland</surname><given-names>Thorsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sampath</surname><given-names>Karuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diffusivity, extracellular interactions of Nodal ligands with the receptors and inhibitors, and selective ligand destruction collectively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many animals, development from a single cell to a complex multicellular organism requires the graded distribution and activity of diffusible proteins, which are known as morphogens. How morphogen gradients are formed is not fully understood. Studies in many organisms have suggested three major mechanisms to establish morphogen gradients: 1) diffusion, 2) transcytosis and 3) via cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wartlick et al., 2009</xref>). For example, the gradient of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) is established by diffusion and is regulated by extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dowd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duchesne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Makarenkova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nowak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2009</xref>), whereas the gradient of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is established not only by diffusion, but also via transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dierick and Bejsovec, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kruse et al., 2004</xref>) and cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsiung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramirez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roy et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Nodal proteins, which belong to the TGF-β family of signaling proteins, play critical roles in vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakefield and Hill, 2013</xref>). They serve as mesendoderm inducers in vertebrates, and are involved in many aspects of embryonic axis formation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sampath and Robertson, 2016</xref>). Nodal proteins are translated as precursors and function as dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 1990</xref>). The Nodal precursors are cleaved by extracellular convertases, and convertase processing was found to be essential for Nodal activation in zebrafish and mouse embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Good et al., 2005</xref>). A recent report found that FurinA convertase activity regulates long range signaling by the zebrafish left-right patterning Nodal, Southpaw (Spaw), but not other Nodal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tessadori et al., 2015</xref>). Upon activation, Nodal proteins form complexes with type II and type I Activin receptors (Acvr1b; Acvr2a/b), which are serine/threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reissmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo and Whitman, 2001</xref>) and activate the Nodal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Massagué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whitman, 1998</xref>). Nodal target genes include <italic>nodal</italic> itself and <italic>lefty</italic>, which encodes a feedback inhibitor of Nodal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branford and Yost, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meno et al., 1999</xref>). In zebrafish, of the three nodal homologs, <italic>cyclops (cyc), squint (sqt)</italic> and <italic>southpaw (spaw), sqt</italic> and <italic>cyc</italic> are expressed in an overlapping pattern in the gastrula margin where presumptive mesoderm and endoderm cells are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gritsman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Long et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rebagliati et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sampath et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Boxtel et al., 2015</xref>). However, Sqt and Cyc elicit differential responses in target cells: Sqt acts at long-range whereas Cyc only affects cells immediately adjacent to the source of the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Schier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>So far, there is no evidence for a requirement for transcytosis and cytonemes in distributing the Nodal factors and the Nodal morphogen gradient has been proposed to be established by simple diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams et al., 2004</xref>). The diffusion coefficient of a molecule is a measure of its ability to move freely across a defined region. The free diffusion coefficient of the zebrafish Nodals has been suggested to be faster than their effective diffusion coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2013</xref>), resulting in fast diffusion over short distances but slow diffusion over longer distances presumably by morphogen trapping at high affinity binding sites. These observations led to the hypothesis that Nodal diffusion is hindered either by cell surface interactions or by molecules in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). How Nodal diffusion is hindered, and to what extent it shapes the Nodal gradient is unclear.</p><p>In contrast to the differential diffusion model, a recent study suggested that a temporal signal activation window created by microRNA-430 (miRNA-430) delays translation of the Nodal antagonist Lefty to determine the dimensions of Nodal signaling in the gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Boxtel et al., 2015</xref>). Repression by miRNA-430 likely plays a key role in regulation of Nodal signaling. However, miRNA-430 is not exclusive to <italic>lefty1</italic> but also targets <italic>nodal/sqt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, reporter protein expression and ribosome-profiling data from zebrafish embryos indicate that Nodal/Sqt and Lefty1 are translated in a similar temporal window in the early gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chew et al., 2013</xref>). As such, it is unclear how the proposed temporal activation window might be converted into a spatial Nodal gradient.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that in addition to diffusion, the gradient of a morphogen is related to the rate of ligand clearance or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callejo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chamberlain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wartlick et al., 2009</xref>), and a role for stability and clearance of Nodals in vivo has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Good et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian and Meng, 2006</xref>). Previously, we reported an atypical lysosome-targeting region located in the pro-domain of Cyc, which targets this Nodal protein for destruction, and regulates target gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian et al., 2008</xref>). How the lysosome-targeting region regulates Nodal clearance and how it influences the Nodal morphogen gradient was not known.</p><p>In this study, we have examined the diffusion coefficient of Nodals in live zebrafish embryos by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS is a widely used single molecule sensitive technique that can quantitatively measure diffusion and concentrations in vivo by determining how fast particles diffuse through a fixed observation volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). We estimated the affinity of Nodals to the type II receptor Acvr2b on the cell surface and to Lefty inhibitors in the extracellular space by single wavelength fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (SW-FCCS). SW-FCCS uses a single laser to excite proteins labeled with spectrally different fluorophores within the observation volume (e.g., the confocal volume) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2009a</xref>). By analyzing the correlated movement of various labeled proteins (ligands/receptor/inhibitor), we determined the fraction of the proteins that were free or bound, and calculated the dissociation constants in live zebrafish embryos. We also investigated the contribution of ligand stability in forming the Nodal gradient. By analyzing diffusion and binding in vivo and from computational simulations, we show that diffusivity alone is insufficient to generate the Nodal morphogen gradient. Our findings show that in order to generate and maintain a robust Nodal morphogen gradient, ligand clearance by degradation is balanced against the binding and release of Nodal ligands with the receptor and inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nodal ligands demonstrate similar mobility profiles</title><p>To visualize Nodal ligands in vivo, we fused the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with Sqt, Cyc, Sqt<sup>Cyc2</sup> and Cyc<sup>Δ2</sup>.

Modeling of the Nodal morphogen gradient requires a range of different parameters, of which some have been measured in vivo and are available, and we have in this study determined binding affinities, and inferred concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We found the dissociation constants, <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>, of Sqt and Cyc to their major cell surface receptor Acvr2, to be ~60 and 120 nM, respectively. In addition, we determined the diffusion coefficients of the Nodals to be ~60 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. From the amplitude of our FCS measurements, we estimated the concentration of the Nodal factors to be on the order of 10<sup>2</sup> nM. We determined that the degradation rate for Cyc is higher than that for Sqt, confirming previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, because our degradation rate values were estimated from cell culture, in our simulations we use the values of 0.0001/s and 0.0005/s for Sqt and Cyc, respectively, documented in or estimated from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"> Müller et al., 2012</xref>). In the simulations we produced particles with 0.07/s to 0.7/s in the simulation volume (corresponding to a production rate of 0.3–3 pM/s) to obtain sufficient number of particles for statistical analysis. The number of particles at equilibrium is given by the ratio of production over degradation rate, which was 700–7000 for a degradation rate of 0.0001/s and 140–1400 for 0.0005/s. Importantly, the production rate itself does not change the gradient shape and only the gradient amplitude is altered.

Using these parameters, Sqt produced a gradient of ~30 μm length and Cyc gradient was ~19 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These values are consistent with actual in vivo measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), and support our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our study, we found that the diffusion coefficients of free Nodal and Lefty proteins measured by FCS are very similar (~60 µm<sup>2</sup>/s), consistent with their similar apparent molecular weight and with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). However, their mobility is too great to account for the sharp gradients observed in developing embryos. The diffusion coefficient values determined by FCS are ~3 to 85 times higher than the effective diffusion coefficients reported using FRAP (18.9 ± 3.0 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for Lefty2, 3.2 ± 0.5 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for Sqt and 0.7 ± 0.2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for Cyc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). FCS and FRAP produce different readouts because they measure diffusion in different contexts, time windows and scales. FCS determines diffusion within a small volume (&lt;1 µm<sup>3</sup>) and on a short timescale (&lt;1 s), whereas FRAP measures net diffusion over a large area (&gt;1,000 µm<sup>3</sup>) over a longer time period (&gt;&gt;10 s). FCS has been very useful to determine local diffusion, to infer the concentration of molecules within a defined confocal volume, and to determine the affinity of molecular interactions within the defined confocal volume. FRAP has been very useful for examining large-scale movement of molecules in tissues. The diffusion coefficients determined by the two techniques are known to vary dramatically. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs, the measured diffusion coefficient of Dpp-GFP is 10 ± 1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s from FCS measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), and 0.1 ± 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup>/s by FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>). This difference is thought to arise from other factors (e.g., by degradation of the molecules during diffusion). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest there must be other molecules and mechanisms in the embryo that refine and shape the Nodal morphogen gradient.</p><p>The diffusional movement of morphogens can also be altered by transient binding to other molecules such as receptors or to components of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baeg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2009</xref>), so that one possible mechanism to shape the gradient is transient binding of Nodal proteins to immobilized diffusion regulators, as found for the fibroblast growth factor Fgf8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). To explain the long range distribution of Sqt compared to Cyc, it was also proposed that Sqt might have a lower binding affinity to its receptors, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). However, we find that Sqt in fact binds in vivo to Acvr2b with a higher affinity than the short-range Nodal, Cyc. Sqt also binds to Lefty with higher affinity, raising the possibility that Lefty-binding might alter Sqt activity. Another potential mechanism for gradient formation is rapid clearance of molecules during diffusion, as observed for Dpp in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>). Our measurements and calculations strongly support this mechanism.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the Nodal gradient might be influenced by its stability: Le Good <italic>et al.</italic> showed that increasing the stability of mouse Nodal protein increases its range of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Good et al., 2005</xref>); Tian <italic>et al.</italic> found a lysozyme targeting signal in Cyc that accelerates its degradation and reduces the signaling activity of chimeric Sqt<sup>Cyc2</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian et al., 2008</xref>); Jing <italic>et al.</italic> determined the half-life of Sqt and Cyc to be ~8 hr (~480 min) and ~2 hr (~120 min), respectively, which somewhat correlates with the difference in target induction by the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2006</xref>). However, the difference in clearance rates of Sqt, Cyc, Lefty1 and Lefty2 determined by photo-conversion assays is not pronounced enough to explain their very different decay lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Müller et al. found that their fluorescent Cyc fusion protein was expressed at very low levels in the extracellular matrix, but exhibited an unusual punctate distribution close to the plasma membrane and in the cytosol, whereas their Sqt fusion showed a strong, uniform and mainly intracellular distribution. The punctate distribution of Cyc suggests that Cyc might undergo a much faster and/or sustained endocytosis process compared to Sqt. This supports our finding that cells selectively destroy Nodal ligands by recognizing the lysosome-targeting signal, since the ligands have to be internalized.</p><p>Simulations of the Nodal gradient show that Sqt generates a gradient of 30 μm and Cyc 19.1 μm, consistent with our measurements of 29.5 ± 5 μm for Sqt and 19.7 ± 2 μm for Cyc (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), as well as the estimated signaling range of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Schier 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tian et al., 2008</xref>). In the simulations, 80% and 95% of steady state levels for Cyc is achieved at 0.7 and 1.25 hr, respectively, which is consistent with the timing of mesoderm induction in the gastrula. By the same predictions, Sqt reaches the 80% and 95% levels at ~4 hr and 7 hr, respectively, which is longer than expected. However, these simulations have not taken into consideration cell divisions or binding to other factors that could influence the gradient. Despite some differences in absolute values, the overall agreement between our experimental results, theory, and simulation supports our conclusion that the Nodal gradient is dependent upon diffusion, binding, and degradation of the morphogen.</p><p>An important point to note from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> is that the clearance rate <italic>k</italic> and the receptor concentration <italic>R</italic> are inversely related to each other. Thus, a higher clearance rate would predict a lower receptor concentration and vice versa. It will be interesting to determine these values with higher accuracy in live zebrafish embryos. In addition, some aspects of the system have not been taken into account in our simulations. In particular, we found that Lefty binds the Nodals with high affinity. This may not influence gradient formation as the Sqt/Lefty and Cyc/Lefty complexes likely diffuse very similarly to Sqt and Cyc given that their size difference is within a factor of two. However, Lefty will influence Sqt and Cyc signaling when in complex, even if this is not directly evident in the gradient of fluorescent molecules. We also have not considered how the Nodal co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 1999</xref>) influences gradient formation. It will be interesting to determine how Oep/Cripto co-receptors and Lefty shape the active signaling gradient. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has been shown to play a key role in regulating diffusion of FGFs, presumably via interactions with heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Makarenkova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). It is not known if the ECM or HSPGs play a role in modulating the Nodal morphogen gradient although sulfated proteoglycans have been proposed to provide directional cues for left-asymmetric Nodal in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marjoram and Wright., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we find that in addition to hindered diffusion via binding to the receptors and inhibitors, the differential stability of Nodal ligands play key roles in shaping the Nodal gradient and activity range. Our experimental findings together with theoretical and computational simulations show that diffusion, extracellular interactions i.e., Nodal-receptor binding, Nodal-Lefty inhibitor binding, and selective ligand destruction collectively shape and refine the Nodal morphogen gradient.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of constructs</title><p>All the constructs were PCR amplified and cloned into pCS2+ vector with Kozak sequence gccacc immediate 5’ of the start codon.

Images were acquired in planes ~15 μm below the enveloping layer of the embryos at 512 × 512 pixels with a corresponding size of 1.4 μm<sup>2</sup>/pixel. Acquired images were analyzed using the ImageJ package. A rectangular region of interest (ROI) with a fixed height of 50.4 μm (36 pixels) adjacent to the source was drawn. The width of the ROI differed depending on the size of the embryo. Windows of 7 × 50.4 μm<sup>2</sup> (5 × 36 pixels) were binned and the average intensity of each binned window was calculated. Background auto-fluorescence was estimated from images of un-injected embryos and subtracted from all measurements. The data was normalized to the value closest to the source boundary, plotted on the intensity-distance coordinate with ImageJ. The data was pooled and fitted, or individual data sets were fitted and the gradient length was calculated as the mean of all fits. Both procedures yielded similar results. Fits were performed with an exponential decay:<disp-formula id="equ7"><label>(7)</label><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>A</italic> is the amplitude of the gradient, λ is the gradient decay length and <italic>C</italic> is a possible offset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Simulation of the Nodal gradient</title><p>Simulations were performed with <italic>Mathematica</italic> 10.0 (Wolfram, Champaign, IL). Initial simulations to determine effective diffusion coefficients in the presence of cells as obstacles (tortuosity) and morphogen binding were conducted in 3D. For this purpose, we simulated a 3D slab of 2 μm height (<italic>z</italic>-axis), 44 μm width (<italic>y</italic>-axis), and 86.7 μm length (<italic>x</italic>-axis), for 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). We used a diffusion coefficient of <italic>D</italic> = 60 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, and created 1000 particles at the left border of the simulation volume. The particles were allowed to perform a random walk for 5 s with a time resolution of 5 ms per step. At the left and right borders (along the <italic>x</italic>-axis), particles were reflected. At the other four borders we used periodic boundary conditions. Based upon actual measurements from early gastrula embryos, we assumed that the space is packed with cells of ~10 μm diameter, and an intercellular space (cell membrane-to-cell membrane distance) of ~2 μm. As the height of the simulation volume was only 2 μm, we used cylinders to represent the cells within this space. Under these circumstances, ligand diffusion was reduced by a factor of 1.84. This value is consistent with the findings of Müller et al. who reported tortuosity to reduce diffusion maximally by a factor of 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, for further modeling we assumed the effective diffusion coefficient of the Nodals to be ~30 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. In the case of binding we used the values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> to determine the average number of free particles at each step.

One should probably temper the conclusions from these studies, especially as cellular properties such as the degradation machinery might be different in the poles compared to the margin. Similarly, the stability data generated in this paper were obtained using HEK293T cells, which may be quite different from zebrafish embryonic cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Wang et al. use FCS and FCCS in zebrafish embryos to measure the diffusion of Nodal ligands and their binding affinity to transmembrane receptors and Lefty. The authors conclude that degradation and Nodal-receptor/inhibitor interactions are important for shaping the Nodal gradient and that the measured diffusion coefficient cannot explain the gradient shape.</p><p>The strength and novelty in this work is the in vivo measurements of binding affinity of Nodals to their receptors and antagonists and the new measurements of in vivo diffusivity of Nodal ligands. Nevertheless, I think there are caveats in the strategy the authors have adopted and there are several weaknesses in the data. Overall my opinion is that the study is somewhat preliminary and descriptive. To be of broader interest the biophysical measurements made in this study need to be incorporated into a coherent, self-consistent model for Nodal spread that tests the main conclusions the authors make.</p><p>In general I am skeptical about the sole use of FCS for assessing morphogen diffusion properties. FCS measurements rely on very small length and time scales. In this context it is not surprising that measurements of proteins in extracellular space produce diffusion coefficients consistent with the molecular size of the protein measured. To be useful, FCS measurements need to be coupled with measurements at long time/length scales (e.g. FRAP etc.) in order to understand the diffusivity properties of the ligand at scales relevant to tissue patterning.</p><p>Previous work from the Schier lab (Müller et al. 2012) have made measurements of some of the same parameters as Wang et al. Wang et al. mention these, but it is difficult to understand from the discussion the similarities and possible reasons for the discrepancies between the two sets of data.</p><p>A limitation of the approach the authors take is that it relies on ectopic expression of the proteins assayed. This could introduce various artefacts by taking measurements of proteins expressed from ectopic cell types or located in abnormal regions of the embryo. For example, if ligand secretion/modification machinery are missing or different in the injected cells. Similarly, the measured degradation rates might be affected by over expression, etc.</p><p>With the measurements the authors have made, they could attempt to fit and test a biophysical model of Nodal spread that takes account of extracellular movement, clearance and receptor and antagonist binding. This exercise would offer a consistency check that the various measurements are compatible with each other and don't predict physically unreasonable behaviours. It might also produce testable predictions – for example suggest what proportion of ligand would be expected to be receptor bound/free at any instant in time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Among nodal homologs in zebrafish, Sqt acts over a long distance while Cyc functions within in a short distance. However, the mechanism that determines the difference in their signaling range remains unclear. The authors have addressed this issue and have examined diffusivity, binding affinity to their receptor, and stability (degradation rate) of Sqt and Cyc in comparison. Their results show that the diffusivity is similar whereas degradation rate and affinity to the receptor are different. The authors suggest that the binding affinity to the receptor and selective ligand degradation determines the signaling range.</p><p>The data presented in this paper look convincing and support their conclusion. It would be much nicer if one can examine their stability in embryo (instead of a culture cell system), but this is probably a realistic way to address this. Although this reviewer is unable to fully evaluate the data obtained by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy for technical reason, I support this paper in principle.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Extracellular Interactions and Ligand Degradation Shape the Nodal Morphogen Gradient&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and Reviewer #2. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you will see below, Reviewer #2 is concerned about the receptor concentration used for the simulations, especially in light of previous papers (although of unrelated proteins) such as:</p><p>Fujioka A, Terai K, Itoh RE, Aoki K, Nakamura T, Kuroda S, Nishida E, Matsuda M., Dynamics of the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade as monitored by fluorescent probes. J Biol Chem. 2006 Mar 31 281(13):8917-26.</p><p>Lee E, Salic A, Krüger R, Heinrich R, Kirschner MW. The roles of APC and Axin derived from experimental and theoretical analysis of the Wnt pathway. PLoS Biol. 2003 Oct;1(1):E10.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (General assessment and major comments (Required)):</italic> </p><p>The additions and changes that Wang et al. have made to their study address many of the issues raised in the initial review and substantially strengthen the study.</p><p>However, these changes do lead to several new questions:</p><p>The simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that the authors have added greatly enhance the paper. The parameterization of these rely on several assumptions, in addition to the measurements. On the whole these seem well justified. However, whether the assumption of a receptor concentration of 40microM is appropriate is unclear. It would be useful to express this as molecules per cell and to provide citations to any supporting evidence for this concentration. It would also be useful to explain the consequence for the simulations of order of magnitude differences in receptor concentration.</p><p>If I understand the simulations correctly, they predict that it would take a considerable time for the gradient to reach steady state. It would be interesting to know how long it takes for the simulations to reach ~80% and ~95% of their steady state. If the time to steady state is of the order (or longer) than mesoderm induction (1-2h) then highlighting this and discussing the consequences in the Discussion will be interesting to the field.</p><p>The authors provide a clear explanation in their rebuttal to referee 1 of the differences in use of FCS and FRAP in measuring morphogen gradients. Incorporating elements of this into the Discussion as a way to explain the caveats of the approach would strengthen the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13879.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers have agreed on the following additional work: modeling work to test the validity of their measurements/model or additional biophysical measurements (e.g., FRAP) (the latter just in case this is something you already started doing), as outlined in reviewer 2's comments.</italic></p><p><italic>Please also make sure to incorporate within the manuscript a discussion of the caveats associated with over-expressing the ligands ectopically (we understand that this is how all the related studies have been carried out in zebrafish but of course, these caveats should be clearly stated and the conclusions appropriately tempered.).</italic></p><p><italic>All additional concerns should be addressable by modifying the text.</italic></p><p>We are pleased that the reviewers found our manuscript on the Nodal morphogen gradient in zebrafish to have general implications for formation for morphogen gradients, to be fundamental to our understanding of developmental processes, and that it breaks new ground in 3 different areas.</p><p>In the revised Wang et al. manuscript, we have fully addressed the reviewers’ comments without adding significantly to the manuscript length:</p><p>1) We have performed mathematical modeling to test the validity of our measurements, and the models proposed to generate the Nodal morphogen gradient.</p><p>2) We show that our measurements are consistent with the computational simulations, and fit with reported values.</p><p>3) The revised manuscript has been rewritten for a broad audience, and</p><p>4) The revised conclusions take into consideration the mammalian cell and zebrafish ectopic expression assays used.</p><p>We show simulations from mathematical modeling in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>, and the simulation parameters are listed in new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>We address the specific comments from the individual reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p> <italic>This paper is concerned with the formation of the Nodal gradient during zebrafish development but has general implications for the formation of morphogen gradients and embryonic patterning.

We have provided information regarding the techniques used (FCS, SW-FCCS etc.).</p><p><italic>Recent studies on Nodal signaling in zebrafish have mostly used ectopic expression in the animal pole, which is not the endogenous source of Nodal expression. One should probably temper the conclusions from these studies, especially as cellular properties such as the degradation machinery might be different in the poles compared to the margin. Similarly, the stability data generated in this paper were obtained using HEK293T cells, which may be quite different from zebrafish embryonic cells.</italic></p><p>This has been done. We have revised the Results and Discussion sections to take into consideration the ectopic assays used (see subsection “Simulation of the Nodal gradient” and Discussion, fourth and sixth paragraphs). We also discuss these in the response to reviewers 2 and 3 comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p> <italic>Wang et al. use FCS and FCCS in zebrafish embryos to measure the diffusion of Nodal ligands and their binding affinity to transmembrane receptors and Lefty. The authors conclude that degradation and Nodal-receptor/inhibitor interactions are important for shaping the Nodal gradient and that the measured diffusion coefficient cannot explain the gradient shape.</italic></p><p><italic>The strength and novelty in this work is the in vivo measurements of binding affinity of Nodals to their receptors and antagonists and the new measurements of in vivo diffusivity of Nodal ligands. Nevertheless, I think there are caveats in the strategy the authors have adopted and there are several weaknesses in the data. Overall my opinion is that the study is somewhat preliminary and descriptive. To be of broader interest the biophysical measurements made in this study need to be incorporated into a coherent, self-consistent model for Nodal spread that tests the main conclusions the authors make.</italic></p><p>We have now amended the manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestions,and performed simulations of the data (see revised Methods, New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>).</p><p>In our study, first we measured in vivo the local diffusivity of the Nodals and their inhibitors Lefty by FCS in early zebrafish embryos. Importantly, our findings resolve a conundrum in light of a recent study by van Boxtel et al., (2015) who reported that contrary to the findings of Müller et al., ligand diffusivity is not a major determinant of the Nodal signals, and that instead, miRNA-430 generates a temporal activation window which is somehow converted into a spatial Nodal activity gradient in zebrafish embryos (van Boxtel et al., 2015).</p><p>Our FCS data largely concur with the findings of Müller et al., and show that the Nodals and Lefty have similar local diffusivity <italic>in vivo</italic> in zebrafish embryos.</p><p>In addition, we have determined the binding affinity of the Nodal ligands to their major cell surface receptor Acvr2b. Surprisingly, we found that the longer range Nodal, Sqt, binds with higher affinity to the Acvr2 receptor than the short range Nodal, Cyc. This suggests that other factors must determine the effective range of Nodal signals. We then measured the binding affinity of the Nodal factors to the inhibitor Lefty. We also show a role for selective ligand degradation in shaping the Nodal gradient. Finally, we tested the validity of our measurements by computational simulations.</p><p>Interestingly, our simulations predict a Sqt gradient of 30 μm and Cyc gradient of 20 μm, which are consistent with theoretical models (Equation 2) and with measured in vivo values (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>).Our findings largely support the ‘hindered diffusion’ model proposed by Müller et al. In addition, we found a role for ligand degradation in shaping the Nodal morphogen gradient.</p><p>Therefore, our <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements, together with mathematical modeling, and simulations, represent an advance.</p><p><italic>In general I am skeptical about the sole use of FCS for assessing morphogen diffusion properties. FCS measurements rely on very small length and time scales. In this context it is not surprising that measurements of proteins in extracellular space produce diffusion coefficients consistent with the molecular size of the protein measured. To be useful, FCS measurements need to be coupled with measurements at long time/length scales (e.g. FRAP etc.) in order to understand the diffusivity properties of the ligand at scales relevant to tissue patterning.</italic></p><p><italic>Previous work from the Schier lab (Müller et al. 2012) have made measurements of some of the same parameters as Wang et al. Wang et al. mention these, but it is difficult to understand from the discussion the similarities and possible reasons for the discrepancies between the two sets of data.</italic></p><p>Müller et al., reported diffusion of Nodal and Lefty by FRAP (2012) and by FCS (2013). Importantly, our FCS measurements are in the same order of magnitude, and our conclusions largely concur with Müller et al., 2013 in that the local diffusivity of the Nodals and Lefty is similar, although the absolute diffusion coefficient values reported by the two groups differ slightly {e.g., ~40 +/- 11 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (n=14) for Sqt by Müller, compared to our measurements of ~64 +/- 14 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (n=29)}.</p><p>The “hindered diffusion” model by Müller et al., 2013 proposes that mobility of the Nodals is slowed down by transient binding interactions of the ligands to unknown diffusion regulators in the extracellular space.</p><p>In our study, we measured the diffusion coefficient of the Nodals and Lefty by FCS. In addition we have determined the affinity of the Nodals to the cell surface receptor Acvr2 and Lefty inhibitor by FCCS. We also show by mathematical modeling that diffusion of the Nodals is indeed retarded upon binding, as predicted for hindered diffusion.</p><p>Our simulations more or less concur with the predictions of Müller (2013): we find a 1.84-fold reduction in mobility with cells as obstacles (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of revised Wang et al.) compared to a presumed maximum 2-fold decrease owing to “tortuosity” (Müller et al. 2013). We then show that mobility/diffusion is reduced further when we take binding into consideration (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our FCS and FCCS measurements reporting binding affinities of the Nodals to the receptor and inhibitor, together with our modeling and simulations largely support the “hindered diffusion by tortuosity and transient binding”model proposed by Müller et al.</p><p>A key difference between our findings and model, and that of Schier and colleagues is that they presumed that the clearance/degradation of the molecules does not significantly affect the Nodal gradient (Müller et al., 2012), which is not what we find. We identified a lysosomal targeting region in Cyc that renders this Nodal unstable compared to Sqt (Tian et al., 2008). We had previously shown that this region is responsive to chloroquine, which inhibits lysosomes. The lysosome-targeting region of Cyc when introduced into Sqt, reduces the activity of chimeric Sqt-Cyc fusion proteins. We also find that the slope of the gradient changes with differential ligand stability, with Sqt-Cyc fusions showing a steeper gradient than Sqt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>;λ of 30 μm for Sqt versus 23 μm for Sqt<sup>Cyc2</sup>). This is supported by assays for signaling range in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our results, in our simulations, we find that the exact ligand amount does not change the outcome significantly for concentration changes within a factor of 5 (see revised Results and Discussion). The differences in the gradient length are therefore, a result of differential binding affinities of Sqt and Cyc, and different degradation rates. Thus, degradation of the ligands is a key regulator of the Nodal gradient.</p><p>Taken together, our findings show that hindered diffusion via extracellular binding of the Nodal ligands to the Acvr2 receptor and Lefty inhibitor, together with selective ligand degradation play important roles in shaping the Nodal morphogen gradient. We have now amended the Results, Discussion and conclusions to make this clear.</p><p><italic>A limitation of the approach the authors take is that it relies on ectopic expression of the proteins assayed. This could introduce various artefacts by taking measurements of proteins expressed from ectopic cell types or located in abnormal regions of the embryo. For example, if ligand secretion/modification machinery are missing or different in the injected cells. Similarly, the measured degradation rates might be affected by over expression, etc.</italic></p><p>We agree that ideally one should assay proteins produced by the endogenous loci, at endogenous levels, at native locations in the embryo. Using new CRISPR/Cas based homologous recombination (Hoshijima et al., 2016) to generate single copy reporters to tag endogenous proteins, together with new/emerging 3D imaging techniques (e.g., SPiM) might provide more robust measurements, and indeed such experiments are under way.</p><p>In the current study, for ease of analysis, as is commonly performed in zebrafish embryos, we used tagged fusions of ligand and inhibitors that were expressed ectopically in the animal pole, where any interference from other molecules could potentially be minimized. A caveat with such experiments is that the ectopic locations might not contain all the necessary components, or might introduce some artifacts.</p><p>However, our current and previous analysis largely concurs with previous work which reported that Cyc acts at short range: Genetic analysis using transplantations of mutant or wild type cells suggested that the range of the Cyc signal is short range, i.e., 1-2 cells from its source (Hatta et al., 1991; Sampath et al., 1998). Chen and Schier found that the range of signaling by Cyc is much less than that of Sqt (2001). We reproduce this in our ectopic animal pole expression assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, our analysis of the gradient also show that compared to the long range Sqt, chimeric Sqt<sup>Cyc2</sup> protein has a steeper gradient which is consistent with its reduced signaling range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our modeling of the data measured broadly agrees with the reported in vivo range for the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, revised Results and revised Discussion). We also infer that some additional binding events (e.g. to the co-receptor or other molecules) might further influence the gradient.</p><p>Thus, our measurements in the animal pole (although not ideal) have provided very useful parameters.</p><p><italic>With the measurements the authors have made, they could attempt to fit and test a biophysical model of Nodal spread that takes account of extracellular movement, clearance and receptor and antagonist binding. This exercise would offer a consistency check that the various measurements are compatible with each other and don't predict physically unreasonable behaviours. It might also produce testable predictions – for example suggest what proportion of ligand would be expected to be receptor bound/free at any instant in time.</italic></p><p>This has been done. We performed simulations of the data (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). We have inferred the amount of free versus bound ligand from our FCS and FCCS measurements and provide this data in new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1. A</xref> caveat of our model is that we have not considered how interactions of Nodals with Lefty inhibitors impacts in vivo signaling output. We also have not taken account of potential Nodal-Oep/Cripto interactions. Nonetheless, our measurements are largely supported by the theoretical predictions, mathematical simulations, and fit well with reported values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>Among nodal homologs in zebrafish, Sqt acts over a long distance while Cyc functions within in a short distance. However, the mechanism that determines the difference in their signaling range remains unclear. The authors have addressed this issue and have examined diffusivity, binding affinity to their receptor, and stability (degradation rate) of Sqt and Cyc in comparison. Their results show that the diffusivity is similar whereas degradation rate and affinity to the receptor are different. The authors suggest that the binding affinity to the receptor and selective ligand degradation determines the signaling range.</italic></p><p><italic>The data presented in this paper look convincing and support their conclusion. It would be much nicer if one can examine their stability in embryo (instead of a culture cell system), but this is probably a realistic way to address this. Although this reviewer is unable to fully evaluate the data obtained by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy for technical reason, I support this paper in principle.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments. Owing to the labile nature of Cyc, for ease of assessing degradation, cell culture was performed. Nonetheless, we recognize the reviewers concerns regarding measurements of stability in cell culture rather than in embryos, and therefore, in our mathematical simulations, we now use previously reported half-life values for Cyc and Sqt (see new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>For all FCS and FCCS measurements, we used appropriate controls (e.g., sec-eGFP and eGFP-mCherry fusions), and all measurements were first tested using reagents previously shown to determine diffusion of FGF in zebrafish embryos (Yu et al., 2009).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>As you will see below, Reviewer #2 is concerned about the receptor concentration used for the simulations, especially in light of previous papers (although of unrelated proteins) such as:</italic></p><p><italic>Fujioka A, Terai K, Itoh RE, Aoki K, Nakamura T, Kuroda S, Nishida E, Matsuda M., Dynamics of the Ras/ERK MAPK cascade as monitored by fluorescent probes.

The parameterization of these rely on several assumptions, in addition to the measurements. On the whole these seem well justified. However, whether the assumption of a receptor concentration of 40microM is appropriate is unclear. It would be useful to express this as molecules per cell and to provide citations to any supporting evidence for this concentration. It would also be useful to explain the consequence for the simulations of order of magnitude differences in receptor concentration.</italic></p><p>We are pleased that the reviewer found the revised Wang et al. manuscript improved and that the simulations greatly enhance the paper.</p><p>We determined from our simulations that a receptor concentration of 40 μM is required to slow down diffusion sufficiently to obtain a 30 μm Sqt gradient. However, it is difficult at this time to deduce a single receptor number per cell for several reasons:</p><p>i) First, this number depends on the ratio of interstitial space volume to cell size and number. So any change in the estimated distance between cells (e.g., by cell division, movement and growth) would alter that number. However, the effective diffusion coefficient (D<sub>eff</sub>) does not depend on this; D<sub>eff</sub> depends only on the concentration and tortuosity, and we have used this in our estimates.</p><p>ii) Second, at the moment we do not know whether there are additional binding sites in the interstitial space as reported for other morphogens (e.g. extracellular HSPG binding by Fgf8; Yu et al., 2009). The binding constant and concentration of such sites, or amendments to the binding constants of the morphogens to receptors would lead to changes in that number.</p><p>iii) Third, the degradation/clearance rate is the main determinant of this number and has a direct influence on the receptor concentration: a faster clearance would lead to faster establishment of the gradient and also reduce the receptor number required to establish the λ of 30 μm and 20 μm that we observed for Sqt and Cyc. Therefore, we estimate that there could be anywhere between 100,000 to millions of receptors per cell. For now, we prefer to leave this determination to future studies when precise production and clearance rates for the various molecules become available, and when it is known if there are additional binders for the ligands.</p><p>We have now amended the Results section to state the following:</p><p>“The estimation of the receptor number of 40 μM is based on the value of D<sub>eff</sub> required to establish the gradient of appropriate dimensions for Sqt. […] Based on the above, we assume that 40 μM is the upper limit for the receptor concentration”.</p><p><italic>If I understand the simulations correctly, they predict that it would take a considerable time for the gradient to reach steady state. It would be interesting to know how long it takes for the simulations to reach ~80% and ~95% of their steady state. If the time to steady state is of the order (or longer) than mesoderm induction (1-2h) then highlighting this and discussing the consequences in the Discussion will be interesting to the field.</italic></p><p>The time to reach the steady state is determined by the clearance rate, k: (1-Exp(-k*t)). Therefore, for Cyc, 80% and 95% of steady state levels are achieved at 0.7 and 1.25 h, respectively, which is consistent with the timing for mesoderm induction in the gastrula. By the same predictions, Sqt reaches the 80% and 95% levels at ~4 and 7 h, respectively, which is longer than expected. We should add that we have not taken into consideration cell divisions etc. during that time or binding to other factors, and how such factors might influence the gradient.</p><p>We have now incorporated this into the revised Discussion (fifth paragraph).</p><p><italic>The authors provide a clear explanation in their rebuttal to referee 1 of the differences in use of FCS and FRAP in measuring morphogen gradients. Incorporating elements of this into the Discussion as a way to explain the caveats of the approach would strengthen the discussion.</italic></p><p>This has been done (Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
