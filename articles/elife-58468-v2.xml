Humans are acutely sensitive to the slow rates of FM that are crucial for speech and music. This sensitivity has long been thought to rely on precise stimulus-driven auditory-nerve spike timing (time code), whereas a coarser code, based on variations in the cochlear place of stimulation (place code), represents faster FM rates. We tested this theory in listeners with normal and impaired hearing, spanning a wide range of place-coding fidelity. Contrary to predictions, sensitivity to both slow and fast FM correlated with place-coding fidelity. We also used incoherent AM on two carriers to simulate place coding of FM and observed poorer sensitivity at high carrier frequencies and fast rates, two properties of FM detection previously ascribed to the limits of time coding. The results suggest a unitary place-based neural code for FM across all rates and carrier frequencies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory perception</kwd><kwd>hearing</kwd><kwd>phase locking</kwd><kwd>amplitude modulation</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC005216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oxenham</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007249</institution-id><institution>University of Minnesota</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Eva O.

The perception of FM at both slow and fast modulation rates is often degraded in older people and those with hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacher-Fougère and Demany, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore and Skrodzka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strelcyk and Dau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grose and Mamo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paraouty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wallaert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paraouty and Lorenzi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>). This deficit likely contributes to the communication difficulties experienced by such listeners in noisy real-world environments, which may in turn help explain why age-related hearing loss has been associated with decreased social engagement, greater rates of cognitive decline, and increased risk of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin and Albert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>). Current assistive listening devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, have been generally unsuccessful in restoring FM sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Zeng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ives et al., 2013</xref>). This lack of success may be related to a gap in our scientific understanding regarding how FM is extracted by the brain from the information available in the auditory periphery.</p><p>The coding of AM begins in the auditory nerve with periodic increases and decreases in the instantaneous firing rate of auditory nerve fibers that mirror the fluctuations in the temporal envelope of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schreiner and Langner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joris et al., 2004</xref>). As early as the inferior colliculus and extending to the auditory cortex, rapid AM rates are transformed to a code that is no longer time-locked to the stimulus envelope and instead relies on overall firing rate, with different neurons displaying lowpass, highpass, or bandpass responses to different AM rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schreiner and Langner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nelson and Carney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The coding of FM is less straightforward. For a pure tone with FM, the temporal envelope of the stimulus is flat; however, the changes in frequency lead to dynamic shifts in the tone’s tonotopic representation along the basilar membrane, resulting in a transformation of FM into AM at the level of the auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zwicker, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khanna and Teich, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Sek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saberi and Hafter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sek and Moore, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Although this FM-to-AM conversion provides a unified and neurally efficient code for both AM and FM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saberi and Hafter, 1995</xref>), it falls short of explaining human behavioral trends in FM sensitivity. Specifically, at low carrier frequencies (<italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic> &lt;~4–5 kHz) and slow modulation rates (<italic>f<sub>m</sub></italic> &lt;~10 Hz) FM sensitivity is considerably greater than at higher carrier frequencies or fast modulation rates in a way that is not predicted by a simple FM-to-AM conversion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demany and Semal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Sek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore and Sek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sek and Moore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>). This discrepancy is important, because it is FM at low frequencies and slow modulation rates that is most critical for human communication, including speech and music, as well as many animal vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attias and Schreiner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nelken et al., 1999</xref>). The enhanced sensitivity to slow FM at low carrier frequencies has been explained in terms of an additional neural code based on stimulus-driven spike timing in the auditory nerve that is phase-locked to the temporal fine structure of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rose et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Sek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parthasarathy et al., 2019</xref>). Although a code based on time intervals between phase-locked neural spikes can potentially provide greater accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siebert, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinz et al., 2001</xref>), be maintained to some extent in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paraouty et al., 2018</xref>), and be used for spatial localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moiseff and Konishi, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grothe et al., 2010</xref>), it is not known whether or how this timing information is extracted by higher stages of the auditory system to encode periodicity (pitch) and FM.</p><p>If the detection of FM at fast rates depends on an FM-to-AM conversion, whereas the detection of FM at slow rates does not, then fast-rate FM detection thresholds should depend on the sharpness of cochlear tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), whereas slow-rate FM detection thresholds should not. Previous studies using normal-hearing listeners have not demonstrated such a relationship for either slow or fast FM rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>). However, this failure to find a correlation may be due to a lack of variability in cochlear filtering within the normal-hearing population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johannesen et al., 2016</xref> found only a modest correlation between slow-rate FM (<italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1500 Hz; <italic>f<sub>m</sub></italic> = 2 Hz) and cochlear mechanical gain loss, but FM thresholds were measured in the presence of superimposed AM, which could have increased the between-subject variability in the measurements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, FM sensitivity was not measured at a faster rate, where only place cues are thought to be utilized. People with cochlear hearing loss often have poorer frequency selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glasberg and Moore, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore et al., 1999</xref>), due to a broadening of cochlear tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robertson and Manley, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liberman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore, 2007</xref>). By contrast, damage to the cochlea is not thought to lead to a degradation of auditory-nerve phase locking to temporal fine structure for sounds presented in quiet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henry and Heinz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henry et al., 2019</xref>), so we would not expect to find a strong relationship between slow-rate FM detection thresholds and hearing-loss-induced changes in cochlear tuning if slow-rate FM relies primarily on a time code.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of (A) FM and (B) AM time waveforms (<italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic> = 1 kHz; <italic>f<sub>m</sub></italic> = 20 Hz) and the resulting changes in basilar-membrane excitation for steep (C and D) and shallow (E and F) slopes.</title><p>In <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, the blue time waveforms represent amplitude over time, while the superimposed red waveforms are the same stimuli plotted in terms of instantaneous frequency over time.

The fidelity of cochlear frequency tuning was assessed using a psychophysical method to estimate the slopes of the forward masking pattern around 1 kHz (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kidd and Feth, 1981</xref>). The results revealed a relationship between the estimated sharpness of cochlear tuning and sensitivity to FM at both fast and slow modulation rates, suggesting that place coding fidelity directly affects FM sensitivity. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for potentially confounding factors such as degree of hearing loss, sensitivity to AM, and age.</p><p>Experiment 2 provided a direct test of earlier assumptions that had led to the conclusion that phase-locked timing information is necessary to code slow FM. We simulated important aspects of the cochlear response to FM without the presence of auditory-nerve timing cues by presenting two tones, spaced far enough away from each other in frequency to avoid peripheral interactions, and applying out-of-phase AM to them. This resulted in a simulation of the out-of-phase AM produced by a single FM tone. Sensitivity to the out-of-phase AM mirrored that seen in traditional psychophysical studies of FM detection, with sensitivity highest at low frequencies and slow rates, despite the lack of any usable timing cues based on temporal fine structure. Taken together, our results suggest that a time-interval code is not necessary to represent slow-rate FM and instead imply a unitary neural code for FM across all rates and frequencies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Relationship between hearing loss and frequency selectivity</title><p>The fidelity of place coding at the test frequency (1 kHz) was measured using pure-tone forward-masking patterns. The 56 participants had to detect a brief tone pip that followed a masker tone presented at 1 kHz. The level of the tone pip was adapted to track its detection threshold. Without the presence of a masker, the threshold level of the tone pip reflects the absolute threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, unfilled circles). In the presence of a pure-tone forward masker, the level of the tone pip depends on the tone pip’s frequency proximity to the masker and on an individual’s frequency selectivity, as determined by their cochlear tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>).

The lack of a significant correlation between slow FM and AM could reflect the use of an additional time code in slow FM. However, because the correlation between slow FM and slow AM was not significantly different from the correlation between fast FM and fast AM (Z = −0.906, p=0.365, two-tailed), these differences in magnitudes should be interpreted with caution.

The current consensus is that place theory applies to fast but not slow FM detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Sek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore and Sek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacher-Fougère and Demany, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strelcyk and Dau, 2009</xref>). Our results contradict this consensus by showing that both slow and fast FM detection thresholds were strongly and similarly related to the masking function slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, a few participants had masking function slopes of zero, or even in the opposite direction (i.e., negative low slopes and/or positive high slopes), presumably due to measurement noise. Imputing these ‘opposite’ slope values with 0 or removing these participants did not affect the statistical outcomes of the analysis. Age and sensitivity to AM could confound effects of cochlear filtering because they are both correlated with FM detection in listeners with normal hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paraouty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>). Audibility is not thought to affect FM for levels that are 25 dB or more above absolute threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zurek and Formby, 1981</xref>), but average absolute thresholds for the carrier frequency in the tested ear were included in the partial correlation analysis as a precaution, since a few listeners with the most hearing loss had stimuli presented at or near 20 dB sensation level (SL), and because hearing loss has been postulated to affect time coding, independent of place coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ewert et al., 2020</xref>). Partial correlations between FM detection and masking function slopes were conducted, controlling for age, absolute thresholds at 1 kHz, and AM detection thresholds at the corresponding rate, in an attempt to isolate the role of place coding in FM detection. The correlations between the residuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) demonstrate a significant relationship between the low slopes of the masking function and FM detection thresholds at both rates (slow FM: <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> = −0.364, p=0.016, CI = [−0.58, −0.101]; fast FM: <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> = −0.377, p=0.015, CI = [−0.589, −0.116]) but no relation between the high slope and FM (slow FM: <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> = −0.064, p=0.555, CI = [−0.331, .213]; fast FM: <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> = −0.084, p=0.555, CI = [−0.349, .194]). Because the low slope of the masking function (reflecting the upper slopes of the cochlear filters) is generally steeper than the high slope (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), it provides more information about frequency change than the high slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, leftmost column), and is therefore predicted to dominate FM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zwicker, 1956</xref>). The correlations between the low slope and FM thresholds were significantly stronger than the correlations between the high slope and FM thresholds for both slow and fast FM before correcting for multiple comparisons (slow FM: Z = −1.83, p=0.034; fast FM: Z = −1.81, p=0.035) but not after (slow FM: p=0.065; fast FM: p=0.065), providing modest but mixed evidence that the low side of the excitation patterns matters most for FM-to-AM conversion. Sensitivity to AM detection was not related to either the low slopes (slow AM: <italic>r</italic> = 0.058, p&gt;0.499, CI = [−0.211, .318]; fast AM: <italic>r</italic> = 0.277, p=0.076, CI = [.013, .505]) or the high slopes (slow AM: <italic>r</italic> = 0.007, p&gt;0.499, CI = [−0.259, .272]; fast AM: <italic>r</italic> = −0.281, p=0.076, CI = [−0.508, −0.017]) of the masking functions. Importantly, the correlations between FM detection thresholds and the low slopes were significantly stronger than the correlations between AM and the low slopes (slow: <italic>Z</italic> = −4.42, p&lt;0.0001; fast: <italic>Z</italic> = −4.89, p&lt;0.0001), demonstrating that the relation between masking function slopes and modulation detection is specific to FM, as predicted by the place-coding theory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Unlike correlations, which are bi-directional, multiple linear regression is a conservative, directional approach to examining the amount of variance accounted for by each variable. Because many of the variables are correlated, the order the variables are entered into the model will affect the percentage of variance explained by each variable. The Variance Inflation Factors ranged from 1.1 to 3.69 for the slow FM model and 1.06–3.62 for the fast FM model, well below the common cutoff of 10, indicating that the independent variables are not too highly collinear with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquardt, 1970</xref>). We took the most conservative approach by entering the low and high slopes last, after all the other variables. Factors known or believed to contribute to FM sensitivity (1 kHz absolute thresholds in the measured ear, age, sensitivity to AM at the corresponding rate, low slope, and high slope, entered in this order) were entered into the model, fitted using the Ordinary Least Squares method. The full models, with all variables entered, explained 59.5% (p&lt;0.0001) and 52.1% (p&lt;0.0001) of the variance in slow and fast FM, respectively. When sequentially entering each variable, absolute thresholds accounted for 45.2% (p=0.022) and 21.7% (p=0.11, n.s.) of the variance for slow and fast FM, respectively (note that all of the <italic>p</italic> values here correspond to the significance of the variable in the full model). Because age is known to impair FM detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strelcyk and Dau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grose and Mamo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paraouty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wallaert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paraouty and Lorenzi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>), age was entered into the model second, accounting for an additional 4.03% (slow FM: p=0.074, n.s.) and 3.78% (fast FM: p=0.16, n.s.) of the variance, while AM thresholds, entered third accounted for 4.03% (slow FM: p=0.039) and 18.7% (fast FM: p&lt;0.0001). The low slope (slow FM: 6.2%, p=0.009; fast FM: 7.91%, p=0.008) but not the high slope (slow FM: .03%, p=0.864; fast FM: .01%, p=0.938) significantly contributed to the variance in sensitivity to FM at both rates, consistent with the partial correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Note that entering the slopes first, instead of last, into the regression means that the variance explained is the same as the squared correlations plotted in panels A and C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (e.g., slow FM and low slope: 39.3%; fast FM and low slope: 22.1% variance explained), but the total variance explained in the full models is unaffected. Entering just the low slope and AM at the corresponding rate into the MLRs, which would be consistent with Zwicker's (1956) place model, accounts for 44.9% and 43.7% of the variance for slow and fast FM, respectively, with significant contributions from both the low slope (slow FM: p&lt;0.0001; fast FM: p&lt;0.0001) and AM (slow FM: p=0.026; fast FM: p&lt;0.0001).

The strongest arguments in support of a time-interval code for slow-rate FM are (1) that FM sensitivity is higher (better) at slow rates than at fast rates (in contrast to AM sensitivity), possibly reflecting ‘sluggishness’ in the ability to evaluate phase-locked timing information, and (2) that sensitivity to slow-rate FM degrades at high carrier frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sek and Moore, 1995</xref>), where phase-locked timing information in the auditory nerve also degrades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palmer and Russell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Verschooten et al., 2019</xref>), whereas sensitivity to AM does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohlrausch et al., 2000</xref>).

We applied AM to two separate carriers, with the modulation either in phase (coherent) or out of phase (incoherent) between the two carriers, at fast and slow modulation rates, and with the carriers presented at frequencies that ranged from within to outside the putative range of human auditory-nerve phase locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Verschooten et al., 2018</xref>). The wide spectral separation of the two carriers (2/3 and 4/3 octaves), their low sound level (45 dB SPL), as well as the narrowband noise added in the spectral gap between them, ruled out any peripheral interactions (including combination tones) between the carriers. We tested whether young normal-hearing listeners’ ability to discriminate incoherent from coherent AM, as well as their ability to detect incoherent AM, varied in the same way that FM detection thresholds varied with modulation rate and carrier frequency, as would be predicted by the place-coding theory of FM perception.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Experiment 2 schematic cochleagram and results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic cochleagram of an FM tone. The magnitude responses for two off-frequency filters (bottom) are 180-degrees out of phase for any given snapshot in time.

A unitary place code for FM predicts that sensitivity to simulated FM via incoherent AM should be best in low-frequency regions (&lt;4–5 kHz) and at slow modulation rates (&lt;10 Hz). To test this hypothesis, we assessed our normal-hearing listeners’ sensitivity for AM dyads that were either in phase (traditional AM) or in opposite phase (incoherent AM, simulating FM), with the modulation depth of each component set to 4 dB below each individual’s AM detection threshold. Sensitivity was assessed for the same center frequencies, rates, and frequency separations as in the discrimination experiment.

At the highest center frequency, the slow-rate benefit for the opposite-phase condition was eliminated (slow 7000 Hz: p=0.132; fast 7000 Hz: p=0.132). This finding was not dependent on the amount of separation between the two carrier frequencies, as there was no significant main effect of frequency separation and no significant interactions. In summary, our detection tasks involving incoherent AM revealed the same pattern of results that are found in FM detection: performance was best at low carrier frequencies and slow modulation rates and was degraded at high modulation rates and/or high carrier frequencies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A unitary code for FM</title><p>Our finding that cochlear place coding is equally important for both slow- and fast-rate FM detection was unexpected. Humans’ acute sensitivity to slow changes in frequency at carriers important for speech and music has been thought to result from precise neural synchronization to the temporal fine structure of the waveform or the combination of place and temporal fine structure cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demany and Semal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Sek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore and Sek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sek and Moore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacher-Fougère and Demany, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Strelcyk and Dau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johannesen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paraouty et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the combined effect of audibility, age, sensitivity to AM, and masking function slopes accounted for about 60% and 52% of the total variance in slow and fast FM detection thresholds, respectively. This is a high proportion of the variance, particularly considering the approximate and indirect nature of the behavioral measure used to estimate cochlear tuning.</p><p>The clear role for place coding in slow FM detection is contrary to the widely accepted view that time coding is used to detect FM at the slow rates found in speech and music. Instead, our results provide evidence for a unitary code for two crucial features of natural sounds, AM and FM, that extends across the entire range of naturally encountered fluctuation rates. Experiment 2 directly addresses the arguments that have been used in the past to support the use of a time-interval code or a dual place-time code for slow-rate FM and demonstrates that enhanced slow-rate FM sensitivity can be accounted for by limitations in humans’ sensitivity to across-frequency variations in AM coherence, without recourse to the properties of auditory-nerve phase locking. This finding likely extends to simple frequency discrimination, which is believed to rely on the same mechanism as slow FM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sek and Moore, 1995</xref>). A unitary code for FM and AM at all rates also helps explain the generally high-multicollinearity between FM and AM sensitivity observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and in several previous studies with normal-hearing listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paraouty and Lorenzi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>), although the effect size of the correlation between slow-rate FM and AM was smaller than observed in previous studies.

However, combinations of pure tones form harmonic complex tones, such as musical instrument sounds, voiced speech, and many animal vocalizations. It is known that humans perceive the pitch of harmonic complex tones in ways that are fundamentally different from other commonly studied species, such as the chinchilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shofner and Chaney, 2013</xref>), ferret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walker et al., 2019</xref>), or songbird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bregman et al., 2016</xref>). Recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shofner and Chaney, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walker et al., 2019</xref>) has suggested that part of this difference can be explained by the substantially sharper cochlear tuning found in humans than in smaller mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sumner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Verschooten et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, sharper human cochlear tuning is believed to explain why humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houtsma and Smurzynski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein and Oxenham, 2003</xref>) and some other primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Song et al., 2016</xref>) rely primarily on low-numbered spectrally resolved harmonics to extract pitch, whereas smaller mammals, such as ferrets and chinchillas, seem to rely primarily on the cues in the temporal envelope, which are provided by spectrally unresolved harmonics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shofner and Chaney, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walker et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Results from the present study suggest that resolved harmonics, which are most important for human pitch perception, may be represented by their place of stimulation rather than by the temporal fine structure information encoded via the stimulus-driven spike timing (phase locking). This conclusion is consistent with other studies showing that pitch perception is possible even with spectrally resolved harmonics that are usually assumed to be too high in frequency to elicit phase locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oxenham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carcagno et al., 2019</xref>) and with studies showing that steep filter slopes are required to represent harmonics from filtered noise in noise-vocoder simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mehta and Oxenham, 2017</xref>). It is also supported by recent data from the inferior colliculus of the rabbit, showing that place coding of low-numbered harmonics from high F0s in the midbrain is robust over a relatively wide range of sound levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Su and Delgutte, 2020</xref>), a finding that should generalize to low F0s in humans, given our superior frequency selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Alternative interpretations</title><p>One alternative interpretation of our results from experiment 1 is that hearing loss leads to a degradation in both spectral resolution and neural phase locking to temporal fine structure, and that it is the degradation in the phase locking, not cochlear filtering, that drives the relationship between spectral resolution and FM coding observed here. There are several reasons why this interpretation is unlikely. First, physiological studies with non-human animals have generally found little or no effect of SNHL on phase locking in the auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison and Evans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henry and Heinz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henry et al., 2019</xref>), with the exception of one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Woolf et al., 1981</xref>). Support from human studies is based on indirect evidence from behavioral results showing poorer performance in hearing-impaired listeners in tasks thought to use time coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopkins and Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopkins and Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moore, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Füllgrabe and Moore, 2017</xref>). However, all of these, with the exception of binaural tasks, could be affected by poorer cochlear tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oxenham et al., 2009</xref>). Binaural tasks, involving the discrimination of interaural time differences (ITDs) in the temporal fine structure of stimuli, are likely to rely on phase-locked coding. These studies have not always found a clear relationship between ITD sensitivity and hearing loss, once effects of age and audibility are accounted for (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smoski and Trahiotis, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopkins and Moore, 2011</xref>), although a recent meta-analysis suggests a small effect of hearing loss on ITDs once controlling for age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Füllgrabe and Moore, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A second reason why it is unlikely for the role of place coding in FM to be a byproduct of degraded time coding with SNHL is that the relationship between place coding fidelity and FM sensitivity remained significant even after the effects of age, AM sensitivity, and hearing loss at 1 kHz were accounted for via partial correlation. Controlling for hearing loss should ensure that possible confounding changes in temporal fine structure coding with poorer frequency tuning are factored out, whereas controlling for aging and sensitivity to AM accounts for central aspects of processing that may affect FM thresholds, including task demands (i.e., the ability to perform a two-interval modulation detection task) and processing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>). The results therefore suggest that degradations of time coding with hearing loss or central aspects of aging do not fully account for the observed effects.</p><p>Another alternative interpretation is that a dual code, based on combined place and timing cues, accounts for slow FM sensitivity, rather than a unitary code. A dual code could potentially explain the high collinearity often observed between measures of FM and AM sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paraouty and Lorenzi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the observation from experiment one that slow-rate FM sensitivity may not be as strongly correlated to AM sensitivity as fast-rate FM (although these differences in correlation strength were not statistically significant). In addition, it has been found that AM can interfere with the detection of FM, particularly at fast rates and high carrier frequencies, perhaps pointing to the possibility of a dual code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore and Sek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ernst and Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2019</xref>). However, just as experiment 2 showed that timing cues are not necessary to explain enhanced slow-rate, low-carrier FM sensitivity, it may be that coherent AM across two carriers also interferes with the detection of incoherent AM in the same way that it interferes with FM detection. This prediction remains to be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Explaining superior FM perception at low rates and low carrier frequencies within a unitary framework</title><p>A pure cochlear place-based model for FM proposes that FM is transduced to AM via cochlear filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zwicker, 1956</xref>). As the frequency sweeps across the tonotopic axis, this is reflected via periodic amplitude fluctuations in the responses of cochlear filters. Experiment 2 demonstrated that a place-only model can account for the different rate- and frequency-dependent trends in FM and AM sensitivity observed in many previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Viemeister, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheft and Yost, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Sek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore and Sek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sek and Moore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacher-Fougère and Demany, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore and Skrodzka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whiteford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Whiteford and Oxenham, 2017</xref>), based on limitations in sensitivity to AM incoherence at high carrier frequencies and/or high modulation rates. Previous studies examining sensitivity to AM incoherence had either only tested fast rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green et al., 1990</xref>) or lower center frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moore and Sęk, 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moore and Sęk, 2019</xref> noted that the very large AM depths needed to discriminate AM incoherence, also observed here, are larger than one might expect if such a task were reflective of the same mechanism used in FM coding. However, the carriers used in AM-incoherence experiments must be spaced far enough apart to avoid peripheral interactions (in our case 2/3 or 4/3 octaves), meaning that the separation is much greater than for the two sides of excitation produced by a single carrier in an FM experiment. This in itself could explain why overall sensitivity is poorer in the AM simulations than in true FM detection and discrimination experiments.</p><p>Our combined findings suggest the auditory system’s ability to compare changes in the output between nearby cochlear filters is more efficient at slow than at fast rates, but only at low center frequencies. This interpretation is partly supported by a computational modeling study showing that frequency and intensity can be represented by a single code, if inter-neuronal noise correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>) are taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Micheyl et al., 2013</xref>). Such correlations would require relatively long time windows to play a functional role, and so would only provide a benefit at low modulation rates, where the duration of the necessary time window does not exceed one period of the modulation. It is not currently known why such effects are dependent on the carrier frequency, but it may be that auditory cortical representations of the highest frequencies (&gt;6 kHz) may be less extensive, due to their relative unimportance for everyday auditory stimuli, such as speech and music, which in turn could produce poorer sensitivity in fine discrimination tasks, analogous to the effects of visual crowding observed in the visual periphery (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Whitney and Levi, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>All tasks in experiment one were completed by 56 participants (19 male, 37 female; average age of 66.5 years, range: 19.4–78.5 years) with no reported history of cognitive impairment.

The TEN was presented continuously in each trial, with the bandwidth spanning one octave, geometrically centered on the test frequency. Except for tasks that involved detection of a short (20 ms) tone pip, the TEN level (defined as the level with the auditory filter’s equivalent rectangular bandwidth at 1 kHz) was always 25 dB below the target level, beginning 300 ms before the onset of the first interval and ending 200 ms after the offset of the second interval. Because less noise is needed to mask very short targets, the TEN was presented 35 dB below the target level for tasks that involved detection of a short, 20 ms tone pip (with and without the presence of a forward masker).

For these conditions, only the final two runs were used in analyses, and the first two runs were regarded as practice. The average across the final two runs for each tone-pip frequency was used in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-9"><title>Sample size</title><p>Because the strength of the relationship between FM sensitivity and forward masking slopes was unknown in listeners varying in degree of SNHL, and the number of people with SNHL at 1 kHz was expected to be limited, we set a minimum sample size requirement for SNHL subjects based on the smallest effect we would like to be able to detect. To detect a moderate correlation between masking function slopes and FM sensitivity (<italic>r</italic> = 0.4, α = 0.05, one-tailed test) with a power of .9, we needed a sample of n = 47. We also aimed to recruit an additional 10 participants with normal hearing thresholds at 1 kHz of similar age to the SNHL subjects. The normal-hearing sample was limited to 10 participants to ensure a relatively even distribution of absolute thresholds at 1 kHz between 0 and 70 dB SPL. One of these anticipated normal-hearing subjects had mild SNHL at 1 kHz in their worse ear, leading to a sample size of n = 57, with nine listeners with normal hearing at 1 kHz and 48 listeners with SNHL. One SNHL subject reported a history of neurological issues and was excluded from the study. Another SNHL subject had unusually poor FM sensitivity at both rates, with thresholds greater than 3 SD from the group mean. This outlier was excluded from all analyses, leading to a final sample size of n = 55. Including the outlier in all analyses generally did not affect the results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty participants (three male, 17 female; mean age = 21.8 years; range: 19–28 years) completed the full experiment 2. An additional 18 participants began the study but failed one or more of the screening criteria: One participant failed the audiometric screening, two participants failed the absolute threshold screening at one or both frequencies, and 15 participants were unable to pass the AM discrimination screening. The large number of participants unable to pass the AM discrimination screening was likely due to the limited amount of training provided. Most participants were experienced with psychophysical tasks and were recruited from the laboratory’s participant pool. To pass the audiometric screening, participants were required to have pure-tone thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL at octave frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. All participants gave informed consent and were provided monetary compensation or course credit for their time. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Minnesota.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Stimuli were generated digitally in Matlab (MathWorks) at a sampling rate of 48 kHz with a 24-bit Lynx E22 soundcard and were presented diotically over Sennheiser HD 650 headphones in a double-walled sound-attenuating booth. Absolute thresholds in quiet were assessed for the two highest frequency components present during the experiment (8819 and 11112 Hz). The target interval contained a 500 ms pure tone with 10 ms raised cosine onset and offset ramps, while the reference interval contained 500 ms of silence. The target and reference intervals were separated by a 100 ms ISI.</p><p>For all other tasks, the stimuli were 1 s in duration with 50 ms raised cosine onset and offset ramps, presented at 45 dB SPL per component. AM discrimination was assessed for two carrier frequencies separated by either 2/3 (narrow-frequency separation) or 4/3 (wide-frequency separation) octaves and centered on one of three possible frequencies: 500, 1500, and 7000 Hz. The frequencies of each carrier for all conditions are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>. Both carriers were amplitude-modulated at either a slow (2 Hz) or fast (20 Hz) rate. The starting phase of the modulator was randomized for each stimulus presentation and were either in phase (same starting phase) or out of phase (180-degree phase shift) for the two carriers. Randomizing the envelope starting phase in this manner ensured that participants could only use the relationship between the two modulators, rather than the starting phase of either of the modulators alone, to perform the task. The target stimulus was always incoherent AM (i.e., 180-degree phase difference), while the two reference stimuli were coherent AM (i.e., in phase). To prevent participants from possibly using envelope cues in off-frequency filters (i.e., by monitoring fluctuations in output at filters centered between the two carriers, which could be systematically different for the coherent versus incoherent conditions), narrow-band TEN was geometrically centered between the two carrier frequencies with a bandwidth of either 1/6 octave (for the narrow frequency-separation condition) or 1/3 octave (for the wide frequency-separation condition) and was presented at 39 dB SPL per ERB. The TEN was presented continuously and gated between trials, beginning 300 ms before the onset of the first stimulus within a trial and ending 200 ms after the offset of the last stimulus. Example trials were presented at large depths (<italic>m</italic> = 1 and <italic>m</italic> = 0.75) for the 1500 Hz center frequency in the narrow-frequency separation condition at both rates, as these were the conditions where envelope incoherence was most salient. The AM-phase discrimination screening tested all combinations of conditions for the wide-frequency separation, as this was predicted to be more challenging than the narrow-frequency separation, effectively eliminating participants who would require more training to perform the task.</p><p>Pure-tone AM detection thresholds were measured for each individual component in the presence of the corresponding TEN for all carrier/TEN combinations used in the complex AM detection task for both the 2 and 20 Hz rates.</p><p>Complex AM detection sensitivity for both coherent and incoherent AM was assessed using the same center frequencies, frequency separations, and modulation rates as used in the AM discrimination task. The target was a two-component complex tone with AM imposed on both components while the reference was a steady (unmodulated) two-component complex tone. For each block, the frequency components of the reference were identical to the carrier frequencies in the target. The modulation depth of the target components was individualized to be 4 dB below the participant’s average pure-tone AM detection threshold (in 20log(<italic>m</italic>)) for each individual component at the same carrier and rate in the presence of TEN. This depth was small enough to make the task challenging but avoided performance that was at chance level. TEN was presented in the same manner as in the AM discrimination task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>General procedures</title><p>Both the high-frequency absolute threshold and the AM discrimination screenings took place on the first session. Only participants who passed both screenings were invited to complete the rest of the experimental tasks, which took place across an additional 5–6 sessions, with each session lasting no longer than 2 hr. All tasks were either two- or three-interval alternative forced choice, with the target appearing in each interval with equal a priori probability. The task was to click the numbered virtual response button on the computer screen that corresponded to the interval that contained the target. Visual feedback (‘Correct’ or ‘Incorrect’) was presented on the screen after each trial. All participants completed the tasks in the same order, described below in the order they were presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Absolute threshold screening</title><p>To ensure performance in the highest center-frequency condition was not limited by audibility, participants were required to have absolute thresholds ≤ 30 dB SPL for the two highest frequency components present during the experiment. Participants were instructed that each of the three response buttons on the screen would illuminate red, one at a time, and their task was to select the button that was illuminated while they heard a tone. The target level varied adaptively using a 2-down, 1-up adaptive method that tracked the 70.7% correct point of the psychometric function. Two runs were measured for each frequency condition. The order of the frequency condition was randomized across runs with the constraint that both frequencies were tested once before repeating a frequency condition.</p><p>On the first trial, the target was presented at 40 dB SPL. The target changed by 8 dB for the first reversal, 4 dB for the next two reversals, and 2 dB for all following reversals. Absolute thresholds for each run were determined by calculating the mean level at the final six reversal points. Participants with average thresholds across the two runs &gt;30 dB for either frequency condition were excluded from participating in the rest of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>AM-phase discrimination screening</title><p>An additional qualification criterion was that participants had to be able to perform the discrimination task by the end of the first 2 hr session. First, to aid in target identification, participants were presented with two blocks of eight example trials each (four trials per depth). A trial consisted of three tones, presented sequentially over time, and participants had to pick the one that was incoherently modulated. The target and references always had a large modulation depth of either <italic>m</italic> = 1 or <italic>m</italic> = 0.75 so that the target envelope incoherence was salient. The examples were blocked by modulation rate, and the depth condition was randomized within a block. The order of the blocks was randomized. Participants were allowed to repeat up to three blocks of examples per condition.</p><p>The examples were followed by the AM-phase discrimination screening. The instructions were the same as the example trials, but the AM depth of all stimuli varied adaptively with performance using a 2-down, 1-up method to track the 70.7% correct point of the psychometric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levitt, 1971</xref>). Two runs were measured for each condition, for a total of 12 runs. The order of the runs was randomized by center frequency and then modulation rate, so that both modulation rates were tested before continuing to the next center frequency condition. Randomization was constrained so that all conditions were tested once before any conditions were repeated.</p><p>The initial trial in each run had a modulation depth (in 20log(<italic>m</italic>)) of −8 dB. The depth changed by 6 dB for the first two reversals, 2 dB for the next two reversals, and 1 dB for all following reversals. Threshold was defined as the average log-transformed modulation depth at the final six reversal points. To account for inability to perform the task, the tracking procedure terminated early if the maximum possible modulation depth (0, 100% modulation) was reached 15 times within a run. Any conditions with at least one failed threshold estimate were repeated until the participant successfully achieved two consecutive threshold estimates for the corresponding condition(s). If the end of the 2 hr session was reached and a participant was still unable to achieve a threshold for one or more conditions, they were excluded from participating in the full study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>AM phase discrimination</title><p>Instructions and methods were the same as the AM discrimination screening, except that both the wide- and narrow-frequency separation conditions were tested. The order of the conditions was randomized by center frequency, then modulation rate, and then frequency separation, so that both frequency-separation conditions were tested for a given center frequency and rate before the next rate was tested for the same center frequency. There were four runs per condition, for a total of 48 runs. All conditions were tested once before any conditions were repeated.</p><p>Eight subjects were unable to converge on a threshold for at least one run. In all instances, this corresponded to the 7000 Hz center frequency, usually in the wide frequency-separation condition and the fast rate. One additional run was collected to replace each failed run so that all participants had four thresholds estimates per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>AM detection</title><p>Two tones were presented sequentially in time, and participants were instructed to pick the one that was modulated. There were two runs per condition, for a total of 48 runs. The order of the runs was randomized by carrier frequency and then modulation rate, so that both rates were tested before the next carrier frequency was presented. All carrier frequency and rate combinations were tested before any conditions were repeated.</p><p>The modulation depth varied based on performance using a 3-down, 1-up adaptive method to estimate the 79.4% correct point on the psychometric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levitt, 1971</xref>). At the beginning of each run, the target had a modulation depth of −8. The depth varied by 6 dB for the first two reversals, 2 dB for the next two reversals, and 1 dB for all following reversals. AMDLs were calculated as the average modulation depth at the final six reversal points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Complex AM detection</title><p>Participants were presented with two complex tones, one at a time, and instructed to pick the tone that was modulated. To cue participants to listen for the correct modulation rate, each block began with five practice trials with larger modulation depths. The target in the first practice trial was presented 3 dB above threshold and then decreased in depth by 1 dB for each additional practice trial. Practice trials were immediately followed by 50 experimental trials, with the target component depths set to 4 dB below the individualized AM detection thresholds. At the start of this task, participants were informed that the modulation depths were individualized to be difficult but not impossible, so they should use the practice trials to help them identify what rate to listen for in the corresponding block. Blocks were randomized by center-frequency condition and then modulation rate, so that one block of each rate and frequency separation were completed before the participant was presented with the next center-frequency condition. After completing one block of each condition, the randomization procedure was repeated again, so that participants completed 100 trials per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-9"><title>Sample size</title><p>Because the variance of AM incoherence sensitivity is unknown, sample size was determined by reviewing recent publications comparing group-average FM detection thresholds at different carriers and rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore and Sek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ernst and Moore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2019</xref>).

An analogous procedure was conducted for each individual’s masked thresholds for every tone-pip condition, with four runs (two test and two retest) sampled from each individualized normal distribution. The average simulated runs were used to estimate the low and high frequency slopes of the masking function by calculating a linear regression between the four lowest and four highest tone-pip frequency conditions for the average test and the average retest runs (four regressions per iteration).

The first experiment assesses people with normal hearing as well as participants with different degrees of hearing impairment, resulting in a wide range of fidelity of cochlear place coding. The authors find that the ability to detect frequency modulation is correlated to the fidelity of the cochlear place coding, even for low modulation frequencies where it was previously assumed that the place code did not matter. They conclude that cochlear place coding is critical for the detection of frequency modulation, at all modulation frequencies. In the second experiment, the authors show that a task of detecting amplitude modulation of two nearby frequencies with their amplitude modulation being either in our out of phase produces behaviour that is similar to that of detecting frequency modulation. Because the detection of amplitude modulation is not assumed to involve a temporal code, this is taken as evidence that the dependencies of the frequency modulation detection on the carrier frequency as well as on the modulation frequency does not need to result from temporal coding.</p><p>These results are overall well described and presented. The research question of place coding versus temporal coding regarding different aspects of a sound is important, since frequency modulation appears in many real-world sounds such as speech. Clarifying how these modulations are encoded in the brain can therefore help to elucidate the processing of many complex signals. However, there are a range of major issues that we would like the authors to address in a revised version.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors investigate detection thresholds for fast and slow FM as well as for fast and slow AM. The dual coding model predicts that the thresholds for detecting slow FM should not be correlated to the remaining three thresholds, whereas all other detection thresholds should be correlated to each other. In the author's model, all thresholds should be correlated to each other (including the thresholds for detecting slow FM). The authors find that the detection thresholds for slow FM and fast FM are significantly correlated, which corroborates their hypothesis. However, they also find that the correlation between the detection thresholds for slow FM and slow AM is insignificant, which seems to contradict their hypothesis. Moreover, the authors do not describe the correlation between the detection thresholds for slow FM and fast AM. Please detail this correlation and discuss how the seemingly diverging observations can be reconciled.</p><p>Hearing impairment may cause damage to the cochlear place coding, but also to temporal coding as well as to more central cognitive processes. Please discuss these possible confounds further.</p><p>2) The correlations presented in Figure 5 between the residuals of the FM detection and the slopes related to cochlear tuning appear to rely mostly on data points that have slopes around 0, or even of the opposite sign as the expected one. We are wondering what such slopes signify, and how they could be explained? It seems to us that they might indicate a more complicated pattern of hearing loss. Do we know – and can therefore control – how such more complicated hearing loss might affect FM or AM detection? Vice versa, would the correlations still persist if only slopes in a “reasonable” range, comparable to that of normal-hearing people, were to be included?</p><p>3) The second line of evidence uses multiple linear regression to account for the influence of other factors. This analysis produced one finding that is more in line with the traditional view: after hearing loss had been entered into the regression, sensitivity to AM accounted for 18.7% of the variance in fast-rate FM thresholds but only 4% of that in slow-rate FM thresholds. Could the authors compute whether, in the raw data, the correlation between the low-frequency slope and the FM thresholds was larger than that between the low-frequency slope and the AM thresholds? Such a correlation could be a clear prediction of the authors' hypothesis and might be quite powerful as it predicts that one across-listener correlation is significantly larger than another.</p><p>4) Regarding the second experiment, could combination tones have affected the performance? In addition, two important features of the design are missing from the main text and should be inserted: the use of exclusively normal-hearing subjects and the presence of a narrowband of noise between the two carriers.</p><p>5) We believe that the data may be insufficient to completely rule out a temporal code for FM in some conditions. Johannesen et al., 2016, which is not cited in the manuscript, reported that low-rate FM detection (<italic>f<sub>c</sub></italic>=1.5 kHz, <italic>f<sub>m</sub></italic>=2Hz) was not correlated with pure tone thresholds or age for hearing-impaired listeners (N=68), and was only slightly correlated with cochlear mechanical gain loss inferred using forward masking (N=68, R2=0.06, p=0.04, see their Table I). At first sight, the results of Johannesen et al., 2016, seem inconsistent with the data of experiment 1 in the present study. A potentially important difference between the two studies, however, is that Johannesen et al., 2016, superimposed random AM (rate 1-3 Hz, depth=6 dB) on their stimuli to minimize FM-to-AM conversion as a reliable cue for FM detection; i.e., to maximize the possibility that FM detection was based on an temporal code. Their hearing-impaired subjects were still able to perform the task. Therefore, the study of Johannesen et al. shows that a temporal code is likely used when FM-to-AM is not possible or reliable and makes us wonder if the pattern of results in experiment 1 would still hold if random AM were super-imposed on the stimuli.</p><p>The authors themselves acknowledge that FM is encoded in the timing of spikes of auditory neurons and indeed cite some studies that support a dual code for FM (e.g., Paraouty et al., 2018). Therefore, the more parsimonious explanation for all the evidence combined is that FM is probably encoded via a dual place-time code. In our opinion, the authors should transmit this idea more clearly rather than the idea that low-rate FM is encoded only via a place code.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The role of cochlear place coding in the perception of frequency modulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The smaller correlations between slow FM and AM could be accounted for by a dual place-time code. Because the correlation between slow FM and slow AM was not significantly different from the correlation between fast FM and fast AM, however, the evidence for a dual code is modest, particularly in the light of the results from experiment 2. The trends with rate and center frequency in experiment 2 demonstrate that spike-driven timing is not necessary to explain rate and carrier dependent trends in FM sensitivity that have been typically attributed to time coding. The Results section on frequency selectivity in experiment 1 as well as the Discussion have been edited to point out that hearing impairment may co-vary with issues related to temporal coding and/or central processing. The title has also been changed to tone down the claim that only place coding can account for FM sensitivity. Importantly, even after controlling for potentially confounding effects of hearing loss, aging, and sensitivity to AM, the partial correlations between FM sensitivity and low-frequency masking pattern slopes persisted. This finding helps to establish that masking-pattern slopes affect FM sensitivity, even when the potential confounds of hearing loss, task demands of AM processing, and central effects of aging are accounted for.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The correlations presented in Figure 5 between the residuals of the FM detection and the slopes related to cochlear tuning appear to rely mostly on data points that have slopes around 0, or even of the opposite sign as the expected one.

Imputing these slopes with 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) or removing them entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) does not change the conclusions; this is now stated in the manuscript (subsection “Relationship between frequency selectivity and FM detection thresholds”). Restricting the data to only include those with normal hearing at the carrier would leave us with a substantially underpowered sample size, as most participants have hearing loss. However, past studies with only normal-hearing participants have shown no correlation between the steepness of the masking pattern slopes and fast or slow FMDLs (Whiteford and Oxenham, 2015; Whiteford et al., 2017), likely because there is not as much variability in peripheral place coding fidelity when all the listeners have healthy hearing.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlations between FM sensitivity (y-axes) and fidelity of place coding (x-axes) (n=55) with extreme slope data points (i.e., negative low slopes and/or positive high slopes) replaced with 0.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58468-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Correlations between FM sensitivity (y-axes) and fidelity of place coding (x-axes) with extreme slope data points removed.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58468-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The second line of evidence uses multiple linear regression to account for the influence of other factors.

In our case, both tones were low in level (45 dB SPL). Even the smaller ratio of 2/3 octaves (f2/f1 = 1.59) is much greater than the ratios that generate combination tones, and the levels are too low. For the larger ratio of 4/3 octaves (f2/f1 = 2.52), no combination tones are mathematically possible, as the primary combination tone frequency (2f1-f2) falls below 0 Hz. In addition, the narrowband noise between the tones would further limit any potential combination tones.</p><p>The main text has been edited to state that experiment 2 used exclusively normal-hearing listeners and that narrowband noise was presented between the carriers to prevent any interactions between them, including combination tones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We believe that the data may be insufficient to completely rule out a temporal code for FM in some conditions. Johannesen et al., 2016, which is not cited in the manuscript, reported that low-rate FM detection (f<sub>c</sub>=1.5 kHz, f<sub>m</sub>=2Hz) was not correlated with pure tone thresholds or age for hearing-impaired listeners (N=68), and was only slightly correlated with cochlear mechanical gain loss inferred using forward masking (N=68, R2=0.06, p=0.04, see their Table I). At first sight, the results of Johannesen et al., 2016, seem inconsistent with the data of experiment 1 in the present study.

In our opinion, the authors should transmit this idea more clearly rather than the idea that low-rate FM is encoded only via a place code.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the superimposed random AM on FM makes it hard to directly compare Johannesen et al., 2016, to the present study. One issue with measuring FM with AM imposed is that it elevates FM thresholds at all carriers and rates relative to traditional FM thresholds – an effect that could be driven by more central aspects of FM processing, rather than less reliable place cues. Furthermore, superimposed AM on FM would not entirely wipe out FM-to-AM conversion; in fact, an optimal detector strategy could eliminate most of the AM interference by subtracting the coherent AM found on either side of the carrier frequency from the incoherent AM produced by the FM. Thus, any interference produced by AM may be the result of non-optimal processing, or (as suggested by our data) more reliance on the lower excitation pattern slope than the upper. In either case, the results from Johannesen et al. could potentially still be explained by the use of residual place cues and out-of-phase AM processing. The lack of correlation between pure-tone thresholds and FM thresholds in their study may be because their pure-tone thresholds did not specifically reflect thresholds at the carrier (i.e., they were weighted and averaged across multiple frequencies). The lack of correlation between FM thresholds and age is less clear and not consistent with what we (Whiteford et al., 2017) and others (Paraouty and Lorenzi, 2017) have found for traditional FM and age, although again this is made more difficult to interpret in that there are likely added demands on central processing when detecting FM with superimposed AM.</p><p>We have incorporated the Johannesen et al., 2016, paper into the manuscript and edited the Discussion to include the possibility that slow-rate, low-carrier FM uses a dual code that relies on combining both place and timing information, which may account for the patterns of correlations observed in experiment 1. Importantly, such a dual code could not account for the results of experiment 2, where no useful timing cues are available, calling into question the necessity of any timing information needed for slow-rate FM.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the revised manuscript is significantly improved.
