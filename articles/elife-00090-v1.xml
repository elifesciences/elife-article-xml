Here we report that doxorubicin stimulates de novo synthesis of ceramide, which in turn activates CREB3L1, a transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor. Doxorubicin stimulates proteolytic cleavage of CREB3L1 by Site-1 Protease and Site-2 Protease, allowing the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of CREB3L1 to enter the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes encoding inhibitors of the cell cycle, including <italic>p21</italic>. Knockdown of CREB3L1 mRNA in human hepatoma Huh7 cells and immortalized human fibroblast SV589 cells conferred increased resistance to doxorubicin, whereas overexpression of CREB3L1 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells markedly enhanced the sensitivity of these cells to doxorubicin. These results suggest that measurement of CREB3L1 expression may be a useful biomarker in identifying cancer cells sensitive to doxorubicin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00090.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00090.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00090.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is a broad term to describe over 200 diseases that are caused by cells proliferating in an out-of-control manner. Cell replication and division are normally very tightly regulated, and as cells become old, damaged or mutated, they are either repaired or undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). However, if defective cells continue to replicate, the resulting clusters of abnormal cells can become cancerous.</p><p>With so many different types of cancer, there is no ‘magic bullet’ to cure all of them. Many cancer therapies are targeted, relying on drugs that block the spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in the growth and progression of certain tumors. However, the fact that diseased cells replicate faster than normal cells in many forms of cancer makes it possible to use non-specific drugs, such as doxorubicin, to treat tumors when targeted therapies are not available.</p><p>Doxorubicin can induce DNA breaks in a variety of different cancers by inhibiting the activity of topoisomerase II but a consistent relationship between the inhibition of this enzyme and the blocking of cell proliferation has not been established. This lack of understanding of the mechanism through which doxorubicin inhibits cell proliferation makes it difficult to identify cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from doxorubicin treatment.</p><p>Denard et al. have now shown that doxorubicin blocks cell replication by cleaving a transcription factor called CREB3L1. This latest work builds on previous work in which they showed that cleavage of this transcription factor can inhibit the replication of cells infected with hepatitis C virus. It has been known since 2000 that CREB3L1 is a membrane protein with one end inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the other end (which is terminated with an NH<sub>2</sub> group) in the cytosol of the cell. When CREB3L1 is cleaved, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain travels into the nucleus of the cell, where it drives the transcription of genes that suppress the cell cycle. Denard et al. clearly show that doxorubicin triggers the cleavage of CREB3L1 by stimulating the production of ceramide molecules. Thus, It might be possible, with further research, to use CREB3L1 as a biomarker to identify tumors that are suitable for treatment by doxorubicin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00090.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00090.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>doxorubicin</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>CREB3L1</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 090119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL 20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cleavage of a membrane-bound transcription factor by the chemotherapeutic reagent doxorubicin can block the proliferation of tumor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is used widely to treat diverse types of cancer, yet its effectiveness is hampered by the existence of drug-resistant cancer cells. The reason for drug resistance is unclear mainly because the mechanism through which doxorubicin inhibits proliferation of cancer cells is not completely understood. Doxorubicin has been proposed to exert its cytostatic action through intercalation into DNA and production of free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gewirtz, 1999</xref>). However, these mechanisms are unlikely to be clinically relevant as the concentration of doxorubicin required to produce these effects is much higher than that achievable in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gewirtz, 1999</xref>). Inhibition of topoisomerase II by doxorubicin at clinically achievable concentrations leads to DNA breaks, but a consistent relationship between DNA strand breaks and the cytostatic action of the drug has not been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gewirtz, 1999</xref>). Thus, the mechanism through which doxorubicin inhibits cell proliferation remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to blocking cell proliferation, doxorubicin induces renal fibrosis in mice by stimulating production of collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lee and Harris, 2011</xref>). The dual ability of doxorubicin to block cell proliferation and to induce collagen expression caught our attention inasmuch as we recently showed that both responses can be activated by a transcription factor called cAMP response element-binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1, also known as OASIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denard et al., 2011</xref>). CREB3L1 belongs to a family of transcription factors synthesized as transmembrane precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Omori et al., 2002</xref>) and activated through a process designated as Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2000</xref>). The transcription factor domain of CREB3L1 is located in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 374-amino acids that project into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The COOH-terminal domain of 124 amino acids projects into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Viral infection triggers the RIP of CREB3L1, which undergoes two sequential cleavages mediated by Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denard et al., 2011</xref>). The S1P-catalyzed cleavage at the luminal side is a prerequisite for the S2P-catalyzed intramembrane cleavage that releases the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of the protein from membranes, allowing it to drive transcription of genes that suppress cell proliferation such as <italic>p21</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denard et al., 2011</xref>). Nuclear CREB3L1 also activates genes required for assembly of the collagen matrix, including <italic>collagen 1α1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denard et al., 2011</xref>). These dual activities prompted us to hypothesize that doxorubicin functions by stimulating proteolytic activation of CREB3L1.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00090.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Doxorubicin stimulates RIP of CREB3L1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of CREB3L1.

In the absence of doxorubicin, CREB3L1 existed as the full length precursor (∼80 kDa) in membranes and the cleaved nuclear form of CREB3L1 (∼55 kDa) was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 1). Treatment with doxorubicin markedly raised the amount of the nuclear form of CREB3L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2). The amount of membrane protein calnexin and nuclear protein lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was not altered by doxorubicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Doxorubicin may increase the amount of nuclear CREB3L1 through stimulation of CREB3L1 precursor cleavage or inhibition of nuclear CREB3L1 degradation, which was reported to be carried out by proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murakami et al., 2009</xref>). To determine whether doxorubicin inhibits degradation of nuclear CREB3L1, we transfected Huh7 cells with a cDNA encoding NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment of CREB3L1 resembling the cleaved nuclear form of the protein (pCMV-CREB3L1(Δ381-519)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denard et al., 2011</xref>). The amount of transfected nuclear form of CREB3L1 was not affected by doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). However, this amount was increased in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that overexpression of the transfected protein did not overwhelm the machinery that degrades nuclear CREB3L1. These results suggest that doxorubicin does not stabilize nuclear CREB3L1. Thus, doxorubicin appears to increase nuclear CREB3L1 by stimulating proteolysis of its precursor.</p><p>To determine whether doxorubicin-stimulated cleavage of CREB3L1 was catalyzed by S1P and S2P, we analyzed the cleavage in mutant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells deficient in S1P or S2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rawson et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1998</xref>). In wild type CHO cells, doxorubicin stimulated cleavage of CREB3L1 to produce the nuclear form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, doxorubicin failed to produce the nuclear form of CREB3L1 in mutant cells deficient in either S1P or S2P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). In wild type CHO cells, we also detected in the membrane fraction a cleaved fragment with a molecular weight similar to that of the nuclear form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). This fragment was absent in cells deficient in S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) but dramatically elevated in cells deficient in S2P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). These findings suggest that this membrane-bound fragment is the intermediate form of CREB3L1 that was cleaved by S1P but not by S2P. Similar cleavage intermediates were observed in earlier studies of SREBP-2, a prototypes of RIP substrates, in mutant CHO cells deficient in S2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rawson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). SREBP-2 was cleaved in sterol-depleted CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 1) to activate genes required for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). However, this cleavage was not activated by doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, doxorubicin appears to specifically induce proteolytic activation of CREB3L1.</p><p>An alternative approach to determine the effect of doxorubicin on proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 is to analyze the effect of the compound on expression of target genes activated by CREB3L1.

For both untransfected Huh7 cells and those transfected with the control shRNA (Huh7-shControl), doxorubicin completely blocked their proliferation at a concentration between 50 and 150 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This concentration of doxorubicin also resulted in maximal cleavage of CREB3L1 in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For Huh7-shCREB3L1 cells, doxorubicin at concentrations up to 500 nM failed to block their proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These concentrations of doxorubicin were not enough to trigger apoptosis of Huh7 cells, which became apparent only when the cells were treated with 5 µM of the compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To rule out the off-target effects of the shRNA, we also transfected Huh7 cells with two distinct siRNA targeting regions of CREB3L1 that is different from that targeted by the shRNA.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed SV589 cells, an immortalized line of human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yamamoto et al., 1984</xref>), and MCF-7 cells, a line of human breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soule et al., 1973</xref>). Compared to Huh7 cells, expression of CREB3L1 was higher in SV589 cells and lower in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The sensitivity of the cells to growth inhibition by doxorubicin followed the order of CREB3L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar to Huh7 cells, knockdown of CREB3L1 by two duplexes of siRNA targeting different regions of CREB3L1 in SV589 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) made them more resistant to doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since MCF-7 cells expressed very little CREB3L1, we used these cells to study the effect of CREB3L1 overexpression on sensitivity to doxorubicin. We stably transfected MCF-7 cells with a plasmid encoding CREB3L1 and selected one clone of the cells with relatively low expression (MCF7/pCREB3L1(L); eightfold above parental cells) and another clone with high expression of CREB3L1 (MCF7/pCREB3L1(H); 300-fold above parental cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The eightfold overexpression of CREB3L1 in MCF7/pCREB3L1(L) cells lowered the IC<sub>50</sub> for doxorubicin from 500 nM to 10 nM, and the 300-fold overexpression of CREB3L1 in MCF7/pCREB3L1(H) cells further reduced the IC<sub>50</sub> to ∼1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In this experiment, cells were treated with doxorubicin for 2 days. To determine the effect of CREB3L1 expression on proliferation of the cells treated with doxorubicin for a longer period of time, we incubated MCF-7 and MCF7/pCREB3L1(H) cells with 15 nM doxorubicin for 6 days. This treatment did not affect proliferation of MCF-7 cells, but markedly blocked proliferation of MCF7/pCREB3L1(H) cells, as determined by direct cell counting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and by measurement of cellular DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Doxorubicin induced appearance of histone γH2AX, a marker for DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 2). However, this effect was unaffected by knockdown of CREB3L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 5). This result suggests that cleavage of CREB3L1 does not lead to doxorubicin-induced DNA breaks. To investigate whether DNA breaks may lead to cleavage of CREB3L1, we examined etoposide, another chemotherapeutic drug that inhibits topoisomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stähelin and von Wartburg, 1991</xref>). Unlike doxorubicin, etoposide failed to induce cleavage of CREB3L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lane 3), even though etoposide was as effective as doxorubicin in causing DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Accordingly, knockdown of CREB3L1 in Huh7 cells did not increase their resistance to etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and overexpression of CREB3L1 in MCF7 cells also did not increase their sensitivity to the compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that induction of CREB3L1 cleavage by doxorubicin is not related to its inhibitory activity towards topoisomerase. Besides etoposide, CREB3L1 was also not required for bleomycin or paclitaxel to inhibit cell growth, an observation suggesting that CREB3L1 may be specifically involved in doxorubicin-induced suppression of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00090.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CREB3L1 activation is independent from DNA breaks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) On day 0, indicated cells were seeded at 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 60 mm dish.

Since ER is the site where most lipids are synthesized, we wondered whether doxorubicin may alter homeostasis of certain lipids that may result in cleavage of CREB3L1. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug derived from doxorubicin, were reported to induce de novo synthesis of ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bose et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), a class of lipid known to inhibit cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ogretmen and Hannun, 2004</xref>). De novo synthesis of ceramide is initiated with the condensation of palmitate and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gault et al., 2010</xref>). This rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of ceramide is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Linn et al., 2001</xref>). Ceramide synthesis also requires a reaction catalyzed by ceramide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mullen et al., 2012</xref>).

It was reported previously that C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide was converted to naturally-existing ceramide in cells through the ceramide salvage pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kitatani et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, our mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed that treatment with C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide increased nearly all species of ceramide in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This treatment stimulated CREB3L1 cleavage even in the absence of doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results suggest that doxorubicin-induced synthesis of ceramide leads to cleavage of CREB3L1. Thus, CREB3L1 appears to suppress cell proliferation in response to accumulation of ceramide. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that knockdown of CREB3L1 in Huh7 cells completely abolished the ability of C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide to inhibit cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study establishes a crucial role for CREB3L1 in inhibiting cell proliferation in response to doxorubicin. We show that the sensitivity of cellular response to doxorubicin is positively correlated to CREB3L1 expression in cancer cells. Importantly, the concentration of doxorubicin required to proteolytically activate CREB3L1 is within clinically relevant concentration ranges found in the serum of patients treated with the drug (&lt;1 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gewirtz, 1999</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that the clinical response to doxorubicin may be determined by the level of CREB3L1 produced in tumor cells. Thus, measuring CREB3L1 expression in tumor cells may be useful in identifying cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from doxorubicin treatment. However, this hypothesis is difficult to test with the currently available clinical data. This is because most cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy regime containing doxorubicin but not doxorubicin alone. Thus, even if the patients respond to the treatment, it is difficult to discern whether they respond to doxorubicin or other anti-cancer drugs in the regime. A clinical study using doxorubicin alone to treat tumors that express high amount of CREB3L1 will be required to determine whether CREB3L1 expression can be used as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome of doxorubicin.</p><p>An important finding in the current study is that doxorubicin-induced accumulation of ceramide is required for cleavage of CREB3L1. This is the second example of a transcription factor whose proteolytic activation is regulated by a lipid synthesized in the ER. The first such example is SREBP-2, a transcription factor that regulates cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). When ER cholesterol content is less than 4% of total lipid, SREBP-2 are transported from the ER to Golgi complex where it is cleaved by S1P and S2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeBose-Boyd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). These cleavages liberate the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of SREBP-2 from membranes, allowing it to enter the nucleus where it activates all genes required for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horton et al., 2003</xref>). When ER cholesterol content exceeds 8% of total lipid, SREBP-2 is retained in the ER so that it is separated from S1P and S2P that are localized in the Golgi complex. Consequently, cleavage of SREBP-2 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nohturfft et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). If the mechanism through which ceramide regulates cleavage of CREB3L1 is similar to that employed by cholesterol to regulate cleavage of SREBP-2, then excessive ceramide is predicted to trigger the transportation of CREB3L1 from the ER to Golgi complex. Such similarity might also explain why a twofold increase in ceramide is sufficient to induce cleavage of CREB3L1, as ceramide may also function through the same switch-like mechanism used by cholesterol to regulate SREBP-2 cleavage.</p><p>Our current study demonstrates that proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 is required for doxorubicin to induce expression of <italic>p21</italic>. However, expression of <italic>p21</italic> alone may not be sufficient to suppress cell proliferation. We have shown previously that CREB3L1 induces transcription of multiple genes that suppress cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denard et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, CREB3L1 may function similar to p53 as a master regulator of cell proliferation. It was reported previously that doxorubicin inhibited cell proliferation through both p53 dependent and independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lupi et al., 2007</xref>). Since CREB3L1 is able to inhibit proliferation of doxorubicin-treated Huh7 cells in which p53 is inactivated by mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hsu et al., 1993</xref>), CREB3L1-mediated pathway is likely to be p53-independent. Most cancer cells are thought to originate from genome damage. Since p53 is activated in response to genome damage to inhibit cell proliferation, the protein is frequently inactivated by mutations in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Levine et al., 1991</xref>). Unlike p53, CREB3L1 is activated by ceramide or ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murakami et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2009</xref>) but not genome damage. Owing to the lack of selection pressure against expression of CREB3L1, most cancer cells may still express functional CREB3L1. This may be the reason why doxorubicin is effective against many varieties of cancers. Thus, more effective chemotherapeutic reagents against cancers may be generated by development of compounds that specifically activate CREB3L1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>We obtained rabbit anti-LSD1 from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA); mouse anti-calnexin from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY); mouse anti-γH2AX from Millipore (Billerica, MA); rabbit anti-Actin and anti-p21 from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA); Doxorubicin (Cat# D1515-10MG), bleomycin, etoposide, paclitaxel and N-Hexanoyl-D-sphingosine (C<sub>6</sub>-Ceramide) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); Myriocin and fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> from EMD Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany); and [<sup>14</sup>C]palmitate (55 mCi/mmol) from ARC (St. Louis, MO).

The authors show that Doxorubicin causes CREB3L1 activation (by cleavage) and increased expression of two CREB3L1 target genes (p21 and Collagen1A1). The authors conclude that the cytostatic effects of Doxorubicin are mediated – at least in part – by CREB3L1. This is an important finding. However, there are some weaknesses in this study.</p><p>1) The mechanism of Doxorubicin action on CREB3L1 is unclear. The authors indicate that this is mediated by increased de novo ceramide synthesis. Evidence in favor of this hypothesis is derived from the finding that Doxorubicin causes increased ceramide synthesis (although the authors do not refer to previous literature that has already established this finding). To test the role of ceramide, the authors present two experiments. First, the drug myriocin is used to block serine palmitoyltransferase, the first step in ceramide biosynthesis. Possible off-target effects of this drug are not considered and no alternative approach is employed to confirm the finding presented. Second, the short chain C6-ceramide is employed as a ceramide mimetic, but it is not clear whether this toxic molecule acts as a mimetic for natural long chain ceramide.</p><p>2) If de novo ceramide biosynthesis is a key aspect of the cytostatic effects of Doxorubicin, the absence of a defined mechanism that accounts for effects of Doxorubicin on ceramide synthesis represents a weakness of the mechanistic aspects of this study. Moreover, the authors do not establish how ceramide causes proteolytic activation of CREB3L1.</p><p>3) The authors show that Doxorubicin, but not etoposide, causes proteolytic activation of CREB3L1. The authors also show that Doxorubicin causes de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the authors do not examine the effects of etoposide on ceramide.</p><p>4) The shRNA studies are based on the use of a single shRNA and the analysis of a single clone of cells that expresses the shRNA. Controls are needed for off-target effects of shRNA (i.e., the use of more than one shRNA and rescue studies) and clonal variation in isolated cell colonies.</p><p>5) The relevance of p53 status to the findings reported is unclear. Is CREB3L1-induced growth arrest independent of p53?</p><p>6) The authors propose that CREB3L1 expression might correlate with Doxorubicin sensitivity of tumors. The study would be strengthened by providing data or analysis of existing data to directly answer this question.</p><p>[Editors' note: in discussions with the authors after the decision, the editors agreed that the requirement for an additional line of investigation to uncover the mechanism by which doxorubicin elevates ceramide and exactly how ceramide works to bring about proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 was not necessary to publish the original observations on the target of drug action (concern #2). Comment #6 was also felt to be a minor concern and the authors were asked to address this using Oncomine data if it existed.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00090.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Thank you very much for your evaluation of our manuscript. The constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. We revised our manuscript according to your suggestions. We hope that the revised manuscript is now suitable for publication. The detailed revision is listed as follows.</p><p><italic>1. The authors need additional evidence that the effects of doxorubicin are mediated through an increase in ceramide levels before this can be published</italic>.</p><p>We now include three more experiments to show that doxorubicin stimulates CREB3L1 cleavage through increased synthesis of ceramide. In addition to the radiolabeling experiment presented in the original manuscript, we used mass spectroscopic analysis to demonstrate that doxorubicin increased intracellular amounts of ceramide. This new result is presented in Figure 6B. We also show that treatment with fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, also blocked doxorubicin-induced cleavage of CREB3L1. This result is presented in Figure 7C. The observations that two inhibitors (myriosin and fumonisin B1) targeting two different enzymes involved in ceramide synthesis were both effective in inhibiting doxorubicin-induced cleavage of CREB3L1 strongly suggest that increased ceramide synthesis led to this cleavage.</p><p>Finally, through mass spectroscopic analysis, we show that treatment with C6-ceramide increased nearly all species of naturally existing ceramide in cells. This result is presented in Figure 7D. This observation confirms earlier reports that C6-ceramide functions through increasing intracellular amount of naturally existing ceramide, as opposed to acting as a mimetic for natural long chain ceramide.</p><p>[Comment 2 no longer applies.]</p><p><italic>3. The authors do not examine the effects of etoposide on ceramide</italic>.</p><p>We now show that etoposide failed to induce ceramide synthesis at a concentration at which cell proliferation was inhibited. This result is presented in Figure 6C.</p><p><italic>4. The shRNA studies are based on the use of a single shRNA</italic>.</p><p>For reasons that we do not understand, after screening for nearly 100 clones of Huh7 cells transfected with four different shRNA targeting CREB3L1, we only obtain a single clone of the cells in which CREB3L1 is consistently knocked down by more than 90%. We were unable to perform the rescue study because overexpression of CREB3L1 led to constitutive cleavage of the protein that blocked proliferation of Huh7 cells even in the absence of doxorubicin. We thus knocked down CREB3L1 by transiently transfecting cells with two distinct siRNA targeting CREB3L1 at regions different from that targeted by the shRNA. Transfection of these siRNA also made Huh7 cells more resistant to doxorubicin. These new results, which are presented in Figures 3D and 3E should rule out the off target effect of the shRNA.</p><p><italic>5. The relevance of p53 status to the findings reported is unclear</italic>.</p><p>Our finding that CREB3L1 is able to inhibit proliferation of Huh7 cells in which p53 is inactivated by mutations indicates that CREB3L1-mediated pathway is p53 independent.</p><p>This point is discussed in more detail in the revised manuscript. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform the experiment suggested by the Senior Editor because doxorubicin-triggered CREB3L1-dependent responses only occur at low concentrations of doxorubicin that do not result in cell apoptosis.</p><p><italic>6. Inclusion of Oncomine data</italic>.</p><p>We already discussed the reason why we were unable to obtain patient-related data from the database in our original manuscript. The database does allow comparison in gene expression profiles between cultured cancer cells that are doxorubicin resistant and those that are doxorubicin sensitive. However, the concentrations of doxorubicin used in the studies were not described. Traditionally, these analyses were performed with doxorubicin at μM ranges to study the function of multidrug resistance gene. At these high concentrations, doxorubicin induces cellular toxicity independent of CREB3L1.</p><p>Thus, such comparison does not generate useful data for us to determine the role of CREB3L1 in doxorubicin-mediated suppression of cell proliferation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
