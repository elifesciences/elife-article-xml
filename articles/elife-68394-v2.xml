Also, mitochondrial fission and its opposing process of mitochondrial fusion are emerging as crucial regulators of stemness. Intriguingly, stem/progenitor cells maintaining repressed mitochondrial fission are primed for self-renewal and proliferation. Using our newly derived carcinogen transformed human cell model, we demonstrate that fine-tuned Drp1 repression primes a slow cycling ‘stem/progenitor-like state’, which is characterized by small networks of fused mitochondria and a gene-expression profile with elevated functional stem/progenitor markers (Krt15, Sox2 etc) and their regulators (Cyclin E). Fine tuning Drp1 protein by reducing its activating phosphorylation sustains the neoplastic stem/progenitor cell markers. Whereas, fine-tuned reduction of Drp1 protein maintains the characteristic mitochondrial shape and gene-expression of the primed ‘stem/progenitor-like state’ to accelerate neoplastic transformation, and more complete reduction of Drp1 protein prevents it. Therefore, our data highlights a ‘goldilocks’ level of Drp1 repression supporting stem/progenitor state dependent neoplastic transformation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial fission</kwd><kwd>Drp1</kwd><kwd>stem/progenitor state</kwd><kwd>keratinocytes</kwd><kwd>neoplastic transformation</kwd><kwd>single cell confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>single cell transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33ES025662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>Kasturi</given-names></name><name><surname>Spurlock</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name><name><surname>Moran</surname><given-names>Aida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AR048311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shanrun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AI027667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shanrun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mitochondria-based 'priming' of stemness happens by fine-tuned repression of the level or activity of the master regulator of mitochondrial fission, Drp1, which supports carcinogen-induced transformation in a keratinocyte model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The plasticity of the state of stemness is modulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Folmes et al., 2012</xref>; ). Involvement of mitochondria in the regulation of the stem cell state is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lisowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The master regulators of mitochondrial fission and fusion processes are emerging as crucial regulators of both embryonic and adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lisowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spurlock et al., 2020</xref>). The Dynamin Related Protein 1 (Drp1) is the master regulator of mitochondrial fission that breaks larger mitochondria into smaller elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kageyama et al., 2011</xref>). The effects of Drp1-driven mitochondrial fission is opposed by fusion between mitochondria driven by the Mitofusins and Opa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Chan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoppins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schrepfer and Scorrano, 2016</xref>). Therefore, Drp1 repression allows unopposed mitochondrial fusion, and complete Drp1 repression sustains a hyperfused mitochondrial state. Enhanced mitochondrial fusion sustains stemness of certain adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khacho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senos Demarco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Particularly, repression of Drp1 supports stemness and repression of Mitofusin or Opa1 inactivates stemness in adult mouse neural lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>). The other extreme state, that is unopposed mitochondrial fission, is critical for achieving pluripotency of stem cells during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prieto et al., 2016</xref>). However, sustained mitochondrial fission reduces pluripotency of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we speculate that a balance of timely fission and fusion of mitochondria may be critical for maintaining stem cell states.</p><p>In various tumors, the bulk tumor cell populations are maintained by the adult neoplastic stem cells (also called tumor initiating cells) as they self-renew, proliferate and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magee et al., 2012</xref>). Drp1 has been linked to tumor formation in various cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagdas and Kashatus, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serasinghe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanwar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsuyoshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 2015</xref>). Drp1 activation sustains neoplastic stem cells at least in the astrocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 2015</xref>), and genetic ablation of Drp1 prevents neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serasinghe et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, an elevated mitochondrial fusion state, sustained by mitofusin, can drive immortalization of neoplastic stem cells to support tumorigenesis in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>). Using analyses of single cells, we reported that neoplastic ovarian cells with minimum mitochondrial fission are found within a (Aldh marked) neoplastic stem cell sub-population that has &gt;10-fold higher self-renewal and proliferation ability compared to the other (Aldh marked) neoplastic stem cell sub-population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spurlock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spurlock et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we proposed, that a repressed mitochondrial fission state may prime neoplastic stem cells toward maximizing their potential of self-renewal and proliferation. Similar priming was demonstrated in a hematopoietic stem cell subpopulation that maintains Drp1 repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the causative role of repression of Drp1-driven mitochondrial fission in mitochondria driven priming of a stem/progenitor-like like state in skin cells that serve as an excellent model for adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs, 2016</xref>). We established a transformed skin keratinocyte model that sustains abundant self-renewing/proliferating cells with robust repression of Drp1 activity in comparison to the core regulators of mitochondrial fusion. Using single-cell analyses and genetic perturbation strategies we demonstrate for the first time that a ‘goldilocks’ level of Drp1 repression maintains smaller fused mitochondrial network and a characteristic gene expression profile to support stem/progenitor-like state-dependent neoplastic transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of a mild carcinogen transformed keratinocyte model that maintains fine-tuned repression of Drp1, smaller fused mitochondria and abundant self-renewing/proliferating cells</title><p>Neoplastic transformation can be modeled using chemical carcinogens like 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on skin tissue or the keratinocyte HaCaT cell line carrying non-functional p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boelsma et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Der Vartanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray and Swanson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schoop et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wincent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">St John et al., 2000</xref>). Given Drp1 repression increases cell proliferation in the absence of active p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>), the HaCaT cell model provides the appropriate cellular context for our study involving Drp1. Here, we used both mild and strong dose of TCDD to uncover any mitochondria-based priming of stemness during TCDD driven neoplastic transformation. Exposure to milder (T-1nM) and stronger (T-10nM) doses of TCDD increases cell proliferation of HaCaT cells comparably in a standard transformation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Even in the absence of TCDD, the transformed colonies of TCDD-1nM (TF-1) and TCDD-10nM (TF-10) maintain comparable upregulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is the primary effector of TCDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leclerc et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulero-Navarro and Fernandez-Salguero, 2016</xref>). Unlike the parental HaCaT cells (Parental), both transformed cells are able to form subcutaneous xenograft tumors, confirming their transformation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, pathological evaluation of H&amp;E stained tumor sections revealed that the TF-1 cells gave rise to malignant tumors harboring less differentiated (primitive) squamous cells with large nuclei (blue) and little visible cytoplasm (pink) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). Whereas the TF-10 cells formed tumors harboring differentiated stratified squamous epithelium with cells having expansion of cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right); the clear gaps represent cryo-sectioning artifacts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of a mild carcinogen transformed keratinocyte model that maintains abundant self-renewing/proliferating cells and repressed Drp1 activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell proliferation assay (quantified by crystal violet staining) after 4 or 16 days exposure to TCDD (1 or 10 nM) or Toluene (10 nM) vehicle control.

In the transformed cells, the activity of the elevated Drp1 protein (pDrp1-S616/ Drp1) is suppressed by ~10-fold by lowering its cell cycle driven activating phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Such repression of Drp1-driven mitochondrial fission is expected to allow unopposed mitochondrial fusion towards sustaining elevated mitochondrial matrix continuity. Indeed, the transformed cells maintain increased mitochondrial matrix continuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), assessed by live cell pulse chase assay in cells stably expressing photoconvertible mitochondrial reporter mito-PSmO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spurlock et al., 2019</xref>). Unexpectedly, TF-1 cells with twofold less Drp1 activity than TF-10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) still maintain lower mitochondrial matrix continuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), the cause of which was not apparent from subjective examination of mitochondrial shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, we performed quantitative assessment of mitochondrial shape that is determined by the opposing mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. We used our previously designed mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion5] metrics that quantify the contribution (but not kinetics) of fission/fusion to the steady state mitochondrial shape in live cells, which were validated using Drp1 or mitofusin knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spurlock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spurlock and Mitra, 2021</xref>).Also, bivariate analyses of the inversely related [Fission] and [Fusion5] metrics could reveal specific heterogeneity in mitochondrial shape in (FACS sorted) mitochondria primed ovarian neoplastic stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spurlock et al., 2021</xref>). Here, bivariate analyses of the [Fission] and [Fusion5] metrics revealed that the reduced mitochondrial matrix continuity in TF-1 cells is due to maximum enrichment of a cellular subpopulation with moderately reduced [Fusion5] (40–80), moderately elevated [Fission] (0.15–0.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, Int), and weakened [Fission] vs [Fusion5] inverse correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, increased scatter around the regression line). The enrichment of this intermediate fission/fusion subpopulation was accompanied by a proportional reduction of the subpopulation with hyperfused mitochondria ([Fusion5] &gt; 80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spurlock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, HF). Notably, despite maintaining higher mitochondrial matrix continuity than the Parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), TF-1 population has lowest abundance of cells where the longest mitochondrial element contains &gt;80% of the total mitochondrial length ([Fusion1] &gt; 80) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data together suggest that the enriched subpopulation of TF-1 cells maintains smaller fused mitochondrial elements. These mitochondrial structural properties in the TF-1 cells are associated with overall lowering of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in comparison to Parental or the TF-10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, the mitochondrial potential per unit mitochondrial mass in individual cells is regulated over a wider range in TF-1 cells, while it is lowest in TF-10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) likely due to their elevated mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The TF-1 cells have significantly higher in vitro cell proliferation rate and form markedly larger spheroids in conditions that support self-renewal and proliferation, in comparison to those formed by Parental or TF-10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). More importantly, ELDA statistics applied on spheroid formation assay for determination of in vitro stem cell frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu and Smyth, 2009</xref> demonstrated that both the transformed populations have one order higher abundance of self-renewing/proliferating cells compared to the Parental, while TF-1 has double the abundance than TF-10 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>The above data confirms the derivation of a transformed TF-1 keratinocyte model characterized by the following properties: (a) fine-tuned repression of Drp1 activity by reduction of S616 phosphorylation of the elevated Drp1 protein level; (b) enrichment of a subpopulation of cells maintaining smaller fused mitochondrial networks; (c) enrichment of self-renewing/proliferating neoplastic cells capable of forming less differentiated primitive tumors.

GSEA showed upregulation of genes in ‘Mitosis and Relevant Cytoskeletal Proteins’ in Cluster 2 and that of genes in ‘DNA repair/replication and Histones’ in Cluster 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); Cluster 1 has downregulation of “Histones and Ubiquitin related’ genes. Indeed, the mitotic Cyclin B (<italic>CCNB1</italic>) and its partner kinase <italic>CDK1</italic>, as well as Cyclin A (<italic>CCNA2</italic>) are markedly higher in Cluster 2-G2-M, while <italic>PCNA</italic>, which peaks early in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maga and Hubscher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerjatke et al., 2017</xref>) is highest in Cluster 0-S-Histone-hi in all three-cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); the S phase cyclins E1/E2 and their partner <italic>CDK2</italic> were not detected in our scRNA-seq data set. Surprisingly, <italic>KRT15</italic> marked Cluster 3 has dramatic downregulation of genes in ‘Overall Cell Cycle’ and in cell cycle phase categories described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting their cell cycling is slow. Cluster 3-SloCycl-K15-hi maintains extreme low levels of major cyclins in all three-cell populations, most prominently in TF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). PCNA, which is dramatically reduced in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maga and Hubscher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerjatke et al., 2017</xref>), is markedly reduced in the SloCycl-K15-hi cluster (and others) only in the TF-1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). SloCycl-K15-hi has upregulation of genes involved in ‘Keratin’ and ‘Signaling’ pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, the Notch pathway target, <italic>HES1</italic>, which actively maintains quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moriyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sang et al., 2008</xref>), is upregulated across the clusters in the TF-1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data strongly suggest that the enrichment of the SloCycl-K15-hi cluster in the TF-1 population happens due to active maintenance of quiescence, rendering them slow cycling. Cluster four does not relate to cell cycle and shows upregulation of genes related to ‘Cytokine’ (interferons) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), many of which are suppressed by AHR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This finding is consistent with our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>. The downregulated mtDNA genes in Cluster 5 were identified as ‘TCA cycle’ and ‘Complex one biogenesis’ in our overrepresentation analyses (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but not detected in GSEA. Towards understanding the entry into the slow cycling state of the K15hi-Cluster 3, we performed trajectory analyses using Slingshot algorithm that identifies clusters related to each other based on their gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Street et al., 2018</xref>). The output trajectory was the following: ‘G2-M’ to ‘S-Histones-hi’ to ‘Cytokine’ to ‘Histones/Ub-lo’ bifurcating into ‘SloCycl-K15-hi’ or ‘mtDNA-lo’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, open arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This implies that the cells in the TF-1 population may preferentially reside in the SloCycl-K15-hi cluster and not in the mtDNA-lo cluster, thus expanding the former and reducing the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the cell cycle pathway findings from GSEA, we quantified cell cycle scores and distribution in each cluster using a Seurat algorithm that employs several validated predictive cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>). This showed that the TF-1 population has lower S score than the Parental and the TF-10 populations, while G2-M scores were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, Cluster 2 is abundant in G2-M cells, Cluster 0 (and 1) in S and <italic>KRT15</italic> marked Cluster 3 is in G0/G1 (expected for quiescent/slow-cycling cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). This data taken with the lower levels of Histone transcripts in Cluster 1 than in Cluster 0 (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) suggest that Cluster 0 may be in early S phase while Cluster 1 in late S phase. We noted that the expanded 3-SloCycl-K15-hi cluster in the TF-1 population has significantly more cells in G0/G1 and less cells in S than the other two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, arrows), which is opposite to the reduced 5-mtDNA-lo cluster in the TF-1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, arrows). This G1 to S reciprocity between Cluster 3 and 5 (quantified from the distributions as in Materials and methods) is &gt;5 fold in the TF-1 population with respect to the Parental and TF-10 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, inset). This suggests that altered cell cycle regulation in the TF-1 population may allow them to preferentially reside in the 3-SloCycl-K15-hi cluster and not in the 5-mtDNA-lo cluster. Such a regulation may involve attenuation of CDK1-driven Drp1(S616) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) due to marked reduction of <italic>CCNB1/CDK1</italic> particularly in the TF-1 population in late S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), where decision for expansion of the slow cycling <italic>KRT15</italic>-hi cluster is likely made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Thus, detailed scRNA-seq characterization reveals that our newly derived Drp1-repressed-TF-1 keratinocyte population, enriched with neoplastic stem/progenitor cells, maintains an expanded sub-population of slow cycling cells expressing high levels of stem/progenitor markers (lineage specific: <italic>KRT15</italic>; general: <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX4</italic>), likely due to altered cell cycle regulation.

Sox2 expression is under the influence of various G1 cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), including Cyclin E whose degradation is regulated by mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2015</xref>).Particularly, Drp1 repression elevates Cyclin E levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spurlock et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, among the major cyclins, Cyclin E1 levels are particularly higher in the Sox2 enriched Drp1 repressed TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); Cyclin D is particularly higher in TF-10 cells when compared to the Parental (corroborating scRNA-seq data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, Cyclin E1 is preferentially accumulated in the nucleus in TF-1 cells, which is required to impact gene expression of Sox2 (and others) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). The level of CDK2-driven pCyclinE(T-62) reflects the level of CDK2 bound Cyclin E that is susceptible to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siu et al., 2012</xref>). Immunostaining based co-expression analyses showed that elevated Sox2 is sustained in ~38% of the TF1 population that sustain lower pCyclinE(T-62) as opposed to ~2% in the Parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Moreover, a cycloheximide chase assay, for assessing protein degradation rate, revealed no Cyclin E degradation in TF-1 cells within the 2-hr assay time frame in comparison to marked Cyclin E degradation in Parental; both populations maintain Tom20 (mitochondrial marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, our data is consistent with elevated Sox2 in TF-1 cells being sustained by elevated Cyclin E levels achieved by attenuation of its degradation kinetics, which can be potentially impacted by Drp1 repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated if repression of Drp1-S616 phosphorylation maintains Sox2 expression since highest levels of Sox2 is expressed in the cells with reduced pDrp1-S616 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To this end, we stably overexpressed the phospho-deficient Drp1-S616A mutant and the Drp1-WT control in the Parental and TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serasinghe et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed in the Parental cells, Drp1-S616A overexpression maintains markedly reduced pDrp1-S616 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and has attenuated ability of elevating mitochondrial [Fission] and lowering [Fusion5/1] in comparison to the Drp1-WT overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the other hand in the TF-1 cells with already reduced basal pDrp1-S616 levels, Drp1-S616A overexpression modestly reduces pDrp1-S616 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and prevents the paradoxical increase in [Fusion5/1] observed with Drp1-WT overexpression while both do not impact [Fission] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This paradox can be explained if specific Drp1 regulators unnaturally sequester Drp1 to allow unopposed mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, this data suggests that the characteristic reduced [Fusion5/1] in the TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) is maintained by preventing S616 phosphorylation of their elevated Drp1 protein levels. More importantly, the Drp1-S616A expressing TF1 cells maintains ~5 fold higher abundance of Sox2<sup>hi</sup> subpopulations (irrespective of their Krt15 levels) than Drp1-WT expressing TF1 cells that maintain higher abundance of Krt15<sup>lo</sup>-Sox2<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Also, Drp1-S616A expressing TF-1 cells maintain markedly lower mitochondrial membrane potential in comparison to the Drp1-WT expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), suggesting lower mitochondrial potential in the TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) is maintained by lowering pDrp1-S616 levels. Notably, such impact of Drp1-S616A expression on Sox2 or mitochondrial potential is not observed in the Parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>), which maintain higher pDrp1-S616 levels and mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). Thus, repression of pDrp1-S616 results in altered mitochondrial potential and higher abundance of the Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup> sub-population in the TF-1 but not in the Parental population.</p><p>Therefore, our data demonstrates that the neoplastic stem/progenitor cell enriched TF-1 population, with elevated nuclear Cyclin E, maintains a [Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup>] sub-population that is sustained by fine-tuning Drp1 by reducing its S-616 phosphorylation. Cell-cycle-dependent reduction of Cyclin B1/CDK1 levels in the TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) likely reduces their Drp1-S616 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taguchi et al., 2007</xref>), which in turn maintains less fused mitochondria and modulates mitochondrial membrane potential to elevate Sox2 levels. It remains to be seen how regulation of pDrp1-S616 impacts Cyclin E toward maintaining elevated Sox2, although Drp1 regulation appears to enhance Cyclin E levels particularly in mitotic TF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Our data also reveal differences in the impact of Drp1 regulation between the non-transformed Parental and its transformed TF-1 counterpart, which warrants further detailed investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Fine-tuned Drp1 repression by reducing its protein levels sustains a [CyclinE<sup>hi</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup>] state and accelerates carcinogen driven neoplastic transformation, which is suppressed by more complete Drp1 repression</title><p>Given Drp1-S616A mutant does not elevate Sox2 or Krt15 in the non-transformed Parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), we hypothesized that reduction of their Drp1 protein levels allows expression of the stem/progenitor cell markers as noted in Drp1 knockout cells of other cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, we exposed control and Drp1 knockdown Parental keratinocytes to 1 and 10 nM TCDD following standard TCDD driven transformation protocol (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the weaker Drp1 knockdown, which maintains remnant Drp1 protein and a CyclinE<sup>hi</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup> state, was transformed by 10 nM TCDD even earlier than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); 1 nM TCDD did not cause any transformation at this time point. This happened despite their lower cell proliferation rate than the control in the earlier time point. On the other hand, the stronger Drp1 knockdown, which also maintained slower cell proliferation rate and a Krt15<sup>lo</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup> status with elevated nuclear Cyclin E, is not transformed in the same time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, in case of lowered knockdown efficacy, both the weak (W-L) and strong (S-L) Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) increase abundance of self-renewing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and initiate TCCD-driven neoplastic transformation at the earlier time point when control knockdown cells do not exhibit any neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>); this difference between control and the low efficacy Drp1 knockdown does not sustain in the later time point.

We speculate that the inability to sustain this primed stem-like state may prevent neoplastic transformation in Drp1 knockout MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serasinghe et al., 2015</xref>). Plotting the accelerated transformation efficacy with remnant Drp1 levels after knockdown predicts ~50 % reduction of Drp1 protein may maximally accelerate transformation within the experimental range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (remnant Drp1 levels may remain overestimated due to the reduction of the Actin control with Drp1 knockdown, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Fine-tuned Drp1 repression maintains smaller fused mitochondria and transcriptomic profile characteristic of the neoplastic stem/progentior cell enriched TF-1 population, which is suppressed by more complete Drp1 repression</title><p>Toward understanding how the ‘stem/progenitor-like state’ is primed by fine-tuned (incomplete) Drp1 repression, we performed detailed comparison of mitochondrial shape (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and over all gene expression (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) between the Parental keratinocytes expressing control, weak or strong <italic>DNM1L</italic> shRNAs. Bivariate analyses of the inversely related mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion5] metrics confirmed that the stronger (more complete) Drp1 knockdown maintains ~77% cells in the uniformly hyperfused state while the control knockdown population maintains ~55% cells in this state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, HF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, similar to the neoplastic stem/progenitor cells enriched Drp1 repressed TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the ~10-fold weaker Drp1 knockdown maintains only ~38% cells in the uniformly hyperfused state, while enriching a sub-population of cells (~45%) with moderately increased [Fission] and moderately decreased [Fusion5] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, Int). Subjective examination revealed that cells in the enriched sub-population (Int, Fission: 0.15–0.4 and Fusion5: 40–80) harbor some mitochondrial fragments in the midst of tubular mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also found that the cells in this sub-population have lower mitochondrial number and total mitochondrial length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), signifying decrease in mitochondrial content. Also, similar to the TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), ~ 7% of cells in the weaker Drp1 knockdown have the longest mitochondrial element containing &gt;80% of the total mitochondrial length ([Fusion1] &gt; 80), compared to ~40% in the stronger Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This indicates that the increase in mitochondrial number is due to a greater number of smaller networks of fused mitochondria, consistent with findings in TF-1 cells. Moreover, bivariate [Fission] vs [Fusion1] plot revealed that the cells with fission range of 0.15–0.4, enriched in the weaker Drp1 knockdown and TF-1 cells, have only up to 40% of the mitochondrial lengths in fused networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, bottom). Given Drp1-WT overexpression in the Parental cells expectedly increases [Fission] and reduces [Fusion] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), our data suggest that the remnant Drp1-driven mitochondrial fission after fine-tuned Drp1 repression prevents mitochondrial hyperfusion to maintain smaller fused mitochondria (with reduced mitochondrial content), towards sustaining a [CyclinE<sup>hi</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup>] state. However, Drp1 overexpression by itself does not support Sox2hi/Krt15hi state in Parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) as does weaker repression of Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting Drp1 needs to be repressed to support expression of stem cell markers and then further activated. Indeed, Aldh marked neoplastic ovarian stem cells with repressed [Fission] converts to a state of elevated mitochondrial [Fission] when self-renewal and proliferation is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spurlock et al., 2019</xref>), which may be triggered to support mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Twig and Shirihai, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To probe the contribution of gene expression of any particular cell population in sustaining a stem/progenitor-like state after fine-tuned Drp1 repression, we performed scRNA-seq of the control and Drp1 knockdown Parental populations. Analyses of the overall gene expression (within the limits of gene coverage) confirmed that the weaker Drp1 knockdown, which maintains higher transcript levels of <italic>DNM1L</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and ~10-fold higher protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), modulates a smaller gene set to a smaller degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, graded Drp1 knockdown has both ‘similar’ (graded upregulation or downregulation) and ‘opposite’ effects (upregulation in one and downregulation in the other) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The opposite effect is dominated by <italic>KRT15</italic>, <italic>KRT13</italic>, <italic>KRT4</italic>, <italic>KRT5</italic> transcripts being upregulated in the weaker Drp1 knockdown and downregulated in the stronger Drp1 knockdown (color coded * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), corroborating our findings on Krt15 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). On the other hand, genes for various mitochondrial proteins, involved in mitochondrial energetics, redox or biogenesis, were upregulated particularly in the stronger Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> upper panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> (bold), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This is consistent with our observation of decreased mitochondrial content in the weaker Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Synthesis of the mitochondrial proteins can be potentially sustained by elevated ribosomal genes and genes involved in protein synthesis in the stronger Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lower panel).

Strikingly, the weaker Drp1-knockdown population exhibits expansion of the SloCycl-K15-hi cluster and reduction of the Cytokine and mtDNA-lo clusters observed in the stem/progenitor cell enriched Drp1-repressed-TF-1 population<bold>,</bold> albeit to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This similarity in cluster organization suggests that fine-tuned Drp1 repression in Parental population establishes a stem/progenitor cell-like gene expression profile to poise them for accelerated neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, the stronger Drp1 knockdown markedly reduces the abundance of the SloCycl-K15-hi cluster and exhibits overall opposite trend of cluster profile compared to the weaker Drp1 knockdown and TF-1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). <italic>KRT15</italic> and various other marker Keratin genes are dramatically suppressed across the clusters in the stronger Drp1 knockdown and overall elevated in the weaker Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), confirming and expanding our findings on Krt15 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, analyses of cell cycle distribution (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) revealed higher G2-M score, reduced S score and perturbed G1 to S reciprocity between SloCycl-K15-hi and the mtDNA-lo clusters particularly in the stronger Drp1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The dramatic reduction of the SloCycl-K15-hi cluster in the stronger Drp1 knockdown cells could be due to their inability of exiting the elevated CyclinB1/CDK1-driven G2-M regulation in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, left). Also, the stronger Drp1 knockdown maintained marked elevation of the growth factor cyclin, Cyclin D2 and reduction of the S phase marker, PCNA, across clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, right); Cyclin E1 and Sox2 transcripts were not detected in this data set. Therefore, our data demonstrates that particularly fine-tuned Drp1 repression sustains a gene expression profile characteristic of the neoplastic stem/progenitor cell enriched Drp1-repressed-[CyclinE<sup>hi</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup>]-TF-1 population, which is prevented by more complete Drp1 repression that induces cell cycle disturbances.</p><p>Taken together, single-cell analyses of stem/progenitor cell regulators (using immunocytochemistry and transcriptomics) and mitochondrial shape (using quantitative [Fission]/[Fusion] metrics) of our newly derived transformed keratinocyte model reveal that a slow cycling ‘stem/progenitor-like [CyclinE<sup>hi</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup>] state’ is primed by a ‘goldilocks’ level of fine-tuned Drp1 repression (Drp1<sup>ftr</sup>) that maintains small networks of fused mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The stem/progenitor state driven neoplastic transformation is accelerated by fine-tuned Drp1 repression maintained by reduced Drp1 protein levels, while the neoplastic stem/progenitor state is sustained by fine-tuning Drp1 by reducing its S-616 phosphorylation that modulates mitochondrial potential. Given the bidirectional crosstalk of mitochondrial dynamics and redox status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Willems et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that fine-tuned Drp1 repression driven stem/progenitor cell priming may involve sustaining their nuanced redox environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>). The Drp1 repression-driven CyclinE<sup>hi</sup> state may allow rapid transition from quiescence to a self-renewing/proliferation state to support neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Velthoven and Rando, 2019</xref>), given Cyclin E is indispensable for exiting quiescence or for neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang and Clurman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teixeira and Reed, 2017</xref>).

This conceptualization helps explain how regulated reduction and increase of Drp1 activity can potentially maintain adult stem cell properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iwata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khacho and Slack, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xie et al., 2015</xref>). Further in vivo validation of our findings would reveal if and how bodily stresses causing mild repression of Drp1-driven mitochondrial fission can possibly sustain the mitochondria primed ‘stem/progenitor-like state’ in tissues making them susceptible to neoplastic transformation by chemicals and/or genetic changes. Enhanced mitochondrial fusion, proposed as a required event of neoplastic transformation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>), may also involve such mitochondria-driven priming.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Thereafter, we performed the second experiment with eight animals per group, as determined based on various prior publication by our group and others. Our data includes both experiments. Five million transformed HaCaT cells were injected subcutaneously in the flank of athymic nude mice to form xenograft tumors. Prior to injection, cells were trypsinized and washed once with sterile PBS, and finally resuspended to 25,000 cells/µL in room temperature PBS with Geltrex. Tumors arising within 6–8 months were harvested for histochemical analyses. The harvested tumors were frozen unfixed in TissueTek OCT compound on dry-ice.

The 3’-biased cDNA libraries were constructed through the following steps: cDNA fragmentation, end repair and A-tailing, and size selection by SPRIselect beads, adaptor ligation, and sample index PCR amplification, and then SPRIselect beads size selection again. The final constructed 3’-biased single-cell libraries were sequenced by Illumina Nextseq500 machine, targeting total reads per cell for 20,000 at minimum, and the sequencing cycles consisted of 28 bp for read 1, 90 bp for read 2, and 10 bp for i7 index, and 10 bp for i5 index.</p><p>Count matrices were generated from the single-cell raw fastq files using 10 x genomics <italic>cellranger</italic> software (v.4.0) using hg38 reference genome provided by 10 x Genomics. Raw, analyzed and meta data are available in Gene expression omnibus (GEO GSE171772). We filtered the data to only include cells expressing at least 2000 detectable genes (using ‘nFeature_RNA’ filter); this also filtered out dead cells with &gt;10% mt-DNA gene expression in our data set. Our data coverage included approximately ~3000 genes in average of 5000 cells in each population. The resulting count matrices were analyzed by Seurat package (v3.9.9) with the standard workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). After applying the (<italic>nFeature_RNA</italic> &gt;2000), the expression data were then normalized using the <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function in Seurat and variable featuresets were identified using the <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> function in Seurat. Depending on the type of comparison, specific sets of samples were combined using the <italic>IntegrateData</italic> function. The integrated datasets were scaled and cells were clustered with up to 20 dimensions (dim = 1:20). We performed clustering using several resolution parameters (0.1–0.8) and visually selected optimal resolution for specific datasets. The clusters were visualized using UMAP with up to 20 dimensions. Marker genes for each cluster were calculated with the <italic>FindAllMarkers</italic> function and statistical significance was calculated by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Differential expression of the cluster markers was carried out using the FindMarkers function of Seurat. For this, we only used the normalized data before integration (assay ‘RNA’) using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, as suggested by Seurat documentation. For cell-cycle scoring, we use the CellCycleScoring function of Seurat, which provides scores of G2M and S phase scores and assigns cell-cycle phases based on G2-M and S scores, or in G1/G0 when both scores are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>). G1 to S reciprocity was obtained as: {% [G1/S] in Cluster 3 / % [G1/S] in Cluster 5}. The cell-lineage determination and trajectory calculation were carried out using the Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Street et al., 2018</xref>) package with Seurat clusters and default parameters. The algorithm was allowed to automatically identify the start and the end clusters. GSEA analyses were performed with ranked log fold change (LFC) of markers ( &gt; 0.1, p &lt; 0.01, FDR q value p &lt; 0.01) using MsigDB as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanwar et al., 2016</xref>.

For the cytochemistry-based dot-plot analyses, the following operations were performed: signal threshold = [Median] + 1.5 X [MAD], where Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is the median of the absolute difference of individual value from the population median. Nonetheless, the reduced quantitative nature of immunocytochemistry studies compared to immunoblotting studies is exemplified in the smaller increase in Sox2 in the TF-1 cells in immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C and G</xref>) in comparison to the ~8-fold increase observed in immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Experiments have been performed multiple times with separate culture sets to serve as biological replicates, sometimes by different personnel to ensure reproducibility.

In majority of the cases, 2 or more technical replicates for each biological replicate have been used with positive and/or negative controls, as appropriate. The key findings of the scRNA-seq data has been validated in multiple independent experiments. The high-resolution confocal micrograph analyses using Mitograph software involve the quality control of manual exclusion of cells where digital images do not match the corresponding confocal micrograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spurlock and Mitra, 2021</xref>). Without this appropriate quality control step the data may remain erroneous.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Prior work hinted at the possibility that mitochondrial fission/fusion activity is important in supporting neoplastic transformation, but it was unclear exactly what this role was. Here, the authors use an assay for neoplastic transformation induced by carcinogen treatment to demonstrate that diminution in mitochondrial fission activity (from increased phosphorylated Drp1 pools) can prime a stem/progenitor-like state in carcinogen-treated cells, leading to accelerated neoplastic transformation. Using genetic strategies and single cell RNAseq they additionally show that only partial repression of Drp1 is necessary for establishing the stem/progenitor-like state for driving neoplastic transformation, with too much or too little Drp1 repression having no effect. The data are therefore relevant for understanding the conditions for driving neoplastic transformation. The work helps to clarify the mitochondria's role in neoplastic transformation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fine-tuned repression of Drp1 driven mitochondrial fission primes a 'stem/progenitor-like state' to accelerate neoplastic transformation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers have agreed that your paper will be acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>, if their concerns are met. Please note that most of the required changes below are for presentation and quality. But this is important and please do attend to these suggestions.</p><p>Essential revisions:<italic>Reviewer 1.</italic></p><p>1. The abstract is too vague and unstructured for readers to understand what the paper is about and needs significant improvement.</p><p>2. The introduction does not clearly define the problem being addressed in the paper. Among the issues is whether the study is simply about changes in Drp1 levels and its effects on neoplastic transformation, or whether it is focused on mitochondria fission/fusion and its impact on neoplastic transformation. If the latter is part of the conclusion, then the authors need some other way to manipulate mitochondrial fission/fusion levels other than using Drp1 (i.e., changing levels of Opa1, mitofusins, etc) to see whether this also can impact neoplastic transformation.</p><p>3. It would be nice to see if the membrane potential of mitochondria differs under TF1- versus TF10- treatment.

This is a concern because the increased levels of Drp1 in the TF1 cells in Figure 1D conflicts with what appears to be an overall decrease in Drp1 levels in TF1 in Figure 3C.</p><p>4.

Quantification of immunoblots in Figures 1D, 3E, 3F: Where the immunoblots are used to make arguments about increases and decreases in key proteins such as pDrp1 or Krt15 levels, these must be quantified in some manner.</p><p>(Editor's comment : to avoid delays in publication, this is optional if it will require new experiments, but do quantitate existing blots if possible and address the issues raised)</p><p>2. The placement of the arrow in 2B is quite confusing and doesn't seem to indicate the main point trying to be made which is more about Cluster 3 and Sox4 and Krt15 than Krt13 which doesn't seem to change.</p><p>3. Quantification of Dot plots: While the dot plots are helpful for seeing differences between individual cells within the populations, several conclusions are based on the interpretation of how many cells from one condition vs another are within a certain range or quadrant but these are not quantified. For example, 3B what percent of each condition are in each quadrant? This is hard to see by eye. Similarly, 3C, 3D, 3I, and 4B must be quantified and some measure of statistical significance presented. And what is the p-value shown in 4A referring to? Differences between all of them or individual comparisons?</p><p>4. The resolution of figures 4D and 4E must be improved so that the gene names can be seen upon zooming in.</p><p>5. 4C: Is the difference in fusion1 statistically significant? how do the other populations look in the fission vs fusion1 plot?</p><p>6. Ext Figure 2: 2a: may be better as a table instead of a graph because the graph is hard to read and compare. 2c-2d: Cluster 5 seems to be de-enriched for many genes so is it truly surprising or significant that there is less mtDNA? Are the overall counts lower? How are the data normalized to account for differences?</p><p>7. Extended Figure 4A (in figure legend or text please indicate the actual efficiency values and show error bars for replicates as the level of Drp1 repression/kd efficiency is a vitally important metric).</p><p>8.

Materials and methods: There are several key details missing such as the identity (manufacturer) and concentration of all of the antibodies used in the immunoblots and immunofluorescence analysis such as those for pDrp1, Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Cyclins E2, A2, B1, D2, Cytochrome C, Fis1, Tom20. These details are not only important for reproducibility but as well as for evaluation of the results by experts familiar with these particular reagents.</p><p>a. For immunoblotting of whole cell lysates, how did the authors make sure equivalent amounts of cells were analyzed, especially given their very different proliferation characteristics?</p><p>b. How many replicates were used for the single cell RNASeq analysis of TF-1/TF-10 and of weak/strong Drp1-shRNA? What was the difference between the replicates especially for the cluster analysis as done in figure 2A (can this be shown in supplemental material?) to get an idea of how reproducible the findings are especially given how such a small difference in Drp1-shRNA induced levels seems to have such a striking difference on gene expression.</p><p>c. Additionally, there are several typos in this section (p22 Lines 479, 481, 491. p24 lines 524, 525, 529).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68394.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1.</p><p>1.

In the revised manuscript, we have made the abstract more succinct.

We have now clearly defined our focus on Drp1 in the abstract and in the last paragraph of the Introduction section (Lines: 89-98). There, we also clarify that our self-renewing/proliferating cells enriched model is characterized by robust repression of Drp1 activity in comparison to the core regulators of mitochondrial fusion (Figure 1D). Therefore, we focused on Drp1 driven mitochondrial shape and functional changes. Both fusion and fission processes are mentioned in the previous paragraphs of Introduction since they oppose each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be nice to see if the membrane potential of mitochondria differs under TF1- versus TF10- treatment. As it now stands, all the authors provide is a visual inspection of mitochondria under these two conditions, providing unclear metrics for determining the degree of fragmentation or fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We now demonstrate that the mitochondrial structural properties in the TF-1 cells is associated with overall lowering of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in comparison to Parental or the TF-10 cells, assessed by their TMRE uptake (Figure 1F and its legend, Lines: 166-171). Furthermore, the mitochondrial potential per unit mitochondrial mass in individual cells (TMRE / Mitotracker Green staining) is regulated over a wider range particularly in the TF-1 cells, while it is lowest in the TF-10 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and its legend). Also, expression of the phospho-deficient Drp1-S616A mutant in TF-1 cells maintains markedly lower mitochondrial membrane potential in comparison to the Drp1-WT expression (Figure 3J and its legend, Lines: 348-356), suggesting reduced pDrp1-S616 levels maintains modulates mitochondrial potential in the TF-1 cells. Notably, such impact of Drp1-S616A expression on mitochondrial potential is not observed in the Parental cells (Figure 3J and its legend), where pDrp1-S616 levels and mitochondrial membrane remain higher than TF-1 cells. Notably, the accelerated carcinogen driven neoplastic transformation caused by Drp1 knockdown does not involve modulation of mitochondrial potential (Figure 4H and its legend, Lines: 407-409). The relevant methods are described in Lines: 593-94, 610-615.</p><p>Clarification of the ‘unclear’ metrics for determining the degree of fragmentation or fusion:</p><p>We designed, validated (using Drp1 and mitofusin knockouts) and demonstrated the utility of the mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion] metrics (as a part of the mitoSinCe<sup>2</sup> assay and described in Methods, Lines: 600-604) towards filling a gap in quantitation of mitochondrial structure/morphology. As described in our original publication, these metrics quantify the ‘contribution’ of the dynamic fission and fusion processes to the steady state mitochondrial shape in single cells, and do not quantify kinetics of mitochondrial fission or fusion processes. The main advantage of the quantitative mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion] metrics is that they together can identify heterogeneity in mitochondrial structure in a given cell population (Figures 1E, 4I), which other traditional methods cannot. Nonetheless, we have now added analyses of the standard photoconversion based matrix continuity assay confirming the Figure 1D predicted higher mitochondrial matrix continuity in TF-1 and TF-10 cells in comparison to the Parental cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). We have clarified the above points in the revised manuscript (Lines: 136-165). (Please see response to point 9 for further details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Indeed, majority of the cytosolic Cyclin E particularly in the Drp1 knockdown cells represent mitochondrial Cyclin E (not shown), which remains to be elucidated further (Lines: 3-383-385). We are currently pursuing this line of investigation in detail and therefore left out of this short report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We have now expanded our Discussion section along with each result section (as required for a short report format) and also provided a schematic model for better understanding of the conclusions (Figure 5F, Lines: 518-530).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2.</p><p>1.

We also reason this effort is unnecessary because we used the HaCaT cell line and its new derivatives as a model to establish the main conclusions. As highlighted by other Reviewers, we arrived at our main novel conclusion from in depth multidimensional characterization of this in vitro model system, and now we have provided further characterization. Moreover, our finding that close to complete knockdown of Drp1 prevents neoplastic transformation is consistent with the findings from other labs in other cell models and also raises the possibility that inability to sustain the primed stem-like state may prevent neoplastic transformation in those systems (Lines: 413-414, 535-538). Nonetheless, our study highlights the need of testing the impact of fine-tuned Drp1 repression in stem cell maintenance and neoplastic transformation in other models. Please note, we refrain from drawing any conclusion about skin biology from this single cell line study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We also reason this effort is unnecessary because we used the standard TCDD driven transformation of the skin keratinocyte line, HaCaT, as a model carcinogen to illustrate the main conclusions. Moreover, our finding that close to complete knockdown of Drp1 prevents TCDD driven neoplastic transformation is consistent with the findings from other labs in other cell models of Ras driven other neoplastic transformation (Lines: 413-414, 535-538).

This is a concern because the increased levels of Drp1 in the TF1 cells in Figure 1D conflicts with what appears to be an overall decrease in Drp1 levels in TF1 in Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We have seen consistent increase in Drp1 protein levels in the TF-1 and TF-10 cells in comparison to the Parental, albeit to variable degrees. Now we have quantitated the presented blot after normalizing with the loading control, Actin, and the Parental population (Figure 1D and its legend). Now, we also provide another example of increase in Drp1 levels in TF 1 and TF10 while the increase in Mfn1 in the same samples is less consistent (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and its legend, Lines: 130-132).</p><p>Clarification on Figure 3C of the first version of the manuscript:</p><p>Please note that the immunocytochemistry studies are less quantitative than immunoblotting (now clarified in Methods, Lines: 675-678). This is exemplified in the smaller increase in <italic>Sox2</italic> in the TF-1 cells in immunocytochemistry (Figure 3B,C,G) in comparison to the ~8 fold increase observed in immunoblot (Figure 3A). We noted immunocytochemistry with the mouse Drp1 antibody in use shows the expected elevation in Drp1 in the TF1 population, while the rabbit Drp1 antibody doesn’t (previous Figure 3C). Unfortunately, the mouse Drp1 antibody cannot be used to co-stain with mouse <italic>Sox2</italic> antibody in use. We have removed previous Figure3C, given comparison of Drp1 vs <italic>Sox2</italic> relationship between the cell populations may be misleading, although that within each cell population is accurate.

Although deemed optional, we have added new data and analyses (including standard method, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) to address this concern and add value to the revised manuscript (Lines: 134-165). Also, we have clarified the purpose and advantage of using the quantitative mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion] metrics without which we could not have identified the nuanced mitochondrial features of the stemness relevant subpopulations.</p><p>We assume the reviewer is alluding to the photoconversion based live cell pulse assay as the more readily understood method for mitochondrial dynamics. However, this valuable method for assessing overall mitochondrial dynamics and/or mitochondrial matrix continuity, cannot distinguish between ‘contribution’ of mitochondrial fission and fusion processes in maintenance of the steady state mitochondrial structure/morphology in single cells. To fill this gap, we previously designed, validated (using Drp1 and mitofusin knockouts) and demonstrated the utility of the mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion] metrics (as a part of the mitoSinCe<sup>2</sup> assay and described in Methods, Lines: 600-604). Please note, as described in our original publication, mitochondrial [Fission] and [Fusion] metrics do not quantify kinetics of mitochondrial fission or fusion. Rather, these two quantitative metrics together can identify and quantitate heterogeneity in mitochondrial structure/shape in a given cell population. In our current work, use of these metrics provide the following quantitative advantages over the photoconversion based live cell pulse assay:</p><p>1) Validation of the metrics in Drp1 manipulated cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, Figure 4I and their legends, Lines: 333-336, 427-431), and also revelation of nuanced differences with fine-tuned repression of Drp1 (Figure 1E, 4I and their legends, Lines: 153-165, Lines: 427-454), thus identifying the primed stem cell linked characteristic mitochondrial shape in individual cells.</p><p>2) Quantitation of Fusion1 (percent length of the longest mitochondrial element) revealed that fine-tuned reduction of Drp1 protein levels or its Drp1-S616 phosphorylation restricts the length of mitochondrial tubules in a network (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, Figure 4—figure supplements 1I,J,K, Figure 5F and their legends).</p><p>3) Validation of the mitochondrial mass alteration predicted by scRNAseq data (Figure 4J, 5B and their legends, Lines: 477-478).</p><p>4) Revelation of potential distinction between the mechanism of maintenance of mitochondrial shape in Parental vs its transformed TF-1 counterpart, which remains to be investigated further (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, Lines: 333-342, 366-368).</p><p>Nonetheless, now we have added data using our refined photoconversion based matrix continuity assay (Lines: 134-165). This data confirms higher matrix continuity in both transformed cells in comparison to the non-transformed Parental cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), as predicted by their ~10 fold less Drp1 activity (assessed by pDrp1-S616 / Drp1) (Figure 1D). As the reviewer suggested, this elevated matrix continuity likely results from unopposed fusion activity driven by mitofusins and Opa1 in the presence of repressed Drp1 activity. We found that the lower matrix continuity of TF-1 cells than TF-10 cells with 2 fold higher Drp1 activity is due to enrichment of a cellular subpopulation with moderately reduced [Fusion] and moderately elevated [Fission], as identified and quantified by the bivariate analyses of the metrics (Figure 1E). This stem cell linked subpopulation of cells is enriched when Drp1 is weakly repressed, whereas, more complete Drp1 repression expectedly increases the cell population with mitochondrial hyperfusion (Figure 4I and its legend; Lines: 427-449). Given Drp1-WT overexpression in the Parental cells increases [Fission] and reduces [Fusion] (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and its legend) we conclude that the remnant Drp1 driven mitochondrial fission after fine-tuned Drp1 repression prevents mitochondrial hyperfusion to maintain smaller fused mitochondria (with reduced mitochondrial content), towards sustaining a [CyclinE<sup>hi</sup>-Sox2<sup>hi</sup>-Krt15<sup>hi</sup>] state (Lines: 449-460). Notably, Drp1 overexpression by itself does not support Sox2hi/Krt15hi state in Parental cells (Figure 3I) as does weaker repression of Drp1 (Figure 4A), suggesting Drp1 needs to be repressed to support stemness and further activated to support other cellular process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3.</p><p>1.

Quantification of Dot plots: While the dot plots are helpful for seeing differences between individual cells within the populations, several conclusions are based on the interpretation of how many cells from one condition vs another are within a certain range or quadrant but these are not quantified. For example, 3B what percent of each condition are in each quadrant? This is hard to see by eye. Similarly, 3C, 3D, 3I, and 4B must be quantified and some measure of statistical significance presented. And what is the p-value shown in 4A referring to? Differences between all of them or individual comparisons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

Consistently, overexpression of less active Drp1-S616A mutant shows a similar phenotype but only in the TF-1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and its legend, Lines: 333-340) (details in Response to point 9b-2).

Extended Figure 4A (in figure legend or text please indicate the actual efficiency values and show error bars for replicates as the level of Drp1 repression/kd efficiency is a vitally important metric)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We agree that the level of Drp1 repression/kd efficiency is very critical in supporting our main conclusion about the impact of fine-tuned Drp1 repression. Towards this end, we have provided the following revisions:</p><p>1. Added comparable metrics for Drp1 knockdown efficacy from immunoblots and scRNA-seq quantitation. We used the appropriately normalized Drp1 levels after knockdown that is further normalized by levels after control-knockdown (Lines: 463-467). We found that the knockdown difference between the shRNAs is 10 folds at the protein level (Figure 4A and its legend), and less than 2 fold at the RNA level (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and its legend).</p><p>2. We performed fresh knockdown experiments further lowering Drp1 knockdown efficacy where both shRNAs reduced Drp1 levels by less than 2 folds at the protein level (Figure 4E and its legend; such remnant Drp1 levels may remain overestimated due to the reduction of the Actin control with Drp1 knockdown, Figure 4A,E). Nonetheless, such modest Drp1 knockdown reduces abundance of cells with &gt;80 [Fusion1] (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and its legend, Lines: 440-445), increases abundance of self-renewing cells and accelerates neoplastic transformation in Parental cells (Figure 4F, G and their legends, Lines: 402-407). Furthermore, plotting the accelerated transformation efficacy with Drp1 protein levels predicts ~50% repression of Drp1 protein levels can maintain maximal transformation efficacy within the experimental range (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and its legend, Lines: 415-419).</p><p>3. Now we provide multiple analyses of the impact of overexpression of Drp1-wild type and the phospho-deficient Drp1-S616A mutant (Lines: 329-356). Our data suggest that elevated <italic>Sox2</italic>-hi/Krt15-hi sub-population is maintained by reducing Drp1-S616 phosphorylation of the elevated Drp1 protein levels in the TF-1 population, but not in the Parental (Figure 3I and its legend). Consistently, overexpression of Drp1-S616A mutant fails to cause the increase in the [Fusion] metrics observed with Drp1-WT overexpression only in the TF-1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and its legend) (more details in Response to point 9b).</p><p>Therefore, our new data strengthens our conclusion that fine-tuned repression of Drp1 accelerates initiation of neoplastic transformation. Moreover, our new data also highlights that maintenance of the stem/progenitor cell state in the transformed TF-1 cells is achieved by fine tuning Drp1 activity by reducing its phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Furthermore, to confirm reproducibility of the overall cluster organization between the two experimental set, we identified all the common genes defining the clusters in the two experimental data sets (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and its legend), albeit with some differences. Furthermore, the key findings of the scRNA-seq results are validated by immunoblots (<italic>Sox2</italic> and Krt15 levels in Figure 3A, 4A), immunocytochemistry (which is less quantitative, <italic>Sox2</italic> and Krt15 levels in Figure 3B) and quantitative microscopy analyses (mitochondrial mass in Figure 4J); all mentioned in the relevant Result sections.</p><p>Also, please note that the weaker Drp1 knockdown maintains 10 fold higher remnant Drp1 protein levels than the stronger Drp1 knockdown (Figure 4A and its legend). This 10 fold excess of Drp1 can potentially prevent the proposed compensatory adverse effect of excessive Drp1 suppression, namely increase in mitochondrial mass and cell cycle disturbances observed in our scRNA-seq data (Figure 5). Moreover, we predict this compensatory effect may be detected beyond ~50% repression of Drp1 protein when transformation efficacy starts declining (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) (details in point 16) (Lines: 483-487).</p><p>We have corrected all the typos in the Materials and methods section, and others.</p></body></sub-article></article>
