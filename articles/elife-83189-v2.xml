frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A hallmark of ALS/FTD pathology is the presence of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, produced from both sense GGGGCC (poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR) and antisense CCCCGG (poly-PR, poly-PG, poly-PA) transcripts. Translation of sense DPRs, such as poly-GA and poly-GR, depends on non-canonical (non-AUG) initiation codons. Here, we provide evidence for canonical AUG-dependent translation of two antisense DPRs, poly-PR and poly-PG. A single AUG is required for synthesis of poly-PR, one of the most toxic DPRs. Unexpectedly, we found redundancy between three AUG codons necessary for poly-PG translation. Further, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2D (EIF2D), which was previously implicated in sense DPR synthesis, is not required for AUG-dependent poly-PR or poly-PG translation, suggesting that distinct translation initiation factors control DPR synthesis from sense and antisense transcripts. Our findings on DPR synthesis from the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> locus may be broadly applicable to many other nucleotide repeat expansion disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>C9ORF72</kwd><kwd>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</kwd><kwd>frontotemporal dementia</kwd><kwd>dipeptide protein repeats</kwd><kwd>iPSC-derived neurons</kwd><kwd>AUG initiation codons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003607</institution-id><institution>Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kratsios</surname><given-names>Paschalis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS057553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fen-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS101986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Fen-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutational analysis in cell-based models of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD identifies canonical translation initiation codons (AUG) on the antisense CCCCGG transcript as initiation sites for synthesis of neurotoxic dipeptide repeat proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion in the first intron of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> is the most common monogenic cause of inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Renton et al., 2011</xref>). This mutation is predicted to cause ALS/FTD via three non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: (1) a loss-of-function mechanism due to reduced C9ORF72 protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dane et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>), (2) a gain-of-function mechanism due to toxicity from repeat-containing sense (GGGGCC) and antisense (CCCCGG) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McEachin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parameswaran et al., 2022</xref>), and (3) toxicity from dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins produced from these transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loveland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). However, loss of C9ORF72 protein by itself does not cause neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koppers et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, DPRs produced from both sense (poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR) and antisense (poly-PR, poly-PG, poly-PA) transcripts are present in the central nervous system of ALS/FTD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gendron et al., 2013</xref>). Strong evidence from experimental model systems suggests DPRs are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmitz et al., 2021</xref>), underscoring the importance of uncovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for DPR synthesis.</p><p>To design therapies that reduce DPR levels, it is valuable to identify initiation codons used in DPR translation. To date, the synthesis of sense DPRs has been a major focus in the ALS/FTD field, resulting in the identification of translation initiation codons for poly-GA and poly-GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonobe et al., 2018</xref>). As previously shown, <italic>non-canonical</italic> codons (CUG for poly-GA, AGG for poly-GR) initiate DPR synthesis from the sense strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonobe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van ‘t Spijker et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cultured cells showed that the presence of an expanded GGGGCC repeat alone, without flanking intronic sequences, can result in DPR production, suggesting an unconventional form of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). However, deletion analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements upstream of the GGGGCC repeats and ribosome profiling revealed that translation initiation in the poly-GA and poly-GR frames does depend on flanking intronic sequences surrounding the repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van ‘t Spijker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lampasona et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, a recent study proposed that a canonical AUG initiation codon is used for poly-PG synthesis from the antisense CCCCGG transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting conventional translation is involved in the synthesis of at least one DPR. However, the initiation codons for other DPRs (e.g., poly-PR, poly-PA) from the antisense transcript remain unknown. Hence, it is unclear which mode of translation is utilized for DPR synthesis from the antisense transcript.</p><p>Although both sense and antisense transcripts produce GP-containing dipeptides (sense: poly-GP, antisense: poly-PG), the antisense transcript seems to be the primary source of poly-PG/poly-GP inclusions in the brain of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). Further, two recent ALS clinical trials that specifically targeted the production of DPRs from the sense transcript failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tran et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, studying the mechanisms responsible for DPR synthesis from the antisense transcript is important, and this is the focus of the present study.</p><p>An additional challenge in ALS/FTD is the identification of regulatory factors necessary for DPR synthesis. Research efforts have uncovered a number of proteins that act at different steps of DPR synthesis: RNA helicases (eIF4A, DHX36, and DDX3X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tseng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>), proteins of the eIF4F complex (eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E, eIF4H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Linsalata et al., 2019</xref>), small ribosomal protein subunit 25 (RPS25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamada et al., 2019</xref>), ribosome quality control protein ZNF598 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2021</xref>), and eukaryotic translation initiation factors (DAP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van ‘t Spijker et al., 2022</xref>], eIF2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonobe et al., 2018</xref>], eIF3F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayhan et al., 2018</xref>], eIF2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>], and eIF2D co-factors DENR and MCTS-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green et al., 2022</xref>]). Except RPS25, all remaining factors have only been assessed for their effects on DPRs produced from the sense GGGGCC transcript. Furthermore, the role of these factors on DPR synthesis in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD patients remains largely untested.</p><p>Here, we employ cell-based models of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD to identify translation initiation codons for DPRs produced from the antisense transcript. Transfection into cultured cells of constructs carrying 35 CCCCGG repeats (preceded by 1000 bp of human intronic <italic>C9ORF72</italic> sequence) leads to DPR production (poly-PR, poly-PG) and reduced cell survival. We find that a canonical AUG initiation codon located 273 base pairs (–273 bp) upstream of the CCCCGG repeats is necessary for poly-PR synthesis. Further, we provide evidence for redundancy in usage of canonical initiation codons for poly-PG synthesis. Although an AUG at –194 bp is the main start codon for poly-PG, two other AUG codons (at –212 bp and at –113 bp) can also function as alternative translation initiation sites. These findings suggest that DPR synthesis from the antisense transcript occurs via AUG-dependent translation, contrasting with the mode of DPR synthesis from the sense transcript, which depends on non-canonical start codons (CUG for poly-GA, AGG for poly-GR). Finally, we show that the translation initiation factor eIF2D, which is necessary for CUG-dependent poly-GA synthesis from the sense transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>), is not involved in AUG-dependent antisense DPR (poly-PG, poly-PR) synthesis. Hence, distinct translation initiation sites and factors are employed for DPR synthesis from sense GGGGCC and antisense CCCCGG transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transfection of constructs carrying 35 CCCCGG repeats leads to antisense DPR synthesis and reduced cell survival</title><p>To study DPR synthesis from the antisense transcript, we engineered three constructs with 35 CCCCGG repeats preceded by 1000-bp-long intronic sequence from human <italic>C9ORF72</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>), and then followed by nanoluciferase (nLuc) in frame of poly-PR, poly-PG, or poly-PA (see Materials and methods). 48 hr after transfection of poly-PR::nLuc or poly-PG::nLuc into HEK293 and NSC34 cells, robust expression of poly-PR and poly-PG was detected both in luciferase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) and western blotting for poly-PR, poly-PG, and nLuc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), suggesting the luciferase signal is an accurate readout for DPR production.

Next, we simultaneously mutated three codons to CCC, but left intact the AUG at –212 bp. We refer to this construct as ‘–212 AUG’. Upon transfection of –212 AUG, we observed poly-PG expression, suggesting poly-PG translation can start at the AUG at –212 bp. Intriguingly, when we followed a similar approach to mutate three codons to CCC but leave intact the AUG at –194 bp or at –113 bp, we also observed poly-PG production, but this time at an expected lower molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

The poly-GA reduction upon EIF2D shRNA is consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>), albeit more modest - likely due to a technical reason (a bicistronic construct containing 75 GGGGCC repeats was used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig6sdata1"><label>Figure 6—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Full raw unedited images of western blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</title><p>Figures with the uncropped blots are clearly labeled with the relevant bands.</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-83189-fig6-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83189-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Knockdown of EIF2D in human iPSC-derived motor neurons</title><p>We next tested whether EIF2D is required for DPR synthesis in a cellular context that maintains the endogenous human <italic>C9ORF72</italic> gene locus.

The iPSC lines were differentiated into motor neurons as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). Repeated transfection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against <italic>EIF2D (EIF2D</italic>-siRNA-1), but not of a control scrambled siRNA, resulted in robust downregulation of <italic>EIF2D</italic> mRNA as assessed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and eIF2D protein analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mRNA levels of eIF2A, a related initiation factor, remained unaltered, suggesting specificity in the siRNA effect. Despite this knockdown, an immunoassay (conducted in a blinded manner) failed to show any differences in the steady-state levels of soluble poly-PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting eIF2D is not necessary for poly-PG translation from the antisense transcript. We caution though that our immunoassay does not distinguish between poly-PG produced from the antisense transcript and poly-GP from the sense transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Hence, a mild effect upon EIF2D knockdown on poly-PG (from antisense transcript) can potentially be masked by poly-GP (from sense transcript). Of note, PG/GP inclusions in brain tissue of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD patients contain ~80% of poly-PG from the antisense transcript and ~20% of poly-GP from the sense transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>).

Consistent with the latter study, <italic>EIF2D</italic> knockdown had no effect on poly-GR synthesis from the sense transcript based on an immunoassay that measures soluble poly-GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Altogether, these findings from one patient line (26#6) suggest that eIF2D is required for CUG start codon-dependent poly-GA synthesis from the sense transcript in human iPSC-derived neurons, but is dispensable for poly-GR (from sense transcript) and poly-PG synthesis, albeit our immunoassay cannot distinguish between poly-PG and poly-GP. However, when we repeated this experiment with two additional iPSC lines (27#11 and 40#3) from <italic>C9ORF72</italic> carriers with two siRNAs (<italic>EIF2D</italic>-siRNA-1 and -2), we did not achieve robust <italic>EIF2D</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>).

This finding may inform the design of future therapies for ALS/FTD, especially since poly-PR is a highly toxic DPR and poly-PG is thought to be primarily translated from the antisense transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). Our finding of canonical AUG codons serving as translation initiation codons for antisense DPRs (poly-PR, poly-PG) differs from the proposed mode of translation of sense DPRs (e.g., poly-GA, poly-GR). In the latter case, it is thought that repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of poly-GA and poly-GR occurs via non-canonical CUG and AGG initiation codons, respectively, located in the intronic sequence upstream of the GGGGCC repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonobe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van ‘t Spijker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cultured cells showed that the presence of an expanded GGGGCC repeat alone, without flanking sequences, can result in DPR production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freibaum et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, our findings together with these previous studies suggest that DPR synthesis may involve at least three different modes of translation: (1) near-cognate start codon (e.g., CUG, AGG) dependent translation for poly-GA and poly-GR from sense GGGGCC transcripts, (2) canonical AUG-dependent translation for poly-PR and poly-PG synthesis from antisense CCCCGG transcripts, and (3) DPR synthesis may also occur through RAN translation mechanisms that solely utilize the repeat. It is conceivable that all three modes of translation may occur simultaneously in disease, and that the use of non-canonical and canonical initiation codons may be the primary contributors of DPR production.</p><p>A notable finding is the presence of redundancy in start codon usage for poly-PG synthesis. Our data suggest that the AUG at –194 bp is primarily used for poly-PG translation from antisense CCCCGG transcripts, consistent with a previous investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2020</xref>). However, when this AUG is mutated, two other canonical AUG codons (at –212 bp and –113 bp) can also function as translation initiation sites under the experimental conditions described herein. Although it is unclear whether such redundancy in DPR translation initiation occurs in the central nervous system of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD patients, these findings nevertheless suggest that targeting only one translation initiation site may be insufficient to prevent poly-PG synthesis. Redundancy in start codon usage may also apply to other DPRs, such as poly-PR synthesis from the antisense transcript. Although we identified an AUG at –273 bp as necessary for poly-PR synthesis, a previous study detected poly-PR when only 100 bp downstream of the GGGGCC repeats were included in an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chew et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that this intronic 100-bp-long sequence was placed next to a 589 bp regulatory element of the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE), which contains several putative start codons. The AUG initiation codons we identified as necessary for either poly-PR or poly-PG synthesis are predicted to be included in the endogenous antisense CCCCGG transcript based on 5’ RACE analysis on brain samples of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, endogenous mutagenesis of these codons - in the native genomic context of the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> locus - is needed in the future to further test the validity of our findings.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests distinct proteins affect translation initiation of DPRs from sense and antisense transcripts in <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD. For example, the RNA helicase DDX3X directly binds to sense (GGGGCC), but not antisense (CCCCGG) transcripts, thereby selectively repressing the production of sense DPRs (poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that the translation initiation factor EIF2D is not involved in DPR (viz., poly-PG, poly-PR) synthesis from antisense (CCCCGG) transcripts. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonobe et al., 2021</xref>), we showed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in vitro cellular systems (HEK293 and NSC34 cells) that EIF2D is required for poly-GA production from sense (GGGGCC) transcripts. These findings are important because they indicate that not only distinct translation initiation codons, but also different regulatory proteins are involved in DPR synthesis from sense and antisense transcripts, suggesting that different modes of DPR translation (e.g., RAN translation, AUG-dependent translation) occur simultaneously in <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ASL/FTD. Consistent with this idea, translation initiation is the most heavily regulated step in protein synthesis because it is the rate-limiting step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richter and Sonenberg, 2005</xref>). Hence, we favor a model where distinct regulatory factors are necessary for translation initiation of different DPRs. In striking contrast, the transcriptional control of sense and antisense transcripts appears coordinated. For example, a single protein - the transcription elongation factor Spt4 - controls production of both sense and antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kramer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to <italic>C9ORF72</italic> ALS/FTD, nucleotide repeat expansions are present in various genes, causing more than 30 neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chintalaphani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Depienne and Mandel, 2021</xref>). In many of these, products translated from the expanded repeat sequences have been detected in the nervous system of affected individuals. Hence, our findings may also apply to this large group of genetic disorders in the following ways. First, translation of peptides from the same nucleotide repeat expansion may require different modes of translation (RAN- and AUG-dependent translation), as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the surprising redundancy in canonical AUG initiation codon usage for DPR (poly-PG) synthesis may also apply to proteins translated from nucleotide repeat expansions in other genes. Lastly, our results support the idea that distinct translation initiation factors are involved in the synthesis of individual DPRs produced from the same nucleotide repeat expansion. Future studies focused on transcriptional and translational mechanisms of expanded nucleotide repeats may critically contribute to the design of therapies for these diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Relative mRNA expression was calculated with the double delta Ct method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measurement of soluble poly-GR and poly-GP in iPSC-derived neurons</title><p>Soluble poly-GR and poly-GP levels in iPSC-derived neurons were detected using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Immunoassay platform as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, cells were lysed using Tris-based lysis buffer, and lysates were adjusted to equal concentrations and loaded in duplicate wells. Background subtracted electrochemiluminescence signals were presented as percentage. The MSD assays were performed in a blinded manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Soluble and insoluble fractionation for measurement of poly-GA</title><p>Motor neurons were lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts, BP-115D) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and used as the soluble fraction. Protein concentrations of the soluble fraction were determined by the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 23227). To remove carryovers, the pellets were washed with RIPA buffer, and then resuspended in the same buffer with 2% SDS followed by sonication on ice. The lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4°C, then spun at 14,800 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and used as insoluble fraction. Protein concentrations of the insoluble fraction were determined by Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22660).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Measurement of poly-GA in iPSC-derived neurons</title><p>Poly-GA in soluble motor neuron lysates was measured using an MSD sandwich immunoassay. A human/murine chimeric form of anti-GA antibody chGA3 was used for capture, and a human anti-GA antibody GA4 with a SULFO-tagged anti-human secondary antibody was used for detection. Poly-GA concentrations were interpolated from the standard curve using 60X-GA expressed in HEK 293 cells and presented as percentage. For background correction, values from no-repeats neuron samples were subtracted from the corresponding test samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test and two-way ANOVA with the Šídák multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism version 9.3.1. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. The data are presented as mean  ± standard error of the mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>affiliated with Biogen.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further validation of data in Figure 5 as per comments from Reviewers.</p><p>2) Address the contribution of sense-strand encoded GP versus antisense-strand encoded PG in iPSC studies as per Reviewer comments.</p><p>3) All western immunoblot data need to be quantified and statistically analyzed as outlined by Reviewer #1.</p><p>4) The inclusion of additional iPSN lines to demonstrate findings are consistent within an endogenous setting as outlined by Reviewer #2.</p><p>5) Further validation of the luciferase assay to address concerns raised by Reviewers.</p><p>6) An evaluation of cited studies to confirm accuracy of reported information as per concerns raised by Reviewer #1.</p><p>7) An evaluation of DPR aggregation to demonstrate relevance in disease as outlined by Reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. All western immunoblot data need to be quantified and statistically analyzed. In particular, quantification of the multiple molecular weight bands in Figures 2B, 3B and 4B is needed to support the authors conclusions.</p><p>2. There are several issues with the data in figure 5.</p><p>a. the successful knockdown of eIF2D needs to be confirmed on the protein level.</p><p>b. multiple siRNA targeting eIF2D should be tested to confirm that effects are specific to the targeted gene versus an off-target effect.</p><p>c. the authors need to be clearer about their interpretation of the data on GP/PG at this point in their study. Specifically, the GP that is measured here will include both sense-GP and antisense-PG. While Zu et al. demonstrated that the antisense strand is the primary source of GP/PG (which the authors should mention in the intro or results for the reader) the sense strand will still contribute to DPR production and could mask effects. In Figure 6D &amp; F, the authors present more compelling data to support that eIF2D is dispensable for PG production. The authors may want to consider presenting those data sooner.</p><p>3. The authors design novel C4G2:NanoLuc constructs to study antisense DPR synthesis. Further validation of the constructs and the system would improve the current study.</p><p>a. Can the authors present data showing that the PR and PG bands in Figure 1D-1E co-stain with an anti-luciferase antibody since the DPR are tagged with nLuc (Figure 1A)?

In most cases, statistical analysis shows that the mutant reporter has luciferase levels comparable to the control construct (DC9) that bears no CCCCGG repeats. The fact that AUG mutation did not completely suppress DPR translation to the exact same level with the control (DC9) construct may have to do with rules that govern stringency of start codon selection, as described in a paper concerning the fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (PMID: 23396971).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It has not been resolved what is the contribution of GP from sense and antisense strands. It has been shown in previous publications that reduction of sense repeats can significantly decrease the GP level. Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to claim that knocking down eIF2D had no effect on GP level is due to the AUG translation of antisense repeats.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. Our experiments in HEK293 cells were done with a poly-PG::nLuc construct, where nLuc is in the poly-PG frame (Figure 6). In HEK293 cells, KO or knockdown of eIF2D did not reduce poly-PG::nLuc expression. Please, see revised Results section (lines 188-203) entitled “eIF2D does not control poly-PR and poly-PG synthesis from the antisense transcript”.</p><p>In the experiment with iPSC-derived motor neurons (Figure 7), we toned down this claim because our DPR detection method cannot distinguish between poly-PG (from antisense RNA) and poly-GP (from sense RNA). As the reviewer suggested, we also included in that section of the Results the literature that suggests that “It has not been resolved what is the contribution of GP from sense and antisense strands”. Please, see revised <italic>Results section</italic> entitled “Knockdown of EIF2D in human iPSC-derived motor neurons”.</p><p>Lines 216 – 224: “We caution though that our immunoassay does not distinguish between poly-PG produced from the antisense transcript and poly-GP from the sense transcript (Figure 7B). Hence, a mild effect upon eIF2D knockdown on poly-PG (from antisense transcript) can potentially be masked by poly-GP (from sense transcript). Of note, PG/GP inclusions in brain tissue of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD patients contain ~80% of poly-PG from the antisense transcript and ~20% of poly-GP from the sense transcript<sup>14</sup>. However, other studies indicate that the exact contribution of sense poly-GP and antisense poly-PG C9ORF72 ALS/FTD has not been resolved<sup>25, 26, 46</sup>. Hence, our data hint that eIF2D may not affect poly-PG synthesis from the antisense CCCCGG transcript.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only one isogeneic iPSC line was used in the study. 3-5 individual lines should be used to demonstrate the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted new experiments. To test the role of eIF2D, we have now used three published iPSC lines from <italic>C9ORF72</italic> carriers, as well as their isogenic control lines which had CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of expanded GGGGCC repeats. As we describe in Results, we only achieved (~90%) efficient EIF2D knockdown in neurons derived from one iPSC line from a <italic>C9ORF72</italic> carrier. In the remaining two lines, we witnessed variability in our siRNA approach to knockdown EIF2D.</p><p>This variability in the efficiency of siRNA to effectively knockdown EIF2D prevented us from drawing any strong conclusions on the role of EIF2D in DPR synthesis in the context of iPSC-derived neurons. Of note, variability in siRNA efficiency is commonly observed in human cultured neurons (PMID: 31587919). Nevertheless, our siRNA experiments (two siRNAs on two different iPSC lines) took several months to complete, and we feel it is important to share our observations with the community. Hence, we have decided to include them in Figure 7, but refrain from drawing strong conclusions on the role of EIF2D in DPR synthesis in the context of neurons derived from iPSCs of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> carriers.</p><p>Please, see <italic>Results section</italic> (lines 205 – 239) entitled “Knockdown of EIF2D in human iPSC-derived motor neurons” for a detailed description of our EIF2D results in the context of IPSC-derived neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To prove the endogenous DPR production from the antisense repeats starts from AUG, the regions containing the AUG codons should be mutated/deleted to assess how it affects the DPR level.</p></disp-quote><p>To specifically address this issue, the lab of one of the authors (Dr. Fen-Biao Gao) is currently preparing a separate manuscript. Specifically, the Gao lab tried multiple times to mutate the AUG codons in the poly-PG frame with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, but the region is very rich in GC content and the approach was unsuccessful. In this upcoming separate manuscript by the Gao lab, the authors were successful in generating a deletion of the intronic region that contains multiple AUG codons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5, eIF2D protein level should be measured by western blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed efficient eIF2D knockdown at the protein level with Western blotting upon transfection with siRNA against eIF2D (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1).

In iPSC-derived motor neurons, we validated efficient eIF2D knockdown at the mRNA level.

In Sonobe et al., 2021 (PMID: 34654821), we observed a strong effect on poly-GA level in NSC34 cells upon EIF2D shRNA. For that experiment, we introduced the 75 GGGGCC repeats in the context of a monocistronic construct. In that same study, we also conducted a similar experiment in HEK293 cells using a bicistronic construct and observed a strong effect on poly-GA.
