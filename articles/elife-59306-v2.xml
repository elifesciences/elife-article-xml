peptide plays a key role in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. We describe herein the investigation of disease-relevant small amyloid-β oligomers by mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry, revealing functionally relevant structural attributes. In particular, we can show that amyloid-β oligomers develop in two distinct arrangements leading to either neurotoxic oligomers and fibrils or non-toxic amorphous aggregates. Comprehending the key-attributes responsible for those pathways on a molecular level is a pre-requisite to specifically target the peptide's tertiary structure with the aim to promote the emergence of non-toxic aggregates. Here, we show for two fibril inhibiting ligands, an ionic molecular tweezer and a hydrophobic peptide that despite their different interaction mechanisms, the suppression of the fibril pathway can be deduced from the disappearance of the corresponding structure of the first amyloid-β oligomers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyloid beta-peptides</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>conformation analysis</kwd><kwd>ion mobility spectrometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of Hesse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LOEWE Schwerpunkt GLUE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zangl</surname><given-names>Rene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cluster of Excellence Frankfurt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Macromolecular Complexes</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgner</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Heisenberg professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgner</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieblein</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Janosch</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1093 'Supramolecular Chemistry on Proteins'</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schrader</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No 871037 (iNEXT-discovery)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalbe</surname><given-names>Harald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of Hesse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMRZ</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalbe</surname><given-names>Harald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Monitoring the formation of two distinct arrangements in early amyloid-ß aggregation by mass spectrometry and ion mobility allows determination of the effect of potential drug candidates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dementia is a widespread condition in the western civilization with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Folch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar and Hamilton, 2017</xref>). Up to now, no effective treatment of AD has been developed, and substantial efforts are underway to develop drugs that effectively inhibit AD pathogenesis. The cause of onset and progression of AD is unknown, but evidence points to the increased formation of oligomers of the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ<sub>42</sub>) playing a major role in the development of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Defelice and Ferreira, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). The soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers aggregate into fibrils and the detrimental effects of AD seem to be caused by neurotoxicity of the oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Habchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobson, 2003</xref>). Investigation of the oligomerization pathway to identify oligomeric states and interactions stabilizing these states is therefore imperative. When isolated in solution, Aβ<sub>42</sub> shows characteristic patterns of an unfolded polypeptide chain lacking persistent tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Habchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiti et al., 2003</xref>). Depending on concentration, temperature, and homogeneity of the starting material, the polypeptide chain rapidly forms fibrils. The significance of the exact peptide structure for the aggregation process was suggested by molecular dynamic simulations (MD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barz et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, structure determination of the fibrillar state of Aβ<sub>42</sub> has long been challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2010</xref>) and only recently structures for Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrils were determined using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo-electron-microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). The analysis of Aβ<sub>42</sub> structure by solid-state NMR and by cryo-EM consistently revealed an S shaped conformation formed by two branches of Aβ<sub>42</sub> as the basis structure within the fibril. The first branch is stabilized via hydrophobic interactions between amino acids L17 to I32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>), including the hydrophobic KLVFF region (residues 16–20). The second branch is stabilized via an ionic interaction between the K28 sidechain and the C-terminal A42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). Oligomerization of monomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> is conceivable as a parallel stacking in the axial direction of fibril growth. However, recently published fibril structures show fibrillization to occur not via a stacking of a monomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> base (MB), but with a dimeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> base (DB) as the basic module for fibrillary stacking. DB consists of two S shaped Aβ<sub>42</sub> molecules ordered in a C2 symmetric ying-yang-like fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>). This DB nucleation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> leads typically to fibrils which are known as the on-pathway aggregates. At the same time, Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregation might deviate from this oligomerization following a so-called off-pathway aggregation. The aggregates formed via the off-pathway are amorphous and do not show toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kłoniecki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sitkiewicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woods et al., 2013</xref>). Until today, several mass spectrometry (MS) studies investigated Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pujol-Pina et al., 2015</xref>). The combination of MS with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has shown differences stemming from different Aβ<sub>42</sub> isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soper et al., 2013</xref>) as well as ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2015</xref>). However, no structural information deduced from IMS measurements has yet allowed deciphering the fundamental mechanism of fibril growth and no structural basis for interfering with potential on- and off pathway oligomer formation by inhibitors of low molecular weight could be elucidated. Thus, we applied native MS combined with IMS to investigate the formation of the first Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers. While oligomers of Aβ<sub>42</sub> with same size but different arrangements do not differ in mass, they do in their shapes which makes it possible to separate the different species in an electrospray ionization (ESI) IM experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Konijnenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young et al., 2014</xref>). This allowed us to delineate the structural differences between peptides aggregating via different oligomerization pathways to determine attributes relevant for the toxicity of Aβ<sub>42</sub>. Further, for two Aβ<sub>42</sub> ligands OR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austen et al., 2008</xref>) and CLR01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>) with different interaction modes, if binding to Aβ<sub>42</sub>, we can show structural and kinetic differences in inhibition of the same on-pathway oligomerization and deduce a structural basis for their mode of action. Comprehension of the molecular mechanisms controlling the on- or off-pathway aggregation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> is pre-requisite for the design of pharmaceutic agents suppressing Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomerization and thereby neurotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Every Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomer has two arrangements</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> depicts an ion mobility (IM) driftscope plot of Aβ<sub>42</sub>. Oligomers from monomer to nonamer with several charge states in different intensities can be observed. The IMS driftscope spectrum reveals more than one drift time for every m/z value, either arising from different tertiary or quaternary structures for each of the oligomers or an overlap of the charge distributions of different oligomeric species. In such cases where the origin of the measured peaks is not directly clear, the isotopic pattern of the m/z signals can be used to unambiguously determine the mass of the correlating species. While the isotopic patterns show that some overlap occurs, there is clear evidence that all oligomers adopt several conformations. The insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> show an example for both cases. Inset (ii) depicts for the MS peak of m/z = 2258 several species with different drift times. These show different isotope distributions, by which they can be assigned to the respective oligomers, showing that this mass peak contains signal of several overlapping oligomers. In contrast, inset (i) shows for the MS peak at m/z = 1806 an identical isotope distribution for all three appearing drift time signals, indicating the existence of only one oligomer – the dimer (5-times charged) with three conformations. The two smaller of these three dimer conformations represent structures present in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaltashov and Eyles, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruotolo and Robinson, 2006</xref>). The signal with the lowest drift time decreases in intensity with a higher collision energy (CE), while the signal with the highest drift time increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is due to collision induced unfolding (CIU) of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> ion in the gas phase into the larger conformation. The same observation holds true for all oligomers. For every oligomer, we observe two differently structured oligomeric states and for higher lab frame energies (higher charge states and/or higher collision energies), two additional extended structures as the result of unfolding of the two compact species (see as well <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). No dominating larger oligomer, such as a 'magic' hexamer, as suggested previously, was found (further discussion in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). To better understand the oligomerization process, we used the drift times of the structured oligomeric states to calculate their collision cross-section (CCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laszlo and Bush, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warnke et al., 2017</xref>). Experimental CCS can be compared to theoretical growth models and to theoretically calculated CCS of structural models. As it is under debate whether low mass Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers already possess a stable structure, rather than having predominantly unstructured features, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar and Hamilton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedini and Raleigh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauk, 2009</xref>) we first calculated CCS fitting isotropic and linear growth models as published by Bleiholder, et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleiholder et al., 2011</xref>). Proteins, aggregating in an unstructured fashion would resemble an isotropic growth pattern while fibrillary growth would match a linear fit. We calculated growth models for comparison with both sets of experimentally derived CCS. In both cases, we used the respective dimer CCS as a spatially isotropic peptide as reference for the isotropic growth model. We assess the growth behavior separately for both data sets (depicted in red or blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, respectively). The data set with the lower CCS values (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) clearly corresponds to the isotropic growth model for the lower oligomers, while unambiguous assignment to either model is not possible for higher oligomers. The experimental data points for each oligomer show a less homogeneous distribution of CCS than the blue dataset, as seen by the larger error bars, suggesting less clearly defined structures. Assessment of the growth behavior of the data set with the higher CCS values (indicated in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) shows that the isotropic growth curves describes our data up to the tetramers well, after which the experimental data clearly deviates from the isotropic growth model predictions. The CCS of these higher order oligomers have a different dependence on the oligomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> state. CCS for oligomers larger than a tetramer can be perfectly fit by a linear growth model. Thus, our data show a change in the arrangement of oligomers from a more globular to a linear growth with oligomers larger than tetramers following the linear growth model. This suggests that less than four peptides do not stabilize each other sufficiently to form a stable structure. This finding is especially interesting in the light of predictions based on cryo-EM and solid-state NMR studies, which proposed a minimum of five Aβ<sub>42</sub> molecules required to form a regular fibril structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>). Our observation of linear growth from tetramer onward is encouraging for the aim to correlate our findings with structures determined by solid-state NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>) or by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>), bearing in mind that structural polymorphism has been reported both with regard to the microscopic structure and morphology of fibrils. The common feature of the reported structures is a fibrillary structure with S-shaped Aβ<sub>42</sub> forming a dimer as base for the fibril growth. These imply that Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptides have two different ways of interacting with each other – a planar interaction, forming a planar dimer or a stacking interaction, allowing growth along the fibril growth axis. The two different CCS we observe for each oligomer also suggest more than a single growth mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleiholder et al., 2011</xref>). Both sets of CCS show a very similar increase of CCS per oligomer (compare the linear fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting growth via the same S-shaped Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomers. But the different y-interceptions indicate a different growth base leading either to a single-base oligomer or an oligomer building on a dimeric base, known as β-sheet zippers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleiholder et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we assign the oligomers giving the larger set of the experimentally determined CCS to Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptides in DB arranged structures. For the second set of CCS, the overall values are smaller than could be explained by structures with a DB Aβ<sub>42</sub> - they show less homogeneous structures and therewith less clearly follow a linear growth model. This corroborates the assignment of these oligomers to MB arranged structures, which could be less well defined than the DB arranged counterparts. In summary, we assign the two different CCS to arise from either growth via singular Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptides starting from an Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomer or alternatively stacking onto a planar Aβ<sub>42</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Based on these findings, we conclude that two oligomerization pathways exist, one via DB which are on pathway to the stable fibrillary structures as suggested by NMR and cryo-EM measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>). We suggest that the other pathway, where oligomers are formed via MB, can potentially lead to amorphous aggregates but not stable fibrils. This model of two growth pathways is interesting in the light of studies showing that a single mutation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> can change the aggregation pathway leading to amorphous aggregates only, rather than fibrils, as was shown for the Aβ<sub>42</sub> mutant F19P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Groot et al., 2006</xref>). If our model is correct and the DB conformation is essential for the formation of fibrils, we would expect it to be missing for this mutant. In supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3A</xref>, we show the differences in the IM spectrum of F19P as opposed to wild-type Aβ<sub>42</sub>, for the example of (Aβ<sub>42</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>5+</sup> (D<sup>5+</sup>). In support of our model, we can assign the structured and the extended conformation of the MB conformation, but no signal that corresponds to a DB arrangement. The respective TEM images shows amorphous aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref>). These findings show that we can determine with native MS the structural development of small Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers to occur via two pathways, MB and DB stacking.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aβ<sub>42</sub>forms oligomers with two conformations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shows the driftscope spectrum of aggregated Aβ<sub>42</sub> polypeptide. Signals corresponding to oligomers up to nonamer in several charge states and several conformations can be seen (detailed description of the peak assignment can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>).

To further investigate this effect, we submitted the Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers to increasing collisional activation in the collision cell, leading to CIU of the peptide ions. This unfolding process reports on the intramolecular stability within the polypeptide chain and can vary if these interactions are changed by ligand binding, mutations or changes in pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixit et al., 2018</xref>). Only one species of the two Aβ<sub>42</sub> dimer conformations of D<sup>5+</sup> shows unfolding upon collision with inert gas molecules. A signal correlating to the unfolding product of the DB conformation is missing for this charge state. Thus, the CE applied is sufficient to unfold the MB but not the DB conformation before collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the dimer at 125 eV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A(i)</xref>). (For signal intensities in dependence of different CE see as well Figure 4D(i)). For all oligomers, the higher charge states show unfolding for both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A(ii)</xref> as example for Tr<sup>7+</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows the CCS for the two observed structured complexes as well as two unfolding products for all oligomers. Supplementary data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref> depicts this in more detail for the example of the nine-times charged pentamer. The intermolecular stability shifts with oligomeric size. Observing these shifts within the MB conformations allows us to monitor the stability increase of oligomer growth along the growth axis. For the dimer, 50% unfolding is reached at 85 eV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The CE needed for unfolding increases for every oligomer with the heptamer unfolding at 450 eV. Interestingly, the energy gaps between the CE sufficient to unfold the different oligomers are equidistant from dimer to tetramer and again from pentamer, but with a decreased energy gap. In line with this, the red line in the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows equidistance of the energy gaps for oligomers larger than a tetramer. Compared to this trend, which reflects the stability against unfolding for the larger oligomers, the CEs needed to unfold oligomers smaller than a tetramer (gray line in inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) are surprisingly low. This supports our earlier notion that an ordered stable fibrillary structure evolves only after the tetramer, in line with previously proposed theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MB and DB structures</title><p>After establishing that Aβ<sub>42</sub> can oligomerize via two pathways with an MB or DB base, we attempted to shed more light on the resulting structures. We made use of protein database (PDB) entries of Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrils to calculate theoretical CCS for the different oligomers. To distinguish between fibrillary growth via stacking based on an Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomer and a growth structure with a planar arranged DB Aβ<sub>42</sub>, we dissected the PDB structure and constructed two sets of Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers. Each structure was subjected to MD simulation for up to 1 µs to allow rearrangement of the fibril fragments, taking into account the effects of the charges carried due to the ESI process. The resulting structures support our earlier notion regarding development from more isotropic structures toward more stable fibril-like structures for the higher oligomeric states (example structures shown in supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">6</xref>). We analyzed the obtained structures for different structural elements, such as coiled or β-sheet structure (see supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). The most striking feature is the increase of the percentage of β-sheet motive, the bigger the oligomers. This is the case for all tested PDB structures as well as both types of oligomers: the MB and the DB based structures. The higher β-sheet content correspond to the higher stability, seen for the higher oligomers. These findings correlate well with insights from infra-red spectroscopic analysis of IMS-MS separated gas phase ions of smaller amyloidic peptides. As well an increase in β-sheet content was revealed for higher oligomers, showing that stable structural features remain in the gas phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seo et al., 2017</xref>). Using the MD structures, theoretical CCS were calculated (see supplementary information for detailed description). While it should be noted that we are comparing gas phase structures here, which stem from different solution structures, the found correlations are noteworthy. The best correlation was found with CCS obtained from PDB structure 5OQV (see supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). The theoretical CCS correlate well with the experimentally determined values. They show the same increase of CCS per additional Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomer for both sets of values, supporting the S-structured Aβ<sub>42</sub> as the building block in each case. Additionally, the theoretical CCS for the fibrillary DB oligomers correspond very well to the overall values of the experimentally determined CCS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CLR01 inhibits Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomerization</title><p>Our MS investigations of the different aggregation pathways of Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers might provide a rationale for aggregation inhibition by low-molecular-weight inhibitors.

As ESI only allows detection of the first few oligomers and does not report on time-dependent changes, we performed time-resolved laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry (LILBID-MS) measurements.

In sharp contrast, no signal can be observed for the DB Aβ<sub>42</sub> dimer, showing the suppression of this conformer by both inhibitors.

Both inhibitors having the same effect (inhibition of DB dimer formation) is especially interesting in view of the differences of these inhibitors. The inhibitor OR2 is designed to interfere with the central hydrophobic KLVFF region in Aβ<sub>42</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austen et al., 2008</xref>), while CLR01 was shown in the monomeric unfolded state of Aβ<sub>42</sub> to interact in the area of R5, K16, and K28 (supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schrader et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sinha et al., 2012b</xref>), suggesting a different mechanism of action. The disappearance of one of the basic modules for Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomerization (the DB module) upon binding of ligands shows the ligands' influence on the quaternary structure of Aβ<sub>42</sub>, which must be achieved via different changes in tertiary structure: Such changes in tertiary structure can go along with a change in a protein's stability, which can be observed as a different reaction toward collisional activation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> depicts the effect of increasing CE on free and CLR01-bound D<sup>5+</sup>. (The respective experiments with OR2 are shown in supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>). Both species, the bound and the unbound one, dissociate into Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomers (M<sup>2+</sup> and M<sup>3+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B(i) and (ii)</xref>). CLR01 can remain bound to one Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomer. To look at this in more detail, CIU heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) of free and CLR01 bound D<sup>5+</sup> and the respective intensity plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) show the effect that increasing CE has on the dimer. An enhanced CE leads to CIU, as seen by an increase of drift time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and CID observable by the disappearance of the dimer signal. For easy comparison significant CEs (leading to 50% CIU or CID) are summarized in the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E(i) and (ii)</xref>. For the different species, these CEs deviate noticeably, revealing differences regarding the dimers' stabilities toward unfolding or dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(i) and (ii)</xref> as well as supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>), which will be explained in detail in the following: For unbound Aβ<sub>42</sub>, we observe differences between the MB and the DB structures. The increase of CE to 85 eV causes 50% unfolding of the MB dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D(i)</xref> and supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11B</xref>), and higher energies are needed for dissociation. In contrast, the same 85 eV is already sufficient for 50% dissociation of the DB dimer, which interestingly dissociates without any prior unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C(i) and D(i)</xref>). For ligand bound Aβ<sub>42</sub>, we can only observe the effects of CE for the MB dimers, as both ligands prevent the formation of the DB dimer. Both ligands increase the CE needed for 50% CID slightly (for CLR01 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B(i)</xref> and supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11C</xref>). The unfolding process is not hampered upon OR2 binding (a similar amount of CE leads to 50% CIU with or without OR2 bound) while CLR01 interaction stabilizes the intramolecular structure, so 50% CIU cannot be achieved as maximally 15% of the proteins unfold prior to complete D<sup>5+</sup> dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C(ii) and D(ii)</xref>). While OR2 does not alter the unfolding tendencies of Aβ<sub>42</sub>, CLR01 strongly stabilizes intramolecular interactions within an Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide, while leaving intermolecular interactions in terms of aggregation axis growth unaltered. These results show that both ligands have a different mechanism by which they hinder the planar DB interaction and therewith suppress DB formation, leading to the formation of amorphous aggregates instead of fibrils, as seen in TEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is especially interesting, as it shows that drugs, which inhibit the fibril formation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> might interact via different mechanisms, but can still be assessed by simply monitoring their ability to suppress the DB dimer.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CID and CIU experiments comparing free Aβ<sub>42</sub> (top row (i)) and CLR01-bound Aβ<sub>42</sub> (bottom row (ii)).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (i) and (ii) show a comparison of the IM spectra of the 5-times charged dimer of pure and CLR01-bound Aβ<sub>42</sub>, respectively.

According to previously characterized fibril structures, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colvin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>) dimers can either form C2 symmetric Aβ<sub>42</sub> structures (DB form) or exhibit only translational symmetry along the aggregation axis (MB). These dimers serve as base for further aggregation. Our IM data reveals that only oligomers larger than a tetramer support each other sufficiently to adopt a stable structure. The structures of smaller oligomers are less defined, tending to adjust to a more globular overall shape. Nevertheless, well-defined inter- and intramolecular interactions are already formed, as seen by CIU and CID data. This is relevant, as it shows that the foundation for the fibril formation is already laid in the first dimer. Inhibitors or mutations that influence the formation of the aggregation base will lead to different oligomerization processes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> summarizes our findings for Aβ<sub>42</sub>. Despite different binding sites of the two different inhibitors (ionic/hydrophobic), it is remarkable that both disturb the formation of the S-shaped Aβ<sub>42</sub> structure enough to hinder the formation of the planar DB Aβ<sub>42</sub>, which is a pre-requisite for the formation of stable fibrils. Without this DB dimer the remaining Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomers stack axially in a less stable manner. This leads to the inhibition of the on-pathway fibrillary growth as we could show with time resolved measurements. We conclude that an undisturbed S-shaped structure of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> monomer is relevant for an orderly evolvement of large oligomers and fibrils.</p><p>TEM images show an off pathway amorphous aggregation instead of an on-pathway fibrillary one in all the cases where we found the DB arrangement to be missing (Aβ<sub>42</sub> with OR2 or CLR01, as well as for the Aβ<sub>42</sub> mutant F19P).

Fractions were collected on ice, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI and the Aβ<sub>42</sub>-containing fractions dried at 4°C in a concentrator plus (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) to produce a peptide film, which was stored at −80°C. The final yield of Aβ<sub>42</sub> after HPLC purification was approximately 3.5 mg/L. Expression and purification of the SUMO-protease Ulp1: Plasmid DNA encoding the residues 403–621 of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Ulp1 with a His-tagged N-terminal was used. The pET-28b plasmid encoding Ulp1 was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α subcloning cells for the amplification of the plasmid DNA, and into BL21 DE3 cells for expression. For expression, 1 L LB medium selective for ampicillin (100 µg/mL ampicillin) was inoculated with cells to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 and grown at 37°C and 180 rpm. Expression was induced at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6 by the addition of 1 mM IPTG and growth was continued for a further 4–5 hr. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 g, 20 min, 4°C), frozen and stored at −80°C (wet cell mass 5.2 g/L). Ulp1 SUMO-protease cell pellets were suspended in native buffer (50 mM NaPi, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 10 mM β-ME, pH 8.0) and subjected to sonification (15 cycles, 50% power) to lyse the cells. The lysate was centrifuged and the clear supernatant loaded to a pre-equilibrated 5 mL Ni-NTA HisTrap column (Qiagen) whereby an elution gradient with increasing imidazole concentration resulted in the elution of the Ulp1 at 300 mM Imidazole. A yield of 65 mg/L culture was determined using the theoretical extinction coefficient of 28590 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> at 280 nm. Synthetic Aβ<sub>42</sub> was prepared as published before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stark et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, lyophilized Aβ<sub>42</sub> was purchased from AnaSpec, USA (#24224). The peptide was solvated in HFIP containing 3% concentrated NH<sub>3</sub>. After incubation for 5 min, the solution was aliquoted in protein low-bind Eppendorf tubes and the solvent was evaporated using a SpeedVac RVC 2–18 (Christ, Osterode, Germany) concentration system. The remaining peptide film was stored at −80°C. For usage, the peptide film was solvated using DMSO (1%) and 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc buffer at pH 7.4 (if not stated otherwise) to a final peptide concentration of 50 µM. It was stored on ice until beginning the kinetic measurements. Incubation of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> sample was done at room temperature of 22°C in its respective Eppendorf tube. Both Aβ<sub>42</sub> species, recombinant and synthetic, behave identically regarding their structure as detected by ESI ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as well as in oligomerization detected by LILBID-MS (supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). CLR01 was synthesized and then solvated at a concentration of 2 mM in deionized water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fokkens et al., 2005</xref>). For testing the influence of CLR01 on Aβ<sub>42</sub>, the molecule was added in fourfold excess to the peptide. OR2 was synthesized as published before via solid-phase synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cernescu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matharu et al., 2010</xref>). For storage, the molecule was solvated at a concentration of 20 mM in DMSO which was diluted to fourfold excess regarding Aβ<sub>42</sub> for MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on a Synapt G2S (Waters Corpn., Wilmslow, Manchester, UK) equipped with a high-mass quadrupole upgrade. Pd/Pt sputtered nESI tips were pulled in house from borosilicate glass capillaries on a Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (P-1000; Sutter Instrument Co.). Aβ<sub>42</sub> was analyzed in positive ion mode using a capillary voltage of 1.9 kV. The rest of the settings for MS analysis were adjusted as following: cone voltage 100 V at an offset of 80 V, 20°C source temperature. The instrument was calibrated by a conventional CsI solution. All experiments were as well performed in negative ion mode. The observed spectra support our conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>) but show lower signal intensity/quality. Therefore, in this publication we present the data achieved in positive ion mode. IM experiments were done on the same instrument using a traveling wave setup with a wave height of 40 V, a travelling wave velocity of 700 m/s, a nitrogen gas flow of 90 mL/min, drift cell pressure of 3.5 mbar. To calculate CCS values, the instrument was calibrated using cytochrome c, apo-myoglobin and ubiquitin under denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). Collision-induced unfolding (CIU) and -dissociation (CID) experiments were done by ramping the trap collision energy (CE) in steps of 5 V from 5 to 50 V. MS-MS was performed to detect the appearance of the dissociation products of the CID experiment. Thereby, the five-times charged dimer peak, which is discussed in the manuscript, was selected at m/z = 1806 using an LM resolution of 12 and a HM resolution of 15. Laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption MS (LILBID-MS) measurements were performed as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cernescu et al., 2012</xref>). Thereby, for each time-point 4 µL of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> solution described above was injected into the droplet generator (MD-K130 from microdrop Technologies GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) separately. The ions produced by the LILBID process were analyzed as negative ions by time-of-flight. Four spectra were recorded at laser intensities below the damage threshold of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers. Each of those spectra is an average of the analysis of 500 droplets. Mass-calibration was achieved by recording spectra of bovine serum albumin. The oligomeric state of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> sample was determined in terms of the monomer-to-oligomer (M/O) ratio by calculating the ratio of the intensities of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peaks:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo largeop="true" symmetric="true">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The values of those four spectra were averaged to obtain a time depending M/O value. Data analysis of ESI-MS and IMS experiments was done using the software MassLynx V4.1 and UniDec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marty et al., 2015</xref>). CCS calibration was performed according to the protocol by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruotolo et al., 2008</xref>. To process the LILBID-MS spectra, the software Massign was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morgner and Robinson, 2012</xref>). Using this software, the raw spectra were calibrated, smoothed and background subtracted. Visualization of the results was performed using (Origin 2018 OriginLab Corporation, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>MD simulations</title><p>To correlate the two sets of experimental CCS values we obtained for the different Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers with potential structures, we derived structures for the different oligomers from existing Aβ<sub>42</sub> PDB entries. We selected the PDB entries 5OQV and 2NAO which represent Aβ<sub>42</sub> fibrillar structures with a dimer base, deduced from cryo-EM and solid-state NMR experiments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wälti et al., 2016</xref>). Cropping these allowed us to obtain two sets of structures (dimer based (DB) as well as monomer based (MB)) of the respective small oligomers observed in the ESI-MS experiments. The fibril PDB structure 5OQV is a 9-mer with dimeric base, permitting to extract oligomers until 9-mer for the DB structures and oligomers until 5-mer for the MB structures. 2NAO is a 6-mer, accordingly allowing for DB 6-mer and MB 3-mer. Experience has shown that CCS values computed straight from X-Ray, NMR or cryo-EM structures are usually not identical to experimental CCS as received from ESI gas phase ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heo et al., 2018</xref>). We took potential alterations of the protein structures in the gas phase such as charge driven distortion or compaction due to self-solvation during the ESI process into account by performing vacuum MD simulation using Gromacs 5.0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berendsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Der Spoel et al., 2005</xref>). Preceding equilibration of the cropped PDB structures in water were performed based on Pujol-Pina et al., but with the simulation time doubled to 10 ns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pujol-Pina et al., 2015</xref>). Prior to vacuum MD simulations charge effects were taken into account by placing charges onto the isolated structures, according to the most abundant experimental gas phase charge state. Individual charge states were adjusted by manually protonating basic residues according to the experimentally observed species. For each oligomer/charge state combination, a set of structures was generated with the respective number of protons randomly distributed to different basic residues to reflect an ensemble of structures. These structures were then submitted to computation for simulation for 1 µs or 200 ns, respectively, as detailed in supplementary data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>, using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field. The resulting structures were used to perform CCS calculations using the ImoS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larriba and Hogan, 2013</xref>). Nitrogen was selected as a buffer gas, and pressure as well as temperature were set according to experimental conditions. The DSSP algorithm was used to assign the content of secondary structure of the resulting structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kabsch and Sander, 1983</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>TEM measurements</title><p>50 µM Aβ<sub>42</sub> were incubated for 48 hr in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, 1% DMSO at pH 7.4.

Pictures were recorded with a Philips CM 12 with a magnification of 66000.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank M Vabulas, J Wachtveitl and C Robinson for critical reading of the manuscript.

Annotation of the driftscope spectrum of aggregated Aβ<sub>42</sub>, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The corresponding mass spectrum is shown in (<bold>B</bold>). Structured proteins appear in a driftscope plot already at lowest CE. Increase of CE leads to decrease of some of these structures, while new extended structures appear (See as well <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). The driftscope in A is measured at a CE of 15V. This is sufficient for the higher charge states of many oligomers to unfold in the gas phase, as seen by the higher drift times (Unfolded oligomers are indicated by a white outline of the annotation, as opposed to the black outlined annotations, which depict those signals, which stem from solution structures). While many peaks overlap in the mass spectrum as well as the driftscope, unambiguous assignment of all species is possible via different means. In some cases identification is based on isotopic resolution (for examples see insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), unique m/z ratio (such as M<sup>3+</sup>, D<sup>5+</sup>, Tr<sup>7+</sup>,Te<sup>7+</sup> etc.) or as they are CIU products of a clearly assigned species. As different charge states of the same oligomeric species fall on characteristic curves in the driftscope (indicated by dashed lines) additional peaks can be assigned, if the other species of this series are already identified.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59306-app1-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 2.</label><caption><title>nESI mass spectrum of Aβ<sub>42</sub>in negative ion mode and LILBID and nESI spectrum of insulin showing a clear formation of a hexamer upon zink addition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) nESI Spectra of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in negative mode show similar characteristics to those taken in positive mode (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Several oligomerization states can be seen, albeit at lower and lower intensity for the higher the oligomeric states (upscaling of the signal intensity was done as indicated in the figure). As the oligomerization of Aβ<sub>42</sub> was previously described as a process progressing via hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>), we briefly explain here, why we support the notion of linear growth. Both MS methods applied here show Aβ<sub>42</sub> in different oligomeric states with decreasing intensity for higher oligomeric state and no mass peaks indicating a dominant hexamer. Mass spectra published by Bowers et al. don’t show any dominant hexamers either, but the presence of tetramers and more dominant hexamers is deduced from different features seen in drift scope plots for the same m/z signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). Different drift times for one m/z ratio can be caused by different conformations of one oligomer species or by overlap of different charge states of different oligomers. Therefore for example the three different drift times for a nominal −5/2 charged monomer were interpreted as five times charged dimer, 10 times charged tetramer and 15 times charged hexamer. We reproduced these measurements and could similarly observe different drift times for m/z = 1806 in positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and negative ion mode (Inset in A). As our mass spectra show isotopic resolution we can nevertheless show that the alternative interpretation holds true: these drift times belong to different confirmations of only one oligomeric state – the dimer. This is true for all the species discussed in the work of Bowers and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore see no indication for tetramer or hexamer in the drift time plots of these mass peaks, and only very low intensity higher oligomers in the mass spectra. For comparison we investigated insulin, a protein, which is known to aggregate to a hexamer in the presence of zinc ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodson et al., 1979</xref>) B shows LILBID results and C shows nESI results of insulin (10 µM insulin in 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer), both without (i) and with (ii) 1.5-fold excess of zinc respectively. Without zinc some aggregation can be seen with both methods, albeit more of the higher oligomers are retained in the LILBID spectrum, which is similar to our observations for Aβ<sub>42</sub> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">9</xref>). Upon addition of zinc the oligomer distribution shifts to a dominant hexamer, which is clearly visible in both mass spectra. In contrast the hexamer appears in low intensity only for Aβ<sub>42</sub>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59306-app1-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparision of Aβ<sub>42</sub> wt and mutant F19P.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the IM spectrum of the 5-times charged dimeric wildtype Aβ<sub>42</sub> (<bold>i</bold>) with that of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> mutant F19P (ii) shows loss of the DB structure for the later one. (<bold>B</bold>) TEM images of both species show that this goes along with the loss of the characteristic fibrillary structures, which can only be seen for Aβ<sub>42</sub> wt.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59306-app1-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig4" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 4.</label><caption><title>CIU of the trimer, tetramer and pentamer species.</title><p>The schemes indicate the different species (folded and unfolded MB and DB structure).

We removed the respective mentioning of OR2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Oligomer stability is size-dependent”: The author should add more CIU graphs for all the oligomers, for the explanation &quot;For all oligomers the higher charge states show unfolding for both species&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We added the requested CIU graphs in Appendix 1—figure 4.
