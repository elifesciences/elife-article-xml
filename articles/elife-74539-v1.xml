future research into novel approaches for enhancing human longevity. The cave-adapted Mexican tetra, <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>, has attracted interest as a model system for <italic>metabolic resilience</italic>, a term we use to denote the property of maintaining health and longevity under conditions that would be highly deleterious in other organisms (Figure 1). Cave-dwelling populations of Mexican tetra exhibit elevated blood glucose, insulin resistance and hypertrophic visceral adipocytes compared to surface-dwelling counterparts. However, cavefish appear to avoid pathologies typically associated with these conditions, such as accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and chronic tissue inflammation. The metabolic strategies underlying the resilience properties of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cavefish, and how they relate to environmental challenges of the cave environment, are poorly understood. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomics study of long- and short-term fasting in two <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cave populations and one surface population. We find that, although the metabolome of cavefish bears many similarities with pathological conditions such as metabolic syndrome, cavefish also exhibit features not commonly associated with a pathological condition, and in some cases considered indicative of an overall robust metabolic condition. These include a reduction in cholesteryl esters and intermediates of protein glycation, and an increase in antioxidants and metabolites associated with hypoxia and longevity. This work suggests that certain metabolic features associated with human pathologies are either not intrinsically harmful, or can be counteracted by reciprocal adaptations. We provide a transparent pipeline for reproducing our analysis and a Shiny app for other researchers to explore and visualize our dataset.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Astyanax mexicanus</kwd><kwd>cavefish</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>non-traditional model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Metabolic syndrome | Obesity | Metabolomics | Extreme adaptation | Evolution</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2AG071466-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohner</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EDGE 1923372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohner</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolomics data reveals unique metabolic insights into how cavefish adapt to nutrient limited environments while staying healthy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolism plays a central role in many cellular processes, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of many disease states, including cancer, obesity, and diabetes. Recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cirulli et al., 2019</xref>) has shown that certain health effects, particularly cardiovascular disease, can be predicted from metabolic signatures prior to clinical manifestations. This suggests that metabolic dysregulation has causal influence over the disease state of an organism, and conversely disease may be preventable via metabolic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rubino et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>An evolutionary system with particularly extreme changes in metabolic regulation is the Mexican tetra, <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>, which has undergone considerable physiological and behavioral changes to colonize a number of subterranean caves in the Sierra de El Abra region of Mexico. Cavefish have evolved a suite of metabolic phenotypes to cope with the cave environment, including lower metabolic rate, increased appetite, fat storage, and starvation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hüppop, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). Cavefish are also insulin resistant, hyperglycemic, and exhibit increased caloric intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>), a feature often associated with decreased longevity. A notable genomic feature in Pachón and Tinaja cavefish is a mutation in the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>) that, in humans, is linked to Rabson-Mendenhall (RM) syndrome, a form of severe insulin resistance that causes many developmental abnormalities and typically progresses to ketoacidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, cavefish do not appear to suffer any of the adverse effects of RM, lack advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>) normally associated with hyperglycemia, and live long, healthy lives without ill-effects of metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> may provide natural solutions to overcome the challenges associated with adverse metabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan and Rohner, 2019</xref>).</p><p>From an evolutionary standpoint, survival in the cave environment requires resistance to long periods of nutrient deprivation. This, in turn, leads to storage of excess energy in fat and glycerol, which are themselves potentially harmful to the host organism. We hypothesize that survival in the cave environment thus requires multiple, counterbalancing evolutionary changes and that the combined effect of these changes is to make cavefish resilient to a variety of metabolic conditions, of which starvation and triglyceride / sugar accumulation are discrete examples.</p><p>We thus sought to characterize the metabolic signature of resilience by examining the metabolome of Pachón and Tinaja cavefish (two recently derived cave populations) compared to surface-dwelling populations using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) of primary metabolites and lipids. We characterized the response of energetically important tissues (the liver, muscle, and brain) of each population in short/long-term fasted, and fed conditions. We demonstrate that metabolite profiles in Pachón and Tinaja cavefish are more similar to each other than surface fish in each feeding state / tissue combination, highlighting the role of parallel evolution in shaping the metabolome of cavefish. We identify metabolic signatures and metabolites exhibiting the most pronounced regulatory changes within each tissue, population, and feeding state. We constructed inter-population and inter-feeding state comparisons and fit separate statistical models to each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cavefish exhibit many similarities with metabolic syndrome, but also differ from these conditions in terms of antioxidants, metabolites associated with cellular respiration / the electron transport chain, and unexpectedly reduced levels of cholesteryl esters.</p><p>Our results lay the groundwork to explore the mechanistic roles of metabolites and pathways in the nutrient availability-related adaptations of cavefish and suggest that natural evolutionary systems may offer insights into metabolic function by showing how disease states can be altered or counterbalanced under a genetic background more suited to a different set of parameters governing metabolic state.</p><p>In order to aid others in reproducing our analysis, we have provided a pipeline to reproduce all major figures and results on this paper that are derived from our metabolomics dataset at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1699">https://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1699</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://odr.stowers.org/LIBPB-1699">ftp://odr.stowers.org/LIBPB-1699</ext-link>).

Food scarcity is one of the cave’s harshest evolutionary pressures. Cavefish have specialized feeding strategies and fat metabolism that helps them thrive in the cave environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeffery, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hüppop, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). We raised age-matched offspring of Surface (river) fish, and Pachón and Tinaja cavefish morphs originating from two independent cave colonizations. To understand how the cavefish metabolome adapts to ecologically relevant food challenges, we separated Surface, Pachón and Tinaja populations into three different groups at 4 months: 30 day fasted, 4 day fasted, and “Refed” (fed at 3 hr prior to collection after 4 days without food) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We also show RNA-Seq validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table s2) of the main themes observed from the metabolomic data.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic resilience — survivability under a variety of extreme conditions.</title><p>Certain populations of cavefish have adaptations that cause increased appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>) and increased fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>) (in cases where nutrients are plentiful, such as in lab-raised populations). These same populations also exhibit robust health and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>) and do not suffer ill-effects due to high levels of visceral fat and hyperglycemia, both of which are features of most cave populations. However, visceral fat accumulation in cave populations is highly dependent on nutrient availability and is not displayed in wild-caught specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, cavefish paradoxically appear to tolerate both extremely low and extremely high levels of triglycerides, glucose, and other energy storage metabolites. We argue that these differences can be reconciled under a hypothesis whereby the cave environment selects not for resistance to nutrient deprivation per se, but rather <italic>resilience</italic> to a variety of nutrient availability states (such as seasonal floods). Survival under such challenging conditions ostensibly favors the ability to tolerate extreme metabolic states, including not only starvation but also high levels of potentially deleterious metabolites such as triglycerides and reactive oxygen species (ROS). We find evidence for elevated antioxidant levels and altered cholesterol / cholesteryl ester homeostasis in cavefish, suggesting that cavefish may use these mechanisms to offset potentially harmful metabolites and tolerate a broad range of metabolic conditions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74539-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup for each tissue and metabolite category.</title><p>Pachón, Tinaja, and surface <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> fry were raised for 4 months and then separated evenly into fasted (30–day) and non–fasted groups.

Some lipid and primary metabolite categories show a clear separation between different populations (e.g. carbohydrates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and glycerophospholipids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, across most tissues), whereas other categories have a less pronounced change (amino acids in the brain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and fatty acyls in most tissues). In order to quantify separation of feeding states as a function of population and metabolite category, we used a supervised machine learning method based on orthogonal projection of latent structures (O–PLS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then used O–PLS to remove ‘orthogonal’ variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trygg and Wold, 2002</xref>) from each metabolite category and fit a Bayesian logistic regression model to the de-noised data (Supplemental Methods).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Global trends in lipid and primary metabolite data.</title><p>To visualize overall patterns in the metabolome of different experimental groups, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) first on all lipids and primary metabolites (<bold>A,B</bold>), then on individual categories thereof (<bold>C,D</bold>).

We sought to identify metabolites that could be responsible for the drastic change in phenotype of cave populations. Sugars and sugar phosphates are important energy metabolites and hence candidates for adaptations related to resistance to nutrient deprivation. This class of metabolites displays a dramatic change during short- and long-term fasting, particularly in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Transcriptomics data from multiple studies by our group also displays an overall trend toward upregulation of sugar metabolism in cavefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Extreme alterations to sugar metabolites in cave vs surface populations.</title><p>To show differences in cavefish sugar metabolism, we selected 5- and 6-carbon sugars, sugar phosphates, and uronic acids (oxidized forms of sugars that form building blocks of proteoglycans). The row axis shows metabolites within each of these classes, and the column axis shows different populations (short range, labels at bottom), feeding states (medium-range, labels at top) and tissues (long-range, labels at topmost point). Color indicates the mTIC-normalized peak intensity for the average of six biological replicates. Red indicates the maximum value for a given row (i.e. across all populations, tissues, and feeding states), whereas navy blue (the bottom of the color bar) corresponds to a peak intensity of zero, not to the minimum value. Thus, dark cells correspond to very little / zero intensity, as opposed to simply corresponding to the minimum intensity within the row. Given that mTIC intensities are ‘semi–quantitative’, red values thus correspond to the most abundant group for a given metabolite, and navy blue corresponds to lack of abundance.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74539-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Hepatic glucose production is derived from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, the latter relying on stored glycogen, which is quickly exhausted during fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that hepatic gluconeogenesis likely plays a role in sustaining survival under long-term nutrient deprivation in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>. Surprisingly, surface fish also show stable (albeit generally lower) sugar levels in the liver under different feeding states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that sugar production in the liver may be driven by overall demand rather than supply. This may point to a shift from oxidative to sugar-based metabolism as an energy source in energetically expensive tissues. Cavefish possess a larger amount of body fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>), and hence have a larger pool of glycerol to serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. We find that both cave populations exhibit decreased levels of glycerol in the 30-day fasted state, particularly in Tinaja (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicating increased consumption of this intermediate as a substrate for gluconeogenesis may be the source of increased sugar / sugar phosphate abundance in cave populations.</p><p>Regardless of the substrates leading to sugar metabolite accumulation, it is clear that a large difference exists between cave and surface populations within this class of metabolites. However, the specifics of this alteration to sugar metabolism appear to be population-specific, with Tinaja showing a large increase in sugar phosphates and Pachón showing an increase in unphosphorylated sugars respectively in short/long-term fasted states in comparison to surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Other tissues show a mixed response, with muscle displaying increased levels of most sugar phosphates in Pachón but decreased levels of fructose-1-phosphate in both cave populations with respect to surface. The brain displays low levels of sugar / sugar phosphate metabolites overall but possesses increased sugar metabolite abundance in cave populations for certain metabolites and feeding states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>While the levels of most simple sugars and sugar phosphates are increased in cavefish with respect to surface, the levels of gluconic acid and glucoronic acid show the opposite pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Gluconic acid and glucoronic acid belong to uronic acids, a class of sugar acids that are major building blocks of proteoglycans. It has previously been observed that <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cave morphs lack advanced glycation end products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>), which are a defining feature of diabetes and are normally associated with chronic hyperglycemia in humans. Altered metabolism of sugar acids in cavefish may play a role in inhibiting excessive protein glycation and the adverse health effects thereof.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ascorbate</title><p>A highly unexpected and unexplained feature of our analysis is the abundance of vitamin C, particularly in its oxidized form dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), across all tissues in cave populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Ascorbic acid (AA), the reduced, active form, is also more prevalent in muscle tissue. DHAA can be recycled back to AA using reducing cofactors such as NADH and NADPH, which can in turn be regenerated from the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle using simple sugars (which cavefish possess in great abundance). For this reason, vitamin C content in food labeling is usually reported as the sum of AA and DHAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Thus, cavefish possess a larger total ‘pool’ of vitamin C (including interconvertible oxidized and reduced forms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The cave and surface fish metabolome highlights differences in antioxidant availability and oxidative metabolism.</title><p>To analyze changes in redox metabolism in cave populations, we compared the abundance of potent antioxidants and redox-linked metabolites.

The increased appetite could cause cavefish to consume more overall food, which could be responsible for the AA/DHAA increase in the refed state. However, this does not pertain to the 30-day fasted state, where AA/DHAA levels are also elevated across all tissues. There is widespread consensus that teleosts, like humans, lack the ability to produce AA endogenously due to the absence of gulonolactone oxidase, which catalyzes the final step in AA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ching et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, this enzyme is a pseudogene, whereas in teleosts the gene is absent entirely, thought to be lost in the distant evolutionary past. Thus, the additional AA/DHAA supply likely comes from selective reuptake in the kidney, a process that also occurs in humans to conserve AA/DHAA, or it may be produced by commensal microbiota in cavefish. Trace amounts of AA/DHAA in the feed used in the aquatics facility used to house the fish in this experiment may recirculate throughout the water filtration system and be redistributed to all tanks, including those housing fish in the fasted groups. Nevertheless, it remains that even in the case of circulating trace amounts of AA/DHAA, cavefish appear to exhibit selective retainment of AA/DHAA in larger quantities.</p><p>The advantages of AA conservation in adaptation to an environment where prolonged starvation is common are self-evident. AA is involved in collagen formation, and its deficiency leads major loss of integrity of connective tissue. Thus, the ability to retain what little ascorbate is present in underground cave environments would confer an enormous survival advantage to fish.</p><p>Another factor that could influence the AA/DHAA ratio is the effect of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on the GLUT family of transporters, particularly GLUT4 in adipose/muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Czech, 2007</xref>). DHAA competes with glucose for transport across the membrane by GLUT4, whereas AA is taken up by Na<sup>+</sup> transporters. GLUT4 activity is dependent on membrane translocation and this process is dysregulated in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaldin-Fincati et al., 2017</xref>). This combination of elevated blood sugar and insulin resistance suggests that GLUT4 could be less active in cavefish and cause DHAA to accumulate in the extracellular space. AA/DHAA have also been reported to influence C-reactive protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2003</xref>) and protein glycation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2013</xref>), prompting further investigation into <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> as a model of diabetes-related resilience.

Cave populations of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> have been previously reported to exhibit pronounced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>), but do not accumulate advanced glycation end products and do not appear to have diminished longevity.</p><p>In order to compare the metabolome of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cave populations to the known metabolic signatures of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cirulli et al., 2019</xref>), we calculated changes in lipid categories (the coarsest abstraction used in LipidMaps), classes (a more detailed partitioning scheme used in LipidMaps), and, within free fatty acids specifically, the degree of saturation. The metabolome displays a remarkable overlap with the proinflammatory signature associated with obesity that, in humans, leads to insulin resistance. This signature consists of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref> the elevation of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in muscle in most feeding states, which have a direct and pronounced proinflammatory effect in mammals through the recruitment of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glass and Olefsky, 2012</xref>), although the importance of fatty acid release in insulin resistance is disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morigny et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karpe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>) abundance of ceramides in muscle in all feeding states, which are known direct mediators of insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glass and Olefsky, 2012</xref>). Indeed, the only feeding state for which skeletal muscle did not display increased SFA abundance was 30-day fasting, which could simply indicate the exhaustion of free SFA pools. Additionally, palmitate, a precursor of ceramide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glass and Olefsky, 2012</xref>), is elevated in muscle in all feeding states. Sphingoid bases are significantly more abundant in muscle in all feeding states, suggesting generally upregulated sphingolipid biosynthesis in cave populations.</p><p>In contrast to proinflammatory metabolites, omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) such as DHA and EPA have protective effects against inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paschoal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glass and Olefsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). These molecules bind to the GRP120 receptor on macrophages and adipocytes, and the activated receptor then modulates the activity of PPARγ and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paschoal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). ω-3 FAs are less abundant in the liver under 4-day fasting and are generally not upregulated in most feeding states and tissues. Thus, ω-3 FAs do not appear to offset for the proinflammatory signature of cavefish SFA and ceramide signatures, suggesting that cavefish possess an alternate compensatory mechanism to prevent chronic tissue inflammation. Overall, cavefish appear to exhibit many metabolic similarities with obesity and health conditions associated with it.</p><p>However, this is not a universal trend. Cirulli et al. report a strong association between urate levels and BMI, likely due to insulin resistance interfering with uric acid secretion in the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cirulli et al., 2019</xref>. In contrast, cavefish appear to have significantly reduced levels of uric acid in muscle, and in other tissues levels are comparable with surface except for a small but significant increase in Pachón liver during fasted states. Mannose, which is associated with obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cirulli et al., 2019</xref>), was abundant in the Pachón liver in all feeding states, but was reduced in Tinaja compared to surface fish.</p><p>Finally, cholesteryl esters and cholesterol in some feeding states (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), were less abundant in cave populations. Using a previously published gene expression dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnan et al., 2022</xref>), we investigated factors that might influence levels of cholesteryl esters. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which transports cholesterol in / out of lipoproteins, is downregulated in both Pachón and Tinaja compared to surface fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting a potential causal relationship between lower cholesteryl ester levels in cave populations and this important carrier protein. A human variant of CETP associated with decreased serum levels of the protein and larger low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle sizes has been linked to exceptional longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzilai et al., 2003</xref>). The LDL / HDL cholesterol ratio, mediated in part by CETP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christison et al., 1995</xref>), is a major contributor to risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brousseau et al., 2004</xref>). The reliance on triglycerides as an energy source in cavefish may increase the risk of arterial disease by providing an abundance of free fatty acids and other lipids. Cholesteryl esters, in particular, are formed from esterification of a fatty acid and cholesterol, are a major constituent of foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), and, for certain lipid species, show a large difference in abundance between cavefish and surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Inhibition of CETP has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk, ostensibly by altering the partitioning of cholesteryl esters between LDL and HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barter and Rye, 2012</xref>). Indeed, lipid homeostasis in zebrafish exhibits strong similarities with human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2014</xref>), and zebrafish express CETP whereas other model organisms such as mice do not.

LDL and VLDL have higher triglyceride content as compared to HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and García-Palmieri, 2011</xref>) and VLDL is a substrate for lipoprotein lipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freeman and Walford, 2016</xref>), which liberates free fatty acids from triglycerides.

We further hypothesized that certain metabolites may have an important role in cave adaptation. Pachón and Tinaja represent independently derived populations, and we reasoned that a test for parallel adaptation should be selective for metabolites that show the same differential feeding state response pattern across cave populations (e.g. differentially increased in both Pachón and Tinaja fasted states relative to surface).

Studies that focus on the impact of food deprivation on oxidative stress in fish show that prolonged starvation decreases the capacity of fish to ameliorate oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furne and Sanz, 2017</xref>). Glutathione is a major antioxidant that detoxifies ROS and thereby prevents cellular damage from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pompella et al., 2003</xref>). Cavefish face prolonged periods of nutrient deprivation in their natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>). Adaptation to the cave environment may have led to changes in glutathione metabolism in cavefish to protect against oxidative stress under prolonged fasting. Indeed, in an earlier study we were able to demonstrate that cavefish show an increased expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of glutathione, which is indicative of an increased stress level compared to surface fish in their natural habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>).Here, we can confirm that these trends in gene expression are accompanied by elevation of reduced glutathione in the liver and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We did not observe a significant increase of glutathione in the surface fish in the fasted states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Guided by these observations, we further attempted to characterize the role of altered antioxidant and cholesterol metabolism in cavefish. In particular, we hypothesized that cavefish resilience to widely varying nutrient levels is driven by a robust antioxidant system that prevents the accumulation of ROS under conditions of stress (e.g. induced by fasting).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined ROS state in the liver under a subset of our original fasting experiment using similarly aged fish. ROS accumulation has been shown to cause lethal levels of cell damage in flies, but such damage can be prevented via oral administration of antioxidants or over-expression of antioxidant-producing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaccaro et al., 2020</xref>). This caused us to ask whether naturally elevated antioxidant levels in cavefish might protect against starvation-induced ROS accumulation. We reasoned that the most extreme changes are observed between 30-fasted and 4-day fasted +refed groups, and that given the similarity in Pachón and Tinaja antioxidant profiles, one cave population would be sufficient for validation. We thus repeated the fasting experiment using only 30-day fasted and 4-day fasted +refed groups, and using only Pachón and surface populations.</p><p>Using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, we examined different populations and feeding states for ROS level. While liver sections of fasted / refed fish did not show differences in cytoplasmic / nuclear localization of DHE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–E</xref>), a quantitative analysis showed that, under 30-day fasting, juvenile Pachón cavefish exhibit lower levels of ROS in cytoplasm as compared to surface under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that elevated antioxidants in cavefish may have a protective effect by neutralizing active ROS and may have arisen as an adaptation allowing cavefish to tolerate ROS produced by long periods of nutrient deprivation. We did not observe significant differences in DHE nuclear intensity for either the cytoplasm or the nucleus, suggesting that 30 days of fasting may not be sufficient to produce salient differences in the nucleus for juvenile fish. The known resilience properties of antioxidants may also help explain the metabolic resilience of cavefish by providing a buffer against different forms of stress.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>ROS levels in refed / fasted liver via DHE staining.</title><p>Pachón cavefish and surface fish were fasted for 30 days and livers were removed and stained with dihydroethidium (DHE), a blue-fluorescent dye that fluoresces red when oxidized and serves as an indicator of the presence of superoxide radicals.

Analysis of three separate transcriptomic experiments conducted by our group also points to important changes in key genes, such as glutathione S-transferase, being consistently upregulated in cavefish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-Table S2). Combined with the findings presented here, this suggests that response oxidative stress is indeed an important factor in cavefish physiology.</p><p>Antioxidant levels in cavefish may have evolved as a strategy to allow cavefish to tolerate variation in nutrient availability, as a means of controlling inflammation caused by deleterious energy metabolites, as a way of inhibiting atherogenesis, or several of these effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>A. mexicanus</italic> has been advanced as a model of resilience under ostensibly pathological conditions including hyperglycemia, diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan and Rohner, 2019</xref>), and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we have provided a large, untargeted study of the metabolome of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> surface fish and two cave populations in order to investigate the molecular underpinnings of these adaptations.</p><p>We were particularly interested in the role of metabolism in cave adaptation of the two <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cavefish populations in this study: Pachón and Tinaja. This suggests that parallel adaptation to cave environments requires satisfying certain common metabolic needs that are an inherent part of the niche. The obvious candidate for this evolutionary conflux is adaptation to a low-nutrient environment. However, metabolic strategies for survival in such environments are not currently well-understood. We found that drastic alterations in energy metabolism, together with shifts in mediators of redox metabolism and ascorbate, an essential vitamin which is lacking in the cave environment, constitute a major feature of cave adaptation in these populations.</p><p>Cavefish appear to have substantially altered sugar metabolism, and exhibit higher levels of sugars and sugar phosphates. However, the opposite trend occurs for uronic acids, which are the oxidized forms of simple reducing sugars and can be formed enzymatically or non-enzymatically. This incongruency can be resolved by noting the overall trend to decreased reliance on oxidative metabolism (and enzymes that catalyze oxidative processes) and increased reliance on sugar metabolism. This trend stems from sugars and sugar phosphates, antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-KG (which has been shown to inhibit the electron transport chain in <italic>C. elegans</italic>). Due to drastic fluctuation in oxygen level in the subterranean niche, cavefish may rely on a shift from oxidative to predominantly sugar-derived energy metabolism, as compared to their surface-dwelling cousins. Reduction in uronic acids, which are derived from sugars using oxidative processes, can thus be seen as part of this trend. However, the specific reduction of uronic acids in particular may have an additional survival benefit for cavefish by inhibiting protein glycation and thus preventing accumulation of advanced glycation end products. Further investigation is required to fully understand the evolutionary and physiological implications of these metabolic changes.</p><p>Further work is required to establish the extent of hypoxic conditions in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> evolution. However, we also find that certain redox-related metabolites, including <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-KG, glutathione, and ascorbate, all exhibit distinctive abundance patterns in cavefish. These patterns may be in response to hypoxia, poor nutrient conditions, differences in metabolic rate, or some other aspect of the cave niche.</p><p>Our data indicate that upregulation of glucose and long-chain fatty acid production is a common feature shared by Pachón and Tinaja cave populations, suggesting that certain cave habitats do require considerable changes in energy metabolism. Pachón and Tinaja likely have a greater reliance on fat stores for locomotion, as evidenced by increased SFA content in muscle in fasting and refeeding. The decrease of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mtext>-</mml:mtext><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> FAs during fasting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) coupled with the increase of palmitate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in long- vs short-term fasting suggests that cavefish metabolism may be preferentially biased toward storing caloric intake as energy-rich saturated fatty acids. Whether cavefish possess adaptations to counteract the deleterious effects of high body fat, such as suppression of orotic acid (a metabolite implicated in steatosis in the liver), requires further investigation.</p><p>In summary, <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> troglomorphic populations share many metabolic similarities with known pathological conditions such as obesity, but also display important differences which may help to explain their resistance to negative effects of these pathologies. We also found important differences in ascorbate, which is known to serve diverse physiological roles, nicotinamide, which is a precursor to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> synthesis and hence is related to oxidative metabolism, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-ketoglutarate, which has been implicated in longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chin et al., 2014</xref>). We have shown via ROS staining that Pachòn cavefish do possess lower levels of superoxide radicals in the liver after 30 days of fasting. This confirms that increased antioxide levels in cavefish do indeed correlate with physiological state, and suggests that selection in cave environments favors resistance to oxidative stress. Whether selective pressure is driven chiefly by starvation resistance, or whether it is a mechanism to offset oxidized LDL and other harmful metabolites is an open question.</p><p><italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cave populations clearly exhibit altered lipoprotein composition and expression of CETP, an important component of lipid homeostasis.

However, there are limitations to our approach. Our analysis was based on juvenile, pre-sexually mature fish. We chose this developmental time point under the hypothesis that evolutionary changes in metabolism would tend to act early to respond to the selective pressure of the cave environment and positive juvenile fish for robust starvation resistance. However, an age of 5 months does not necessarily coincide with seasonally-correlated food shortages, and hence manifestations of starvation adaptations may not occur until a later developmental stage. We also did not examine a fasting duration of greater than 1 month, despite the potential for longer periods of nutrient deprivation in cave environments.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our goals for this study were (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>) to provide a comprehensive untargeted study of primary metabolites and lipids in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>, an extreme-adapted organism with important connections to metabolic disease, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>) examine the molecular basis for low-nutrient adaptation in cave-dwelling subpopulations, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>) identify metabolic changes that might explain <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> longevity in the face of a phenotype with properties linked to metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Our findings show that the adaptation to a low nutrient environment in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> is linked to extreme changes in sugar and fat metabolism, and that increased reliance on these energy sources in the liver provides for the needs of the organism during nutrient availability fluctuations.</p><p>All in all, our results highlight the role of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> as an evolutionary example of extreme metabolism and suggest important roles for certain metabolites in fish and other species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Surface morphs of <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> were reared from offspring of Mexican surface fish collected in the Río Choy.

Fish were the result of a group mating event within populations. Fish were housed only with members of their population for their entire lives. At 4 months (Tinaja), 4 months and 1 day (Pachón), 4 months and 2 days (Surface), fish of each population were separated into two tanks. 12 fish were separated and starved for 30 days until tissue collection. The 12 fish were maintained on regular feeding schedules until 4 days prior to tissue collection when food was withheld from each population’s regular feeding tank. The mass (g) and length (cm) of each fish was recorded at separation. All efforts were made to equalize mass and length distributions in each cohort. On the evening before tissue collection, 6 fish from the 4-day starved tank were separated and placed into three, 3L-tanks. Tanks were divided down the middle such that all 6 fish (2 in each tank) were housed individually. Singly housed fish were refed for 3 hr with 10 mg of Gemma 500 on the morning of the dissection day for each population. Dissection occurred at 5 months (October 5th, 2019; Tinaja), 5 months and 1 day (October 6th, 2019; Pachón), 5 months and 2 days (October 7th, 2019; Surface). Fish were re-fed in intervals between 8:30am and 12:00pm. At each 3 hr time point, a re-fed fish, a 4-day starved fish, and a 30-day starved fish was euthanized in MS-222. To reduce variability between populations dissected on subsequent days, all dissections took place between 11:30-3pm and were handled identically. Prior to dissection, the final mass and length were recorded for each fish. The liver, muscle, and brain were dissected and placed in 1.5 mL plastic tubes.

First, the sum of all peak heights for all identified metabolites, excluding the unknowns, for each sample was calculated. Such peak sums are called ‘mTIC’ and represent the sum of genuine metabolites (identified compounds) in each sample. This method avoids unidentified peaks that could represent potentially non-biological artifacts such as column bleed, contaminants, or routine machine maintenance. mTIC averages for each sample were compared to determine if the variance between samples was significantly different (p&lt;0.05). Samples were then normalized to the average mTIC ‘mTICaverage’ within populations (Surface, Pachón, or Tinaja) and within organs (brain, muscle, or liver). For example, each biological replicate of the Tinaja brain group was normalized to the average mTIC of all Tinaja brain replicates regardless of feeding state. The equation (a) below was then used to normalize each metabolite (i) of a sample (j). After normalization, data are reported as ‘relative semi-quantifications’ or normalized peak heights.<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mpadded width="+1.7pt"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mpadded><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mtext>(normalized)</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>mTIC</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>mTIC</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the raw peak intensity for metabolite <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:msub><mml:mi>mTIC</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the average identified peak intensity in sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>mTIC</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> is the global average identified peak intensity, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mTIC-normalized intensity of metabolite <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Metabolite categorization</title><p>Metabolites were categorized according to their respective subclass classification in the human metabolite database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>) (if the subclass was absent, we instead used the superclass of the respective metabolite).

We were specifically interested in marginal p-values of each individual metabolite, hence we constructed separate single-covariate models for each metabolite or lipid. Models were further based on different types of comparisons: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspiras et al., 2015</xref>) we compared different feeding states within a given population and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>) different populations within a given feeding state. Logistic regression models (and GLMs in general) tend to suffer from complete separation of observed covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). This renders maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters impossible. We therefore used the bayesglm function of the arm R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelman et al., 2008</xref>) to obtain estimates for model coefficients, even in the case of complete separation. The bayesglm requires specifying a prior distribution. We found that the highly conservative default prior corresponding to a an assumption that the response to a change in input should typically not exceed roughly ±5 on the logistic scale, or, equivalently, no typical change in input should cause a shift in probability from 0.01 to 0.50, or 0.50–0.99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelman et al., 2008</xref>) was sufficient to identify important metabolic changes in our comparisons. However, given the conservative nature of this prior distribution, we did not perform FDR correction.</p><p>We first split the input dataset into two matrices: one containing populations as category labels (bottom left), and one containing feeding states as category labels (upper right). We then subset each of these into the three possible pairwise comparisons from each group, compute z-score-normalized values within the comparison, filter the resulting matrix using O-PLS to remove orthogonal noise, and use the bayesglm function to fit a model to the respective comparison for discriminating either populations (within a given feeding state) or feeding states (within a given population). In each case, the GLM consists of a single covariant corresponding to metabolite / lipid peak heights (for individual metabolites) or classes of metabolites / lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Differences between feeding states and shared metabolites</title><p>To identify metabolites that might play a role in cave adaptation, we sought to fit logistic regression to an input capturing the difference between refed and starved samples and differences between cave and surface populations simultaneous.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Dario Riccardo Valenzano as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1 and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This work lays out a series of plausible associations between metabolic states in cave populations – based on metabolomics analyses of different organs – and cavefish biology.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are based almost exclusively on metabolomics data. The reviewers feel that it would be very important to validate these results with alternative techniques (ex. transcriptomic analysis).</p><p>The title is misleading. It's not entirely clear whether the metabolomic analysis informs us into how metabolic resilience is achieved in cavefish. Hence, the word &quot;resilience&quot; should be removed from the title. Also, to be factual about in which species these results were obtained, the name &quot;cavefish&quot; (or Mexican tetra) should be featured in the title.</p><p>We would like to request major changes to this manuscript, in order to be further considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The most relevant points are:</p><p>1. An independent validation of the metabolomics results (see reviewers comments).</p><p>2. An explanation about impact of fish age or include age as a potential confounder for the analyses. At least the authors should raise caveats about age differences among groups.</p><p>3. Remove Figure 2 or provide a clearer representation of their results.</p><p>4.

Perform/report about multiple testing correction – provide a power calculation for the number of fish/tissues used to mitigate for the lack of experimental validation.</p><p>7. Openly address their vision in terms of physiological adaptations/positive selection vs. alternative evolutionary paths that might have led to cavefish specific phenotypic spectrum (including metabolism).</p><p>8. All reviewers feel the paper should be re-written as a resource paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is well-written, but there are important points I'd like to bring up, which can strengthen it. It is clearly a resource paper, rather than a &quot;finding-strong&quot; work. This should be made more explicit.</p><p>The title is misleading. I am not entirely convinced this metabolomic analysis informs us into how metabolic resilience is achieved in cavefish. I suggest removing the word &quot;Resilience&quot; from the title. Also, I suggest the name &quot;cavefish&quot; should be featured in the title.</p><p>There is no attempt to go beyond association between metabolic states and functional metabolic &quot;adaptations&quot; (which is OK, descriptive work is important).</p><p>It is not clear what these adaptations the authors speak about are exactly. Are they adaptations to lack of nutrients, light, different temperature in the cave environment, all of the above?</p><p>I find this work is generally well conducted; however, often the experimental approaches are presented as results (e.g. Figure 3). The authors should separate better the methods section from the results part. The first paragraph of the Results section does not necessarily belongs to the results part. It is about &quot;what was done&quot;, rather than &quot;here is question A, here is our approach, here is the result, here is our comment/interpretation of the result&quot;.</p><p>Figure 3 has basically no clear message, other than &quot;what was done&quot; and how the samples separate. I figure the message is &quot;cavefish populations clusters closer to one another than to the surface population based on a, b and c. Perhaps this should be stated declaratively in the caption.</p><p>In Figure 2 there is a possible typo: &quot;Experimental setup (A) and PCA…&quot;. I do not see any PCA, if this refers to Principal Component Analysis. Perhaps this caption is the relict of an older version of the figure? Please amend.</p><p>Generally, I am un-easy with the use of the phrase &quot;evolved populations&quot;. Also surface populations are evolved. Perhaps &quot;recently derived&quot; would be more apt?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As a result of using metabolomics without further validation or further going into at least one aspect of the findings in much more detail using other techniques, the manuscript lacks impact and the conclusions drawn are very speculative. At the very least I would like to see the main metabolites identified to be different validated using another method to be able to confidently draw conclusions. But to increase the impact of the results for the field, I would ideally like to see further experiments to investigate one of the main findings in detail.</p><p>Have power calculations been used to determine sample size? an n of 6 seems low for metabolomics with the observed variations to be able to draw the conclusions drawn. This needs to be shown and sample size needs to be justified/increased. This is extra relevant because of the lack of validation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74539.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This work lays out a series of plausible associations between metabolic states in cave populations – based on metabolomics analyses of different organs – and cavefish biology.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are based almost exclusively on metabolomics data.

An independent validation of the metabolomics results (see reviewers comments).</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this point, we have added Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, which include three RNA-Seq datasets (one of which is age-matched to this study). The transcriptomics data confirms the main themes of the metabolomics data – alterations of sugar and antioxidant metabolism. We discuss in the text how these trends vary between the different transcriptomics datasets. Steady-state levels of metabolites are, of course, a function of many variables, and hence RNA-Seq data can only be used for qualitative comparisons (barring building a complex model), but we find the sugar and antioxidant metabolism gene signatures encouraging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An explanation about impact of fish age or include age as a potential confounder for the analyses. At least the authors should raise caveats about age differences among groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The new data added in point (1) above includes an RNA-Seq dataset that is exactly age-matched with the fish in this study, which helps address this point. Furthermore, as part of our resubmission, we have removed data that we feel to be extraneous and does not contribute to the theme of the main text (a metabolomic survey of surface and cave populations of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>), and as a result some of the non-age matched results have also been removed. We have noted age differences where still applicable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Tone down the mechanistic relevance of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ objective assessment of the findings. Upon consideration of the reviewer comments, we agree that the findings presented here to not meet the standards required to draw mechanistic conclusions and have attempted to remove mechanistic language and speculative comparisons from the manuscript. We hope future studies will establish connections between the these metabolic trends and mechanistic details of cave adaptation. We believe establishing <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cell lines will help elucidate these mechanisms (cell lines are particularly useful because of the availability of gene editing tools, whereas gene editing in fish embryos is technically challenging). This is an effort that our group is actively engaged in but will take some time to achieve.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Fix/address inconsistency of Figure 5 (fructose upregulation in the brain).</p></disp-quote><p>We regret any confusion caused by Figure 5 (now Figure 4) and have renormalized it on a per-tissue basis to show the trend in brain fructose levels. The figure now clearly shows that fructose levels are higher in cave populations. As an aside, the fructose comment was a comparison against naked mole-rats. As several reviewers observed, these comparisons are speculative, and we removed them for this reason (hence the original comment related to fructose no longer exists in the current revision).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Perform/report about multiple testing correction – provide a power calculation for the number of fish/tissues used to mitigate for the lack of experimental validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the concerns raised by reviewers regarding the sample size below. Briefly, we are aware of the difficulty in drawing statistical conclusions for the sample configuration used in our study. We chose to split our budget between primary metabolites and lipids, and even so the combined dataset was considerably expensive to obtain (~$50k USD).</p><p>If we had instead chosen to focus on either primary metabolites or lipids, we could have employed a sample size of n=12, which is more statistically sound. However, given the exploratory nature of this work and the fact that this represents the first metabolomics study of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cavefish, we believe that a more comprehensive dataset is more useful than a smaller, but more statistically powerful dataset. We hope this manuscript will help guide future hypothesis-based mechanistic studies, rather than serve to confirm or reject a hypothesis based on statistics.</p><p>As for multiple testing correction, it is usually not applied to Bayesian analyses such as ours. We chose a Bayesian approach because we were unable to fit a frequentist GLM to our data (due to “perfect separation”). This confirms that sample size is an issue.</p><p>However, in Bayesian analyses, the choice of prior distribution can be thought of as a proxy for “false positives” (although false positives are a frequentist concept). In other words, reviewers who are more familiar with frequentist statistics can think of the choice of prior as a substitute for applying false discovery rate correction, and we hope our argument will convince the reviewers that our choice of prior can be used on lieu of a multiple testing correction.</p><p>The prior used by our analysis is highly conservative (spread across roughly ±5 of the logistic scale, see Gelman 2008 reference). Thus, reported statistics can be thought of as being a conservative estimate. A power analysis of a Bayesian GLM is beyond our technical abilities.</p><p>Finally, we hope this point is also addressed by our inclusion of multiple sets of RNA-Seq data (including age-matched data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Openly address their vision in terms of physiological adaptations/positive selection vs. alternative evolutionary paths that might have led to cavefish specific phenotypic spectrum (including metabolism).</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to clean up the manuscript and removing figures / data that did not support the main theme of metabolic characterization of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cave and surface fish, and we have also followed reviewer suggestions about removing references to positive selection. This cleaned-up version will hopefully offer a clearer picture of our main work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. All reviewers feel the paper should be re-written as a resource paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to resubmit the manuscript as a resource paper and agree that this article type is more appropriate. Upon investigation of formatting requirements for resource papers, we discovered that the current layout of the manuscript already meets the requirements of a resource paper, and the only additional requirement is to publish all source code under the OSI open-source definition. As with the initial submission, we have included a link for the reviewers to download the source code and will publish it publicly under an OSI-approved license pending acceptance of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper is well-written, but there are important points I'd like to bring up, which can strengthen it. It is clearly a resource paper, rather than a &quot;finding-strong&quot; work. This should be made more explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful for the reviewer’s suggestions. We have ensured the manuscript is compliant with <italic>eLife</italic> resource paper guidelines and toned down the mechanistic language.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title is misleading. I am not entirely convinced this metabolomic analysis informs us into how metabolic resilience is achieved in cavefish. I suggest removing the word &quot;Resilience&quot; from the title. Also, I suggest the name &quot;cavefish&quot; should be featured in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these suggestions and agree the title can be improved. The revised manuscript incorporates these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no attempt to go beyond association between metabolic states and functional metabolic &quot;adaptations&quot; (which is OK, descriptive work is important).</p><p>It is not clear what these adaptations the authors speak about are exactly. Are they adaptations to lack of nutrients, light, different temperature in the cave environment, all of the above?</p></disp-quote><p>While there are a number of adaptations in cavefish to all of the environmental challenges the reviewer mentioned, we believe the findings here most relate to (1) extreme nutrient scarcity (to be more explicit, long periods of nutrient scarcity interrupted by seasonal flooding) and (2) secondary conditions triggered by this (e.g., excess fat accumulation, which is normally detrimental). We believe changes in sugar metabolism are related to the former whereas changes in antioxidant metabolism are related to the latter. We have endeavored to better emphasize this point in the text, particularly in the third paragraph of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find this work is generally well conducted; however, often the experimental approaches are presented as results (e.g. Figure 3). The authors should separate better the methods section from the results part. The first paragraph of the Results section does not necessarily belongs to the results part. It is about &quot;what was done&quot;, rather than &quot;here is question A, here is our approach, here is the result, here is our comment/interpretation of the result&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon re-reading this paragraph we agree with the reviewer that it is out-of-place in the Results section, and we have moved it to the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 has basically no clear message, other than &quot;what was done&quot; and how the samples separate. I figure the message is &quot;cavefish populations clusters closer to one another than to the surface population based on a, b and c. Perhaps this should be stated declaratively in the caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the message of this figure can be more clearly stated. We have incorporated the reviewer’s suggestion and revised the figure caption to point out the sample association patterns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 there is a possible typo: &quot;Experimental setup (A) and PCA…&quot;. I do not see any PCA, if this refers to Principal Component Analysis. Perhaps this caption is the relict of an older version of the figure? Please amend.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer for catching this mistake! This did indeed refer to an earlier version of the manuscript. We have corrected the typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally, I am un-easy with the use of the phrase &quot;evolved populations&quot;. Also surface populations are evolved. Perhaps &quot;recently derived&quot; would be more apt?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point is well-taken, particularly in a metabolomic study which with no genetic component. We have made the suggested corrections to the manuscript and replaced all occurrences of “evolved populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As a result of using metabolomics without further validation or further going into at least one aspect of the findings in much more detail using other techniques, the manuscript lacks impact and the conclusions drawn are very speculative. At the very least I would like to see the main metabolites identified to be different validated using another method to be able to confidently draw conclusions. But to increase the impact of the results for the field, I would ideally like to see further experiments to investigate one of the main findings in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the need for additional validation. To this end, we have included several RNA-Seq datasets in Figure S1/2, including an age-matched dataset. While it is not possible to draw quantitative conclusions about the steady state levels of metabolites from alterations in gene expression (without a complex model), the main themes of our manuscript – alterations of antioxidant and sugar metabolites – are also represented in the transcriptional data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have power calculations been used to determine sample size? an n of 6 seems low for metabolomics with the observed variations to be able to draw the conclusions drawn. This needs to be shown and sample size needs to be justified/increased. This is extra relevant because of the lack of validation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that n=6 is probably too low. We made the decision to use a sub-optimal sample size in order to cover both primary metabolites and lipids, and even so the data acquired for this study was considerably expensive (~50k USD). If we had instead covered only one of the two, we could have used n=12, but given the exploratory nature of this work we elected to cover more metabolites at the expense of drawing statistical conclusions. The statistical model we use (a Bayesian GLM) is rather complex and a power analysis of it is beyond our technical abilities (and the bayesglm function in the “arm” R package that we use does not appear to be designed for this). However, the model is based on a highly conservative prior and hence the estimates it gives can generally be trusted as a lower bound for effect size.</p></body></sub-article></article>
