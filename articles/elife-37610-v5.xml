conduction may involve ephaptic coupling – intercellular communication involving electrochemical signaling across narrow extracellular clefts between cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that β1(SCN1B) –mediated adhesion scaffolds <italic>trans</italic>-activating Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (SCN5A) channels within narrow (&lt;30 nm) perinexal clefts adjacent to gap junctions (GJs), facilitating ephaptic coupling. Super-resolution imaging indicated preferential β1 localization at the perinexus, where it co-locates with Na<sub>V</sub>1.5. Smart patch clamp (SPC) indicated greater sodium current density (I<sub>Na</sub>) at perinexi, relative to non-junctional sites. A novel, rationally designed peptide, βadp1, potently and selectively inhibited β1-mediated adhesion, in electric cell-substrate impedance sensing studies. βadp1 significantly widened perinexi in guinea pig ventricles, and selectively reduced perinexal I<sub>Na</sub>, but not whole cell I<sub>Na</sub>, in myocyte monolayers. In optical mapping studies, βadp1 precipitated arrhythmogenic conduction slowing. In summary, β1-mediated adhesion at the perinexus facilitates action potential propagation between cardiomyocytes, and may represent a novel target for anti-arrhythmic therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>arrhythmia</kwd><kwd>cardiac conduction</kwd><kwd>guinea pig</kwd><kwd>ephaptic coupling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 HL56728-15A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gourdie</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16SDG29870007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veeraraghavan</surname><given-names>Rengasayee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL102298-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poelzing</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL102298-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS076752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isom</surname><given-names>Lori L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 HL HL141855-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gourdie</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Poelzing</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional investigations identify a structural unit for ephaptic coupling in the heart, and provide the mechanistic basis for a novel strategy for the treatment of arrhythmias.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The concept that the heart beats as a functional syncytium composed of discrete muscle cells electrically coupled by gap junctions (GJs) is a foundational theory of modern cardiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kléber and Rudy, 2004</xref>). Moreover, as GJ remodeling occurs in multiple cardiac pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jongsma and Wilders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stroemlund et al., 2015</xref>), it is widely held that disrupted GJ coupling is mechanistically central to arrhythmogenesis in heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vuyst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palatinus et al., 2012</xref>). Whilst a GJ-based paradigm for cardiac electrical coupling has been in place for over 50 years, a small group of mathematical biologists has proposed that cardiac conduction in health and disease may involve ephaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Keener, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mann and Sperelakis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pertsov and Medvinskiĭ, 1979</xref>). Ephaptic conduction is conceived as involving the intercellular transmission of action potentials via ion accumulation/depletion transients occurring within narrow extracellular clefts between closely apposed myocytes. Further interest in this hypothesis has been stoked by provocative findings such as conduction still occurring in mice with knockout of the principal ventricular GJ protein, connexin43 (<italic>Gja1</italic>/Cx43) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutstein et al., 2001</xref>) and in humans with dominant negative mutations of GJA1, the gene encoding Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shibayama et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although the ephaptic hypothesis has remained controversial, owing to a lack of direct experimental evidence, theoretical studies have identified two key elements of a hypothetical structural unit that might support this alternative mechanism of conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hichri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kucera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin and Keener, 2013</xref>): 1) Close proximity (&lt;30 nm) between the membranes of adjacent myocytes and 2) a high density of sodium channels at such points of close inter-membrane apposition. These prerequisites for the formation of a cardiac ephapse pointed to its likely location in the intercalated disk (ID) where cardiac sodium channels are concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petitprez et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we report that α (<italic>Scn5a</italic>/Na<sub>V</sub>1.5) and β (<italic>Scn1b</italic>/β1) subunits of cardiac sodium channels preferentially localize at the perinexus, a nanodomain at the edge of GJs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rhett et al., 2011</xref>) where the membranes of apposed cells routinely approach each other closely enough for ephapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veeraraghavan et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, we demonstrate that adhesion mediated by the extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of β1 generates close proximity between the membranes of adjacent cells within perinexal nanodomains, likely enabling these to function as ephapses. Importantly, we identify dynamic changes in perinexal ultrastructure, secondary to compromised β1-mediated adhesion, as a novel mechanism for arrhythmogenic conduction defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-rich nanodomains within the ID may enable ephaptic coupling between cardiac myocytes, and that the cell adhesion function of β1 may be important to this phenomenon.

We then identified an amino acid sequence (1FVKILRYENEVLQLEEDERF20: βadp1) within the β1 Ig domain homologous to the desmoglein-1 Ig loop adhesion sequence - a peptide mimetic of which acts as a competitive inhibitor of desmosomal adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). To assess the interaction of βadp1 with β1, and thus its potential ability to act as a competitive inhibitor of β1 adhesion, we allowed the peptide to bind freely to the β1 homology model in silico, determining that it associated with the adhesion surface of the Ig loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). MM-GBSA refined docking of βadp1 using Maestro displayed a low energy conformation (ΔG binding −44.47) at this location. The predicted binding pose revealed stabilization of this conformation via a network of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions between the C-terminal end of βadp1 and polar residues within the β1 adhesion domain, as well as accommodation of hydrophobic residues of βadp1 within pockets along the β1 adhesion surface. Sequences of similar length from the Ig loop outside of the adhesion domain, as well as a randomized βadp1 sequence (βadp1-scr), did not show propensity to interact with the adhesion surface of the β1 extracellular domain. Substituting the basic arginine (R) at position 19 of βadp1 with acidic aspartic acid (D) yielded a sequence (βadp1-R85D) with significantly abrogated binding to the β1 model in silico (ΔG binding −18.05). The arginine at this position of βadp1 corresponds to R85 on full length β1 and is a mutational hotspot associated with diseases of electrical excitation in the heart and brain of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoun and Isom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed the ability of βadp1 to abrogate β1 adhesion using the 1610 β1OX model. βadp1 significantly, persistently and dose-dependently decreased junctional resistance in confluent monolayers of 1610 β1OX cells, but not in 1610 parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which express negligible levels of β1. These results suggest that βadp1 selectively inhibited the intercellular adhesion function of β1 in this in vitro model.

Importantly, we find that the extracellular adhesion domain of the sodium channel β1 subunit may be critical for the generation of the close (&lt;30 nm) cell-cell interactions necessary for this mechanism to operate. Selective inhibition of β1-mediated adhesion profoundly disrupts the structure of GJ-adjacent perinexi, causing them to dehisce/de-adhere, and swell beyond limits that would theoretically support ephaptic conduction, with attendant loss of perinexal sodium currents, anisotropic conduction slowing and arrhythmias. The clinical translational significance of perinexal dehiscence is further emphasized by our recent report that it is associated with the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raisch et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the physical extent of the β1 extracellular domain predicted by our molecular homology model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) is 7–15 nm, depending on relaxation state of the domain. Thus, the span of two β1 extracellular domains on apposed cell membranes in trans homophilic interaction concurs with the EM-based measurements of average perinexal width (15–30 nm) in untreated hearts that we report here, and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veeraraghavan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the cardiac ephapse.</title><p>Top. A schematic diagram illustrating the organization of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, β1, Cx43 and N-cad to different ID nanodomains.

Early work on ephaptic coupling in the heart was motivated by the fact that GJs, which are abundant in mammalian hearts, are over two orders of magnitude less frequent in other chordates, especially birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martínez-Palomo and Mendez, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shibata and Yamamoto, 1979</xref>). Mathematical modeling suggests that this level of GJ coupling is unlikely to reliably support the beat-to-beat conduction of AP long-term, thus indicating that an alternate paradigm for AP conduction may operate in bird hearts. Nevertheless, the investigation of ephaptic conduction has remained largely theoretical and the hypothesis has drawn considerable skepticism over the years. The present study identifies a potential structural unit within the ID located at the edge of GJs – the ephapse – that may provide a mechanistic basis for ongoing studies of this long-theorized mechanism of cardiac AP conduction.</p><p>Subcellular distribution (and thus, nano-structural context) has emerged as an important modulator of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hichri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petitprez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen-Izu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hund and Mohler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makara et al., 2014</xref>): Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 has been reported to be divided into lateral and ID-localized pools based on its sarcolemmal localization, differences in scaffolding partners, and current properties. Interestingly, Hichri and colleagues recently demonstrated that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 behavior is influenced by channel clustering, and localization facing narrow extracellular clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hichri et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 pools playing different, ultra-structure dependent roles. Here, using super-resolution STORM-RLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veeraraghavan and Gourdie, 2016</xref>), we further categorize ID-localized Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 into a ‘perinexal pool’ adjacent to Cx43 and a ‘plicate pool’ that co-distributes with N-cad. The perinexal pool is in agreement with our demonstration of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 enrichment proximal to Cx43 GJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veeraraghavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veeraraghavan and Gourdie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veeraraghavan et al., 2016</xref>), while the plicate pool is consistent with the results of Leo-Macias and colleagues who reported Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 co-distributing with N-cadherin-positive adherens junctions within the ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leo-Macias et al., 2016</xref>). Whilst adjacent cell membranes are very closely apposed (5–15 nm) within the perinexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veeraraghavan et al., 2015</xref>), they are further apart (63 nm) in the vicinity of adhesion complexes within plicate ID regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leo-Macías et al., 2015</xref>). Given that theoretical studies indicate that membrane spacing of ≤30 nm would be necessary to support ephaptic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greer-Short et al., 2017</xref>), the plicate Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 pool is unlikely to play a role in ephaptic coupling. Nonetheless, whilst closely approximated, <italic>trans</italic>-activating sodium channels at GJ perinexi may act to ‘trigger’ a local depolarization of interplicate membrane, the function of the nearby pools of plicate Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels could be to provide <italic>cis</italic>-activated excitatory current, contributing to the spread of depolarization through the downstream myocyte.</p><p>The approach we took to developing a competitive inhibitor of β1 was based on a methodology successfully applied by independent groups to two other Ig domain adhesion molecules that share homologies with β1: N-cad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Williams et al., 2000a</xref>), and desmoglein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlipp et al., 2014</xref>). This strategy involved generating a peptide mimetic of the extracellular adhesion sequence of the β1 Ig domain. In ECIS experiments, β1 overexpression conferred strong adhesion to 1610 cells, which was selectively and dose-dependently inhibited by βadp1 treatment. When perfused into GP ventricles, βadp1 prompted dose-dependent increases in inter-membrane distance, selectively within perinexi. Similar effects were not observed in hearts treated with a scrambled control peptide, βadp1-scr. The conspicuous de-adhesion of perinexal membranes prompted by βadp1 in GP hearts, and by germline loss of <italic>Scn1b</italic>/β1 in mice was selective to perinexal nanodomains, with inter-membrane spacing at other ID locations (e.g. within adherens junctions and desmosomes) remaining unaffected in both GPs and mice. These results, along with the demonstration that βadp1 treatment had no effects on whole-cell I<sub>Na</sub>, but results in localized loss of I<sub>Na</sub> adjacent to Cx43-GFP GJs, attest to the selectivity of the novel inhibitor of β1-mediated adhesion. Further, these findings suggest that the increases in extracellular cleft width adjacent to Cx43 GJ induced by inhibition of β1-mediated adhesion likely compromises <italic>trans</italic>-activation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels within these nanodomains. Ongoing studies would usefully determine the basis of this localized down-regulation of channel activity. Crucially, the fact that βadp1 treatment of myocyte monolayers elicits these localized changes in I<sub>Na</sub> within GJ-adjacent nanodomains, without alteration of whole-cell I<sub>Na</sub>, indicates the possibility of local remodeling of Na<sup>+</sup> channel complexes from perinexal nanodomains.</p><p>Examining the functional impact of βadp1 treatment on Langendorff-perfused GP ventricles, we observed prolongation of the QRS complex, pointing to conduction slowing. The QT interval was also prolonged by a similar degree as the QRS complex, indicating no change in ST segment duration. This is consistent with the absence of APD changes following βadp1 treatment in both isolated myocytes and in intact ventricles. The contrast between these results, and those reported in mice lacking β1 (β1-null), where QT prolongation was associated with prolonged AP duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2007</xref>), likely stem from the differences between acutely and selectively inhibiting β1-mediated adhesion (as in the present study), versus chronic genetic ablation of β1 expression. As yet, conduction velocity measurements have not been reported from the ventricles of β1-nulls, which in light of the data reported herein would be a useful addition to our understanding of cardiac conduction mechanisms.</p><p>In keeping with the observed QRS prolongation, βadp1 treatment dose-dependently slowed transverse conduction in intact ventricles, increasing the anisotropy of conduction, and precipitating spontaneous arrhythmias. We have previously demonstrated in silico that anisotropic conduction slowing secondary to a reduction of I<sub>Na</sub> at the ID results from compromised ephaptic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veeraraghavan et al., 2015</xref>): Briefly, a wavefront traveling transverse to the fiber axis encounters more cell-cell junctions per unit distance than one traveling longitudinally. Therefore, compromised cell-cell coupling via perinexal nanodomains would have a greater impact on transverse conduction than on longitudinal conduction. Thus, the anisotropic nature of conduction slowing caused by βadp1 is consistent with disruption of ephaptic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plonsey and Barr, 2007</xref>), and identifies a hitherto unanticipated role for β1-mediated adhesion in the heart. Taken together, these data lend further support to the hypothesis that β1 adhesion mediates close apposition between Na<sub>V</sub>1.5-rich membranes within the perinexus, facilitating ephaptic coupling between cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this context, the fact that βadp1 mimics a sequence in β1 (i.e. its Ig domain adhesion sequence) that is a ‘hot spot’ for disease-causing mutations, including mutations associated with atrial arrhythmia (R85H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>), conduction disease (R85H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>), epilepsy (R85H, R85C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheffer et al., 2007</xref>), Brugada syndrome (E87Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasdemir et al., 2015</xref>), and febrile epilepsy (I70_E74del) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audenaert et al., 2003</xref>) lends further support to the importance of β1-mediated adhesion to electrical propagation in the heart, and beyond. Interestingly, a single amino acid substitution of R to D at the R85 ‘hot spot’ within βadp1 significantly abrogated the cell adhesion-inhibitory effects of the peptide. These data suggest that disease-causing mutations associated with this locus may mediate their effects via perinexal disruption.</p><p>In summary, we provide experimental evidence suggesting that ephaptic conduction may play a role in the heart, identifying hitherto unanticipated assignments for both Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and β1 in this phenomenon. Although limitations of current technology prevent direct interrogation of electrophysiology at the nanoscale, which would provide direct proof of the ephaptic mechanism, our results strongly suggest a role for it in normal cardiac physiology. Thus, it has not escaped our notice that modulation of β1-mediated adhesion could represent a novel clinical target for the amelioration of cardiac arrhythmias. Increased spacing of perinexal membranes, whether resulting from inhibition of β1-mediated adhesion, or acute interstitial edema, is strongly associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Given that humans with atrial fibrillation also demonstrate perinexal dehiscence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raisch et al., 2018</xref>), these data suggest that drugs that act to stabilize and/or enhance β1-mediated adhesion within IDs could have anti-arrhythmic potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparations</title><p>Hearts were isolated from male retired breeder guinea pigs (GPs), and 19-day-old <italic>Scn1b</italic> -/- mice, perfused as Langendorff-preparations, or preserved for cryosectioning or transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Confocal and super-resolution microscopy</title><p>Immunofluorescent staining was performed, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veeraraghavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veeraraghavan and Gourdie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veeraraghavan et al., 2016</xref>), on 5 µm cryosections of tissue, and monolayers of cells fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%; 5 min at room temperature).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Adhesion Function of the Sodium Channel Beta Subunit (β1) is Required for Cardiac Action Potential Propagation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Colleen Clancy (Reviewer #1).</p><p>General Assessment:</p><p>The manuscript entitled, &quot;The Adhesion Function of the Sodium Channel Beta Subunit (β1) is Required for Cardiac Action Potential Propagation&quot; describes combined experimental and computational studies on cardiac myocyte cell adhesion medicated by β1 protein (SCN5A), interacting with transmembrane voltage gated ion channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5. β1 provides a scaffold for concentrating Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 in the perinexal cleft adjacent to gap junctions (GJ). It generates close cell-cell apposition within intercalated disks. A rationally designed peptide βadp1 inhibits β1 adhesion. Multiple spectroscopic, electrophysiological and modeling experiments performed by the authors provided details of this process and also its consequences for sodium channel and overall electric cardiac myocyte and tissue activities including an increased incidence of arrhythmias. The authors suggest that their findings indicate plausibility of ephatic conduction mechanism in cardiac tissue, which operates via transient changes in ion concentration in a narrow extracellular cleft rather than connexin mediated GJ connections. And extracellular β1 domain adhesion may play a major role in this mechanism, which becomes disrupted e.g. by βadp1 peptide. The authors suggest that understanding this mechanism may lead to novel ways of β1 mutation associated arrhythmias.</p><p>This is a very interesting study, which might be of substantial significance since it suggests major re-evaluation of fundamental electrical signal propagation mechanisms in the heart tissue. There are, however, a few shortcomings, which need to be addressed before the manuscript can be published.</p><p>There are certain aspects of the results that are unconvincing and/or confusing. That is to some extent inevitable given the range of techniques employed. However, in order to really make the manuscript both convincing and understandable to most readers, the authors need to improve some of the analysis of data and/or how it's described. And some of the less convincing results, in particular those in Figure 4E-F, might be better off left on the cutting room floor. Unless I misinterpreted something, these results seem to add nothing to the story.</p><p>Required Revisions:</p><p>1) First of all, it would be helpful to more clearly state the general overarching idea in the Introduction and again in the beginning of the Results section. A cartoon representation of the system/problem at hand similar to Figure 8 will be extremely useful.</p><p>2) The authors interpret results of their studies in favor of ephatic mechanisms, but it seems that it has not been confirmed directly, only through mathematical modeling and interpretation of the experiments, which suggest plausibility, but cannot prove. This should be clearly stated and some description of alternative explanations as well as possible shortcomings and alternative explanations might need to be mentioned.</p><p>3) A concise methodology section at the end of main text be very helpful.</p><p>4) Subsection “STORM-RLA Indicates Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 Distributes Between Two Pools within the Intercalated Disk” – connection between Figure 2 and some values described in the text needs to be made more clear. For instance: &quot;over half of these β1 clusters localized to the perinexus&quot; Where is it shown in Figure 2?</p><p>5) How was β1 and βadp1 docking performed?</p><p>&quot;stabilization of the interaction via a network of intramolecular hydrogen bonds&quot; – this does not make sense since intramolecular H bonds would typically stabilize a particular protein conformation but intermolecular H bonds would stabilize peptide – peptide interaction. How stabilities of the docked complexes were estimated?</p><p>6) &quot;physical extent of the β1 extracellular domain […] 7-15 nm, depending on relaxation state of the domain&quot; – that length is indeed very subjective especially considering absence of structural information in this region, necessary for accurate homology modeling.</p><p>7) Figure 2E is confusing. It is not clear why dark shading for any overlap is combined with% of clusters located in perinexus (light shading). In this case how do the clear bars can represent &quot;no overlap&quot; case?</p><p>8) Figure 3 parts are not clear/confusing. Panel B. There is a long completely disordered terminal fragment. Most likely, there was no homologous template structure in β3, and it was modeled de novo. It should not have been included in the homology modeling. Docked βadp1 – β1 structure is not clear as shown. A representation with two differently colored molecular surfaces and/or ribbons with a few interacting residues shown in atomic details would be much more useful.</p><p>9) Resistances in panels A and D are very different numerically. Also, there are differences in numbers in the line plots and summary bar graph in panel D. For 200 μm βadp1 values on the left graph are bigger for parental but the other way around on the right graph.</p><p>10) Figure 4F – what is the significance of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> results? They do not seem to be described in the text.</p><p>11) In the Introduction in the first paragraph, it is stated that &quot;[…] electrical excitation jumping between myocytes across extracellular clefts, not wholly unlike how activation steps discontinuously between neurons at the synaptic cleft.&quot; I'm not sure what they're trying to imply here – seems to me that ephaptic coupling <italic>is</italic> wholly unlike standard synaptic communication between neurons (which involves neurotransmitters and all).</p><p>12) In the Discussion it's stated that &quot;Ephaptic coupling is known to operate in neural and other tissue&quot;. I think that ephaptic coupling is only significant in a setting when there is a high degree of synchrony and &quot;neural mass&quot; effects are present.</p><p>13) Except in special cases (e.g., PHP – Mauthner cell synapses), cell-cell ephaptic coupling is very weak… perhaps you could describe the typical strength of ephaptic coupling in neural tissue and its (potential) functional role.</p><p>14) In the Discussion, there's a paragraph or two of evolutionary speculation. While (or whilst!) I personally like evolutionary speculation in general, here it's probably a bit too speculative, and it really doesn't add much to the paper in my opinion. I'm actually not sure if cells in invertebrate hearts were shown to be lacking all direct electrical coupling (it would have been nice to have a citation there), but invertebrates do have gap junction proteins (inexins), and invertebrate hearts are typically neurally driven.</p><p>15) The results with the fluorescent dyes shown in Figure 4 are extremely unconvincing. First, with the 0.3 kDa dye, why the fluorescence in the ID initially <italic>higher</italic> than in the interstitial space? Wouldn't this most likely occur not because of diffusion, but because some binding partner is trapping the dye in the ID? Maybe I'm wrong, but that seems like the most likely explanation to me. Thus, when the peptide alters this, does it cause a change in the diffusion, or does it just disrupt the &quot;trapping&quot;? Although something is clearly happening with the 0.3 kDa dye, it seems premature to ascribe this effect to diffusion.</p><p>In general, diffusion is best assessed using dynamic time course techniques such as FRAP. With the snapshots presented, it's difficult to make strong inferences.</p><p>The other issue here is that the peptide causes no change at all to the distributions of the 3kDa and 10kDa dyes. However, low [Ca] does, although this result is shown in the figure yet not described at all in the text. Overall these results are confusing and difficult to interpret, and the authors' conclusions about diffusion barriers is not compelling.</p><p>16) The results shown in Figure 3, with a technology called ECIS, show convincing trends, but what exactly is being measured in these experiments is not at all clear. What's confusing is that the text refers to measurements of &quot;intercellular junctional resistance.&quot; Does this mean resistance through the gap junctions connecting adjacent cells? In the context of cardiac electrophysiology, that's what this term usually means. But the trends seen in the Results seem to indicate that something different is being measured, which makes this part confusing.</p><p>For instance, I one would expect the gap junctional resistance to be much <italic>lower</italic> in the 1610 β10X cells than in the 1610 parental cells. And then I would expect the peptide to <italic>increase</italic> this resistance in the β10X cells. But instead the exact opposite trends are observed.</p><p>So, what is the ECIS technique actually measuring? It must be some form of impedance from one electrode to another electrode in the extracellular space? But can this resistance be directly related to the cable properties that help to determine conduction? This section requires much clearer explanations of what is being measured and what the results mean in terms of physiological parameters.</p><p>17) It is convincing in Figure 7 that the peptide widens the QRS complex and slows propagation. But why should this be anisotropic? If the IDs are located at the cell ends, disruption of these ephapses would be expected to slow both longitudinal and transverse condition, with no a priori reason to think there should be a change in the anisotropy ratio. The manuscript repeatedly mentions the 2015 Pflugers Archiv paper for justification for this, but without offering any explanation. Readers of the journal shouldn't have to also examine prior studies in order to understand these results.</p><p>18) The results in Figure 6 are interesting, but the interpretation is not totally clear. If the peptide was just increasing the width of the ID between myocytes, this would affect the ephaptic conduction, without necessarily decreasing the amount of Na current at the ephapse. So it seem like the β subunit is also keeping the channels in that location, besides controlling the width of the gap.</p><p>19) The colocalization analyses shown in Figure 2 are quite confusing and not well-described. The text requires the reader to slog through lots and lots of numbers, without a good sense of the big picture implications. And when one examines the figure, it's not at all clear how &quot;incidence of overlap&quot; in Figure 2E should be different from &quot;degree of overlap&quot; in Figure 2F. The difference between these measured is only mentioned in passing. Sometimes 2E and 2F are consistent with each other, other times not. This is all quite confusing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37610.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] There are certain aspects of the results that are unconvincing and/or confusing.

This has now been clarified in the manuscript and we have added the free energy of binding from MMGBSA refinement of poses to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;physical extent of the β1 extracellular domain[…] 7-15 nm, depending on relaxation state of the domain&quot; – that length is indeed very subjective especially considering absence of structural information in this region, necessary for accurate homology modeling.</p></disp-quote><p>Structural information from the β3 crystal structure approximate the size of that extracellular loop to be ~5nm (DOI: 10.1098/rsob.140192, Figure 3), and β1 is slightly larger. A homology model based on a 4.0 Å cryo-EM of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.4-β1 complex from the electric eel (Figure 3B) shows that there is a relatively unorganized region linking the Ig loop and the transmembrane domain, fully capable of extending the length between the membrane and the furthest regions of the protein by a few nm. These results support the possibility that two apposed β1 subunits can span a 10-15 nm extracellular cleft. We have added this improved visualization of our β1 molecular model to Figure 3B, and revised the text (subsection “βadp1 – A Rationally Designed Inhibitor of β1-mediated Adhesion”, second paragraph) to better clarify the modeling approach as noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2E is confusing.

In Figure 2A (previously 2E), each bar is now divided into 3 segments: overlap (colored), adjacent (perinexal) (shaded), distant (clear). We hope that this resolves the issues stemming from our formerly confusing labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3 parts are not clear/confusing. Panel B.

The docking studies referenced in the text were performed with an updated homology model that incorporated structural data from a 4.0 Å cryo-EM of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 channel in complex with β1. The binding surface depicted was unchanged upon updating the model, but Figure 3B now more accurately reflects the structure between the IG loop and the transmembrane domain. The updated view in Figure 3C removes the surface rendering of the β1 Ig loop and shows atomic details of βadp1 binding (ball and stick) and β1 surface (cartoon with interacting residues as stick).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Resistances in panels A and D are very different numerically.

Hence, the difference in the absolute values measured. Additionally, the line graphs (Figure 3D, left) present representative results from a single ECIS experiment whereas the bar graph (Figure 3D, right) presents summary data from 5 experiments, each with 2 technical replicates per cell type and treatment condition. These details are now better clarified in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 4F – what is the significance of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> results?

Specifically, this technique measures the electrical impedance offered by a monolayer of cells to current flow between electrodes located above, and below the monolayer, and previous studies demonstrate that the resistance of the extracellular cleft at cell-cell junctions (junctional resistance) is well-reflected by measurements at low frequencies (62.5-4000 Hz) (Williams, Williams and Doherty, 2002; Schlipp et al., 2014). This is now clearly stated in the manuscript (subsection “βadp1 – A Rationally Designed Inhibitor of β1-mediated Adhesion”, first paragraph). Since the technique measures impedance between two extracellular compartments (above, and below the cells), it is incapable of assessing gap junction resistance connecting the intracellular compartments of adjacent cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) It is convincing in Figure 7 that the peptide widens the QRS complex and slows propagation.

We reason that the anisotropic effects of βadp1 treatment reflect the fact that a wavefront traveling transverse to the fiber axis would encounter more cell-cell junctions per unit distance than one traveling longitudinally. Thus, any compromise in cell-cell coupling via perinexal nanodomains would have a greater impact on transverse conduction, than on longitudinal conduction. We have now added this explanation to the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) The results in Figure 6 are interesting, but the interpretation is not totally clear.

Briefly, ‘Incidence of overlap’ referred to the percentage of clusters which demonstrated any overlap at all, while ‘degree of overlap’ referred to the fractional volume of participating clusters involved in the overlap. To avoid potential confusion, we have now relabeled the incidence of overlap as “relative localization overview” and noted that the solid, shaded, and uncolored bars refer respectively to “any overlap”, “adjacent”, and “distant” situations. We hope that these revisions to the figure, and the text have mitigated the issues noted by the reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
