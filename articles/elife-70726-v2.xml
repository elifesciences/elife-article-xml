cerebellar neurodegeneration, and an increased risk of cancer. A loss of ATM is also associated with increased protein aggregation. The relevance and characteristics of this aggregation are still incompletely understood. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent other genotoxic conditions can trigger protein aggregation as well. Here, we show that targeting ATM, but also ATR or DNA topoisomerases, results in the widespread aggregation of a metastable, disease-associated subfraction of the proteome. Aggregation-prone model substrates, including Huntingtin exon 1 containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat, aggregate faster under these conditions. This increased aggregation results from an overload of chaperone systems, which lowers the cell-intrinsic threshold for proteins to aggregate. In line with this, we find that inhibition of the HSP70 chaperone system further exacerbates the increased protein aggregation. Moreover, we identify the molecular chaperone HSPB5 as a cell-specific suppressor of it. Our findings reveal that various genotoxic conditions trigger widespread protein aggregation in a manner that is highly reminiscent of the aggregation occurring in situations of proteotoxic stress and in proteinopathies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are constantly perceiving and responding to changes in their surroundings, and challenging conditions such as extreme heat or toxic chemicals can put cells under stress. When this happens, protein production can be affected. Proteins are long chains of chemical building blocks called amino acids, and they can only perform their roles if they fold into the right shape. Some proteins fold easily and remain folded, but others can be unstable and often become misfolded. Unfolded proteins can become a problem because they stick to each other, forming large clumps called aggregates that can interfere with the normal activity of cells, causing damage.</p><p>The causes of stress that have a direct effect on protein folding are called proteotoxic stresses, and include, for example, high temperatures, which make proteins more flexible and unstable, increasing their chances of becoming unfolded. To prevent proteins becoming misfolded, cells can make ‘protein chaperones’, a type of proteins that help other proteins fold correctly and stay folded. The production of protein chaperones often increases in response to proteotoxic stress. However, there are other types of stress too, such as genotoxic stress, which damages DNA. It is unclear what effect genotoxic stress has on protein folding.</p><p>Huiting et al. studied protein folding during genotoxic stress in human cells grown in the lab. Stress was induced by either blocking the proteins that repair DNA or by ‘trapping’ the proteins that release DNA tension, both of which result in DNA damage. The analysis showed that, similar to the effects of proteotoxic stress, genotoxic stress increased the number of proteins that aggregate, although certain proteins formed aggregates even without stress, particularly if they were common and relatively unstable proteins.</p><p>Huiting et al.’s results suggest that aggregation increases in cells under genotoxic stress because the cells fail to produce enough chaperones to effectively fold all the proteins that need it. Indeed, Huiting et al. showed that aggregates contain many proteins that rely on chaperones, and that increasing the number of chaperones in stressed cells reduced protein aggregation.</p><p>This work shows that genotoxic stress can affect protein folding by limiting the availability of chaperones, which increases protein aggregation. Remarkably, there is a substantial overlap between proteins that aggregate in diseases that affect the brain – such as Alzheimer’s disease – and proteins that aggregate after genotoxic stress. Therefore, further research could focus on determining whether genotoxic stress is involved in the progression of these neurological diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genotoxic stress</kwd><kwd>protein homeostasis</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALW 824.15.004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergink</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM126170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaCava</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charity4brains</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergink</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Various genotoxic stresses trigger widespread aggregation of abundant, liquid-liquid phase separation-prone proteins, suggesting that genotoxic stress is a potential driver of disease-associated protein aggregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The PI3K-like serine/threonine checkpoint kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) functions as a central regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR) and is recruited early to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shiloh and Ziv, 2013</xref>). Defects in ATM give rise to ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a multisystem disorder that is characterized by a predisposition to cancer and progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKinnon, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Impaired function of ATM has also been linked to a disruption of protein homeostasis and increased protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corcoles-Saez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Protein homeostasis is normally maintained by protein quality control systems, including chaperones and proteolytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). Together, these systems guard the balance of the proteome by facilitating correct protein folding, providing conformational maintenance, and ensuring timely degradation. When the capacity of protein quality control systems becomes overwhelmed during (chronic) proteotoxic stress, the stability of the proteome can no longer be sufficiently guarded, causing proteins to succumb to aggregation more readily. Proteins that are expressed at a relatively high level compared to their intrinsic aggregation propensity, a state referred to as ‘supersaturation,’ have been shown to be particularly vulnerable in this respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciryam et al., 2015</xref>). A loss of protein homeostasis and the accompanying widespread aggregation can have profound consequences, and is associated with a range of (degenerative) diseases, including neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kampinga and Bergink, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The characteristics and relevance of the aggregation induced by a loss of ATM are still largely unclear. Loss of MRE11 has recently also been found to result in protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), and since MRE11 and ATM function in the same DDR pathway, this raises the question whether other genotoxic conditions can challenge protein homeostasis as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainslie et al., 2021</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huiting and Bergink, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that not just impaired function of ATM, but also inhibition of the related checkpoint kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), as well as chemical trapping of topoisomerases (TOPs) using chemotherapeutic TOP poisons leads to widespread protein aggregation. Through proteomic profiling, we uncover that the increased protein aggregation induced by these genotoxic conditions overlaps strongly with the aggregation observed under conditions of (chronic) stress and in various neurodegenerative disorders, both in identity and in biochemical characteristics. In addition, we find that these conditions accelerate the aggregation of aggregation-prone model substrates, including the Huntington’s disease-related polyglutamine exon 1 fragment. We show that the widespread protein aggregation is the result of an overload of protein quality control systems, which cannot be explained by any quantitative changes in the aggregating proteins or by genetic alterations in their coding regions. This overload forces a shift in the equilibrium of protein homeostasis, causing proteins that are normally kept soluble by chaperones to now aggregate. Which proteins succumb to aggregation depends on the ground state of protein homeostasis, including the wiring of chaperone systems in that cell. Finally, we provide evidence that the protein aggregation induced by genotoxic stress conditions is amenable to modulation by chaperone systems: whereas inhibition of HSP70 exacerbates aggregation, we also provide a proof of concept that aggregation can be rescued in a cell line-specific manner by increasing the levels of the small heat shock protein HSPB5 (αB-crystallin).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein aggregation is increased upon targeting ATM, ATR, or DNA TOPs</title><p>Aggregated proteins are often resistant to solubilization by SDS, and they can therefore be isolated using a step-wise detergent fractionation and centrifugation method.

This revealed that chemical inhibition of the checkpoint signaling kinase ATR also enhanced protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Inhibition of tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), which repairs various 3′-blocking lesions including topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) cleavage complexes, had no clear effect on protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This could be a result of functional redundancy or limited TOP1 trapping occurring under unstressed conditions in a timeframe of 72 hr. We therefore also directly targeted TOPs using the chemotherapeutic compounds camptothecin (CPT) and etoposide (Etop). The genotoxic impact of CPT and Etop is a well-documented consequence of their ability to trap (i.e., ‘poison’) respectively TOP1 and TOP2 cleavage complexes on the DNA, resulting in DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pommier et al., 2010</xref>). Strikingly, we found that transient treatment with either compound caused a particularly strong increase in protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), which was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Treatment of U2OS cells with CPT led to a dose-dependent increase in aggregation as well, although at higher doses compared to HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases 1–3 (PARP1-3), involved in single-strand break repair, did not increase aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Recently, it was reported that PARP inhibition reduces the enhanced aggregation triggered by a loss of ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), something we find as well for CPT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Neither CPT nor Etop treatment in HEK293T cells had any effect on aggregation within the first 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). This reveals that the increased aggregation occurs only late and argues that it does not stem from any immediate, unknown damaging effect of either CPT or Etop on mRNA or protein molecules. Together, these data indicate that the increased protein aggregation triggered by targeting ATM, ATR, and TOPs is a late consequence of genotoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CPT and ATM loss drives aggregation in a cell-type-dependent manner</title><p>To investigate the nature of the proteins that become aggregated after genotoxic stress, we subjected the SDS-insoluble protein aggregate fractions and whole-cell lysates (WCL) of control (DMSO) and CPT-treated HEK293T cells to label-free proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We detected 39 proteins that aggregated significantly more in ATM-inhibited cells compared to control cells and 5 proteins that aggregated less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Surprisingly, only one protein was found to aggregate more after both CPT treatment and inhibition of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that these genotoxic conditions drive the aggregation of different proteins. However, we noted that several proteins that aggregated more after CPT treatment were absent in the dataset of ATM inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that we may have only identified the most abundantly aggregating proteins. We selected MCM7, TUBA1A, and HDAC1, three proteins that were identified in our MS/MS analysis, to consistently aggregate more in CPT-treated HEK293T cells but that were not picked up in the ATM inhibition MS/MS analysis and confirmed that all three aggregated more in CPT-treated HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

These findings indicate that these different genotoxic conditions drive aggregation similarly, although the most prominent aggregating proteins differ.</p><p>Next, we investigated the aggregation caused by a loss of ATM or CPT treatment in U2OS cells, a cell line that has been used previously as well to study the effect of a loss of ATM on protein aggregation. We found 210 proteins that aggregated more in <italic>ATM</italic> KO cells, while 53 proteins aggregated less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of these 210 proteins, 114 were also found to aggregate more in <italic>ATM</italic>-depleted U2OS cells in a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2021</xref>. Treatment of U2OS cells with CPT resulted in 106 proteins aggregating more and 61 proteins to aggregate less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Close to 20% of proteins that aggregated more after CPT treatment also aggregated in <italic>ATM</italic> KO U2OS cells (20/106) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar to the induced aggregation in HEK293T cells, proteins that aggregate more in U2OS <italic>ATM</italic> KO or CPT-treated cells appear to be largely soluble in wild-type cells, but now aggregate consistently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>At first glance, protein aggregation caused by a (functional) loss of ATM or CPT treatment in U2OS cells seemed to be quite different from the aggregation observed in HEK293T cells. Not a single protein was found to aggregate more in all four different conditions, only two proteins aggregated more in both HEK293T and U2OS cells after CPT treatment, and only one protein overlapped between <italic>ATM</italic> KO U2OS cells and ATM-inhibited HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, a GO term analysis of the aggregating proteomes did reveal overlap across the different treatments and the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–I</xref>). Cytoskeleton-related terms, including microtubule and microfibril, are enriched across the different aggregating proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F, H</xref>). However, enrichment of most GO terms is restricted to a specific treatment and/or cell line. For example, proteins that aggregated more in CPT-treated HEK293T cells are enriched for nucleotide binding terms, most prominently RNA binding, which is highly enriched among proteins that aggregate after ATM inhibition as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Specifically CPT treatment in HEK293T cells drives the aggregation of mitochondrial components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In U2OS cells, proteins that aggregate more after a loss of ATM or CPT treatment appear to be enriched for components involved in cell-cell contact, including cell adhesion and cellular membrane processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). .</p><p>As protein aggregation can manifest vastly different in distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freer et al., 2016</xref>), we examined which proteins aggregated consistently in HEK293T and U2OS cells, regardless of the presence or absence of genotoxic stress. Importantly, within each cell line, these ‘consistently’ aggregating proteins show a very high overlap between experiments (~80% overlap, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Based on this, we defined a ‘baseline aggregating fraction’ for each cell line. This consisted of aggregating proteins that were not changed upon the genotoxic treatments: these proteins were detected in at least two experimental replicates of both treated and untreated cells and exhibited p-adjusted values of &gt;0.05 in t-test comparisons, consistent with no significant effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This revealed that 66% (118/179) of the HEK293T baseline fraction aggregates in the U2OS baseline as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Importantly, 62% (99/160) of the proteins that aggregated more in CPT- or ATM inhibitor-treated HEK293T cells are also part of the U2OS baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This indicates that in U2OS cells afar bigger cluster of proteins ends up in aggregates, even under normal conditions. Indeed, silver staining revealed that in unstressed U2OS cells protein aggregation is substantially more prominent than in untreated HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is also reflected in MCM7, TUBA1A, and HDAC1, all three of which aggregate strongly already in (untreated) wild-type U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings indicate that the lack of overlap between proteins that aggregate after CPT- or ATM inhibitor treatment in HEK293T and proteins that aggregate in U2OS after CPT treatment or in ATM KO cells is primarily a reflection of a different proteome and a different background aggregation in these two cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Proteins that aggregate after genotoxic stress represent a metastable subproteome</title><p>These data indicate that the genotoxic conditions of TOP1 poisoning and ATM loss have a cell line-dependent impact on protein aggregation. In both HEK293T and U2OS cells, protein aggregation does not appear to be limited to a specific location or function but affects proteins throughout the proteome. This suggests that the aggregation is primarily driven by the physicochemical characteristics of the proteins involved.</p><p>A key determinant of aggregation is supersaturation. Protein supersaturation refers to proteins that are expressed at high levels relative to their intrinsic propensity to aggregate, which makes them vulnerable to aggregation. Supersaturation has been shown to underlie the widespread protein aggregation observed in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and in general aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciryam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciryam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kundra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Noji et al., 2021</xref>). The relevance of supersaturation is underlined by the notion that evolutionary pressures appear to have shaped proteomes along its lines, so that at a global level protein abundance is inversely correlated with aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tartaglia et al., 2007</xref>). To determine the role of protein supersaturation in the aggregation observed in our experiments, we first defined a control group of proteins that were <italic>not</italic> identified as <underline>a</underline>ggregating (NIA) for HEK293T cells to serve as a benchmark. This group consisted of all proteins that were only identified in the HEK293T WCL, and not in the SDS-insoluble fractions (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We next examined the intrinsic aggregation propensities of proteins using the aggregation prediction tools TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004</xref>) and CamSol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sormanni and Vendruscolo, 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that aggregated proteins have in general a slightly lower (for the baseline aggregation) or equal (for CPT- and ATM inhibitor-induced aggregation) intrinsic propensity to aggregate compared to NIA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, even proteins with a low intrinsic propensity to aggregate can be supersaturated and be vulnerable to aggregation, when they are expressed at sufficiently high levels. Interestingly, our MS/MS analysis revealed that proteins that aggregate in CPT- or ATM-inhibited-treated HEK293T cells are in general highly abundant compared to NIA proteins in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Cross-referencing the aggregated proteins in our datasets against a cell-line-specific NSAF reference proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geiger et al., 2012</xref>) confirmed this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Supersaturation only relates to overall protein concentration per cell, but within a cell, local protein concentrations can differ. A prime example of this is the partitioning of proteins in so-called biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS can increase the local concentration of proteins, which has been shown to be important for a wide range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>). However, it also comes with a risk of transitioning from a liquid to a solid, and even amyloid state. Indeed, a large amount of recent data have clearly demonstrated that proteins that engage in LLPS are overrepresented among proteins that aggregate in various proteinopathies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>). Using catGRANULE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tartaglialab.com">http://tartaglialab.com</ext-link>), we find that HEK293T baseline aggregation and both CPT- and ATM inhibitor-induced aggregation are indeed made up of proteins that have a higher average LLPS propensity than NIA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). HEK293T baseline and ATM inhibitor-induced aggregation are also enriched for proteins that have a high propensity to engage in LLPS-relevant pi-pi interactions, as indicated by both a higher average PScore and a larger percentage of proteins that have a PScore &gt; 4 (i.e., above the threshold defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vernon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Inversely, dividing NIA proteins into supersaturated and non-supersaturated subgroups reveals that they have a similarly low average LLPS propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This points out that a high LLPS propensity can discriminate supersaturated proteins that are prone to aggregate from supersaturated proteins that are not.</p><p>Upon examining the proteins that aggregate in U2OS cells, we found further support for this. Baseline aggregation in U2OS cells is also made up of supersaturated, LLPS-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H–R</xref>). Despite the baseline aggregation being far more pronounced in U2OS cells than in HEK293T cells, many supersaturated proteins are not SDS-insoluble in U2OS cells, even in cells treated with CPT or in cells lacking <italic>ATM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1O</xref>). In U2OS <italic>ATM</italic> KO cells, proteins that aggregate more are supersaturated compared to U2OS NIA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M</xref>); for CPT-treated cells, this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M–O</xref>). Proteins that aggregate more in U2OS <italic>ATM</italic> KO cells also have a higher general propensity to engage in LLPS as predicted by PScore and catGRANULE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1P and Q</xref>), while proteins that aggregate more in CPT-treated cells are enriched for proteins with a PScore &gt; 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1R</xref>). From this, we conclude that both CPT treatment and a loss of ATM further exacerbate the aggregation of LLPS-prone and supersaturated proteins in a cell-type-dependent manner.</p><p>A GO term analysis of our RNAseq data revealed a striking lack of overlap in transcriptional processes altered upon treatment with CPT or loss of ATM function in either HEK293T or U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Intriguingly, only two transcripts (one up and one down) were significantly altered (–1 &gt; log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; 1) after ATM inhibition in HEK293T cells despite the enhanced aggregation occurring in these cells. This further underlines that the enhanced aggregation after CPT treatment or a loss of ATM function is mostly driven by the physicochemical characteristics of the proteins involved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genotoxic stress-induced protein aggregation is the result of a global lowering of the protein aggregation threshold</title><p>Our data shows that a substantial number of inherently similarly vulnerable proteins aggregate under the genotoxic conditions of CPT treatment or ATM loss. Their consistent aggregation across independent repeats argues against the possibility that this is caused by any genotoxic stress-induced DNA sequence alterations in their own coding regions as these would occur more randomly throughout the genome. Moreover, we find that the increased aggregation can also not be explained by any changes in abundance of the proteins involved, resulting for example from DNA damage-induced transcriptional dysregulation, as very limited overlap exists between proteins that aggregate and proteins with an altered expression upon CPT treatment or ATM loss (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for HEK293T and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> for U2OS).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The cell-intrinsic aggregation threshold is lowered upon targeting ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), or DNA topoisomerases.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>.

As a result, more and more LLPS-prone, supersaturated proteins that are normally largely soluble now start to aggregate, with the most vulnerable proteins aggregating first. This aggregation threshold appears to be inherently lower in U2OS cells compared to HEK293T cells, causing a large population of metastable proteins to aggregate already under normal conditions. Genotoxic stress in U2OS cells lowers the aggregation threshold even further, causing a ‘second layer’ of LLPS-prone proteins that are not even always supersaturated to aggregate also (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>This lowering of the aggregation threshold is highly reminiscent of ‘classic’ protein aggregation resulting from (chronic) proteotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weids et al., 2016</xref>) and has been referred to as a disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>) or shifted protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciryam et al., 2013</xref>). In line with this, we find that proteins that aggregate more in HEK293T and U2OS cells after CPT treatment or after a (functional) loss of ATM are enriched for proteins that have been reported to aggregate upon heat treatment of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mymrikov et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, they are enriched for constituents of stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rnagranuledb.lunenfeld.ca">http://rnagranuledb.lunenfeld.ca</ext-link>), cellular condensates that have been found to function as nucleation sites for protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mateju et al., 2017</xref>). Protein aggregation after heat shock and the formation of aberrant stress granules also includes the aggregation of newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganassi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). To assess the extent to which newly synthesized proteins aggregate in cells exposed to genotoxic conditions, we pulsed HEK293T cells with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled cysteine and methionine 48 hr after CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Notably, protein synthesis is reduced approximately threefold in CPT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Despite this strong reduction in protein synthesis, radioactively labeled proteins were still clearly present in the aggregating fraction of CPT-treated cells. They were however not enriched in the aggregating fraction compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that the enhanced aggregation triggered by CPT is not explained through an accelerated aggregation of specifically newly synthesized proteins.</p><p>A shift in protein homeostasis has also been suggested to be key to the build-up of protein aggregates during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciryam et al., 2014</xref>) and to the initiation of protein aggregation in a range of chronic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morley et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, we find that proteins that aggregate after transient CPT treatment are enriched for constituents of various disease-associated protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). 67% (82/122) of them – or their mouse homologs – have already previously been identified in TDP-43 aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dammer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zuo et al., 2021</xref>), Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCormack et al., 2019</xref>), or α-synuclein-induced aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020</xref>), or found to aggregate in Huntington’s disease (HD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2017</xref>) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kepchia et al., 2020</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). An enrichment for HD and AD brain aggregating proteins was also observed among proteins that aggregate after inhibition of ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>If genotoxic conditions indeed over time lead to a lowering of the aggregating threshold, this would predict that they can also result in an accelerated aggregation of aggregation-prone model substrates. For example, disease-associated expanded polyQ proteins are inherently aggregation prone, and they have been shown to aggregate faster in systems in which protein homeostasis is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gidalevitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gidalevitz et al., 2010</xref>). We went back to HEK293 cells and employed a line carrying a stably integrated, tetracycline-inducible GFP-tagged Huntingtin exon 1 containing a 71 CAG-repeat (encoding Q71). Transient targeting of ATM, ATR, and in particular TOPs, but not TDP1, 24–48 hr prior to the expression of polyQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) indeed accelerated polyQ aggregation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), closely mirroring the increased aggregation that we observed before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The accelerated polyQ aggregation under these conditions is also dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>), and it is not explained by changes in total polyQ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). PolyQ aggregation is normally proportional to the length of the CAG repeat, which is intrinsically unstable. Importantly, we find no evidence that the accelerated polyQ aggregation induced by these genotoxic conditions can be explained by an exacerbated repeat instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Next, we also used the same tetracycline-inducible system and experimental set-up to investigate the aggregation of the protein folding model substrate luciferase-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K</xref>). We find that transient targeting of either ATM or TOP1 results in an enrichment of luciferase-GFP in the aggregated fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Genotoxic stress results in a rewiring of chaperone networks, which is however insufficient to prevent client aggregation</title><p>We noted that ATM inhibition and in particular CPT treatment resulted in an increased aggregation of multiple (co)chaperones in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

The overlap that exists between aggregating chaperones in each cell line suggests that this occurs mostly cell line specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

HSP70s (HSPAs) are among the most ubiquitous chaperones, and they have been shown to play a key role in maintaining protein homeostasis in virtually all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta and Singh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hunt and Morimoto, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lindquist and Craig, 1988</xref>). Upon cross-referencing the NIA and aggregating fractions against a recently generated client database of HSPA8 (HSC70; constitutively active form of HSP70) and HSPA1A (constitutively active and stress-inducible HSP70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ryu et al., 2020</xref>), we find that HSPA8 and HSPA1A clients are enriched among aggregating proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also mined the BioGRID human protein-protein interaction database using the complete KEGG dataset of (co)chaperones (168 entries). Although the transient and energetically weak nature of the interactions between many (co)chaperones and their clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clouser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mayer, 2018</xref>) makes it likely that these interactions are underrepresented in the BioGRID database, it can provide additional insight into the presence of (putative) chaperone clients in the aggregating fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Victor et al., 2020</xref>).

Overall, we find that the relative levels of chaperone engagement of the different aggregating fractions largely reflect their respective supersaturation and LLPS propensities.</p><p>When the capacity of chaperone systems is overloaded, this can eventually trigger a rewiring of chaperone systems. This plasticity allows cells to adapt to varying circumstances and proteotoxic stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>). In HEK293T cells, we find that treatment with CPT results in an overall upward shift of (co)chaperone expression levels, as measured in both our WCL MS/MS analysis (16 up, 8 down) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and in our RNAseq dataset (11 up, 5 down) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Upregulated chaperones include HSPB1, DNAJA1, HSPA5, HSPA8, and HSP90AA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), all of which are among the most frequent interactors of aggregating proteins in CPT-treated cells. The expression of most of these chaperones is regulated by the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Metchat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Neueder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Trinklein et al., 2004</xref>). HSF1 is indeed partially activated by CPT treatment in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). ATM inhibition in HEK293T cells resulted in a marginal HSF1 activation. This is in line with an overall less pronounced aggregation response after ATM inhibition in HEK293T cells, which appears to be insufficient to initiate a clear rewiring of chaperone systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In U2OS cells, a loss of ATM or treatment with CPT appears to result in a more balanced rewiring of chaperone systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). In CPT-treated U2OS cells, protein levels of multiple chaperones are even lowered. Nevertheless, similar to HEK293T cells, many of the most frequent (co)chaperone interactors of the aggregating proteins in U2OS are found to aggregate themselves as well. These findings indicate that (sufficient) genotoxic stress induces a rewiring of chaperone systems in a cell and stress-specific manner. This rewiring is however insufficient to prevent the increased aggregation of metastable client proteins.</p><p>We reasoned that the difference in aggregation between HEK293T and U2OS cells might also be reflected in different chaperone expression levels already under normal conditions. Indeed, a differential expression analysis between untreated HEK293T and untreated U2OS cells revealed a strong overall upward shift of (co)chaperone gene expression levels in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>). For example, we found that gene expression levels of the small heat shock-like protein Clusterin (CLU) are &gt;100-fold higher in wild-type U2OS compared to HEK293T cells, gene expression levels of the stress-inducible HSPA1A are &gt;150-fold higher, and that of HSPB5 (or CRYAB, i.e., αB-crystallin) were &gt;400-fold higher. Interestingly, the differences in expression of chaperone systems in U2OS compared to HEK293T overlap with the changes occurring after CPT treatment in the latter. Out of the 13 (co)chaperones identified to be expressed differently in both (RNAseq; –1 &gt; log2FC &gt; 1), 12 are altered in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Genotoxic stress-induced protein aggregation is amenable to modulation by chaperone systems</title><p>Our data suggest that the lowering of the aggregation threshold upon various genotoxic conditions is caused by an overload of chaperone systems, leading to a shift in protein homeostasis.

While most of these had no overt effect, overexpression of several JDPs reduced protein aggregation, including the generic anti-amyloidogenic protein DNAJB6b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aprile et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hageman et al., 2010</xref>). However, we found that the small heat shock protein HSPB5 was especially effective. HSPB5 is a potent suppressor of aggregation and amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delbecq and Klevit, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Golenhofen and Bartelt-Kirbach, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hatters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Webster et al., 2019</xref>).

HSPB5 overexpression also reduced ProteoStat aggresome staining and the occurrence of cytoplasmic FUS puncta (without affecting overall FUS levels; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), two other markers of a disrupted protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although HSPB5 itself has never been linked to genome maintenance, we evaluated whether HSPB5 can mitigate the increased aggregation following a loss of ATM in U2OS cells by altering DNA repair capacity.

Moreover, neither HSPB5, nor HSP70 nor HSP90 accumulated at either CPT- or gamma irradiation-induced DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). This points out that the overload of chaperones is not due to a sequestering to DNA damage sites.</p><p>HSPB5 is one of two chaperones that are transcriptionally upregulated in U2OS cells after either a loss of ATM or CPT treatment, and the only one that is not transcriptionally upregulated in CPT-treated HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Crucially, we found that overexpression of HSPB5 can reduce the enhanced protein aggregation in CPT-treated U2OS cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, I</xref>), but that stable overexpression of HSPB5 has no effect on the CPT-induced aggregation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These data emphasize that the rewiring of chaperone systems in response to genotoxic stress is tailored to each cell, depending largely on the ground state of protein homeostasis and concomitant aggregation that occurs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report that TOP poisoning and functional impairment of ATM or ATR trigger a widespread aggregation of LLPS-prone and supersaturated proteins. Our data show that the aggregation of these metastable proteins is a consequence of an overload of chaperone systems under these genotoxic conditions. This is illustrated by the aggregation of certain chaperones, and the observation that specifically the (putative) clients of these chaperones aggregate as well. It is further supported by the notion that CPT treatment leads to a strong reduction in protein synthesis over time, something that has been reported for other forms of DNA damage as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halim et al., 2018</xref>). Reduced protein synthesis is a well-known response to proteotoxic stress and is believed to lower the strong demand for chaperone capacity of nascent chains that are innately vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that despite a reduction in protein synthesis, genotoxic stress still leads to an overload of chaperone systems, causing protein homeostasis to shift. This effectively lowers the cell-intrinsic threshold of protein aggregation, and as a result, vulnerable proteins that are largely kept soluble under normal conditions now succumb more readily to aggregation. The accelerated aggregation of the model substrates polyQ- and luciferase that occurs in cells exposed to these conditions underlines this threshold change as well.</p><p>The observed shift in protein homeostasis after genotoxic stress is strikingly reminiscent of what is believed to occur under conditions of (chronic) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weids et al., 2016</xref>) and during many age-related neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">David et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morley et al., 2002</xref>). Supersaturated proteins have been found to be overrepresented in cellular pathways associated with these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciryam et al., 2015</xref>), and disease-associated aggregating proteins, including FUS, tau, and α-synuclein, are known to exhibit LLPS behavior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zbinden et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, we find that the proteins that aggregate in our experiments show a strong overlap in identity and function with stress-induced aggregation, and with the aggregation observed in various proteinopathies.</p><p>The shift in protein homeostasis under genotoxic stress conditions can theoretically be caused by either an altered capacity of protein quality control systems or by an increased demand emanating from an altered proteome. These are, however, difficult to disentangle fully, in particular because they may form a vicious cycle of events, where (co)chaperones are increasingly sequestered as a growing number of proteins succumbs to aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>). Either way, both result in a net lack of protein quality control capacity, which can be rescued by upregulating specific chaperones, and exacerbated by further decreasing chaperone capacity. The aggregation that occurs under the genotoxic conditions used in our study follows this pattern. Nevertheless, our data lead us to hypothesize that the overload of chaperone systems is largely caused by an increased demand for chaperone activity in the proteome. Multiple (co)chaperones that have been reported to interact frequently with the aggregating proteins are upregulated under the genotoxic conditions used in our study. Many of these (co)chaperones aggregate themselves as well. Crucially, further overexpression of one of the most upregulated chaperones in U2OS, HSPB5, is able to largely bring aggregation in CPT-treated and <italic>ATM</italic> KO cells back down to the control level.</p><p>The strong upregulation of several small heat shock (-like) proteins in U2OS cells, including HSPB5, seems to point at a rewiring of the chaperone network in this cell line towards a more prominent reliance on this class of chaperones. Small heat shock proteins have been reported to act together in heterodimers and hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aquilina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mymrikov et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, in vivo they rely on other chaperone systems such as the HSP70 machinery to efficiently counteract aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mogk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reinle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zwirowski et al., 2017</xref>). The low expression of small heat shock proteins in general and of HSPB5 specifically in HEK293(T) cells suggests that these cells might not be equipped to wield elevated levels of HSPB5 to prevent widespread aggregation of proteins. This may explain why elevated levels of HSPB5 have no effect on CPT-induced aggregation in HEK293 cells.</p><p>The strong overlap between CPT-induced aggregation in HEK293T cells and baseline aggregation in U2OS cells also argues for an increased demand. U2OS is a cancer cell line (osteosarcoma), whereas HEK293(T) cells have a vastly different origin (embryonic kidney). Cancer cells inherently exhibit elevated levels of protein stress, which has been attributed to an increased protein folding and degradation demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshaies, 2014</xref>). The notion that the rewiring of chaperone systems in response to CPT treatment in HEK293T cells mimics the difference in chaperone wiring between HEK293T and U2OS cells underlines this further.</p><p>Our data indicate that any increased demand caused by these genotoxic conditions is, however independent of quantitative changes of the aggregating proteins themselves and likely also of any genetic alterations in their coding regions (in <italic>cis</italic> genetic alterations). The accelerated polyQ aggregation – not accompanied by any enhanced CAG repeat instability – provides support for this. This is not necessarily surprising as proteins that aggregate as a consequence of an overload of the protein quality control do not have to be altered themselves. Previous studies have shown that during proteomic stress a destabilization of the background proteome can result in a competition for the limited chaperone capacity available, causing proteins that are highly dependent on chaperones for their stability and solubility to aggregate readily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gidalevitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gidalevitz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this light, it is interesting that the proteins that aggregate in our experiments are in general prone to engage in LLPS. LLPS is known to be regulated by RNA and often involves RNA-binding proteins. Strikingly, we find that the aggregation that occurs after genotoxic stress is enriched for RNA-binding proteins. This enhanced aggregation can also be mitigated by inhibiting PARylation, which plays a key role in the regulation of LLPS processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McGurk et al., 2018</xref>). LLPS is a different biochemical process than protein aggregation (with different underlying mechanisms and principles), but aberrant LLPS can drive the nucleation of insoluble (fibrillar) protein aggregates, for example, for polyQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Peskett et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore believed that LLPS events need to be closely regulated and monitored to prevent aberrant progression into a solid-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti and Dormann, 2019</xref>). Although data is so far limited, chaperones, and in particular small heat shock proteins, have been reported to play a pivotal role in the surveillance of biomolecular condensates. For example, the HSPB8-BAG3-HSPA1A complex has been found to be important for maintaining stress granule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganassi et al., 2016</xref>), and recent work uncovered that HSPB1 is important to prevent aberrant phase transitions of FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). We find that HSPB8, BAG3, and HSPA1A are upregulated in HEK293T cells treated with CPT. Interestingly, although HSPB5 itself has so far not been shown to undergo LLPS, like HSPB1, it has been found to associate with nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van den IJssel et al., 1998</xref>), which are membraneless as well. HSPB5 has also been shown to be important to maintain the stability of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Golenhofen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yin et al., 2019</xref>), and we find that many proteins that aggregate upon genotoxic stress conditions are cytoskeleton (-related) components. A growing body of evidence indicates that cytoskeleton organization is regulated through LLPS processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wiegand and Hyman, 2020</xref>). Our data thus indicate that genotoxic stress conditions can exacerbate the risk of aberrant progression of LLPS processes, which in turn may trigger an overload of chaperone systems.</p><p>The increased protein aggregation that occurs after a loss of ATM – including in A-T patient brains – has been recently attributed to an accumulation of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). As an impaired response to DNA damage is believed to be the primary driving force of A-T phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shiloh, 2020</xref>), these findings have fueled the idea that a disruption of protein homeostasis may be an important disease mechanism in A-T. Our data provide further support for this as they show that the widespread aggregation caused by a loss of ATM follows a predictable pattern that overlaps strikingly with the aggregation that is believed to underlie many neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, our findings also provide a proof of principle that other genotoxic conditions – including chemotherapeutic TOP poisons – can have a very similar impact. This points at the existence of a broader link between DNA damage and a loss of protein homeostasis . Although further research is needed to determine the full breadth and relevance of this link, our work may thus offer clues as to why besides impairments in ATM many other genome maintenance defects are characterized by often overlapping (neuro)degenerative phenotypes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Petr et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"

respective sections for more information). The statistical tests that were used are indicated in each figure legend. For experiments with pairwise comparisons, two-tailed Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used unless otherwise indicated. For experiments with multiple comparisons, a Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s post-hoc test (when datasets did not pass normality testing) or two-tailed Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests with Bonferroni correction (when indicated) was performed. p-Values are shown for all experiments. All repetitions (n) originate from independent replicates; any representation of technical repeats in figures is explicitly mentioned in the accompanying legend. Gels and stains were processed and analyzed using ImageJ software (Fiji).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mammalian cell culture</title><p>All parental cell lines were obtained from ATCC (see Key resources table) and are mycoplasma negative (GATC Biotech GA, Konstanz, Germany). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells expressing inducible GFP-Htt<sup>exon1-Q71</sup> (GFP-Q71) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hageman et al., 2010</xref>), and HEK293 cells expressing inducible luciferase-GFP as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hageman et al., 2011</xref>).

For the generation of U2OS and HEK293 cells overexpressing HSBP5, see later section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Western blotting and (immuno)staining</title><p>For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to either nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, probed with the indicated antibodies, and imaged in a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system. For an overview of all antibodies used in this study, see Key resources table.</p><p>For (immuno)staining, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1–0.2% Triton-X100, and incubated for 15 min with 0.5% BSA and 0.1% glycine solution in PBS. ProteoStat staining (ENZO, ENZ-51023-KP050) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibody incubation (see Key resources table) was performed overnight at 4°C. After secondary antibody incubation, cells were stained with Hoechst (Invitrogen, H1399) or DAPI as indicated, and mounted on microscopy slides in Citifluor (Agar Scientific). Cells were observed using a confocal scanning microscope (Leica), and images were processed using ImageJ software (Fiji). The aggresome signature was defined as cells exhibiting both a curved nucleus and perinuclear presence of ProteoStat dye. For DNA repair kinetics experiments, cells were irradiated with 2 Gy (IBL-637 irradiator, CIS Biointernational), fixed at the indicated timepoints post-irradiation, and stained for 53BP1. For the localization experiments of HSPB5, HSP70, and HSP90, U2OS cells were either irradiated with 2 Gy or treated for 24 hr with CPT (400 nM), and left to recover for 48 hr before immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Genotoxic drug treatments</title><p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> (and Key resources table) for an overview of the drugs and concentrations used in this study. For genotoxic drug treatments, cells were treated with drugs in the indicated doses. The culture medium was replaced 24 hr after drug treatment, and after another 48 hr (unless explicitly mentioned otherwise) cells were harvested by scraping in PBS, centrifugation, and snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Differential detergent protein fractionation</title><p>Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCL<sub>2</sub>, 1% v/v Igepal CA-630 (#N3500, US Biological), cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.1 unit/µl benzonase endonuclease (Merck Millipore) and left for 1 hr on ice with intermittent vortexing. Protein content was measured and equalized, and Igepal CA-630 insoluble proteins were pelleted by high-speed centrifugation (21,000 rcf, 45 min, 4°C). Protein pellets were washed with lysis buffer without Igepal CA-630 and redissolved in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% v/v SDS at room temperature (RT) in a Thermomixer R (Eppendorf) at 1200 rpm for 1–2 hr. SDS-insoluble proteins were then pelleted by high-speed centrifugation (21,000 rcf, 45 min). SDS-insoluble protein pellets were washed with lysis buffer without any detergent. For subsequent silver staining, pellets were solubilized in urea buffer (8 M urea, 2% v/v SDS, 50 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4) overnight at RT in a Thermomixer R (Eppendorf) at 1200 rpm. For subsequent Western blotting, pellets were solubilized in concentrated sample buffer (4% SDS, 125 mM Tris pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, bromophenol blue), boiled for 10 min, and left overnight RT in a Thermomixer R (Eppendorf) at 1200 rpm.

After elution, samples where dried up on speed-vac and resuspended in 25 µl of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (MS quality, Thermo). Mass spectral analysis was conducted on a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (B). Samples were loaded using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system onto a 75 µm × 50 cm Acclaim PepMap RSLC nanoViper column filled with 2 µm C18 particles (Thermo Scientific) using a 120 min LC-MS method at a flow rate of 0.3 µl/min as follows: 3% B over 3 min; 3–45% B over 87 min; 45–80% B over 1 min; then wash at 80% B over 14 min, 80 to 3% B over 1 min and then the column was equilibrated with 3% B for 14 min. For precursor peptides and fragmentation detection on the mass spectrometer, MS1 survey scans (<italic>m/z</italic> 200–2000) were performed at a resolution of 120,000 with a 300% normalized AGC target. Peptide precursors from charge states 2–6 were sampled for MS2 using Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA). For MS2 scan properties, Higher Energy Collision Dissociation (HCD) was used and the fragments were analyzed in the orbitrap with a collisional energy of 30 %, resolution of 15000, Standard AGC target, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms.</p><p>MaxQuant version 1.6.7.0 was used for peptides and protein identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>) and quantification with a proteomic database of reviewed proteins sequences downloaded from Uniprot (08/17/2020, proteome:up000005640; reviewed:yes). Abbreviated MaxQuant settings: LFQ with minimum peptide counts (razor + unique) ≥ 2 and at least one unique peptide; variable modifications were oxidation (M), acetyl (protein N-term), and phospho (STY); carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification with trypsin/P as the enzyme.</p><p>ProteinGroup.txt from MaxQuant output was used for protein significance analysis via postprocessing in R (R Core Team 2021): potential contaminant and reversed protein sequences were filtered out, partial or complete missing values in either case or control replicates were imputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dou et al., 2020</xref>) in parallel 100 times, and subsequently averaged log<sub>2</sub>-transformed LFQ intensities were used for <italic>t</italic>-tests, including Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected, <italic>p</italic>-adjusted values. Log<sub>2</sub> fold change for each protein record was calculated by subtracting the average log<sub>2</sub> LFQ intensity across all replicates in control samples from the average log<sub>2</sub> LFQ intensity across all replicates in case samples. To mitigate imputation-induced artifacts among significant proteins, only significant proteins detected and quantified in at least two replicates were considered: p-adjusted value ≤ 0.05 and, for cases (log<sub>2</sub> fold change ≥ 1, replicates with nonimputed data ≥ 2), or for controls (log<sub>2</sub> fold change ≤ –1, replicates with nonimputed data ≥ 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNAseq library construction and sequencing</title><p>RNA was isolated from cells with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit from QIAGEN.

The authors convincingly show how different sources of DNA damage, such as impaired ATM and ATR responses, as well pharmacologic blockage of topoisomerase 1 and 2, is conducive to increased protein aggregation. These experiments are conducted in two different cell types, proving conservation of the observed effects across systems. The authors show how aggregation-prone proteins aggregate more readily upon DNA damage induction, which lowers the threshold for aggregation. These results are supported by several independent methods, including testing aggregation kinetics in a known aggregation-prone protein (Hungtingtin exon 1) after DNA damage induction.</p><p>Mechanistically, the authors manage to connect lowered aggregation threshold after DNA damage to chaperones dysfunctional networking, which can be buffered by induction of small chaperones, including HSPB5, a known aggregation suppressor.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript the claims are well balanced and the authors do a great job in acknowledging potential limitations of their findings, as well as giving credit to previously published work with results that in part overlap and support some parts of their findings.</p><p>Congratulations on a very well conducted and written study. I had a great time reading it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Defects in the DNA-damage response (DDR) are the cause of several human genetic syndromes, commonly characterised by neurodegeneration and cancer predisposition, such as Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), caused by inactivation of ATM, a key regulator of the DDR. Previous studies have linked ATM deficiency to increased protein aggregation. The current manuscript expands the connection between DNA damage and protein aggregation by analysing additional genotoxic conditions and identifying the proteome susceptible to aggregation upon DNA damage. Moreover, the authors show that modulation of chaperone levels affects the extent of DNA-damage-induced aggregation, suggesting that increased aggregation upon DNA damage is likely a result of an overloaded chaperone system.</p><p>The specific observations are:</p><p>– The authors found that genotoxic conditions, such as treatment with topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT), cause an increase in protein aggregation.</p><p>– The authors found that aggregating proteins produced by ATM loss and CPT treatment are different, probably because of cell-type proteome differences.</p><p>– In addition, the authors found that aggregating proteins upon CPT treatment are in general supersaturated and prone to aggregate.</p><p>– The authors showed that genotoxic conditions accelerate the aggregation of expanded polyQ protein aggregation models without increasing the number of CAG repeats.</p><p>– The authors found that CPT treatment reduces the solubility of multiple chaperones and causes changes in chaperone gene expression.</p><p>– Also, authors found that HSP70 inhibitor increased CPT-induced protein aggregation while the overexpression of HSPB5 reduced protein aggregation observed in ATM deficient cells.</p><p>The results broadly support the descriptive conclusions made in the manuscript.</p><p>Importantly, the study links two rather distinct fields, namely genotoxicity and proteostasis, thus bring out novel thoughts and datasets.</p><p>Some points for further consideration are:</p><p>(1) Previous study showed that proteasome-mediated protein degradation is impaired in ATM deficient cells (PMID: 21298066) and defects on ATM have shown increased protein aggregation (PMID: 29317520 and 16189515). In addition, deficiencies in ATM and the related protein MRE11 have also been shown to cause protein aggregation driven by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) hyperactivation (PMID: 33571423). The proposed manuscript expands the association between DNA damage and protein insolubility by describing additional genotoxic insults also cause protein aggregation. The manuscript performs various different analyses with lists of aggregated proteins which may prove useful in linking this study to neurodegeneration and ageing. On the mechanistic side, however, the underlying causes that link DNA damage and protein aggregation remain unknown as detailed below.</p><p>(i) The various descriptive analyses to characterise protein aggregation upon genotoxic conditions are convincing and complementary. However, the 24h genotoxic treatment followed by 48h additional hours before studying aggregation introduces complex effects of these stressful conditions. The long time gap between DNA damage and sampling for aggregation makes interpretation of direct causality of DNA damage on aggregation hard. E.g. could there be a cell-cycle checkpoint activated/ mitochondria/ ER defects introduced as a consequence of DNA damage that ultimately lead to protein aggregation?</p><p>(ii) Previous studies have shown that ATM can be independently activated by oxidative stress caused by reactive oxidative species (ROS) (PMID: 20966255) and Double-strand Breaks by a Mre11-dependent mechanism. Defects on ROS-dependent activation of ATM cause dysregulation of protein homeostasis (PMID: 29317520), suggesting ROS increase and PARP hyperactivation as the source of neurotoxicity observed in Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) disease. However, mutations in Mre11 also generate cerebellar neurodegeneration and protein aggregation by a ROS-independent mechanism (PMID: 33571423). If would be especially interesting to assess if protein aggregation produced by additional genotoxic treatments used in this study (ATR inhibition, topoisomerase poisoning) depends on ROS accumulation and PARP hyperactivation as well. In addition, it would be interesting to evaluate the activation of the major regulator of protein homeostasis (HSF1) upon the different insults. Furthermore, it would be clarifying to analyse if genotoxic-induced protein aggregation depends on nascent translation to offer more mechanistic details. E.g. it has been shown that acute proteotoxic stress causes nascent polypeptides to get ubiquitinated. It would be interesting to know whether the proteins that aggregate upon DNA damage are newly synthesized.</p><p>(2) Along the manuscript two different models are used (ATM loss in U2OS and CPT treatment in HEK29T cells). Comparisons between the protein aggregation induced by the two genotoxic conditions are complicated since they are distinct cell lines and should be avoided. Furthermore, author should explain why only some models are used in some experiments, since for example, it might be interesting to assess if HSPB5 overexpression has an equivalent effect on CPT-induced protein aggregation.</p><p>(3) The accelerated aggregation of polyQ-GFP upon genotoxic conditions results are clear, however, authors should include whole-cell extract (WCE) controls in these experiments, since the level of aggregation is completely dependent on the expression levels of the protein and the used treatments can alter expression levels. For instance, this can be observed in Figure 4G (comparing ATM and TOP1 inhibition).</p><p>(4) The authors argue that genotoxic conditions cause the aggregation of supersaturated proteins. Although, this might be true in the case of CPT-treated HEK293T, it doesn't explain the protein aggregation observed in ATM knockout U2OS cells. Author should discuss this in further details and offer more convincing observation to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>(5) The authors state that upon CPT treatment the expression of certain chaperone was altered, this result doesn't seem to be well supported by the volcano plots shown in Figure 5E and 5F. The authors should discuss the transcriptional changes results from a broad perspective since, clearly, chaperone-encoding genes are not the most differentially expressed genes.</p><p>(6) The chaperone overload model to explain DNA-damage-induced aggregation is an interesting interpretation. However it is not clear if HSP70 inhibition/ HSPB5 overexpression alter the manner in which aggregated proteins are handled by cells. Thus it is hard to argue whether chaperone overload is the reason for the aggregation in the first place or the experimental manipulation of chaperones (HSP70 inhibition) lowers the ability of cells to manage aggregated proteins. If chaperone overload is the reason of aggregation, what is causing chaperones to be overloaded? Do the chaperones get titrated to damaged DNA or in ubiquitin signaling that is on hyperdrive during DNA damage?</p><p>Long treatment time used allow cells to pass through several DNA replication cycles, so the authors could evaluate whether the observed protein aggregation upon genotoxic treatments depends on DNA replication.</p><p>Previous studies in yeast have proposed that deficiency in ribosomal RNA and proteins synthesis lead to proteotoxic stress (PMID: 30843788) and defects on DNA topoisomerase I have been shown to cause similar consequences (PMID: 1124783). Therefore, it would be worth assessing whether rRNA stress/instability could explain the increased protein aggregation observed upon genotoxic insults again to offer mechanistic insights.</p><p>The Figure 4G is not cited in the manuscript.</p><p>WCE levels of HSPB5 overexpression should also be shown in corresponding experiments (Figure 6C, G), as well as the total expression of FUS in WT and ATM deficient cells by the same reasons as mentioned above.</p><p>Also, the authors should provide the list of the RNAseq analysis results showing the changes in gene expression and the statistical information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Protein instability with subsequent widespread protein aggregation occurs during aging, in neurodegenerative diseases and in response to various stresses. Previous work from different groups identified widespread protein aggregation linked to impairment of the DNA damage response. This work sets out to investigate the impact on protein aggregation following treatment with a variety of drugs targeting the DNA damage response.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study provides an in depth comparison of protein aggregation in two different cell lines in response to impairment of DNA damage repair. Extensive bioinformatics analysis reveals the characteristics of the aggregated fraction after treatment of CPT targeting topoisomerase 1. In particular, they show an enrichment of LLPS prone proteins and proteins previously identified with neurodegenerative disease aggregates. Importantly with a comprehensive analysis of whole proteome and insoluble proteome mass spectrometry data combined with RNAseq data, they expose changes in the chaperone system. Using an over-expression screen, they find that increasing levels of small heat shock protein HSPB5 reduces widespread protein aggregation following genotoxic stress related to ATM knockout.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study benefits from a comprehensive omics and bioinformatics analysis, the main experimental setup is questionable: two different treatments (CPT drug versus ATM genetic knockdown) are compared in two different cellular backgrounds (non-cancerous HEK-293T versus cancerous U2OS cells). This setup makes it difficult to distinguish effects due to the different cellular background or treatments.</p><p>Line 125: The claim that &quot;different drug treatments drive the aggregation of a similar set of proteins (Figure 1C)&quot; is not sufficiently justified. This claim is based on the analysis of only three proteins and a densitometry analysis of the stained insoluble proteome on an SDS-PAGE gel. Also the claim is not substantiated by an overlap between the proteins in the increased aggregation fraction in CPT versus ATM KO treatments (Figure 2E). The previous study by Lee et al., 2021 referred to in the introduction, provides a more relevant comparison showing the strong overlap of proteins in the insoluble fraction in the same cellular background with loss of MRE11 or ATM.</p><p>Line 135: “we identified a total of 1826 aggregated proteins across U2OS wild-type and ATM KO cells” and line 115 “We picked up a total of 983 aggregated proteins”. These numbers include proteins identified in only one replicate of the aggregated fractions from either case or control. I would advise to state the number of proteins identified in &gt;1 repeats from either case or control.</p><p>Line 161-163: “we examined which proteins already aggregate in the background of untreated HEK293T and U2OS cells (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p&gt;0.05, identified in &gt;1 repeats of both case and control) (Figure 2A, D). The definition of the “Background aggregation” is unclear and potentially misleading. If only non-significant proteins in over one repeat in both case and control are included, then the background aggregation set does not include proteins identified only in untreated. Also proteins with increased aggregation that also aggregate in the control conditions are not included in the background set. This explains why there is no overlap between increased aggregation and background aggregation in Figure 2E.</p><p>Line 255: “we conclude that both CPT-treatment and a loss of ATM further exacerbate the aggregation of LLPS-prone and supersaturated proteins, in a cell-type dependent manner”. As one cell is cancerous and the other not, it is unclear if any conclusions can be made related to cell-type.</p><p>HSPB5 is significantly up-regulated in U2OS ATM KO but not in HEK293T CPT treated cells. Does HSPB5 over-expression also prevent aggregation in HEK293T CPT treated cells? This would help to determine the breath of action of HSPB5 in combating genotoxic stress related protein aggregation.</p><p>Additional experiments to strengthen the science:</p><p>I recommend comparing CPT treatment in U2OS versus HEK-293T cells and ATM inhibition by drug treatment versus CPT drug treatment in one cell type. It would be interesting to see the results related to SG proteins, heat-sensitive and enrichment for constituents of disease-associated protein aggregates for the ATM KO aggregation set. Also it would be important to show that HSPB5 overexpression alleviates protein aggregation in HEK293T CPT treated cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70726.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers acknowledge that this study bridges two distinct fields, namely genotoxicity and proteostasis and has several potential important implications.

These datasets allow us now to compare different treatments within a cell line, and a single stress across the two cell lines. These comparisons support our earlier conclusions, and in our opinion these datasets definitely improved the manuscript, as we think that the study certainly became more mature, and the conclusions more solid.</p><p>In addition, we made use of the opportunity to also improve the statistical analysis of our MS/MS data. Previously, we relied on a 1-seed imputation method to impute missing data. However, we realized that a single random sample from a given distribution can render outliers, especially when such a sampling process is repeated for a number of missing values. We therefore opted to switch to a more accurate 100-seed imputation method, in which for each missing value 100 samples are generated using different seeds and subsequently averaged. This ensures that randomly distributed outliers have a minimal impact on the imputed values.

To strengthen this argument, we now provide additional data showing that none of the chaperones that we tested is present at DNA damage sites caused either by CPT or by γ irradiation (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>In our manuscript we hypothesize that in certain genotoxic backgrounds chaperones become overloaded because of an increased cellular demand for chaperone capacity emanating from the proteome, affecting mostly supersaturated, LLPS-prone client proteins that subsequently aggregate. Importantly, this includes the aggregation of putative clients of those chaperones that also co-aggregate. This suggests that the aggregation of certain chaperones may in cases of high levels of genotoxic stress further accelerate the aggregation of their clients/substrates in a vicious cycle.</p><p>This study bridges genotoxic stress with protein aggregation. Uncovering further molecular details regarding the initial trigger of the increased cellular demand for chaperone capacity goes beyond the aim of this study – they will need to be elucidated by future studies on this newly described phenomenon. In the manuscript we did rephrase parts of the Discussion (lines 519-529 and 541-543) but at this point, we feel that a further in-depth discussion of this would quickly become too speculative, so we refrained from it in the manuscript. Having said that, in our opinion the link between DNA damage and liquid liquid phase separation is an intriguing option. PARylation is known to decorate various types of (single strand) DNA damage. PARylation also plays a key role in the regulation of LLPS processes, and the addition of PAR to a substrate has been hypothesized to initiate and accelerate LLPS, and increase the risk of progressing into a solid-like state. The fact that proteins that aggregate after genotoxic stress are frequently LLPS-prone therefore hints at the existence of a coupling between DNA damage and PARP hyperactivation occurring throughout the cell. This could lead to an increased demand for chaperone capacity regulating LLPS processes. It is possible that besides PARylation, other protein modifications would play a role here as well.</p><p>It might indeed be possible that ubiquitin signaling plays a role as it is a crucial part of the DNA Damage Response. However, we want to emphasize that our analysis reveals that there is no direct correlation between an increase in protein level and the increased aggregation (Figure 4A and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A). In other words, the proteins that aggregate do not do so because their levels were altered, because of, for example, an impaired UPS-mediated degradation. However, we certainly do not want to rule out a role for ubiquitin-mediated signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main points that need to be addressed experimentally/analytically for the paper to be considered for publication are the following:</p><p>1. Does HSPB5 overexpression have an effect on CPT-induced protein aggregation? Does HSPB5 over-expression also prevent aggregation in HEK293T CPT treated cells? This would help to determine the breath of action of HSPB5 in combating genotoxic stress related protein aggregation.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested both questions. Overexpression of HSPB5 can suppress the aggregation induced by CPT in U2OS cells (Figure 6H, I). As requested, we now also generated HEK293 cells stably overexpressing HSPB5, but found that in those cells CPT still triggers enhanced aggregation (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1G). This is perhaps not surprising as HSPB5 is barely present in HEK293 cells, and it is also not upregulated under the conditions of genotoxic stress used in our study. It has been suggested that small heat shock chaperones (including HSPB5) operate together in hetero-dimers and hetero-oligomers, and that in vivo they depend on other chaperone systems to efficiently counteract aggregation. Our findings indicate that the rewiring of chaperone systems (and by extension, the possibility of rescuing aggregation through overexpression of in this case HSPB5) is tailored to each cell. We changed our conclusions accordingly (in both the Discussion (lines 490-500) and the Abstract (lines 13-14)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Compare CPT treatment in U2OS versus HEK-293T cells and ATM inhibition by drug treatment versus CPT drug treatment in one cell type. The analysis should clarify results related to SG proteins, heat-sensitive and enrichment for constituents of disease-associated protein aggregates for the ATM KO aggregation set.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now added two extra datasets, which allowed us to compare the two treatments in the two different cell lines. We also included these in the subsequent analyses, including the enrichment for proteins that aggregate after HS, constituents of stress granules, and in certain aggregation-diseases (Figure 4B, C and E, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C, D). Briefly, we find that aggregation induced by a loss of ATM function also overlaps with the aggregation in HS, SG components, and certain disease aggregates, and hence further support our earlier conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Are proteins that aggregate upon DNA damage newly synthesized?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed pulse experiments with radioactive (<sup>35</sup>S) methionine and cysteine in combination with our aggregation assay. This revealed a strong reduction in protein synthesis after CPT treatment (as has been shown before for other forms of DNA damage). Despite this reduction in protein synthesis, we can clearly measure that newly synthesized proteins indeed still aggregate potently (Figure 4E). That being said, the relative contribution of newly synthesized proteins to the aggregated fraction is not significantly altered after genotoxic stress (Figure 4D). This indicates that the enhanced aggregation cannot be (solely) explained by an increased aggregation of specifically newly synthesized proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[….]</p><p>Some points for further consideration are:</p><p>(1) Previous study showed that proteasome-mediated protein degradation is impaired in ATM deficient cells (PMID: 21298066) and defects on ATM have shown increased protein aggregation (PMID: 29317520 and 16189515). In addition, deficiencies in ATM and the related protein MRE11 have also been shown to cause protein aggregation driven by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) hyperactivation (PMID: 33571423). The proposed manuscript expands the association between DNA damage and protein insolubility by describing additional genotoxic insults also cause protein aggregation. The manuscript performs various different analyses with lists of aggregated proteins which may prove useful in linking this study to neurodegeneration and ageing. On the mechanistic side, however, the underlying causes that link DNA damage and protein aggregation remain unknown as detailed below.</p><p>(i) The various descriptive analyses to characterise protein aggregation upon genotoxic conditions are convincing and complementary. However, the 24h genotoxic treatment followed by 48h additional hours before studying aggregation introduces complex effects of these stressful conditions. The long time gap between DNA damage and sampling for aggregation makes interpretation of direct causality of DNA damage on aggregation hard. E.g. could there be a cell-cycle checkpoint activated/ mitochondria/ ER defects introduced as a consequence of DNA damage that ultimately lead to protein aggregation?</p></disp-quote><p>DNA damage, including treatment with topoisomerase poisons, is known to elicit a cell cycle checkpoint arrest. One of the primary defects in ATM or ATR-compromised cells is that they are impaired in eliciting this checkpoint response. The observation that aggregation is induced after when lacking functional checkpoint kinases suggests that the checkpoint activation per se is not necessary to induce aggregation under these circumstances. Still, it could be possible that checkpoint activation influences the aggregation process. To correctly and fully assess the role of cell cycle checkpoints would be a separate study in itself that goes beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Mitochondrial and ER-resident proteins are among the proteins that aggregate, as for example becomes clear from the GO-term analyses of aggregating proteins in HEK293T cells treated with CPT (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D-I). However, this is not consistent between the two different treatments, and between the two cell lines, suggesting that mitochondrial or ER damage does not play a primary role in aggregation induced by genotoxic stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Previous studies have shown that ATM can be independently activated by oxidative stress caused by reactive oxidative species (ROS) (PMID: 20966255) and Double-strand Breaks by a Mre11-dependent mechanism. Defects on ROS-dependent activation of ATM cause dysregulation of protein homeostasis (PMID: 29317520), suggesting ROS increase and PARP hyperactivation as the source of neurotoxicity observed in Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) disease. However, mutations in Mre11 also generate cerebellar neurodegeneration and protein aggregation by a ROS-independent mechanism (PMID: 33571423). If would be especially interesting to assess if protein aggregation produced by additional genotoxic treatments used in this study (ATR inhibition, topoisomerase poisoning) depends on ROS accumulation and PARP hyperactivation as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested both the dependency of ROS and PARP in the aggregation process using the inhibitors NAC and Ku-58948, respectively. The results for blocking ROS with NAC yielded inconsistent results (data therefore not included in the manuscript). The effects of blocking PARP were striking: PARP inhibition can reduce CPT-induced aggregation in HEK293T cells (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1F, G), which is highly reminiscent of the results published before for ATM deficient cells (PMID: 33571423). This implies that PARP (hyper)activation may play a role in genotoxic stress-induced aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it would be interesting to evaluate the activation of the major regulator of protein homeostasis (HSF1) upon the different insults.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the activation of HSF1 in both ATM-compromised cells and after CPT treatment. A partial activation of HSF1 can be observed after CPT-treatment; however, after ATM inhibition this is less prominent. This is in line with an overall less strong aggregation response in the case of ATM inhibition (Figure 1C, Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, it would be clarifying to analyse if genotoxic-induced protein aggregation depends on nascent translation to offer more mechanistic details. E.g. it has been shown that acute proteotoxic stress causes nascent polypeptides to get ubiquitinated. It would be interesting to know whether the proteins that aggregate upon DNA damage are newly synthesized.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested whether newly synthesized proteins aggregate in cells subjected to CPT and find that they do, despite a strong reduction in protein synthesis (Figure 4D). However, the relative contribution of newly synthesized proteins to aggregation appears to be unchanged (Figure 4D). This indicates that the enhanced aggregation occurring in CPT-treated cells cannot be (solely) explained by an enhanced aggregation of newly synthesized proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Along the manuscript two different models are used (ATM loss in U2OS and CPT treatment in HEK29T cells). Comparisons between the protein aggregation induced by the two genotoxic conditions are complicated since they are distinct cell lines and should be avoided.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct and we now added two extra MS/MS and RNAseq datasets that support our earlier conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, author should explain why only some models are used in some experiments, since for example, it might be interesting to assess if HSPB5 overexpression has an equivalent effect on CPT-induced protein aggregation.</p></disp-quote><p>This has largely changed with the addition of the new datasets. With regards to the latter: we now show that overexpression of HSPB5 can indeed suppress CPT-induced aggregation in U2OS cells (Figure 6H, I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The accelerated aggregation of polyQ-GFP upon genotoxic conditions results are clear, however, authors should include whole-cell extract (WCE) controls in these experiments, since the level of aggregation is completely dependent on the expression levels of the protein and the used treatments can alter expression levels. For instance, this can be observed in Figure 4G (comparing ATM and TOP1 inhibition).</p></disp-quote><p>The WCE controls can be found in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1G and H.</p><p>CPT and Etop indeed lead to higher levels in the WCE of the GFP-Q71 tetracycline-inducible stable cell line we used. However, it is important to note that the accelerated aggregation cannot be explained by this increase alone. For example, ATM and ATR inhibitors do not have this effect, while still inducing polyQ-GFP aggregation (Figure 4F, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1G and I). Low doses of Etoposide do not increase the total levels of GFP-Q71 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1H), while these doses do lead to an accelerated aggregation (Figure 4G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors argue that genotoxic conditions cause the aggregation of supersaturated proteins. Although, this might be true in the case of CPT-treated HEK293T, it doesn’t explain the protein aggregation observed in ATM knockout U2OS cells. Author should discuss this in further details and offer more convincing observation to strengthen their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our new data and improved analysis provide additional clarification on this point. We now show that ATM treatment of HEK293T cells also triggers the enhanced aggregation of supersaturated, LLPS-prone proteins. Importantly, many of the proteins that aggregate after CPT treatment or ATM-inhibition in HEK293T cells are already subject to aggregation in U2OS cells under control conditions and are present in what we refer to as the ‘baseline aggregation’ (Figure 2F). <italic>ATM</italic> KO and CPT treatment in U2OS cells still trigger additional aggregation. These additionally aggregating proteins appear indeed less supersaturated than those in HEK293T cells, and in fact the difference with the U2OS NIA (i.e. non-aggregating proteins) is no longer significant for CPT-treated cells (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1M, N). Aggregating proteins in <italic>ATM</italic> KO cells are LLPS-prone, for proteins that aggregate after CPT-treatment this is less prominent. Importantly, as in the HEK293T experiments, proteins that aggregate under these two conditions are both still enriched for heat-sensitive proteins, stress granule constituents (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C, D), and chaperone clients (Figure 5B, C and Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). This pattern suggests that different cell lines have different “layers” of vulnerable proteins, depending on their ground state of protein homeostasis. In HEK293T cells this ground state is high, putting only highly vulnerable proteins (high supersaturation, high LLPS propensity) under threat of aggregation upon genotoxic stress. In U2OS cells this ground state is much lower, and many of the most vulnerable proteins are already subject to aggregation. Genotoxic stress in U2OS therefore elicits the aggregation of proteins that are less well-predicted by supersaturation and LLPS-proneness. This is visualized in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B, which we adapted to illustrate this point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors state that upon CPT treatment the expression of certain chaperone was altered, this result doesn’t seem to be well supported by the volcano plots shown in Figure 5E and 5F.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous manuscript we referred to both transcript and protein levels while these changes were more apparent at the transcript levels, we agree that this was confusing. We changed this in the text (lines 370-375). Importantly, the improved analysis of our data and the inclusion of the two new datasets (Figure 5 and in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1) still allow us to conclude that (functional) loss of ATM or CPT treatment does result in a rewiring of the chaperone network (although more subtle for ATM inhibition in HEK293T cells) in a cell line and stress-specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should discuss the transcriptional changes results from a broad perspective since, clearly, chaperone-encoding genes are not the most differentially expressed genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a GO-term analysis (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2) and added an accompanying paragraph in the text that discusses the transcriptional changes from a broader perspective (lines 250-256). We kept this concise however, as we found no obvious overlap between stress conditions or global transcriptional changes that would clearly provide additional explanations as to the forces that drive aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The chaperone overload model to explain DNA-damage-induced aggregation is an interesting interpretation. However it is not clear if HSP70 inhibition/ HSPB5 overexpression alter the manner in which aggregated proteins are handled by cells. Thus it is hard to argue whether chaperone overload is the reason for the aggregation in the first place or the experimental manipulation of chaperones (HSP70 inhibition) lowers the ability of cells to manage aggregated proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>The “overload of chaperones-model” that we propose is strengthened by our new data, and is based on the following observations: (1) Chaperone clients are significantly enriched in the aggregating fractions (Figure 5B and C). (2) Multiple (co)chaperones aggregate themselves (Figure 5A and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A-E). (3) Putative clients of those (co)chaperones that aggregate are overrepresented in the list of aggregating proteins (Figure 5D and Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). (4) The inhibition of HSP70, at a dose which is not causing aggregation under normal circumstances, increases the aggregation after CPT even more (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A). (5) Genotoxic stress leads to a partial activation of HSF1 over time. (6) HSPB5 is upregulated in U2OS cells subjected to genotoxic stress (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1G-H), and overexpression of HSPB5 is able to fully rescue the increased aggregation both after CPT-treatment and after a loss of <italic>ATM</italic> (Figure 6B, C, H, I). Together, these data confirm the prominent role of chaperones in the genotoxic stress-induced aggregation process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If chaperone overload is the reason of aggregation, what is causing chaperones to be overloaded?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an intriguing but difficult question to answer. In our manuscript we focused mainly on the reason why proteins aggregate after genotoxic stress. We reveal that supersaturated proteins that are LLPS-prone aggregate due to an overload of chaperones, which is reminiscent of aggregation after canonical protein stress such as HS. We want to point out that also under these conditions the exact molecular details are not well understood. Our data leads us to hypothesize that the overload of chaperone systems caused by (transient) genotoxic stress is caused by an increased demand for chaperone capacity. This likely includes an increased demand for preventing aberrant LLPS, and may very well also include a more global increase in folding/conformational maintenance demands. We have clarified this in the Discussion (lines 519-529 and 541-543).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the chaperones get titrated to damaged DNA or in ubiquitin signaling that is on hyperdrive during DNA damage?</p></disp-quote><p>Importantly, HSPB5 overexpression has no impact on the formation and resolution of γ radiation-induced DNA damage foci (Figure 6 —figure supplement 6D, E). We have now also tested a few chaperones that are important for our study (HSPB5, HSP70 and HSP90), and found that none of these accumulate on DNA damage sites, neither on CPT-induced DNA damage nor on γ irradiation-induced DNA damage (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>Ubiquitin signaling is an important part of the DNA damage response. Therefore, it might be possible that it plays a role in the accelerated aggregation we observe. How ubiquitin signaling and chaperone function relate is an interesting topic which is not that well understood in general. However, to our knowledge there is no indication that DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation results in a lack of available or “free” ubiquitin that is necessary for other processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Long treatment time used allow cells to pass through several DNA replication cycles, so the authors could evaluate whether the observed protein aggregation upon genotoxic treatments depends on DNA replication.</p></disp-quote><p>Although some of the higher CPT doses we used elicit a strong checkpoint response which arrested the cells (not shown), thereby minimizing the rounds of replication, we cannot rule out that replication could play an (exacerbating) role in the increased aggregation. To elucidate in how far replication would contribute is in our opinion beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previous studies in yeast have proposed that deficiency in ribosomal RNA and proteins synthesis lead to proteotoxic stress (PMID: 30843788) and defects on DNA topoisomerase I have been shown to cause similar consequences (PMID: 1124783). Therefore, it would be worth assessing whether rRNA stress/instability could explain the increased protein aggregation observed upon genotoxic insults again to offer mechanistic insights.</p></disp-quote><p>Our RNAseq analysis nor our MS analysis hinted to problems in rRNA synthesis or ribosomal proteins to aggregate more under genotoxic stress conditions. This certainly does not mean that problems in protein synthesis do not play a role, and in fact we now added data showing that newly synthesized proteins are present in the CPT-induced aggregation fraction. However, as explained above, the relative aggregation of newly synthesized proteins is not significantly altered in cells exposed to genotoxic stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Figure 4G is not cited in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>WCE levels of HSPB5 overexpression should also be shown in corresponding experiments (Figure 6C,G), as well as the total expression of FUS in WT and ATM deficient cells by the same reasons as mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a blot of the same lysates probed for HSPB5.

If only non-significant proteins in over one repeat in both case and control are included, then the background aggregation set does not include proteins identified only in untreated.

This explains why there is no overlap between increased aggregation and background aggregation in Figure 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear here. We previously indeed defined ‘Background aggregation’ as those proteins that aggregated unchanged in case versus control. They had to be picked up at least twice in case or control. Our aim was to group those proteins that aggregated to a similar extent within a cell line, regardless of the presence or absence of genotoxic stress. We did this because we wanted to investigate if the (physicochemical) properties of those proteins are different from those that aggregate (more) under genotoxic stress. We understand that the term ‘Background aggregation’ may in itself have caused some confusion, and so we changed it to ‘Baseline aggregation’.</p><p>We want to emphasize that taking baseline aggregation into account proved critical to our study, as it revealed that genotoxic stress-induced aggregation depends mostly on the cell line-intrinsic threshold of aggregation. We believe that our study is thereby also highly relevant for studies of protein aggregation in general. It illustrates the importance of looking at what we call ‘baseline aggregation’, for example in the context of proteinopathies – this is currently not often done. In other words, the fact that specific proteins aggregate in one cell but not in another may not necessarily mean that different processes are at work, but could very well reflect cell-to-cell differences in the ground state of protein homeostasis.</p><p>Of note: our additional MS/MS experiments now allow us to use a more strict cut-off for this group of proteins. Baseline aggregation for HEK293T and U2OS cells is now defined as those proteins that aggregate to a similar extent regardless of stress (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p&gt;0.05, identified in &gt;1 repeats of both case and control), and that do so in both experiments performed for that cell line.
