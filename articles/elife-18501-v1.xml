Human cancer is enhanced by PPARγ loss-of-function mutations, but inhibited by PPARγ agonists such as TZD diabetes drugs including rosiglitazone. However, it remains enigmatic whether and how macrophage contributes to PPARγ tumor-suppressive functions. Here we report that macrophage PPARγ deletion in mice not only exacerbates mammary tumor development but also impairs the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone. Mechanistically, we identify Gpr132 as a novel direct PPARγ target in macrophage whose expression is enhanced by PPARγ loss but repressed by PPARγ activation. Functionally, macrophage Gpr132 is pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor. Genetic Gpr132 deletion not only retards inflammation and cancer growth but also abrogates the anti-tumor effects of PPARγ and rosiglitazone. Pharmacological Gpr132 inhibition significantly impedes mammary tumor malignancy. These findings uncover macrophage PPARγ and Gpr132 as critical TAM modulators, new cancer therapeutic targets, and essential mediators of TZD anti-cancer effects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18501.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18501.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18501.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system can both contribute to cancer progression and restrain the growth of tumors. Some immune cells – called macrophages – create an inflammatory environment around a tumor, which can support the spread of the cancer cells.</p><p>Independent observations and experiments have shown that a protein called PPARγ can suppress the development and growth of tumors. Drugs called thiazolidinediones (or TZDs for short), which are normally used to treat type 2 diabetes, activate PPARγ and therefore have anti-tumor effects. However, it is not fully understood how PPARγ and TZDs suppress tumor development.</p><p>Cheng et al. hypothesized that the PPARγ protein and TZDs can inhibit the activity of the inflammatory macrophages that help tumors to develop. To test this, mice were genetically engineered so that their macrophages could not produce the PPARγ protein. These engineered mice were more likely to develop breast cancer than normal. Furthermore, the breast tumors in the modified mice did not shrink when they were treated with TZDs, whereas the tumors of normal mice did.</p><p>Cheng et al. also found that PPARγ inhibits the ability of macrophages to produce a protein called Gpr132, which itself contributes to inflammation and allows breast cancer cells to grow. Mice that were unable to produce Grp132 displayed less inflammation, and cancer growth was blocked. Drugs that inhibited the activity of Grp132 in normal mice also reduced the ability of breast tumors to spread.</p><p>Future experiments will need to examine exactly how the Gpr132 proteins produced by macrophages communicate with the cancer cells. Furthermore, developing new drugs that can inhibit Gpr132 could ultimately lead to more effective treatments for cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18501.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18501.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>rosiglitazone</kwd><kwd>PPARgamma</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Gpr132</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP130145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-13-1-0318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK089113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000983</institution-id><institution>Mary Kay Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>073.14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6-FY13-137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P30CA142543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The PPARγ protein acts in macrophages to inhibit breast cancer progression and mediate the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone by suppressing Gpr132 – a pro-tumor and pro-inflammatory factor in macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How immune cells in the tumor microenvironment modulate cancer malignancy is a fundamental and fascinating question with tremendous therapeutic significance for cancer intervention. Emerging evidence supports a functional association between inflammation and cancer. Chronic inflammation is implicated in &gt;15% of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>) and shown to promote tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scholl et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shacter and Weitzman, 2002</xref>). As a key player in inflammation and cancer progression, TAM strongly correlates with poor cancer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bingle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noy and Pollard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qian and Pollard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffell et al., 2012</xref>). For example, overexpression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1 or M-CSF) leads to accelerated tumor progression in mice and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scholl et al., 1994</xref>). Moreover, TAM also modulates therapeutic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruffell and Coussens, 2015</xref>). Although numerous clinical studies and experimental mouse models support that macrophages generally play a pro-cancer role, anti-tumor property has also been reported for certain subtypes of macrophages, suggesting that macrophage regulation of cancer malignancy is pleotropic and context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krzeszinski and Wan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noy and Pollard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qian and Pollard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruffell and Coussens, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor and a transcription factor that regulates a myriad of physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lefterova et al., 2014</xref>). PPARγ loss-of-function mutations have been associated with human cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldred et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarraf et al., 1999</xref>). Synthetic PPARγ agonists, such as the TZD anti-diabetic drugs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been implicated to inhibit tumor malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apostoli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drzewoski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fenner and Elstner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fröhlich and Wahl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Skelhorne-Gross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uray et al., 2012</xref>). These evidences suggest that PPARγ exerts anti-tumor effects, although a lack of correlation or pro-tumor effects have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saez et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1998</xref>). Limited clinical trials to date are inconclusive on the effects of TZDs on human cancer outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mueller et al., 2000</xref>). Provocatively, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reveal that the incidence of cancer malignancies was significantly lower in rosiglitazone-treated patients than in control groups, although rosiglitazone did not significantly modify the risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monami et al., 2008</xref>). These findings not only support an anti-tumor role of TZDs but also suggest that TZDs may act to impede tumor progression rather than tumor initiation.</p><p>Importantly, epidemiological studies suggest a bidirectional association between diabetes and cancer: diabetes (especially type 2) correlates with higher risk of cancers including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Gale, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2010</xref>); conversely, 8–18% of newly diagnosed cancer patients are diabetic, and cancer patients with preexisting diabetes are 50% more likely to die after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richardson and Pollack, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand how anti-diabetic drugs influence cancer for a better treatment of both cancer and diabetes.</p><p>Previous studies largely focused on the direct effects of PPARγ on cancer cells. TZDs were shown to promote terminal differentiation, reduce proliferation and trigger lipid accumulation in human breast cancer cells and liposarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tontonoz et al., 1997</xref>). More recently, the anti-proliferative effect of pioglitazone was reported to involve a metabolic switch in lung and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether and how PPARγ in macrophages modulates cancer progression is unknown. Moreover, previous studies heavily relied on the usage of PPARγ ligands, which may exert PPARγ-independent and/or physiologically irrelevant effects; whereas in vivo genetic dissection of the specific PPARγ functions in each cell type in the cancer milieu is lacking.</p><p>We previously reported that female mice with PPARγ deletion in the hematopoietic and endothelial cells developed inflammation in their lactating mammary gland. This led to the production of inflammatory milk, which triggered systemic inflammation in the nursing neonates manifested as a transient fur loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wan et al., 2007b</xref>). These intriguing observations suggest that PPARγ plays an anti-inflammatory role in macrophage and mammary gland, which may influence breast cancer. We hypothesize that PPARγ in macrophages impedes breast cancer development by inhibiting inflammation. Using a series of genetic and pharmacological, gain- and loss-of-function, in vitro and in vivo approaches, here we uncover macrophage PPARγ as an important suppressor of breast cancer progression and a key mediator of the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone that functions by repressing a novel target Gpr132 in macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Macrophage PPARγ deletion enhances tumor growth in vivo</title><p>We generated macrophage PPARγ knockout mice (mf-g-KO) by breeding PPARγ flox mice with Tie2Cre or Lysozyme-Cre (LyzCre). Tie2Cre deleted PPARγ in hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2007b</xref>). LyzCre deleted PPARγ in the myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clausen et al., 1999</xref>). These two mf-g-KO models are complementary with different pros and cons: although Lyz-g-KO mice permit a more specific macrophage PPARγ deletion, Tie2-g-KO mice confer a more complete macrophage PPARγ deletion (89%) compared with Lyz-g-KO mice (79%). Thus, we compared <italic>Pparg<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cre<sup>tg/+</sup> </italic>KO mice with <italic>Pparg<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cre<sup>+/+</sup></italic>littermate controls using both models.</p><p>To determine the effects of macrophage PPARγ deletion on breast cancer progression, we performed mammary fat pad orthotopic injections of C57BL/6J-compatible mouse breast cancer cells EO771 in female mice, and followed tumor growth by measuring tumor size. Compared to the littermate controls, both Tie2Cre-induced and LyzCre-induced mf-g-KO mice showed enhanced tumor development as indicated by earlier onset and larger tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). These results indicate that the pro-tumor effect observed was largely caused by PPARγ deletion in myeloid cells such as macrophages. Staining for Ki67 and phospho histone H3 (PH3) in the tumor sections showed increased cell proliferation in mf-g-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). To assess a different cancer model, we obtained another C57BL/6-compatible mouse cell line (Py230) that was derived from spontaneous mammary tumors in C57BL/6 MMTV-PyMT female transgenic mice. Py230 cell injection into the mammary fat pad showed that tumor growth was also exacerbated in mf-g-KO mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

(<bold>Q</bold>) A simplified working model for how macrophage PPARγ inhibits inflammation and tumor growth by repressing the transcription of macrophage Gpr132, a novel pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor membrane receptor. Upon sensing and activation by tumor signals, macrophage Gpr132 may modulate macrophage intracellular signaling and downstream targets, which in turn promotes cancer cell proliferation (indicated by the dashed line). Macrophage PPARγ deficiency increases Gpr132 level to afford better tumor sensing by macrophages, thereby promoting tumor growth. Pharmacological Gpr132 inhibition via either PPARγ agonist or Gpr132 blockade attenuates breast cancer progression. Moreover, both macrophage PPARγ and Gpr132 are key mediators of the anti-tumor effects of the clinically used TZD drug rosiglitazone.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18501.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18501.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-18501-fig5-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18501.011</object-id><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Additional analysis of Gpr132.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of Gpr132 protein in spleen and bone marrow (BM) from WT and Gpr132-KO mice.

In this system, Gpr132 was deleted in macrophages as well as other Gpr132-expressing tissues such as bone marrow, spleen and thymus, but not in the injected cancer cells which had essentially no Gpr132 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Previous study show that Gpr132-KO mice display a normal pattern of T and B lineage differentiation, appearing healthy and indistinguishable from WT littermates throughout young adulthood, but develop progressive secondary lymphoid organ enlargement associated with abnormal expansion of both T and B lymphocytes that become pathological when older than one year of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, our experiments were initiated in young mice and terminated before Gpr132-KO mice aged to prevent any potential effects of lymphoid defects on cancer growth. Compared with WT and Gpr132 heterozygous (Het) controls, Gpr132-KO mice exhibited significantly diminished tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Compared with WT controls, Gpr132-Het mice also showed attenuated tumor growth at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>), indicating that Gpr132 regulation is dosage-sensitive. Together, our in vitro and in vivo results indicate that macrophage Gpr132 promotes tumor growth, suggesting that Gpr132 inhibition may impede cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Macrophage Gpr132 mediates PPARγ regulation and rosiglitazone effects</title><p>To further examine whether Gpr132 is a functional PPARγ target in macrophage that is required for PPARγ cancer regulation, we conducted pharmacological and genetic experiments. As a pharmacological gain-of-function strategy, we treated the macrophage-cancer cell co-cultures or tumor-grafted mice with rosiglitazone or vehicle control. Pre-treating Gpr132-KO macrophages with rosiglitazone before cancer cell seeding no longer showed any inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in the co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with this in vitro observation, the anti-tumor effect of rosiglitazone in vivo was also abolished in Gpr132-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). These pharmacological findings support that the PPARγ repression of Gpr132 in macrophages is a significant contributor to the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone.</p><p>As a genetic loss-of-function strategy, we bred Gpr132-KO mice with mf-g-KO mice to generate mf-g/Gpr132 double KO (DKO) mice.

Because macrophage precursors reside in hematopoietic tissues such as blood, bone marrow and spleen that can be efficiently targeted by siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson et al., 2007</xref>), we chose to employ siRNA-mediated Gpr132 knockdown. We treated WT female mice with si-Gpr132 or si-Ctrl for 18 days via intravenous injection at 10 μg/mouse twice/week, three days before and 15 days after cancer cell graft.

Here we have uncovered a crucial yet previously unrecognized role of macrophage PPARγ in suppressing cancer progression and mediating the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>). Mechanistically, PPARγ activation in macrophages tunes down inflammatory programs by repressing the transcription of a novel target gene Gpr132, which is a pro-inflammatory membrane receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>). Consequently, tumor growth is inhibited when the macrophage Gpr132 level is low by either Gpr132 deletion/inhibition or PPARγ activation via rosiglitazone; whereas tumor growth is exacerbated when the macrophage Gpr132 level is high as the result of macrophage PPARγ deficiency. Importantly, Gpr132 deletion abolishes the cancer regulation by macrophage PPARγ or rosiglitazone, indicating that Gpr132 is an essential mediator of PPARγ functions in macrophages and tumor progression. These findings reveal PPARγ and Gpr132 as fundamental key players in TAM, providing new mechanisms how macrophages interact with tumor cells to promote cancer malignancy.</p><p>Although our co-culture experiments suggest that tumor cell-macrophage contact is required for macrophage PPARγ regulations, other possible mechanisms may exist. For example, (1) tumor cell-macrophage close proximity (rather than direct contact) may be required so that an increased macrophage Gpr132 expression can better sense a gradient of the signal sent from tumor cells - this is supported by previous studies indicating Gpr132 as a pH and lipid sensor that may regulate immune cell trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Justus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vangaveti et al., 2010</xref>); (2) upon activation by tumor signals, macrophage Gpr132 may modulate macrophage intracellular signaling and downstream targets, which in turn promotes cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>). Our findings have opened an exciting new path for future investigations to delineate how macrophage Gpr132 senses tumor signals and then exacerbates tumor malignancy.</p><p>Both inflammatory macrophages (M1-like) and M2-like macrophages have been shown to be potentially pro-tumor. Recent literature strongly support that inflammation exacerbates tumor progression, as highlighted in several reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noy and Pollard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qian and Pollard, 2010</xref>). Thus, in terms of how macrophage PPARγ impacts tumor progression, only the phenotype speaks of the truth. Our in vivo and in vitro findings all support an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor role of macrophage PPARγ activation, and a pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor effect of macrophage PPARγ deletion. Among the many downstream events that mediate the pro-tumor effects of inflammatory macrophages, it is possible that macrophage PPARγ not only regulates cancer cell behavior but also modulates tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to alter immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engblom et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>PPARγ may act on several cell types to exert anti-tumor effects including previously described cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tontonoz et al., 1997</xref>) and now reported immune cells. Our findings reveal macrophage as a key cell type, if not the only cell type, that is essential for the tumor suppressive effects of TZDs. Interestingly, although Tie2-g-KO mice harbored more complete PPARγ deletion than Lyz-g-KO mice and both mouse models showed enhanced tumor growth and tumor macrophage recruitment, the phenotype was more pronounced in Lyz-g-KO. It is possible that the PPARγ deletion in other hematopoietic cells outside of the myeloid lineage exerted opposite albeit minor effect on tumor growth in the Tie2-g-KO mice, which was absent in the Lyz-g-KO mice.</p><p>Similarly, PPARγ may affect many genes in macrophage, and targets other than Gpr132 may also contribute to the anti-tumor effects of PPARγ. Nonetheless, our genetic rescue and pharmacological experiments indicate that Gpr132 is a very important part of the puzzle and an essential mediator of macrophage PPARγ regulation, because in the absence of Gpr132, the tumor-modulating function of macrophage PPARγ or rosiglitazone is abolished. This uncovers Gpr132 as not only a novel key PPARγ target but also a new cancer therapeutic target.</p><p>Our luciferase reporter assays indicate that PPARγ directly suppresses the transcriptional activity from Gpr132 promoter, which is further supported by ChIP assays showing PPARγ binding to Gpr132 promoter, leading to a decreased level of H3K9Ac active transcription histone mark at the Gpr132 transcriptional start site. Nonetheless, additional mechanisms such as changes in mRNA stability may also contribute to PPARγ down-regulation of Gpr132 mRNA level.</p><p>Cancer cells form an intimate relationship with TAMs to proliferate and survive. As such, targeting the infiltrating macrophages to alter their number and properties can lead to a significant inhibition of cancer malignancy. Our data suggest that this can be achieved by either PPARγ activation or Gpr132 inhibition in the macrophage. By elucidating the mechanisms that macrophages use to promote cancer and inflammation, effective diagnostic tools as well as innovative anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory therapeutics can be designed. For example, macrophage levels of PPARγ and Gpr132 may predict not only tumor aggressiveness but also the pharmacological responses to rosiglitazone or Gpr132 inhibitors. Our findings may explain why rosiglitazone exerts anti-tumor effects in certain cancers but not others – cancers with abundant PPARγ-positive macrophages may be sensitive whereas cancers with limited macrophages or PPARγ-negative macrophages may be resistant.</p><p>Remarkably, the positive association of Gpr132 with inflammation and breast cancer in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>), the repression of Gpr132 expression by rosiglitazone in human macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the anti-tumor effects of pharmacological Gpr132 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O–P</xref>) highlight the exciting potential of Gpr132 blockade as a new therapeutic. Moreover, the observation that Gpr132 expression is significantly increased in the majority of human breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) suggests that Gpr132 may serve as a useful marker for breast cancer prognosis, similar to the 21 genes typically examined in the commercially available Oncotype Dx panel.</p><p>In summary, the significance of our findings resides in the following aspects: (1) it reveals macrophage as an important cell type that contributes to PPARγ suppression of cancer and the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone; (2) it identifies Gpr132 as a novel PPARγ direct target gene in macrophages that mediates PPARγ functions; (3) it uncovers Gpr132 as a pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor factor in macrophages, and thus a novel therapeutic target. Ultimately, these new knowledge will enhance our understanding of macrophage regulation, cancer microenvironment as well as PPARγ and Gpr132 biology, which may translate to a better intervention of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and inflammatory disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>PPARγ flox mice on a C57BL/6J background (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004584">IMSR_JAX:004584</ext-link>) were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2003</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present the interesting observation that PPARg-dependent expression of Gpr132 in macrophages attenuates breast cancer growth using a co-culture system and in vivo experiments with hematopoietic cell-specific PPARg-deficient mice and Gpr132-deficient mice. Translational information was provided by data showing upregulation of Gpr132 and a positive correlation between Gpr132 and inflammatory markers in human breast cancer tissues.</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that the work was potentially of interest to the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. All of the reviewers appreciated the large amount of work presented. At the same time, the review process identified several opportunities to strengthen the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not discuss previously published work from the Kittler laboratory which demonstrated that the anti-proliferative activity of pioglitazone manifests its antiproliferative activity in cancer cells (lung and breast) by reprogramming cell metabolism (Cell Metab 20, 650-661). It seems plausible that the effects observed could be explained by a shift in oxidative to glycolytic metabolism upon PPARγ knockdown. Also, recruitment of M1-polarized macrophages to the tumors in mice is likely to increase the number of TILs. This introduces the possibility that the effects may relate to decreased immune surveillance. This possibility is also not considered. The reviewers feel that it is essential that the authors provide a more balanced discussion of their results in the context of previously published work in this area.</p><p>2) Please specify which Cre driver was used for each experiment. Tie2-Cre expresses in endothelial cells, and therefore the possibility that PPARg in endothelial cells is contributing to tumor growth needs to be considered with this model. Have the authors done the tumor growth experiment in LysM-PPARg-/- Gpr132-/- mice?</p><p>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> are compelling. However, the confirmatory data, in Py230 cells, is only presented as endpoint studies (presumably; not clearly explained). Tumor growth data over time together with the luciferase data would better support that the effect was confirmatory of that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p>4) Similarly, full growth curve data for the tumor study should be presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>. Further, the key in vitro experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) would be bolstered by the inclusion of data showing that PPARγ target genes are induced.</p><p>5) Do E0771 and Py230 cells express PPARγ? How did the authors rule out direct effects of rosi on the cancer cells? Related to this point, for the in vitro studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> why do the investigators switch to a third cell line MDA231? Why were E0771 or Py230 cells not used? Was it merely to allow the study of mouse/human gene expression or did Rosi differentially effect these cells in vitro?</p><p>6) The in vivo effect of rosiglitazone on tumor progression should also be characterized in terms of macrophage infiltration in WT and mf-g-KO mice.</p><p>7) Tumor size differences were less pronounced in hematopoietic/endothelial PPARg-Tie2-cre than in PPARg-LysM-cre with EO771 tumor mammary cells. Is this due to differences in PPARg recombination in the two models? The authors should analyze the degree of PPARg deletion in purified tumor-cell infiltrating macrophages.</p><p>8) The authors show increased myeloid infiltration into tumors (based on immunofluorescence staining) in the setting of PPARg deficiency. Therefore, it is not surprising that inflammatory gene expression is enhanced since more leukocytes are present on site. Inflammatory gene expression should be analyzed within intra-tumor infiltrating macrophages (FACS sorted), therefore comparing the same number of cells obtained from WT and macrophage PPARg-deficient mice. FACS analysis of infiltrating populations should be more carefully analyzed.

All of the reviewers appreciated the large amount of work presented. At the same time, the review process identified several opportunities to strengthen the work.</italic> </p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors do not discuss previously published work from the Kittler laboratory which demonstrated that the anti-proliferative activity of pioglitazone manifests its antiproliferative activity in cancer cells (lung and breast) by reprogramming cell metabolism (Cell Metab 20, 650-661). It seems plausible that the effects observed could be explained by a shift in oxidative to glycolytic metabolism upon PPARγ knockdown. Also, recruitment of M1-polarized macrophages to the tumors in mice is likely to increase the number of TILs. This introduces the possibility that the effects may relate to decreased immune surveillance. This possibility is also not considered. The reviewers feel that it is essential that the authors provide a more balanced discussion of their results in the context of previously published work in this area.</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We have now provided more extended and balanced discussion of these aspects. We have cited the Kittler paper describing how pioglitazone inhibits lung and breast cancer cell proliferation via a metabolic switch (Introduction, fourth paragraph). We have now also discussed that the downstream events of how inflammatory macrophage accumulation promotes cancer cell growth may involve tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and consequently altered immune surveillance (Discussion, third paragraph). To clarify, our PPARγ conditional KO mice harbor PPARγ deletion in hematopoietic/myeloid lineages, but not cancer cells, thus the effects observed were unlikely due to cancer cell metabolic changes. Our findings reveal macrophage as a key cell type, if not the only cell type, that is essential for the anti-cancer effects of TZDs (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Please specify which Cre driver was used for each experiment. Tie2-Cre expresses in endothelial cells, and therefore the possibility that PPARg in endothelial cells is contributing to tumor growth needs to be considered with this model. Have the authors done the tumor growth experiment in LysM-PPARg-/- Gpr132-/- mice?</italic></p><p>We have now specified the Cre driver in the Methods (first paragraph) and figure legend. We agree that Tie2Cre is less specific to myeloid lineage than LyzCre, yet Tie2Cre has the advantage of a more complete PPARγ deletion than LyzCre, as now clarified in the first paragraph of the Results. Our preliminary data show that Lyz-g/Gpr132-DKO also exhibited decreased tumor growth compared with Lyz-g-KO and WT controls. Even though angiogenesis was also slightly increased in the Tie2-g-KO tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>), the findings that both Tie2-g-KO and Lyz-g-KO show similar phenotype support the notion that macrophage is the major responsible cell type.</p><p><italic>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> are compelling. However, the confirmatory data, in Py230 cells, is only presented as endpoint studies (presumably; not clearly explained). Tumor growth data over time together with the luciferase data would better support that the effect was confirmatory of that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have now presented the time course for both bioluminescence and tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Similarly, full growth curve data for the tumor study should be presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>. Further, the key</italic> in vitro <italic>experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) would be bolstered by the inclusion of data showing that PPARγ target genes are induced.</italic></p><p>We have now presented the time course data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>. We have also included a positive control showing that rosiglitazone induces a previously reported PPARγ target gene LXRα in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Do E0771 and Py230 cells express PPARγ? How did the authors rule out direct effects of rosi on the cancer cells? Related to this point, for the</italic> in vitro <italic>studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> why do the investigators switch to a third cell line MDA231? Why were E0771 or Py230 cells not used? Was it merely to allow the study of mouse/human gene expression or did Rosi differentially effect these cells</italic> in vitro<italic>?</italic></p><p>PPARγ is expressed in all these breast cancer cell lines; however, rosi treatment was only performed on macrophages before cancer cell co-culture – the rosi-containing medium was removed and macrophages were washed before cancer cell seeding – thus there is no direct effect of rosi on cancer cells in our in vitro system. In our in vivo system, rosi may also exert direct effect on cancer cells, but our results showed this effect was not sufficient when PPARγ was deleted in macrophages, further supporting the essential role, if not the only role, of macrophage PPARγ in the TZD anti-tumor function. As explained in the first paragraph of the subsection “PPARγ-deficient macrophages promote cancer cell proliferation in vitro”, for our in vitro macrophage-cancer cell co-culture studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2,</xref> we chose to use human luciferase-labelled MDA231 subline for two reasons: 1) the luciferase label in this breast cancer cell line distinguishes cancer cells from macrophages, thus permitting the specific quantification of cancer cell proliferation; 2) gene expression in cancer cells and macrophages can be distinguished by RT-QPCR using human-specific primers (for cancer cells) and mouse-specific primers (for macrophages).</p><p><italic>6) The</italic> in vivo <italic>effect of rosiglitazone on tumor progression should also be characterized in terms of macrophage infiltration in WT and mf-g-KO mice.</italic></p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now included this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Tumor size differences were less pronounced in hematopoietic/endothelial PPARg-Tie2-cre than in PPARg-LysM-cre with EO771 tumor mammary cells. Is this due to differences in PPARg recombination in the two models? The authors should analyze the degree of PPARg deletion in purified tumor-cell infiltrating macrophages.</italic></p><p>We have now clarified that macrophage PPARγ deletion was more complete in Tie2-g-KO compared with Lyz-g-KO (Results, first paragraph). Although both mf-g-KO mouse models showed enhanced tumor phenotype, as the reviewer pointed out, the phenotype was more pronounced in Lyz-g-KO. It is possible that PPARγ deletion in other hematopoietic cells outside of the myeloid lineage exerted opposite albeit minor effect on tumor growth in the Tie2-g-KO mice, which was absent in the Lyz-g-KO mice. We have now added this to Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) The authors show increased myeloid infiltration into tumors (based on immunofluorescence staining) in the setting of PPARg deficiency. Therefore, it is not surprising that inflammatory gene expression is enhanced since more leukocytes are present on site. Inflammatory gene expression should be analyzed within intra-tumor infiltrating macrophages (FACS sorted), therefore comparing the same number of cells obtained from WT and macrophage PPARg-deficient mice. FACS analysis of infiltrating populations should be more carefully analyzed. Such data is critical to support the conclusion that PPARg deletion changes the functional properties of tumor infiltrating macrophages.</italic></p><p>We concur with the reviewers that it is important to separate the effect of PPARγ deletion on macrophage abundance and macrophage properties. Although FACS sorting of tumor infiltrating macrophages has been used to examine macrophage gene expression, it is a common concern that this long procedure including 37°C collagenase digestion will alter gene expression. Instead, we tackled this question by employing a variety of systems to examine the intrinsic macrophage properties including bone marrow and spleen-derived macrophages, both in the absence and presence of breast cancer cell co-culture. All our results support a pro-inflammatory effect of PPARγ deletion and an anti-inflammatory function of rosiglitazone in macrophages.</p><p><italic>9) There is little prior evidence for PPARg acting as a direct repressor. Has an effect on mRNA stability been considered? Regarding the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, what is the effect of rosiglitazone on PPARg binding to the Gpr132 promoter? ChIP assay with H3K9Ac to compare wild-type macrophages to PPARg deficient macrophages would be informative.</italic></p><p>Our luciferase reporter assays indicate that PPARγ directly suppresses the transcriptional activity from Gpr132 promoter, which is further supported by ChIP assays showing PPARγ binding to Gpr132 promoter, leading to a decreased level of H3K9Ac active transcription histone mark at the Gpr132 transcriptional start site. Yet, additional mechanisms such as changes in mRNA stability may also contribute to the regulation. We have now discussed this point (Discussion, sixth paragraph). For our ChIP assays, we have clarified that rosiglitazone did not significantly alter PPARγ binding to Gpr132 promoter (subsection “PPARγ binds to Gpr132 promoter and represses its transcriptional activity”), and provided additional data showing that PPARγ-deficient macrophages displayed elevated H3K9Ac histone mark and resistance to rosi effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and in the aforementioned subsection).</p></body></sub-article></article>
