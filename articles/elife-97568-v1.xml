To achieve this, we show that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>PA</italic>)<italic>,</italic> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2’-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in murine macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from decreased pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<italic>Mpc1</italic>), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (Esrra). Consequently, Esrra exhibits weakened binding to the <italic>Mpc1</italic> promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between Esrra and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and, consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized murine and human macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <italic>Mpc1</italic> and <italic>Esrra and</italic> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the in vitro findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <italic>PA</italic> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <italic>PA</italic> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedented mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis in its influence on Mpc1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <italic>PA</italic> clearance. These paradigmatic findings pave the way for developing treatments to bolster host resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>2'-aminoacetophenone</kwd><kwd>quorum sensing</kwd><kwd>MvfR</kwd><kwd>tolerance to infection</kwd><kwd>Esrra</kwd><kwd>PqsR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Pseudomonas</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI134857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Arijit</given-names></name><name><surname>Bandyopadhaya</surname><given-names>Arunava</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Vijay K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovacic</surname><given-names>Filip</given-names></name><name><surname>Cha</surname><given-names>Sujin</given-names></name><name><surname>Oldham</surname><given-names>William M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tzika</surname><given-names>A Aria</given-names></name><name><surname>Rahme</surname><given-names>Laurence G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>83009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Arijit</given-names></name><name><surname>Rahme</surname><given-names>Laurence G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>85132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Vijay K</given-names></name><name><surname>Tzika</surname><given-names>A Aria</given-names></name><name><surname>Rahme</surname><given-names>Laurence G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> secreted signaling molecule 2'-aminoacetophenone modulates cellular immunometabolism to promote persistence in infected tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host tolerance is a fundamental mechanism of innate immunity. Studies have shown that innate immune cells following infection or exposure to microbial products may enter a state of immune tolerance characterized by reduced responsiveness toward microbial re-exposure a few hours later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masyutina et al., 2023</xref>). Epigenetic and signaling-based mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in host immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masyutina et al., 2023</xref>).

It was suggested that specific metabolic programs are activated in monocytes and macrophages upon exposure to infection and microbial products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galli and Saleh, 2020</xref>). However, in host tolerance, the molecular mechanisms underlying immunometabolic reprogramming mediated by bacterial pathogens remain poorly understood.</p><p>Metabolic pathways are essential for generating energy for various cellular functions, including those performed by immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karan et al., 2022</xref>). Macrophages use metabolic pathways to generate energy and metabolites to adapt to changing environments and stimuli, thereby enabling them to cope with the needs of a fluctuating immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galli and Saleh, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bird, 2019</xref>). Thus, properly functioning metabolic pathways are vital for immune cells to counteract pathogens.

QS is a cell density-dependent signaling system bacteria used to synchronize their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Déziel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickhoff and Bassler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuqua and Greenberg, 2002</xref>). MvfR (a.k.a. PqsR), a critical QS transcription factor of <italic>PA,</italic> regulates the synthesis of many small molecules, including signaling molecules such as 2’-aminoacetophenone (2-AA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Déziel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Déziel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kesarwani et al., 2011</xref>). In vivo studies have demonstrated that 2-AA enables <italic>PA</italic> to persist in infected murine tissues by promoting innate immune tolerance through histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-mediated epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>). 2-AA tolerization reprograms the host inflammatory signaling cascade by maintaining chromatin in a ‘silent’ state through increased HDAC1 expression and activity and decreased histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>). These changes also impact the protein-protein interaction between HAT and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/HDAC1 and p50/p65 nuclear factor-κB subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2017</xref>).

Our group’s previous in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that 2-AA affects metabolic functions in skeletal muscle, which contains a high concentration of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tzika et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>).

Our findings uncovered the crucial action of 2-AA on energy homeostasis and metabolism in tolerized immune cells through perturbances of the Esrra/Ppargc1a interaction, Mpc1-mediated pyruvate transport, and the production of the key energy metabolism molecules, ATP, and acetyl-CoA and their association with the persistence of <italic>PA</italic> in mammalian tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tolerization by 2-AA impacts the generation of crucial energy metabolites in macrophages</title><p>Following infection or exposure to microbial products, innate immune cells may enter a state of tolerance several hours later, as depicted by their diminished responsiveness or unresponsiveness to microbial re-exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masyutina et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Divangahi et al., 2021</xref>).

We quantified the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA, which is a fuel for ATP production, in a series of in vitro experiments in which murine BMDM cells were exposed to 2-AA (first 2-AA exposure) or re-exposed (second 2-AA exposure) to respectively determine their activation, and tolerance as well as memory to this QS molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 hr (black bar) appeared to have entered a state of tolerance as ATP and acetyl-CoA levels were decreased compared to 2-AA exposures for a shorter time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The tolerance of these cells as well as their memory to 2-AA was determined by their responsiveness to a second 2-AA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To achieve this, these cells were washed to remove 2-AA and allowed to rest for 24 or 106 hr in the absence of 2-AA before receiving the second 2-AA exposure for 1 or 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> (red bars) shows the unresponsiveness of BMDM cells to 2-AA re-exposure as evidenced by the similar levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA compared to cells exposed to 2-AA for 48 hr (first exposure black bars). The sustained unresponsiveness of the cells to re-exposure indicates that the cells exhibited innate immunological memory, which could not be reverted by 2-AA re-exposure. Similar responsiveness patterns of ATP and acetyl-CoA as with BMDM cells were observed in murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or human monocyte THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) following exposure or re-exposure to 2-AA. These findings further support our observations with BMDM cells and confirm that either cell type can be used to study responses to 2-AA. These results reinforce the notion that 2-AA impacts crucial energy metabolites in macrophages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>2’-Aminoacetophenone (2-AA) tolerization decreases crucial metabolites of cellular energy and affects mitochondrial respiration in mouse BMDM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation showing experimental design: naïve cells were exposed to 2-AA for 1, 6, or 48 hr (black).

The Ppargc1a/Esrra axis has not previously been implicated in tolerization but has been extensively studied in cancer, underscoring the novelty of our findings. Studies in cancer cells have shown that the physical interaction of human Esrra with Ppargc1a strongly enhances the binding of Esrra to DNA to induce the activation of the targeted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schreiber et al., 2003</xref>), including <italic>Mpc1,</italic> responsible for the import of cytosolic pyruvate into mitochondria and PDH, that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. Inhibition of Esrra has also been shown in cancer cell metabolism studies to interfere with pyruvate entry in mitochondria by inhibiting the expression of <italic>Mpc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2019</xref>), and inhibition of Esrra led to decreased expression of Ppargc1a-controlled expression of mitochondrial genes in mice brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bronte and Pittet, 2013</xref>). Indeed, we find that the transcription of <italic>Esrra, Ppargc1a,</italic> and <italic>Mpc1</italic> genes and pyruvate uptake into mitochondria is reduced in tolerized macrophages. Given that pyruvate is a primary carbon source in the TCA cycle that fuels OXPHOS and the production of ATP into mitochondria, it explains the reduced ATP and acetyl-CoA levels observed in tolerized macrophages. Future studies will focus on unveiling the pathways by which macrophages respond to the bioenergetic changes identified and decipher their effect on the pyruvate cycle in host tolerance to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caslin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We show that the unprecedented action of a QS bacterial small signaling molecule on the interaction between Esrra and Ppargc1a in the nucleus is hampered. Although it remains to be elucidated whether 2-AA interferes directly or indirectly with the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis, our data bring up the possibility that the reduced production of acetyl-CoA may be responsible since cholesterol is a known coactivator/ligand of Esrra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), which is generated from acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). This possibility may also explain the reduced expression of <italic>Esrra</italic> and lower abundance since cholesterol is also required for its activation and autoregulation. However, it is also possible that 2-AA may antagonize the interaction between Esrra and Ppargc1a by binding to <italic>Esrra</italic>. Small molecules as antagonists of Esrra have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chisamore et al., 2008</xref>). The weaker binding of Esrra to the <italic>Mpc1</italic> promoter site, and consequently reduced <italic>Mpc1</italic> expression, explains the reduced pyruvate presence in mitochondria and that of ATP and mitochondrial quiescence. These findings open avenues for exploring novel therapeutic strategies through the overexpression of <italic>Esrra</italic> to counteract the tolerization induced by 2-AA and enhance clearance of <italic>PA</italic> infection. Interestingly, <italic>Esrra</italic> overexpression on breast cancer metastases promotes an efficient antitumor immune response selectively in the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The observed cellular metabolic perturbances also align with our previous studies in skeletal muscle, which pointed to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by 2-AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tzika et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016a</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>PA</italic> QS LasR-regulated homoserine lactone molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL, was reported to attenuate the expression of <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> and decrease the mitochondrial respiratory capacity in lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maurice et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, another <italic>PA</italic> QS molecule, PQS, also regulated by LasR, was recently shown to induce organelle stress, including mitochondria, by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kushwaha et al., 2023</xref>). As opposed to 2-AA, which dampens the pro-inflammatory response, PQS increases pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kushwaha et al., 2023</xref>), consistent with the fact that PQS is an acute infection type molecule unrelated to chronic/persistent infections.</p><p>Previously, we reported that 2-AA tolerization induces histone deacetylation via HDAC1, reducing H3K18ac at the TNF-α promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>). The findings with acetyl-CoA reduction, the primary substrate of histone acetylation, and the TNF-α transcription using UK5099 and ATP in 2-AA-treated macrophages are in support of the bioenergetics disturbances observed in macrophages and their link to epigenetic modifications we have shown to be promoted by 2-AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>). Macrophages exposed to 2-AA in the presence of exogenous ATP showed improved intracellular bacterial clearance and enhanced TNF-α levels, supporting the epigenetic interconnection of macrophages and cellular ATP responsiveness levels against infection. The exogenous addition of UK5099 that reverted the efficiency of the <italic>mvfR</italic> infected macrophages to clear the <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden and the counteraction to the 2-AA effect by ATP addition that increases the clearance of <italic>PA</italic> intracellular burden support the importance of this energy-carrying molecule in <italic>PA</italic> persistence.</p><p>The results with the Mpc1 inhibitor, UK5099, suggest that the availability of pyruvate could underlie the mechanism of 2-AA-regulated HDAC/HAT-dependent control of transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators and bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). These results align with our previous findings, showing that establishing bacterial intracellular burden in macrophages is HDAC1 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to be elucidated if HDAC/HAT-mediated histone modification directly regulates the expression of OXPHOS genes in 2-AA-tolerized macrophages, as it was shown that histone deacetylation downregulates OXPHOS in persistent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi and Tu, 2015</xref>). Given the complexity of 2-AA-mediated long-term effects, future omics studies combined with immune profiling may aid in deciphering the possible network of co-factors across different subpopulations of immune cells and the immunometabolic reprogramming related to 2-AA.</p><p>We have shown that although 2-AA tolerization leads to a remarkable increase in the survival rate of infected mice, it permits an HDAC1-dependent sustained presence of <italic>PA</italic> in mice tissues and intracellularly in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we use 2-AA-producing and isogenic non-producing <italic>PA</italic> strains to confirm the 2-AA-mediated decrease in the central metabolite acetyl-CoA and the energy-carrying molecule ATP during infection. These murine infection studies provide strong evidence of the 2-AA biological relevance in reducing these metabolites in vivo.

LPS tolerization predominantly involves changes in H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lauterbach et al., 2019</xref>), while 2-AA tolerization involves H3K18 modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2017</xref>). The 2-AA-mediated effects reported here are also distinct from the epigenetic-metabolic reprogramming mediated by LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>), which promotes endotoxin tolerance in immune cells by upregulating glycolysis and suppressing OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Although 2-AA and LPS implicate different components and lead to different outcomes, both involve epigenetic mechanisms and immune memory.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming upon infection may be pathogen-specific, with each pathogen impacting specific metabolic pathways that better fit its respective metabolic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galli and Saleh, 2020</xref>).

It would be interesting, however, to test whether 2-AA affects the killing efficacy of macrophages against other pathogens, as emerging evidence shows that synergistic or antagonistic interactions between clinically relevant microorganisms and host have important implications for polymicrobial infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dhamgaye et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While in this study, we focused on the role of Esrra mainly in pyruvate metabolism; future studies are needed to reveal other Esrra/Ppargc1a axis-dependent metabolic and immune pathways are modulated by 2-AA. To this end, possible pathways to be interrgogated may be, the cholesterol synthesis pathway that relies on acetyl-CoA precursor, as cholesterol is a known coactivator/ligand of Esrra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), fatty acid catabolism, which generates acetyl-CoA, and fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vega et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>This study unveils the unprecedented actions of a QS bacterial molecule in orchestrating cellular metabolic reprogramming in addition to the epigenetic reprogramming reported previously and has also been shown to promote a long-lasting presence of <italic>PA</italic> in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>). That 2-AA cross-tolerized macrophages to LPS corroborates our previous findings on the implication of epigenetic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhaya et al., 2016b</xref>) rather than ligand-receptor-mediated signaling-based mechanism and raises the possibility that this QS molecule may confer non-specific cross-protection. This is an aspect we plan to investigate in the future. The reported immunometabolic reprogramming contributes to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms, biomarkers, and functional significance that may be involved in immune tolerance to persistent infection, providing for designing and developing innovative therapeutics and interventions. These approaches can focus on promoting host resilience against bacterial burden and safeguarding patients from recalcitrant persistent infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines: source, authentication methods, and media used</title><p>RAW 264.7 and THP1 cells were obtained from ATCC.

The mechanism details the role of pyruvate transporter expression via ERRalpha-PGC1 axis, resulting in pro-inflammatory TNF alpha signalling responsible for acquired infection tolerance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection.

While the data presented is intriguing and the paper is well-written, there are several points that warrant consideration. The authors should enhance the clarity, relevance, and impact of their study.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper presents a novel discovery regarding the mechanisms through which PA regulates the bioenergetics of tolerized macrophages.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The relevance of the in vivo model to support the conclusions is questionable.

Our conclusion that 2-AA decreases bioenergetics while sustains bacterial burden is further supported by additional in vivo data we present now in Fig. S5. To strengthen the relevance of our in vivo data, we performed additional in vivo experiments. In this set of in vivo studies, mice received the first exposure to 2-AA by injecting 2-AA only and the 2nd exposure through infection with PA14 or ΔmvfR four days post-2-AA injection. As shown in the supplementary Figure S5 the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA in the spleen of infected animals and the enumeration of the bacterial counts were the similar between PA14 or ΔmvfR receiving the 1st 2-AA exposure and agree with the “one-shot infection” findings presented in Figure 5 with the PA14 or ΔmvfR+2-AA infected mice or those receiving 2-AA only. These results are consistent with our previous findings showing that 2-AA impedes the clearance of PA14 (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2012; Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016; Tzika et al. 2013) and provide compelling evidence that the metabolic alterations identified may favor PA persistence in infected tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the time and effort in reviewing our revised manuscript and are grateful for their constructive comments and for acknowledging the significance of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The study tries to connect energy metabolism with immune tolerance during bacterial infection. The mechanism details the role of pyruvate transporter expression via ERRalpha-PGC1 axis, resulting in pro-inflammatory TNF alpha signalling responsible for acquired infection tolerance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection. The mechanism-based approach in dissecting the roles of metabolic coactivator, transcription factor, mitochondrial transporter, and pro-inflammatory cytokine during acquired tolerance towards infections indicates a detailed and well-written study. The in vivo studies in mice nicely corroborate with the cell line-based data, indicating the requirement for further studies in human infections with another bacterial model system.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have involved various mechanisms to justify their findings. However, they have missed out on certain aspects which connect the mechanism throughout the paper. For example, they measured ATP and acetyl COA production linked with bacterial re-exposures and added various targets like MCP1, EER alpha, PGC1 alpha, and TNF alpha. However, they skipped PGC1 alpha levels, ATP and acetyl COA in various parts of the paper. Including the details would make the work more comprehensive.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and apologize for omitting the PGC-1α levels. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the PGC-1α transcript levels (Figure 4C) in the section describing 2-AA-mediated dysregulation of the ERRα and MPC1 transcription (lines 243-252). Moreover, we have added Figure S5, which shows additional ATP and acetyl CoA levels in vivo. In our view, ATP and acetyl-CoA levels are shown in all appropriate settings, interrogating the bioenergetics, including in the presence of bacteria and in their absence, where only 2-AA is added. Please see Figures 1 and 5 and the newly added Figure S5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of public data sets to support their claim on immune tolerance is missing. Including various data sets of similar studies will strengthen the findings independently.</p></disp-quote><p>Suppose we understand correctly the reviewer’s comment regarding public data sets on immune tolerance. In that case, we are referring to our data since there are no published data from other groups on 2-AA tolerization and because the outcome of the 2-AA effect on the bacterial burden differs from that of LPS. Therefore, this study did not consider comparing with published data from LPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Animal model: The authors appropriately initiated the study with an in vitro tolerization model involving 2-AA re-exposure, providing foundational insights for further investigation. However, the rationale for the one-shot injection in the in vivo model lacks clarity. To strengthen the relevance of the in vivo data, the authors should consider establishing a model involving bacterial re-exposure, such as a two-challenge paradigm with antibiotic treatment in between. This approach would allow for the examination of peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice, assessing ATP levels, acetyl CoA, TNF production, and bacterial counts. Such an approach would better align the in vivo findings with the in vitro experiments, confirming the role of tolerized macrophages in controlling PA infection in the presence of 2-AA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, we have performed a similar two-challenge paradigm study in which first exposure to 2-AA is achieved by injecting 2-AA, and 2nd exposure through infection with PA14 or ΔmvfR four days post -2-AA injection. The results of Figure S5 can be directly compared with those in Fig 5 in vivo studies. As shown in supplementary Figure S5 the levels of ATP and acetyl-CoA in the spleen of infected animals and the enumeration of the bacterial counts agree with the “one-shot infection” presented in Fig 5 (PA14 or ΔmvfR+2-AA). Figure S5 study although not included initially to simplify data presentation, it was performed in parallel with Fig 5 and thus they can be directly compared.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Exogenous ATP treatment: It is crucial to explore whether 2-AA re-exposure suppresses inflammasome activation and whether this suppression can be reversed by exogenous ATP treatment. Specifically, the authors should investigate whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inhibited in tolerized macrophages and whether such activation is necessary for host defense. Clarifying these points would provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying macrophage tolerization induced by 2-AA.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point. We agree, indeed, this is planned in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figures 4C and D: The authors should exercise care in describing these figures. For instance, line 263 states that &quot;UK5099 had no effect on the PA14 burden in macrophages,&quot; which requires correction for accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize and rephrase this sentence and other sentences referring to Fig 4D and 4E in this section. Please see the highlighted sentences in the results section referring to Fig 4. For example, “The addition of the UK5099 inhibitor strongly enhanced the bacterial intracellular burden in ΔmvfR infected macrophages compared to the non-inhibited ΔmvfR infected cells, reaching a similar burden to those infected with PA14 (Fig. 4D)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) ERRα expression: While the study intriguingly demonstrates a decrease in ERRα levels in tolerized macrophages following exposure to 2-AA, the discussion of this finding is lacking. It is worth exploring the possibility of increasing ERRα expression to counteract the tolerization induced by 2-AA and enhance clearance of PA infection. This avenue should be thoroughly discussed in the manuscript's Discussion section, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of 2-AA on macrophage function.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for this additional comment. We have now included this point in the discussion section (lines 373-376).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the study is an excellent addition to the role of energy metabolism during bacterial infection. The mechanism-based approach in dissecting the roles of metabolic coactivator, transcription factor, mitochondrial transporter, and pro-inflammatory cytokine during acquired tolerance indicates a detailed and well-written study. However, connecting the mechanisms often was not reflected in some of the experiments, and answering a few concerns/suggestions will undoubtedly improve the study's readability, appeal, and overall impact on a broader audience.</p><p>(1) The authors should rephrase the title if possible. The title indicates 2AA as a bacterial quorum sensing signal; however, throughout the manuscript, there are no studies associated with actual quorum sensing in bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. However, the title indicates 2-AA as a quorum sensing molecule because the synthesis of this signaling molecule is uniquely regulated by quorum sensing. Because of its importance in the virulence of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and its regulation by quorum sensing, we feel that it is appropriate to refer to it as such.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors generalised immunotolerance and memory of 2AA-exposed cells to broad-spectrum microbial exposure by just testing with LPS exposure. I would suggest they test at least 2 more heterologous microbial products known to illicit response and confirm their claim from Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We intend not to generalize immunotolerance and memory of 2-AA exposed cells to broad-spectrum microbial exposure. Moreover, since the manuscript is not focused on comparing other bacterial molecules to 2-AA and multiple studies have focused on LPS tolerance, we tested LPS only in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) LPS triggers ATP production through glycolysis in nitric oxide (NO) dependent mechanisms in various immune and non-immune cells. The authors should study the concentrations of NO, Glucose, and Pyruvate levels to clarify the mechanism of energy dynamics and the source of ATP and Acetyl CoA generated/scavenged during primary and secondary exposures to both 2AA and LPS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a cross-tolerization experiment using 2-AA and LPS would reveal interesting insights into immune response during PA infections. However, this is out of the scope of this article. Please notice that the mechanism of 2-AA and LPS tolerization is mechanistically distinct, e.g. they rely on different HDAC enzymes, and LPS tolerization predominantly involves changes in H3K27 acetylation (Lauterbach et al. 2019). In contrast, 2-AA tolerization involves H3K18 modifications (Bandyopadhaya, Tsurumi, and Rahme 2017). For this reason, the complexity of such interactions would require a comprehensive set of experiments that are not part of the focus of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Immunogenic triggers often rapidly alter mitochondrial membrane potential, which alters oxygen consumption rates. However, the authors tend to generalize energy homeostasis and claim the deregulation of OXPHOS-inducing quiescent phenotype depending upon OCR measurements from Figure 1D. The authors must evaluate mitochondrial health and membrane potential during first and second exposure in a time-dependent manner to strengthen their theory of mitochondrial dysfunction. The authors should also check the phenomena in vivo (mice exposed to infection) if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We now include electron microscopy images of mitochondria isolated from macrophages exposed to 2-AA. Results revealed that 2-AA alters mitochondrial morphology and cristae, supporting the mitochondrial dysfunctionality caused by 2-AA. These results are shown in Figure S4 and lines 185-188.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Since both MCP1 and MCP2 transporters are known to transport pyruvate to mitochondria, checking both MCP1 and 2 at transcript and protein levels in exposed cells will be essential. I suggest authors use MCP inhibitors or use RNA interference against MCPs to check the effect on tolerance of the cells exposed for a second time.</p></disp-quote><p>To our understanding, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier proteins, MPC1 and MPC2, form a hetero-oligomeric complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane to facilitate pyruvate import into mitochondria (McCommis and Finck 2015). We also used UK5099 an MPC carrier inhibitor for enumeration of bacterial load in macrophages in Figure 4 and observed a similar effect as 2-AA suggesting a similar mechanism of action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The pyruvate levels of mitochondria in Figure 2A are shallow, and the authors claim statistical significance within a 1.5-fold change. The authors should cross-check the number of mitochondria they are isolating while estimating pyruvate from only mitochondrial fractions. Another point is, correlating mitochondrial pyruvate with the burst of ATP during first exposure in comparison to second exposure, one can argue that the number of mitochondria is variable between the exposures leading to a change in pyruvate amount (mitochondria number increases to compensate for the first exposure and decreases quickly to maintain homeostasis and remains quiescent during a second exposure due to activation of compensatory immune mechanism towards primary exposure). How do authors address the issue?</p></disp-quote><p>Our electron microscopic studies indicate that although after 2-AA exposure, no reduction in mitochondrial numbers is observed in macrophages, alterations in mitochondrial morphology and cristae are observed. Please also see our answer to point # 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors claim that ERR alpha regulates MCP1 transcription via activation of ERRalpha-PGC1 alpha axis and tolerization in cells to second exposure is due to impairment of the axis (Figure 3). PGC1 alpha is known to be induced during various metabolic, physiological, and immune-challenge-related stress in a tissue-dependent manner. In this context, one should expect changes in transcript and protein levels of PGC1 alpha. The authors must study PGC1 alpha levels with time-dependent exposures. LPS was shown to induce oscillations in PGC1 alpha levels in a tissue-specific manner. In experiments, authors should verify if such oscillations persist during time-dependent exposure, emphasising mitochondrial uncoupling that might get dampened during re-exposures to microbial challenges.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion. We have now included PGC-1α (Figure 4C) transcript levels, which show the same profile as the transcript levels of ERRα and MPC1. Please note that PGC-1α is only one of several ERRα co-activators; therefore, the amount of ERRα protein is the most relevant assessment regarding the activation of the MPC1 transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors claim that ERRalpha induces MCP1 through ChIP data in Figure 3. However, the physical verifications at mRNA levels and mutational/inhibitor-based experiments are missing. The authors should study the alterations of MCP1 mRNA in relation to exposures and inhibitors of ERRalpha and PGC1 alpha to strengthen their work.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting approach; however, this experiment exceeds the scope of our manuscript. We will certainly consider this suggestion in our future experiments. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Publicly available data sets with LPS exposures should be analyzed for gene sets pertaining to mitochondrial OXPHOS, metabolism, immune response, etc. This will support the authors' work and provide a global overview of transcriptome associated with immune tolerance.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. For the reasons explained in #3 point and because the bacterial burden outcome of the 2-AA effect is different from that of LPS, comparison with LPS published data was not considered in this study. We agree that in the future, a comprehensive comparison of whole genome transcriptome studies between LPS and 2-AA may reveal important insights that may also help better understand and potentially classify the immune tolerance triggered by 2-AA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In Figure 4, the authors study the role of MCP1 and associated pyruvate-dependent bacterial clearance during tolerization and associate them with a decrease in TNF alpha. I would suggest the addition of an ERR alpha inhibitor in these experiments. It is not clear as to why (mechanism) TNF alpha transcription was affected via pyruvate transport during bacterial exposure. I would suggest that the authors clarify the mechanism of TNF alpha activation/inactivation and its association with energy metabolism during acquired tolerance.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, given that a similar effect of ERRα on TNF-α was observed by other researchers (Chaltel-Lima et al. 2023). Here, to clarify the mechanism of TNF alpha activation/inactivation and its association with energy metabolism, we elaborate on this aspect in the discussion section.</p><p>Lines 388-393. The text reads:</p><p>Previously, we reported that 2-AA tolerization induces histone deacetylation via HDAC1, reducing H3K18ac at the TNF-α promoter (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016). The findings with acetyl-CoA reduction, the primary substrate of histone acetylation, and the TNF-α transcription using UK5099 and ATP in 2-AA treated macrophages are in support of the bioenergetics disturbances observed in macrophages and their link to epigenetic modifications we have shown to be promoted by 2-AA (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) It is surprising that authors specifically target TNF alpha as a pro-inflammatory cytokine during tolerance. Various reports of cytokines and immune modulatory factors play a vital role in immune tolerance upon bacterial exposure. I would suggest authors perform cytokine profiling or check public data sets to specify their reason for choosing TNF alpha.</p></disp-quote><p>The choice of TNF-α is based on the results obtained in our previous study (Bandyopadhaya et al. 2016).</p><p>Bandyopadhaya, A., M.
