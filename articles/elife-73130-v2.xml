<italic>Phox2b</italic> cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The syndrome is characterized by hypoventilation and inability to regulate breathing to maintain adequate O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The mechanism by which CCHS impact respiratory control is incompletely understood, and even less is known about the impact of the non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARM) form. Our goal was to investigate the extent by which NPARM <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutation affect (a) respiratory rhythm; (b) ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (HCVR) and hypoxia (HVR); and (c) number of chemosensitive neurons in mice. We used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation (same found in humans with NPARM CCHS). We crossed them with <italic>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></italic> mice to introduce mutation in regions involved with respiratory function and central chemoreflex control. Ventilation was measured by plethysmograph during neonatal and adult life. In room air, mutation in neonates and adult did not greatly impact basal ventilation. However, <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic>, <italic>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></italic> increased breath irregularity in adults. The HVR and HCVR were impaired in neonates. The HVR, but not HCVR, was still partially compromised in adults. The mutation reduced the number of Phox2b<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup>-expressing neurons as well as the number of fos-activated cells within the ventral parafacial region (also named retrotrapezoid nucleus [RTN] region) induced by hypercapnia. Our data indicates that <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells impaired RTN neurons, as well as chemoreflex under hypoxia and hypercapnia specially early in life. This study provided new evidence for mechanisms related to NPARM form of CCHS neuropathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypercapnia</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>ventilation</kwd><kwd>phox2b</kwd><kwd>retrotrapezoid nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009/01236-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takakura</surname><given-names>Ana C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015/23376-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreira</surname><given-names>Thiago S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1HL132355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otero</surname><given-names>José J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>302334/2019-0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreira</surname><given-names>Thiago S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>302288/2019-8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takakura</surname><given-names>Ana C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New evidence for the impaired breathing activity is related to non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations form of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome neuropathology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breathing is an essential physiological function soon after birth because it can rapidly regulate O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood for the rest of our life. Oxygen is mainly sensed by peripheral chemoreceptors, while CO<sub>2</sub> is regulated by central chemoreceptors, and to a lesser extent by peripheral chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nattie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guyenet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Hypoventilation and inability to increase breathing under low oxygen and high CO<sub>2</sub> levels are one of the most impacting symptoms in patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The paired like homeobox 2B (<italic>Phox2b</italic>) mutations are well known to be involved in the development of CCHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weese-Mayer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>). CCHS-related <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutations occur in two major categories: a trinucleotide, polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARM) and a non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARM), which includes missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patwari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramanantsoa and Gallego, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreira et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Phox2b</italic> NPARM deletions within exon 3 are correlated with severe CCHS phenotype with complete apnea, profound hypoventilation during sleep, and/or cause of post-neonatal infant mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weese-Mayer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which CCHS impact respiratory control is incompletely understood. Thus, investigating how <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutation in specific neuronal population could contribute to better understand the clinical respiratory outcomes in CCHS. In a rodent experimental model, <italic>Phox2b</italic> PARM mutation is specific to retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a well-known region involved with central chemoreflex control, impaired respiratory control, and ventilatory response to hypercapnia in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, hypoxic ventilatory responses are intact and potentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, genetic deletion of <italic>Phox2b</italic> from atonal homolog 1 (<italic>Atoh1</italic>)-expressing cells, that include not only RTN neurons (peri VII region) but also neurons located in the intertrigeminal region (peri V region), also abolished ventilatory response to hypercapnia in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>). The effect seems to be dependent on neuronal loss of ventral aspect of the parafacial region, also named RTN. Although peri V neurons might also be affected, resection of this region did not impact respiratory response to low pH levels in a brainstem preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that this region is not involved with central chemoreflex. However, the extent to which NPARM in regions that are involved with respiratory control and chemosensitivity remains an open question.</p><p>Recently, a human CCHS case postmortem proband was found and the mutation predictably causes a frameshift and a hypomorph protein (<italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Lascio et al., 2018</xref>). The present mutation was used to generate a conditional transgenic mouse line that can be activated by cre recombinase and introduce the humanized NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation during different developmental phases and regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nobuta et al., 2015</xref>). Expression of NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in the ventral visceral motor neuron domain (non-respiratory domain) induced apnea in newborns, loss of visceral motor neurons and <italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons in the RTN, and pre-Bötzinger complex dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alzate-Correa et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, in the present study, we proposed to investigate the effect of NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in regions that are directly involved with respiratory control and central chemoreflex. To achieve this we used <italic>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></italic> line as a promoter. <italic>Atoh1</italic> is expressed during development in proliferating cells in the rhombic lip and in postmitotic neurons. In this independent site, postmitotic neurons are the only region that co-express <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> surrounding the paramotor neurons that involves facial motor nucleus (thus peri VII, parafacial/RTN neurons) and trigeminal motor nucleus (peri V). We proposed to investigate the effect of NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in these regions on respiratory function, ventilatory chemoreflex to hypoxia and hypercapnia during neonatal and adulthood. In addition, we proposed to determine the effect of this mutation in the development of <italic>Phox2b</italic> chemosensitive neurons in the parafacial/RTN region. Our hypothesis is that NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in Atoh1-expressing cells impairs respiratory control, ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, and parafacial/RTN chemosensitive neurons.</p><p>We found that NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells suppressed breathing activity in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in neonates. Surprisingly, it did not mainly affect baseline ventilation. We also showed that adult mutant mice increased irregular breathing pattern and the ventilatory response to hypoxia was partially compromised. While ventilatory response to hypercapnia completely recovered. Additionally, anatomical data showed reduced <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)<sup>-</sup> immunoreactivity and fos<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup>-activated neurons by hypercapnia in the parafacial/RTN region. Together, our findings imply that NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells affects the development of the parafacial/RTN chemosensitive neurons, and consequently impaired breathing under hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions especially in neonates. These data provided new evidence for mechanisms related to CCHS neuropathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional respiratory changes observed in NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> in <italic>Atoh1<sup>cre</sup></italic>-expressing cells</title><p>In the first set of experiment, we investigated whether a conditional mutation of <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells affects ventilation during neonatal and adult phase.

We found that the mutation resulted in (a) impaired hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses in neonates; (b) the ventilatory response to hypoxia, but not to hypercapnia, was reduced in adults; (c) the number of irregular breathing pattern increased in adults; (d) <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression within parafacial/RTN region (<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup>) reduced ≈50%; (e) no significant change in the number of catecholaminergic cells (TH<sup>+</sup>) located in the ventrolateral medulla (C1 region) or in the dorsolateral pons (LC and subcoeruleus region); (f) the mutation also reduced the number of hypercapnic fos-activated neurons in the parafacial/RTN (fos<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup>) by 56%. These findings demonstrate for the first time that NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells (in the parafacial/RTN and intertrigeminal region) affects regulation of breathing and chemosensory respiratory control for both, hypercapnia and hypoxia, especially in neonates. Furthermore, it showed that despite an impaired RTN region, anatomically and functionally during adulthood, the system adapted and developed appropriate responses to hypercapnia, but not to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic view of the mouse hindbrain control of breathing and the role of transcriptions factors and neuromodulators.</title><p>The respiratory parafacial region (pF) contains neurons involved in breathing regulation. Within the ventral aspect of the pF, retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) could be defined as a cluster of neurons positive for <italic>Phox2b</italic>, neuromedin (Nmb), NK1, glutamatergic (VGlut2), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and the absence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), serotonin, GABA, and glycine. These neurons are activated by CO<sub>2</sub> via their intrinsic pH sensitivity and via inputs from the carotid bodies. The RTN of mice has a distinctive developmental lineage that relies on transcription factors <italic>Egr2, Phox2b, Lbx1,</italic> and <italic>Atoh1. Phox2b</italic> is the only one that remains expressed in adulthood. RTN progenitors originate from the dB2 domain of rhombomere 5. These progenitors are <italic>Phox2b</italic>-positive, switch on <italic>Lbx1</italic> at the postmitotic stage, migrate ventrally, and activate <italic>Atoh-1</italic> expression once they reach the region of the facial motor nucleus. In the respiratory pF also have distinct functional subgroup of neurons, that is, pF ventral neurons (non-RTN) and pF lateral neurons (expiratory oscillators). RTN neurons target various components of the respiratory central pattern generator (rCPG) and are presumed to play a key role in breathing automaticity during anesthesia, sleep, and quiet waking. The carotid body may also influence the activity of the rCPG neurons through connections that bypass the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takakura et al., 2006</xref>).

The mutant neonates showed a slightly increase in tidal volume and consequently in total ventilation compared to their control littermates.

However, the reduction in ventilation in their study was due to reduction in total cycle duration with no change in tidal volume.</p><p>To further investigate whether the result in our study could be a bias of the plethysmograph method used (whole-body), in a subset of neonates, we used a more accurate method, the head-out plethysmograph. Despite the small number sample (N=4/group) we found similar results, showing a tendency to slightly increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation in the mutant neonate group. It is important to mention that, despite the small increase in ventilation there was no difference in oxygen consumption between mutants and control mice, indicating no changes in metabolic rate induced by the mutation.</p><p>Additionally, the small increase in ventilation does not seem to be a consequence of the genetic approach used by us, which target not only ventral parafacial/RTN region (peri VII), but also intertrigeminal neurons (peri V) that express both <italic>Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>). The result suggests a direct effect of NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation used in our study. Because inactivation of Phox2b from Atoh1-expressing cells, that is, the same population target in our study, found reduction in the ventilation in mutant neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>) and contradict with our study. Unfortunately, we do not know from the former study if the reduction in ventilation was due to change in tidal volume and/or respiratory frequency.</p><p>Whether the change is a consequence of NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation specific to peri VII and/or peri V region, we do not have a clear picture because we do not use any strategy to target one of those population. Although, there is no data in the literature showing the contribution of peri V <italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons to regulate tidal volume.

It is also important to highlight that all studies cited above measured ventilation in neonates using the whole-body plethysmograph method.

However, while hypercapnic ventilatory response completely recovered during adulthood, the hypoxic ventilatory response still partially compromised.

In addition, as in our study, cells were located ventral to facial nucleus. A massive loss of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup> neurons occurred when PARM <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutation was introduced in the RTN. Thus, loss of RTN chemosensitive neurons might be responsible for the blunted hypercapnic response in neonate. Therefore, the open question is what mechanisms enable the neonate mutant to maintain their ventilation, and presumably normal blood PCO<sub>2</sub> in a condition where the chemosensors neurons in the RTN were importantly reduced.</p><p>Here, we showed that although adult mutant mice recovered ventilatory response to hypercapnia, there was a reduction in both the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup> and fos<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>-</sup>-activated neurons under hypercapnia in the parafacial/RTN region. Interestingly, former studies applied different strategies to manipulate <italic>Phox2b</italic> parafacial/RTN neurons, CO<sub>2</sub> response was only partially recovered in the adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruffault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernandez-Miranda et al., 2018</xref>). Although, an extensive depletion of parafacial/RTN neurons occurred at embryonic ages. There is no information whether those neurons still depleted during adulthood and whether they are functional. Thus, it complicates further discussion with our finding. The recovery of the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex in adults in our study might be due to a late compensation of residual RTN neurons, peripheral chemoreceptor, and/or to some of the multiple chemosensors sites as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nattie, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One possibility is that carotid body compensates for the CO<sub>2</sub> drive to breathe and then through nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) activates the respiratory column to maintain breathing activity. The plausible explanation emerges by considering that RTN neurons are strongly activated by carotid body stimulation and provide powerful excitatory input to the respiratory column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takakura et al., 2006</xref>). They may thus be obligatory intermediates for relaying the CO<sub>2</sub> response when occur a loss of RTN neurons early in life. The second possibility is that RTN is not an obligatory site for central chemoreceptors in adults when the neurons are damaged at first days of life. Other candidates of chemoreceptor sites could assume the function. Those candidates are serotonergic neurons that have been reported to be pH-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Richerson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corcoran et al., 2009</xref>), the noradrenergic neurons located in the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biancardi et al., 2008</xref>) and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wenker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wenker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobrinho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The results of previous loss-of-function experiments to assess the role played by RTN neurons in the chemoreflex in adults are not entirely conclusive. In previous work, we evaluated the chemoreflex in which subsets of <italic>Phox2b</italic>-expressing neurons in the RTN were lesioned using toxin or pharmacological tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takakura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takakura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takakura et al., 2014</xref>). Bilateral lesions of the neurokinin1 receptor-expressing neurons in the RTN region by injection of saporin conjugated to a substance P or injection of the GABA-A agonist muscimol reduced hypercapnic ventilatory response in adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nattie and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takakura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takakura et al., 2014</xref>). However, these experiments lack specificity, and the extension of the lesion or inhibition is difficult to control. Using a more selective approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marina et al., 2010</xref>, applied a pharmacogenetic tool to silence RTN neurons. Rats that received injection of lentivirus vector expressing the allatostatin receptor from PRSx8 promoter reduced the hypercapnic ventilatory response after administration of allatostatin. However, the PRSx8 promoter used targets <italic>Phox2a</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> neurons in the rostral aspect of the ventrolateral medulla, which includes RTN, C1 adrenergic, and A5 noradrenergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to mention that studies that tested loss of function of RTN/parafacial neurons in adult rodents need to be carefully discussed. Since it might exist important differences in neuronal plasticity, when comparing to neurons that were damaged early in the life.</p><p>Another important finding in our study was the compromised ventilatory response to hypoxia in both neonates and adult mutants. The hypoxic ventilatory response emerges from a physiological reflex of the already established notion that ventrolateral brainstem respiratory neurons are excited by peripheral chemoreceptors via a direct glutamatergic input from commissural NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guyenet, 2014</xref>). Besides the di-synaptic excitatory pathway from commissural NTS to RVLM, we also know that we have a relay via the chemosensitive neurons of the RTN (secondary input) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takakura et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the compromised ventilatory response to hypoxia could be explained by the fact that this pathway was affected by the conditional <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells.</p><p>The impaired ventilatory response to hypoxia in neonates is in contrast with previous work that used PARM <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutation specific to RTN neurons. Interestingly, PARM <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutation in the RTN showed intact and even higher ventilatory response to hypoxia in neonates, despite the abrupt loss of RTN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>). This difference could be explained by the fact that in their study, peripheral chemoreceptors are potentialized in neonates. When neonate mutants were exposed to hyperoxia (100% O<sub>2</sub>) they showed higher respiratory depression and apneas compared to their control. Although in the present study we have not tested hyperoxia in neonates, we found that at least in adults it did not cause any effect (data not shown).</p><p>The open question that needs to be investigated is by which mechanism NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells compromise chemosensory control of breathing in both neonates and adults. Such mechanisms may involve selective loss of neurons, disorganized respiratory circuits, that likely contributes to the irregular breathing pattern and apneic phenotype during adulthood. In addition, further studies could investigate whether the respiratory function and chemoreflex responses in mutants are altered during sleep stages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data established the NPARM <italic>Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup></italic> mutation in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells with an impaired ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia in neonates.

In other words, the conditional Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> mutation in Atoh1-expressing cells affects the peripheral chemoreflex pathway and the important cells that serve as relevant chemosensors in the ventral aspect of the parafacial/RTN region.

The head and body chambers were separated by a pliable neck collar of plastic film that provided an air-tight seal between the two chambers. Three, premixed gas mixtures (room air 21% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>; hypercapnia 7% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>; hypoxia 8% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>; Oxylumen Gases Industriais Ltda, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were delivered continuously through the head chamber mice a flow rate of 40 mL/min for P1-3. The body chamber was sealed but had two ports, one for the differential pressure transducer (FE 141 Spirometer, ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia) used to monitor pressure oscillations associated with breathing and the other calibration port for injecting and withdrawing known volumes of gas (via a graduated syringe). Calibration of the system via injection of different volumes of air into the body chamber (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mL) established that the pressure signal (mV) was directly proportional to volume and that the relationship was linear (R<sup>2</sup>=0.999). The pressure signal was amplified (FE 141 Spirometer, ADInstruments), digitized (200 Hz), and stored on computer via acquisition software (PowerLab system, ADInstruments/LabChart Software, version 7.3). The entire plethysmograph system was under a controlled temperature to maintain in the thermoneutral zone for P1-3 age between 32.5°C and 33.5°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mortola, 1984</xref>).</p><p>For whole-body plethysmography closed system, the plethysmograph chamber of neonate had 40 mL and was saturated with water vapor and thermoregulated at 32.5°C and 33.5°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mortola, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durand et al., 2004</xref>). The flow rate was set to 40 mL/min to avoid CO<sub>2</sub> and water accumulation. Breathing recording in adult mice was all done using whole-body plethysmography closed system in a larger chamber (500 mL) and flow rate was set to 500 mL/min. Experiments occurred at 24–26°C room temperature. The animal chamber was connected to a differential pressure transducer and to a preamplifier (FE 141 Spirometer, ADInstruments) to detect pressure oscillations when chamber was completely closed. Volume calibration was performed for each experiment by injecting 0.2–0.5 mL of air into the neonatal and adult chamber. The signal was digitalized using PowerLab system (ADInstruments). The sample rate was set as 1000 Hz and signal were filtered in 0.5–20 Hz bandwidth.</p><p>Breathing variables as breath duration (T<sub>TOT</sub>; s), inspiratory time (T<sub>I</sub>; s), expiratory time (T<sub>E</sub>; s), tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>; µL/g), respiratory frequency (fR; breaths/min), and ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>; µL/min/g) were analyzed offline using Lab Chart software (ADInstruments). Tidal volume in whole-body plethysmography was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patrone et al., 2018</xref>). Minute ventilation was defined by the product of breathing frequency and tidal volume. Breath variability was analyzed by IBI irregularity and it was defined as IBI irregularity = abs (T<sub>TOT</sub> (n+1) – T<sub>TOT</sub> (n))/ T<sub>TOT</sub> (n) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Heijden and Zoghbi, 2018</xref>). We also used a nonlinear method of analyses known as Poincare map. This method plots breath duration (T<sub>TOT</sub>) vs. duration of the subsequent breath (T<sub>TOT</sub> n+1). We used a total of 100 breaths at rest condition. Next, we calculated SD1 and SD2 that describe the distribution of the points in the ellipse using the Kubios software (version 3.5.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan et al., 2002</xref>). In summary, it was calculated the width of the variation perpendicular to (SD1) and along the line of identity (SD2) from the ellipse that describes the distribution of the points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To quantify breathing parameters, we first calculated the average of 30 s during a stable condition for each animal during normoxia, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. To quantify changes during hypoxia and hypercapnia, we normalized the data to baseline for each animal and then calculate the relative changes expressed as percentage. Spontaneous apnea‐like events or respiratory pause was defined by the cessation of breathing greater than the average of one respiratory cycle to identify possible breathing pattern abnormalities. The duration of each apnea‐like event was from the end of the first breath to the start of the following breath.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measurements of O<sub>2</sub> consumption</title><p>We used an O<sub>2</sub> analyzer (ADInstruments) that was connected to the output port of the animal’s head chamber to pull air through the chamber at 100 mL/min for P1-2 and 500 mL/min for adult mice. A mass flow system (MFS, Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV, USA) was coupled to the outlet of the whole-body plethysmograph chamber. The outflow from the chamber was dried through a drierite column before passing through the O<sub>2</sub> analyzer where O<sub>2</sub> fraction in the outflow gas was continuously sampled (1000 Hz) and digitized via PowerLab (ADInstruments/Chart Software, version 7.3). The fractions of oxygen in the inflow (FiO<sub>2</sub>) and outflow (FeO<sub>2</sub>) gas were measured using a gas analyzer (model ML206, ADInstuments) that sampled, alternatively from the input and outflow gas ports. O<sub>2</sub> consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) was calculated based on the formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Depocas and Hart, 1957</xref>): VO<sub>2</sub> = [FLo(FiO<sub>2</sub> − FeO<sub>2</sub>)]/1 − FiO<sub>2</sub>, where FLo is the outlet flow rate; FiO<sub>2</sub> is the inflow O<sub>2</sub> fraction; FeO<sub>2</sub> is the outflow O<sub>2</sub> fraction. VO<sub>2</sub> was divided by body mass (in g) and the values reported under standard temperature and pressure, dry (STPD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology</title><p>The mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (5% in 100% O<sub>2</sub>) and heparin was injected intracardially (500 units) and perfused through the ascending aorta with 20 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 0.1 M) and with 50 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS 0.1 M).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hiroshi Onimaru (Reviewer #1); Luis Rodrigo Hernandez-Miranda (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The present manuscript by Ferreira and colleagues is of potential interest to researchers working in the field of neural control of breathing and associated respiratory disorders. This study provides some novel insight into some genetic lesions that may underlie some developmental respiratory pathophysiologies. However, limitations in novelty, methodological approaches and data interpretations prevent acceptance of the paper in its present form.</p><p>To sum,</p><p>1 – Despite the fact that the authors propose a new genetic strategy to manipulate the development of the RTN in mice, there is a limited level of novelty when compared to previous already published works that have already clearly established the importance of Phox2b and Atoh1 regarding their role in specifying RTN constitutive neurons with their functions in central chemoception and breathing rhythm in general. You should strongly and deeply argue and discuss the differences between your present results and already known data addressing the role of Phox2b and Atoh1 in the RTN function and respiratory disorders.</p><p>2 – In addition, there are several methodological aspects and interpretation that deserve attention: the most important one being the practices for plethysmographic recordings in newborn and adult mice that must be performed in correct conditions in order to be able to draw strong and unambiguous conclusions; the identity of cFos-positive cells should be better described (are they indeed Phox2b+?). A fate map of GFP-expressing cells is required, including at different developmental stages. This is crucial as a precedent study has shown mislocation of RTN cells after genetic manipulations, this possibility is by the way not documented, examined or discussed. In addition, the status of other structures co-expressing Phox2b and Atoh1 must be described, as they might also affect breathing behavior.</p><p>3 – Illustrations must be ameliorated (Figure 1 is useless, Figure 4 requires traces before gas challenges and back to control, Fig8: the VII nucleus must be Phox2b positive) and additional data should be presented (map of GFP+ cells as stated above, activity of RTN cells during challenges).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors introduced new strategy of genetic manipulation in mice to reveal functional development of the RTN neurons that may relate to CCHS neuropathology. The methods and results are fairly clear. However, it might be rather difficult and complicated work to discuss the present findings because the results should be compared with those of various previous works including genetic manipulations of the RTN. I think that authors struggled to these issues, but I appreciate if they did more effort for this.</p><p>General comments</p><p>To understand strategy of this study, it would be required to know precise relationship between Phox2b and Atoh1 expression in the RTN during development: e.g. whether Phox2b expression requires preceding Atoh1 expression or not, whether Atoh1 is not required for Phox2b expression but does for correct localization of Phox2b expressing cells, etc. Although some information was mentioned, please add a brief further explanation for this issue in the Introduction to facilitate understanding of their strategy for general readers (see also comments for Discussion section).</p><p>In addition, it would be important to correctly understand differences between genetic removal and induction of (conditional) mutation of Phox2b (or Atoh1). It seems to be rather complicated for general readers to understand these issues and what are new findings of the present study, because various genetic manipulations to investigate the RTN function have been performed.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The last sentence, &quot;…of the RTN neurons and are essential for the activation of breathing under hypoxic and hypercapnia condition…&quot;: What are essential for the activation? (Same as the last sentence in the Introduction).</p><p>Methods</p><p>Authors described &quot;All experiments, were conducted between 9:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M.&quot;</p><p>How do you think about the sleep-wake cycle condition of mice during measurements? This might be important in considering relation to CCHS.</p><p>Results</p><p>Although the number of specimens for statistical analysis is described in Figure 2 legend, it is not clear whether the same number could be applied in other figures. For instance, the number in Figure 3 seems to be different from those in Figure 2 (e.g. in neonate control and adult control). Moreover, the specimen number for body weight analysis was not described (Page 10, para 3). Please check the number of all experiments. It would be better to describe them in each figure or in the text.</p><p>Section 6: The fos expression was counted in RTN neurons lacking TH immunoreactivity. Is it correct that these cells are Phox2b-positive?</p><p>Section 7: The results showed that number of Phox2b expressing cells in mutant mice was about half of that in control mice. Authors should discuss why these results were obtained, because it was previously reported that almost 100% of Atoh1 expressing cells were also Phox2-positive (Dubreuil et al. 2009). Did the present results indicate that 50 % of Phox2b expressing cells in the mutant RTN were Atoh1 independent? Or some of Phox2b△8 mutated cells are remaining?</p><p>Section 7: Did authors confirmed that Phox2b-positive and TH-positive cells in the medulla and pons were not affected by this mutation?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>If authors could summarize possible relationships between Atoh1 and Phox2b (and maybe other related transcription factors) involved in the RTN development, considering previous and present results, it would be very helpful for understanding the present situation and future problem of this field. I strongly recommend that authors give a figure for this purpose.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manner in which the plethysmography for both the neonates and adults is not technically sound. There are several problems with their approaches. For neonates, whole body plethysmography is not an appropriate method to measure tidal volume. As the authors themselves note in their methods section, whole body plethysmography is used &quot;to detected pressure oscillations as a result of changes in temperature promoted by ventilation when chamber was completely closed&quot; [sic]. In neonate plethysmography, P1-3 pups typically equilibrate with their environmental chamber temp. Thus, the waveform is not a derivative of heating and cooling that can be related to tidal volume by applying Bartlett and Tenney corrections but rather a function of airway resistance as the compression in the chamber equilibrates with the rarefaction in the lungs upon inspiration (PMID: 25017785). This phenomenon is also a component of adult respiratory measurements, but less so with a large enough temperature differential (30-33 chamber temp) making the barometric component the predominant feature. Facemask pneumotachography or headout plethysmography can give a more accurate and consistent estimate of tidal volume in neonates.</p><p>In adult plethysmography, several necessary measurements were not taken or presented. Body temperatures is not reported, nor are VO2 or VCO2. In plethysmography, especially in chemosensory studies, these are critical measurements that should be taken concurrently with breathing measurements and reported singularly and as VE/VO2. If any metabolic or temperature differences exist compared to control groups, this will have significant impacts on breathing outcomes. Changes in metabolism can drive persistent states of alkalosis and acidosis that would impact responses to chemosensory challenges (though such states may be mitigated by renal compensation). Metabolism is state dependent and plethysmography, even with habituation, is still stressful (PMID: 31178741). As noted by authors and further elaborated by Frappel and Mortola (PMID: 1621857, VO2 and temperature will drop in response to hypoxia. Additionally, poikilocapnic hypoxic hyperventilation (vs isocapnic)) causes a drop in pCO2 that reduces drive to breath (PMID: 23690557). Lastly, the chamber temperature for the adult studies should be held at thermo-neutrality rather than room temperature (30-33C). The cold challenge to mice that is room temperature has confounding effects on drive to breath and metabolism. By measuring adults in thermo-neutral conditions, potential metabolic effects are minimized. Isocapnic hypoxia may also be considered.</p><p>Given that there is a reported body weight difference and the authors are using a cold chamber for adults, there very well may be an unappreciated difference in metabolism or in metabolic changes due to changes in state, response to hypoxia, or the cold challenge that impacts the reported outcomes. Metabolic differences may also arise (leading to weight loss) through other Phox2B – Atoh1 overlapping populations perturbed in this model not considered in the manuscript.</p><p>The observed phenotypes cannot be exclusively assigned to the RTN. A full assessment of Atoh1 and Phox2b overlap using cumulative fatemapping afforded by the Atoh1_Cre; Phox2bΔ8 model should be reported as other areas of overlap could either impact breathing directly or indirectly through metabolism and stress responses (PMID 8184995). The role of the previously identified Atoh1; Phox2B para and intra – trigeminal neurons should be accounted for in the phenotypes and/or the Atoh1; Phox2B RTN neurons tested in isolation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Ferreira and colleagues provide a novel mouse model (Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8) for the study of the central respiratory chemoreceptor circuit and, therefore, of interest for the respiratory physiology community. Nonetheless, in its present form, this work still lacks more physiological, developmental, and anatomical characterizations to place this study in a broader context and gain new insights into the physiology of respiratory chemoreflexes.</p><p>I hope the authors find my below comments of use to enrich their work.</p><p>1. The major caveat of this work is that it does not significantly differ from previously published reports using very similar approaches (including a Atoh1Cre,Phox2bflox/flox strategy in Ruffault et al., 2015, <italic>eLife</italic> DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051).</p><p>2. For today's standards, the display of the alleles (genetic strategy) used in this study cannot occupy a full main figure (Figure 1).</p><p>3. The plethysmograph traces presented in Figures 2, 4, 5 and 6 should be accompanied by a period of pre-Gas exposure and post-Gas exposure.</p><p>4. Figure 7 and 8 could be combined, and more representative photographs should be presented. The assignment of the facial motor nucleus seems to be arbitrary, as it lacks Phox2b immunoreactive cells. Facial motor neurons do express Phox2b in addition to ChAT in the adult life of mice.</p><p>5. The general outline of the manuscript is nothing I have seen before in <italic>eLife</italic>, that is numbered points for Materials and methods and the result section, although I admit that it helped a lot with the reading.</p><p>6. The authors show a reduction (about half) in the number of Phox2b+/TH- cells in adult Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice, and assume that this is indicative of a reduction in the number of retrotrapezoid neurons. This is not necessarily true. I would recommend that the authors present first an anatomical/developmental characterization of retrotrapezoid neurons in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 at embryonic and neonatal states (E12.5, E16.5 and P0). At this stages, retrotrapezoid neurons have a well-established molecular signature: Phox2b, Atoh1 and Lbx1 expression. Whereas there are not great commercial Lbx1 and Atoh1 antibodies, the authors could consider combining in situ hybridization for Lbx1 and/or Atoh1 with Phox2b immunoreactivity, the Phox2b antibody that the authors used in this study is great, and compatible with in situ hybridization (my own experience). Other studies by the groups of Huda Zoghbi and Jean-Francois Brunet have shown that interfering with Phox2b and Atoh1 expression in retrotrapezoid neurons results in the incorrect location of this cells dorsally to the facial motor nucleus, is this phenotype also present in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice?</p><p>7. The authors show a reduction of Fos+/TH- cells in adult Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice that were exposed to high levels of CO2 in air. From this result the authors conclude that the number of Fos-activated retrotrapezoid neurons is decreased. Again, this is not necessarily true. To better define this, it is necessary to demonstrate that Fos is not express in Phox2b+/TH- retrotrapezoid neurons. Whereas the Fos and Phox2b antibodies used in this study are both generated in rabbits, the authors could make use of the eGFP expression present in the Phox2bdelta8 allele (Figure 1), therefore, it is necessary to combine the immunoreactivity for eGFP (Phox2b), Fos and TH. This is central for this study, as if indeed less retrotrapezoid neurons are activated by CO2 in adult Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice, it is astonishing that these mice can have a full response to hypercapnia. This is intriguing because other mouse models, in which the number of retrotrapezoid neurons are reduced in greater numbers, do not show a full response to CO2 in the adult life, for instance in: P2b::CreBAC1;Atoh1lox/lox (Ruffault et al., 2015), Egr2cre;P2b27Alacki (Ramanantsoa et al., 2011, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011), Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice (Huang et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027) and Egr2cre;Lbx1FS (Hernandez-Miranda et al., 2018, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1813520115).</p><p>8. The authors do not address if retrotrapezoid neurons/parafacial cells are rhythmically active and responsive for pH changes in the embryonic/neonatal life of Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 animals. The fact that these mice can fully respond to hypercapnia in the adult life but not in the neonatal stages might imply that retrotrapezoid neurons are present but somehow silenced in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 neonates. Therefore the anatomical/developmental characterization of retrotrapezoid neurons (as suggested above) should be complemented with in vitro calcium imaging in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 embryos or neonates. This could explain why mice that completely lack retrotrapezoid neurons (Egr2cre;Lbx1FS) do not fully display the hypercapnic reflex, whereas Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice do.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73130.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The present manuscript by Ferreira and colleagues is of potential interest to researchers working in the field of neural control of breathing and associated respiratory disorders.

You should strongly and deeply argue and discuss the differences between your present results and already known data addressing the role of Phox2b and Atoh1 in the RTN function and respiratory disorders.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers and editor for the important concern and the opportunity to better discuss the differences between our study and former studies that have already described the role of Phox2b mutation or genetic deletion on chemoreception and breathing regulation. We implemented several modifications in the manuscript to address this question. Briefly, the main novelty of our study was to introduce a humanized NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> in Atoh1<sup>cre</sup>-expressing cells of rodents. Atoh1 is expressed during development in proliferating cells in the rhombic lip and in postmitotic neurons. In this independent site, postmitotic neurons are the only region that co-express Phox2b and Atoh1 surround the paramotor neurons that involves facial motor nucleus (peri VII thus, RTN/parafacial neurons) and trigeminal motor nucleus (periV also known as intertrigeminal region). The present study highlighted some differences compared to deletion of a transcription factor (Phox2b or Atoh1) or introduction of PARM CCHS mutation revealed by previous studies. Surprisingly, (1) Phox2bΔ8 in Atoh1expressing cells did not induce important functional change of baseline respiration in neonates. In contrast, it increased the number of apneas and respiratory irregularity in adult mice. (2) Ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are compromised in neonates. Interestingly, same lack of hypercapnic response have been demonstrated after introducing PARM mutation specific to RTN (DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011) or by deleting Phox2b from same Phox2b/Atoh1 expressing neurons (periV and peri VII) (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051.001). However, the compromised ventilatory response to hypoxia showed by us contrast with the study that introduced PARM mutation in the RTN (DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011). Furthermore, (3) in adults, the ventilatory response to hypoxia still partially impaired. But they recovered hypercapnic ventilatory response. Despite hypercapnic responses is recovered, the number of Phox2b+/TH- neurons in the RTN/parafacial region reduced by approximately 50%. Additionally, the number of fos+/TH- expressing neurons in the RTN/parafacial region induced by hypercapnia drastically reduced in adults. Interestingly, formers studies that applied different strategies to manipulate Phox2b RTN/parafacial neurons, CO<sub>2</sub> response was only partially recovered in the adult life (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051; DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1813520115). Although, an extensive depletion of RTN/parafacial neurons occurred at embryonic ages. There is no information whether those neurons still depleted during adulthood and whether they are functional. Thus, it complicates further comparison with our finding. Together these results highlighted important differences that certainly imply different mechanisms between our strategy and previous studies. The mechanism by which NPARM Phox2bΔ8 mutation impact ventilatory responses induced by hypoxia and hypercapnia will be focus of future studies in the laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – In addition, there are several methodological aspects and interpretation that deserve attention: the most important one being the practices for plethysmographic recordings in newborn and adult mice that must be performed in correct conditions in order to be able to draw strong and unambiguous conclusions; the identity of cFos-positive cells should be better described (are they indeed Phox2b+?). A fate map of GFP-expressing cells is required, including at different developmental stages. This is crucial as a precedent study has shown mislocation of RTN cells after genetic manipulations, this possibility is by the way not documented, examined or discussed. In addition, the status of other structures co-expressing Phox2b and Atoh1 must be described, as they might also affect breathing behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for several comments on methodology. We acknowledge the limitations of the barometric plethysmography for the precise measurement of tidal volume. For that reason, breath volumes were normalized to calibrations made during each recording. The amplitude ratio of breaths compared to calibrations was used to determine a value in microliter for each breath. In addition, modifications induced by hypoxia/hypercapnia stimulus was showed as percentage change and not absolute values. To account for differences in body size, breath volumes were also normalized to body weight (μl/g). As a result, we do not expect these limitations to have a significant impact on the interpretation of our data. In addition, to further investigate whether the plethysmography method used would change the former tidal volume results, specialty during baseline conditions where the absolute values were described, we performed head-out plethysmograph system in a subset of neonate (control and mutant). We found that neonate mutants mice presented a slightly increase in tidal volume. However, it did not reach statistic differences, presumably due to the small number of the sample (N = 4/group). In any case, we added the results in the result section and mentioned in the text the importance to use more accurate methods since it has not been used by majority of the studies, including those that we referenced in the present study (Mortola, 1984, Durand et al., 2004; Mortola and Frappell, 2013; Patrone et al., 2018).</p><p>In relation to the fos expression, we better described our protocol and clarify the methodology used in the text (methods, results and Discussion section). We used the absence of coexpression with tyrosine hydroxylase, as it has been extensively described to identify RTN activated neurons located ventrally to facial motor nucleus (Stornetta et al., 2006. Barna et al., 2012; 2014; Kumar et al., 2015). Unfortunately, the fos and Phox2b antibodies that we have in the laboratory are made in the same species (i.e, rabbit) and could not be ran together. Furthermore, we investigated RTN/parafacial neurons by analyzing the presence of Phox2b and absence of TH expression. Phox2b+/TH- neurons are well known to be chemosensitive RTN neurons (Stornetta et al., 2006; Onimaru et al., 2008). We found that the number of Phox2b+/TH- neurons greatly reduced in adult mutant mice. Importantly, the neurons were located ventral and laterally to facial motor nucleus. In agreement with previous study that deleted Phox2b from same neuronal region (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051.001). More specifically, from Phox2b/Atoh1 post mitotic neurons in the peri V and periVII region. Interestingly, the misslocation only occurred when manipulating Atoh1 neurons (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051.001; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027 ).</p><p>Regarding the fate map of GFP-expressing cells, in concordance with our prior data (DOI 10.1007/s00401-015-1441-0; doi:10.1111/bpa.12877), GFP expression is only detected in embryonic Phox2b expressing cells. The goal of the present study was to analyze respiratory and anatomical effect after birth and not during embryonic phase. For that reason, a fate map showing GFP-expressing cells during different developmental stages was not performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Illustrations must be ameliorated (Figure 1 is useless, Figure 4 requires traces before gas challenges and back to control, Fig8: the VII nucleus must be Phox2b positive) and additional data should be presented (map of GFP+ cells as stated above, activity of RTN cells during challenges).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 was removed. We edited and added traces showing pre and pos stimulus.

Atoh1 in the brainstem is expressed during development in proliferating cells in the rhombic lip (at early stages) and in postmitotic neurons (during late stage) independently. The postmitotic neurons are the only region that co-express Phox2b and Atoh1 surround the paramotor neurons that involves facial motor nucleus (peri VII thus, RTN/parafacial neurons) and trigeminal motor nucleus (periV also known as intertrigeminal region) (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051.001). Thus, NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> was introduced in the periVII and periV region. Our goal with this strategy was to investigate the effect of the NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> in regions that are well known to be involved with respiratory control and central chemosensitivity. The idea was to induce late activation of NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> and, then analyze the effect on respiratory function and neuroanatomy of RTN after birth (neonatal and adulthood). The results in the present study showing immunoreactivity to Phox2b, and absence of tyrosine hydroxylase strongly indicate the phenotype of RTN/parafacial chemosensitive neurons. Furthermore, we showed that when the mutation is activated in the postmitotic Phox2b/Atoh1 neurons, it greatly impacts RTN/parafacial neurons (reduction in approximately 50% compared to controls). Deletion of Phox2b using similar strategy (from same periV and periVII region) reduced Phox2b+/Atoh1+ expression by 60% during embryonic age 18.5.</p><p>We also added more information in the Introduction and Discussion to be clear for general readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it would be important to correctly understand differences between genetic removal and induction of (conditional) mutation of Phox2b (or Atoh1).

The present study used a conditional “humanized” Phox2b NPARM mutation inspired by a proband previously reported by Dr. Otero´s group. This locus includes a human exon 3 mutation with an 8-nucleotide deletion. It is not induced by Atoh1. Rather, cells that express Atoh1 undergo the cre-mediated recombination at the engineered Phox2b locus and will express the NPARM phox2b only when the gene is normally expressed. Phox2b shows expression early in mammalian development, and therefore this construct provides for the study of NPARM Phox2b effects in respiratory nuclei after initial embryonic Phox2b specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The last sentence, &quot;…of the RTN neurons and are essential for the activation of breathing under hypoxic and hypercapnia condition…&quot;: What are essential for the activation?

It is likely that these cells also express Phox2b because in this region we have the bulk of Phox2b-expressing neurons. We did not perform Phox2b and fos because our antibodies are made in rabbits.

Authors should discuss why these results were obtained, because it was previously reported that almost 100% of Atoh1 expressing cells were also Phox2-positive (Dubreuil et al. 2009). Did the present results indicate that 50 % of Phox2b expressing cells in the mutant RTN were Atoh1 independent? Or some of Phox2b△8 mutated cells are remaining?</p></disp-quote><p>In the present version, we did not analyze the percentage of Atoh1 cells that colocalize with Phox2b in the RTN. Previous studies that used in situ hybridization showed that approximately all Phox2b neurons of the RTN also express Atoh1 (PMID: 22958821, 25866925). We used the cre line as a tool to introduce the conditional Phox2b mutation during Atoh1 expression. Thus, cells that express Atoh1 undergo the cre-mediated recombination at the engineered Phox2b locus and will express the NPARM phox2b only when the gene is normally expressed. Phox2b shows expression early in mammalian development, and therefore this construct provides for the study of NPARM Phox2b effects in respiratory nuclei after initial embryonic Phox2b specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Section 7: Did authors confirmed that Phox2b-positive and TH-positive cells in the medulla and pons were not affected by this mutation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we ran a new series of experiments and noticed that Phox2b+ neurons in the pons as well as the number of TH cells in the A1, A2, A6, and C1 were not affected by the mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>If authors could summarize possible relationships between Atoh1 and Phox2b (and maybe other related transcription factors) involved in the RTN development, considering previous and present results, it would be very helpful for understanding the present situation and future problem of this field.

There are several problems with their approaches. For neonates, whole body plethysmography is not an appropriate method to measure tidal volume. As the authors themselves note in their methods section, whole body plethysmography is used &quot;to detected pressure oscillations as a result of changes in temperature promoted by ventilation when chamber was completely closed&quot; [sic]. In neonate plethysmography, P1-3 pups typically equilibrate with their environmental chamber temp. Thus, the waveform is not a derivative of heating and cooling that can be related to tidal volume by applying Bartlett and Tenney corrections but rather a function of airway resistance as the compression in the chamber equilibrates with the rarefaction in the lungs upon inspiration (PMID: 25017785). This phenomenon is also a component of adult respiratory measurements, but less so with a large enough temperature differential (30-33 chamber temp) making the barometric component the predominant feature. Facemask pneumotachography or headout plethysmography can give a more accurate and consistent estimate of tidal volume in neonates.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the limitations of the barometric plethysmography for precise measurement of tidal volume in neonates used in the present study. For that reason, in a subset of control and mutant neonate mice we analyze respiration using head-out plethysmograph. Despite the small sample size, we found that tidal volume was slightly higher in the mutant compared to controls littermate. We added more information in the material and methods ((page 5; 2) Ventilation measurements), results (page 11, para 1<sup>st</sup>), and Discussion section (page 16, para 2<sup>nd</sup>). Additionally, in the experiments using whole body plethysmograph, breath volumes were normalized to calibrations made during each recording. The amplitude ratio of breaths compared to calibrations was used to determine a value in microliter for each breath. More importantly, changes induced by hypoxia/hypercapnia stimulus were showed as percentage change and not absolute values. To account for differences in body size, breath volumes were also normalized to body weight (μl/g). As a result, we do not expect that these limitations significantly impact the interpretation of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In adult plethysmography, several necessary measurements were not taken or presented. Body temperatures is not reported, nor are VO2 or VCO2. In plethysmography, especially in chemosensory studies, these are critical measurements that should be taken concurrently with breathing measurements and reported singularly and as VE/VO2. If any metabolic or temperature differences exist compared to control groups, this will have significant impacts on breathing outcomes. Changes in metabolism can drive persistent states of alkalosis and acidosis that would impact responses to chemosensory challenges (though such states may be mitigated by renal compensation). Metabolism is state dependent and plethysmography, even with habituation, is still stressful (PMID: 31178741). As noted by authors and further elaborated by Frappel and Mortola (PMID: 1621857, VO2) and temperature will drop in response to hypoxia. Additionally, poikilocapnic hypoxic hyperventilation (vs isocapnic) causes a drop in pCO2 that reduces drive to breath (PMID: 23690557). Lastly, the chamber temperature for the adult studies should be held at thermo-neutrality rather than room temperature (30-33C). The cold challenge to mice that is room temperature has confounding effects on drive to breath and metabolism. By measuring adults in thermo-neutral conditions, potential metabolic effects are minimized. Isocapnic hypoxia may also be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out important issues in our previous manuscript. We agree with the reviewer. In fact, some information and misconception were in the previous version. Now, we added the correct way in which the respiratory parameters were measured in both neonate and adult mice (Material and methods section; page 5 – ventilation measurements). We also measured VO2 and VE/VO2 in control and mutant mice during neonatal and adult phase. Despite the slightly reduction in body weight in the mutants during adulthood, oxygen consumption was not different between groups. Those results indicate that NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> in Atoh1<sup>cre</sup>-expressing cells did not impact metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that there is a reported body weight difference and the authors are using a cold chamber for adults, there very well may be an unappreciated difference in metabolism or in metabolic changes due to changes in state, response to hypoxia, or the cold challenge that impacts the reported outcomes. Metabolic differences may also arise (leading to weight loss) through other Phox2B – Atoh1 overlapping populations perturbed in this model not considered in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above some information and misconception were in the previous version. We performed additional experiments to analyze oxygen consumption. We found that mutation did not change VO2 and VE/VO2 in neonates nor in adults compare to controls. Thus, the reduction in body weight in adult mutant cannot be assigned to changes in the metabolism.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the studies that genetically deleted Phox2b/Atoh1 (PMID: 25866925; PMID: 22958821; PMID: 29972353) did not report body weight. However, when PARM Phox2b mutation was induced specific to RTN neurons (PMID: 21900566), i.e., without directly manipulating periV region, mutated neonate (P9) had lower body weight when compared to controls. Nevertheless, oxygen consumption was not evaluated by the former study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observed phenotypes cannot be exclusively assigned to the RTN. A full assessment of Atoh1 and Phox2b overlap using cumulative fatemapping afforded by the Atoh1_Cre; Phox2bΔ8 model should be reported as other areas of overlap could either impact breathing directly or indirectly through metabolism and stress responses (PMID 8184995). The role of the previously identified Atoh1; Phox2B para and intra – trigeminal neurons should be accounted for in the phenotypes and/or the Atoh1; Phox2B RTN neurons tested in isolation.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the excellent point raised. Regarding the stress response, the study cited (PMID 8184995) demonstrated that children with CCHS had lower levels of anxiety compared to all other children, including those with asthma. However, there is no information about CCHS form (PARM or NPARM) included in the group. It will be an interesting topic to investigate in the future.</p><p>In relation to the cumulative fate mapping, we had several problems with our Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup>; Atoh1<sup>cre</sup> colony which prevented us to continue the experiments to show differences in the expression of Phox2b within the para or intraregional regions.

We implemented several modifications in the manuscript to address this question. We rewrote the manuscript and most of the information was added in the introduction and Discussion section. Briefly, the main novelty of our study was to introduce a humanized NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> in Atoh1<sup>cre</sup>expressing cells of rodents. Atoh1 is expressed during development in proliferating cells in the rhombic lip and in postmitotic neurons. In this independent site, postmitotic neurons are the only region that co-express Phox2b and Atoh1 surround the paramotor neurons that involves facial motor nucleus (peri VII thus, RTN/parafacial neurons) and trigeminal motor nucleus (periV also known as intertrigeminal region). The present study highlighted some differences compared to deletion of a transcription factor (Phox2b or Atoh1) or introduction of PARM CCHS mutation revealed by previous studies. Surprisingly, (1) Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> in Atoh1-expressing cells did not induce important functional change of baseline respiration in neonates. In contrast, it increased the number of apneas and respiratory irregularity in adult mice. (2) Ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are compromised in neonates. Interestingly, similar lack of hypercapnic response have been demonstrated after introducing PARM mutation specific to RTN (DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011) or by deleting Phox2b from same Phox2b/Atoh1 expressing neurons (periV and peri VII) (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051.001). However, the compromised ventilatory response to hypoxia showed by us contrast with the study that introduced PARM mutation in the RTN (DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011). Furthermore, (3) in adults, the ventilatory response to hypoxia still partially impaired. But they recovered hypercapnic ventilatory response. Despite hypercapnic responses is recovered, the number of Phox2b+/TH- neurons in the RTN/parafacial region reduced by approximately 50%. Additionally, the number of fos+/TH- expressing neurons in the RTN/parafacial region induced by hypercapnia drastically reduced in adults. Interestingly, formers studies that applied different strategies to manipulate Phox2b RTN/parafacial neurons, CO<sub>2</sub> response was only partially recovered in the adult life (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.07051; DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1813520115). Although, an extensive depletion of RTN/parafacial neurons occurred at embryonic ages. There is no information whether those neurons still depleted during adulthood and whether they are functional. Thus, it complicates further comparison with our finding. Together these results highlighted important differences that certainly imply different mechanisms between our strategy and previous studies. The mechanism by which NPARM Phox2bΔ8 mutation impact ventilatory responses induced by hypoxia and hypercapnia will be focus of future studies in the laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The authors show a reduction (about half) in the number of Phox2b+/TH- cells in adult Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice, and assume that this is indicative of a reduction in the number of retrotrapezoid neurons. This is not necessarily true. I would recommend that the authors present first an anatomical/developmental characterization of retrotrapezoid neurons in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 at embryonic and neonatal states (E12.5, E16.5 and P0). At this stages, retrotrapezoid neurons have a well-established molecular signature: Phox2b, Atoh1 and Lbx1 expression. Whereas there are not great commercial Lbx1 and Atoh1 antibodies, the authors could consider combining in situ hybridization for Lbx1 and/or Atoh1 with Phox2b immunoreactivity, the Phox2b antibody that the authors used in this study is great, and compatible with in situ hybridization (my own experience). Other studies by the groups of Huda Zoghbi and Jean-Francois Brunet have shown that interfering with Phox2b and Atoh1 expression in retrotrapezoid neurons results in the incorrect location of this cells dorsally to the facial motor nucleus, is this phenotype also present in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The Phox2b+/TH- staining to characterize chemosensitive neurons in the RTN/parafacial region has been extensively demonstrated (PMID: 26068853; 29066557). Additionally, in vitro, and anatomical data showed that Phox2b+/TH- neurons in the RTN responded to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> and majority express TASK-2 and GPR4 receptor. Respectively, a H<sup>+</sup>inhibited background K<sup>+</sup> channel, and a H<sup>+</sup>-activated G-protein-coupled receptor, that strongly suggest mediating the chemosensitivity of RTN/parafacial neurons. Thus, it is unlikely that the population showed in our study did not involve chemosensitive neurons in the RTN/parafacial region. In addition, we used a second strategy, Fos+/TH- immunostaining, to investigate the RTN/parafacial neuronal activation induced by hypercapnia and to avoid the C1 adjacent neurons. Fos+/TH- neurons expression reduced by 50% in adult mutated mice compared to control. Together, these results indicate that the reduction in Phox2b+/TH- neurons in the mutant mice greatly reduced the number of functional chemosensitive neurons from RTN/parafacial region.</p><p>We understand the importance to describe the anatomical characterization of RTN/parafacial neurons at embryonic stages, but it was not the main goal of the present study. We did not analyze any functional respiratory parameters during embryonic stages, as most studies have already done. We focus in characterize functional and anatomical changes induced by the NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> mutation in a mature system. As it corresponds with the timeline when CCHS is detected, to investigate how the anatomical changes could correlate with functional changes when the mutation is activated at late embryonic stages in a restricted neuronal population (periVII and periV). From now, to better understand the mechanisms we will consider the suggestions in the future studies.</p><p>The conditional NPARM Phox2b<sup>Δ8</sup> in Atoh1-expressing cells did not result in miss location of Phox2b neurons dorsally to facial motor nucleus. Our study used a similar strategy that Ruffault et al. (2015) used in their study. The difference is that instead activated the NPARM Phox2bΔ8, they deleted Phox2b from Atoh1-expressing cells (Atoh1<sup>Cre</sup>;Phox2b<sup>lox/lox</sup>). Interestingly, improper location seems to depend directly on Atoh1. Since, deletion of Atoh1 from same population (P2b::CreBAC1;Atoh1lox/lox) shifted Phox2b neurons dorsally. In addition, similar results occurred when Atoh1 was deleted within the HoxA4 domain (PMID: 22958821).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors show a reduction of Fos+/TH- cells in adult Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice that were exposed to high levels of CO2 in air. From this result the authors conclude that the number of Fos-activated retrotrapezoid neurons is decreased. Again, this is not necessarily true. To better define this, it is necessary to demonstrate that Fos is not express in Phox2b+/TH- retrotrapezoid neurons. Whereas the Fos and Phox2b antibodies used in this study are both generated in rabbits, the authors could make use of the eGFP expression present in the Phox2bdelta8 allele (Figure 1), therefore, it is necessary to combine the immunoreactivity for eGFP (Phox2b), Fos and TH. This is central for this study, as if indeed less retrotrapezoid neurons are activated by CO2 in adult Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice, it is astonishing that these mice can have a full response to hypercapnia. This is intriguing because other mouse models, in which the number of retrotrapezoid neurons are reduced in greater numbers, do not show a full response to CO2 in the adult life, for instance in: P2b::CreBAC1;Atoh1lox/lox (Ruffault et al., 2015), Egr2cre;P2b27Alacki (Ramanantsoa et al., 2011, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011), Atoh1Phox2bCKO mice (Huang et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027) and Egr2cre;Lbx1FS (Hernandez-Miranda et al., 2018, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1813520115).</p></disp-quote><p>The Phox2b and fos antibody that we currently used in the laboratory are both made in the same species (rabbit). Thus, to further avoid any misinterpretation by counting C1 adjacent neurons that also could be activated by hypercapnia. We applied the absence of TH- immunostaining together with anatomical well-defined region (ventral and laterally to facial nucleus) as a criterion to define RTN/parafacial neurons. We also added more information to the manuscript to be clear to the reader. Regarding the use of GFP, in concordance with our prior data (Nobuta et al., Alzate et al.), GFP expression is only detected in embryonic Phox2b expressing cells. Although the most likely reason for this is NPARM Phox2b induced lethality, we acknowledge that other possibilities such as incomplete cre-mediated recombination or Phox2b mutation self-repression may mediate these effects (PMID: 2310352; 17765533).</p><p>As far as the above studies mentioned by the reviewer, the RTN/parafacial neurons investigated were done only during embryonic stages. Therefore, we did not know if in adult, the number of neurons would be comparable to the embryonic age showed to further discusses with the data presented by our study. In addition, the former study, they did not perform any experiment to investigate whether the remaining parafacial/RTN neurons were functional or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors do not address if retrotrapezoid neurons/parafacial cells are rhythmically active and responsive for pH changes in the embryonic/neonatal life of Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 animals. The fact that these mice can fully respond to hypercapnia in the adult life but not in the neonatal stages might imply that retrotrapezoid neurons are present but somehow silenced in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 neonates. Therefore the anatomical/developmental characterization of retrotrapezoid neurons (as suggested above) should be complemented with in vitro calcium imaging in Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 embryos or neonates. This could explain why mice that completely lack retrotrapezoid neurons (Egr2cre;Lbx1FS) do not fully display the hypercapnic reflex, whereas Atoh1Cre,Phox2bdelta8 mice do.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments, which are essential to complement our study. However, in our laboratory, we do not have the option of carrying out calcium imaging experiments. Future projects and experiments and maybe some collaborations are being proposed, so that we can answer this question, as well as others.</p></body></sub-article></article>
