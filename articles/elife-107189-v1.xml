Little is known about the impact of spatial structure, in particular the topology of connections among subpopulations, on adaptive evolution. Typically, spatial structure slows adaptation, although some models suggest topologies that concentrate dispersing individuals through a central hub can accelerate adaptation above that of a well-mixed system. We provide evidence to support this claim and show acceleration is accompanied by high rates of parallel evolution. Our results suggest metapopulation topology can be a potent force driving evolutionary dynamics and patterns of genomic repeatability in structured landscapes such as those involving the spread of pathogens or invasive species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA14</kwd><kwd>metapopulation</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h531d29</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019-05622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kassen</surname><given-names>Rees</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Centralized migration accelerates adaptation and drives parallel evolution, emphasizing the key influence of spatial organization on evolutionary dynamics across systems from pathogen transmission to species range shifts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural populations are often spatially structured as metapopulations, meaning they are geographically subdivided and connected by migration. Examples include infectious diseases that transmit through contact networks among hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leventhal et al., 2015</xref>), species ranges that can be discontiguous, especially at range edges where peripheral populations are connected via dispersal to a more well-connected central population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sagarin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pennington et al., 2021</xref>), and patients (along with their colonizing pathogens) that move among wards in a hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Myall et al., 2021</xref>). How metapopulation topology, the arrangement of connections among subpopulations, influences the dynamics of adaptation is not well understood. The central issues concern the impact of topology on rates of adaptation, the time to generate and fix beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tkadlec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yagoobi and Traulsen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frean et al., 2013</xref>), and the population genetic mechanisms responsible.</p><p>The conventional view, based on a model of reproduction involving offspring replacing parents <italic>en masse</italic> in non-overlapping generations and leading to global competition among individuals, is that the topology of connections among subpopulations has little influence on rates of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guillaume, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maruyama, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Slatkin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slatkin, 1985</xref>). Migration in these models tends to slow but not prevent adaptation across a metapopulation relative to a well-mixed, fully connected system when the rate of selection, <italic>s</italic>, exceeds that of migration, <italic>m</italic>. Rates of adaptation in spatially structured populations can be slowed further by clonal interference, the competition for fixation among independently arising beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordo and Campos, 2006</xref>), an effect that can be particularly strong in large populations because mutation supply rates, being the product of population size, <italic>N</italic>, and the genome-wide mutation rate, <italic>U</italic>, are often high in large populations.</p><p>By contrast, topology can strongly modulate the dynamics of adaptation in finite populations where individuals reproduce in overlapping generations and compete locally with each other, either decreasing or increasing rates of adaptation relative to a well-mixed system depending on the arrangement of subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yagoobi and Traulsen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlogiannis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tkadlec et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hindersin and Traulsen, 2015</xref>). Much attention has been paid to how ‘star’ topologies, comprised of a central ‘hub’ connected to peripheral ‘leaf’ subpopulations, can increase the probability of fixation for beneficial mutations above that expected for a well-mixed population because this result is unexpected from standard models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maruyama, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Slatkin, 1981</xref>) and may reasonably capture features of many real-world scenarios such as contact networks of infectious diseases, the edge of species ranges, or patient transfers between regional care centres and large urban hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nekkab et al., 2020</xref>). Rates of adaptation, measured as the establishment time for beneficial mutations destined to fix, are usually slower in stars than well-mixed populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frean et al., 2013</xref>) but can be accelerated when mutation supply rates in each subpopulation (which is <italic>NU</italic>, as defined above, times <italic>m</italic>, the migration rate into a subpopulation) are &lt;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tkadlec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yagoobi and Traulsen, 2021</xref>), possibly because rare beneficial mutations become concentrated in the hub and so are less likely to be stochastically lost when rare, a phenomenon called drift loss.</p><p>Empirical evidence on the impact of topology on rates of adaptation is limited. In microbial evolution experiments where population sizes are typically very large, various forms of spatial structure usually slow down adaptation relative to a well-mixed condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miralles et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habets et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Habets et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perfeito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey, 2021</xref>). The one exception is a study where faster adaptation occurred in structured compared to unstructured populations, a result attributed to the ability of the structured population to explore higher fitness peaks in a rugged fitness landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nahum et al., 2015</xref>). The only study to evaluate the impact of topology per se on adaptation across a range of population sizes tracked an initially rare beneficial mutation introduced into one peripheral ‘leaf’ through both ‘star’ and well-mixed metapopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>). The mutation spread more rapidly through star metapopulations than well-mixed populations when migration rates were low (<italic>m</italic> &lt; 0.01%) and this difference could be exaggerated by reducing population sizes (from <italic>N ~</italic> 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml) and biasing migration from leaves towards the hub. These results are consistent with a mechanism for acceleration involving a reduced probability of drift loss in stars: beneficial mutations rising to high frequency in their introduced subpopulation become concentrated in the hub via migration, allowing them to spread rapidly to other leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Is acceleration possible under more prolonged and open-ended evolution, where mutations arise naturally at any location across the metapopulation and compete with each other for fixation through clonal interference? Evolutionary graph theory, which is grounded in a model of reproduction that generates local competition among individuals, suggests the answer depends on the extent of clonal interference associated with migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frean et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2023</xref>). Only when clonal interference is sufficiently low to allow single, initially rare beneficial mutations to gain access to the hub do we expect to see acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tkadlec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yagoobi and Traulsen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2023</xref>). To test this prediction, we tracked rates of adaptation of the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA14) in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin for approximately 100 generations in 4-patch star and well-mixed populations across a range of mutation supply rates. We manipulate mutation supply rates in each subpopulation by adjusting both the effective population size and migration rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). Each treatment combination is replicated eight times.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design for de novo evolution experiment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two topologies, star or well-mixed, constructed among four subpopulations.

Fitness, measured as both growth rate (<italic>r</italic>) and stationary phase density (<italic>K</italic>) relative to the ancestral strain, was faster in star metapopulations relative to well-mixed populations when effective population sizes were small (main effect of network, p = 0.06 and p &lt; 0.01 for relative <italic>r</italic> and <italic>K</italic>, respectively; effect sizes (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> for the difference between star and well-mixed treatments) <italic>r</italic> = 0.929, 95% CI: [−0.035 to 1.89]; <italic>K</italic> = 1.53, 95% CI: [0.586 to 2.47]), irrespective of migration rate (relative <italic>r</italic>: p = 0.73 and relative <italic>K</italic>: p = 0.97) and even after accounting for the removal of outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Larger metapopulations adapted faster than small ones, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orr, 2000</xref>), but there was no effect of topology on rates of fitness increase at large effective population sizes (main effect of network treatment for relative <italic>r</italic>: p = 0.95 and relative <italic>K</italic>: p = 0.60) across the two migration rates (relative <italic>r</italic>: p = 0.42 and relative <italic>K</italic>: p = 0.51). These results demonstrate that star topologies can accelerate adaptation by as much as 1.5x over that of well-mixed metapopulations when mutation supply is low but not high.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of adaptation in large metapopulations.</title><p>Fitness trajectories in large metapopulations connected by high and low migration rates (LPHM and LPLM).

Establishment times, being the time required to substitute a beneficial mutation that is destined to fix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frean et al., 2013</xref>), may also be faster in stars than well-mixed populations because beneficial mutants experience reduced clonal interference owing to the fact that leaf subpopulations in stars exchange migrants only with the hub whereas all subpopulations – leaves and hub – share migrants equally in a well-mixed metapopulation. Reduced clonal interference could allow beneficial mutants arising in a leaf both to fix more rapidly there and to seed other leaves via the hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuo et al., 2025</xref>). Adaptation could be further accelerated if reduced clonal interference in stars is accompanied by a lower probability of drift loss for rare beneficial mutants colonizing a new patch.</p><p>To evaluate these hypotheses, we first checked that clonal interference was in fact lower in stars than well-mixed metapopulations. We estimated the number and spectrum of mutations segregating at the end of our experiment by sequencing 24 evolved metapopulations (6 for each population size x topology combination). We achieved ~3000-fold sequencing depth and ~98.5% genome-wide coverage for each metapopulation which, after comparing the data with ancestral PA14 genomes (PA14 and PA14-LacZ), allowed us to detect all mutations segregating above ~5% frequency in each metapopulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the average number of mutations segregating in each treatment. The results indicate that while all metapopulations in our experiment evolve in the clonal interference regime, large populations harbour more mutations on average than small populations (two-way ANOVA, main effect population size, p = 0.09), and well-mixed metapopulations support more mutations than star populations at both population sizes (two-way ANOVA, main effect of network treatment, p = 0.11, effect size of the difference between star and well-mixed mean averaged over both population sizes –0.678, 95% CI: [−1.56 to 0.203]). While these effects are not formally significant at the conventional level (p &lt; 0.05), they reassure us that our experimental manipulations modulated the level of clonal interference in the expected directions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Number of mutational changes in each population size/network topology treatment combinations.</title><p>Shown are the mean number of mutational changes for each network topology treatment (star and well-mixed) under each population size (large and small).

If these beneficial mutants are also less likely to be lost to drift during colonization of a new patch, large effect beneficial mutants should be enriched in low population size stars where we see accelerated adaptation. To test this prediction, we collected 48 clones from the last timepoint of each of the evolved metapopulations and assayed stationary phase density at 24 hr, <italic>K</italic>, as a proxy for fitness in the selection medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Parallel evolution is often taken to be an indicator of strong selection acting in a particular locus, as it is unlikely that the same genes or mutations would fix repeatedly by chance alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orr, 2005</xref>). Equally, it could be due to preferential substitution caused by the reduced probability of drift loss, and so higher fixation probability, among the rarer class of larger effect beneficial mutations available to selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chevin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillespie, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kassen and Bataillon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher, 1930</xref>) together with the more rapid spread facilitated by reduced clonal interference. We tested this prediction by using our sequencing results to calculate the rate of repeated, or parallel, evolution for each mutated gene in our data set. We find that parallel evolution was higher in the small <italic>N</italic> star metapopulations compared with all others, an observation confirmed by the significant interaction between population size and network topology for three metrics of parallelism (p &lt; 0.05; see methods). Closer inspection reveals star and well-mixed topologies do not differ in the extent of parallelism in large metapopulations but they do for small metapopulations, stars showing significantly higher parallelism than their well-mixed counterparts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), a result also reflected by higher frequency of all mutations (those appearing repeatedly and as singletons) in small stars compared to the small well-mixed metapopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As there is little reason to suspect the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations available to selection differs systematically between star and well-mixed topologies for a given population size, the high levels of parallelism in the small <italic>N</italic> star must be associated with a higher fixation probability among the first mutations arising in the experiment. Given the over-representation of large effect beneficial mutants in small <italic>N</italic> star metapopulations, these results suggest accelerated adaptation is due to the combined effect of reduced clonal interference and large effect beneficial mutations having a higher probability of fixation because they avoid drift loss when rare in stars compared to well-mixed populations.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Population-level parallelism.</title><p>Difference in population-level parallelism between the two topologies for each effective population size.

Notable examples include the enrichment of <italic>mexS</italic> and <italic>gyrA</italic> mutations exclusively in small and large metapopulations, respectively (binomial test, p &lt; 0.005 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). We see the same pattern for putative non-resistance mutations as well: <italic>lasR</italic> and <italic>wspA</italic> being mutated in the large (binomial test, p &lt; 0.005 and p &lt; 0.05, for lasR and wspA, respectively) but not in the small metapopulations.

Additionally, it is notable that mutations in <italic>nfxB</italic> are present in all (six out of six) small star but only 50% (three out of six) in the small well-mixed metapopulations sequenced, although the difference is not statistically significant (binomial test, p = 0.08). Furthermore, the average frequency of resistance-conferring <italic>mexS</italic> and <italic>nfxB</italic> mutations is modestly higher in small stars relative to small well-mixed metapopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), although this effect is not formally significant (two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test p = 0.1585 and p = 0.2606, for <italic>nfxB</italic> and <italic>mexS</italic>, respectively, and p = 0.1729, Fisher’s method of combining multiple probabilities). This result, taken together with the observation that fewer mutations segregate in small stars compared to small well-mixed networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), lends further support to the idea that small stars lead to rapid enrichment of beneficial driver mutations.</p><p>Our genomic data is also consistent with the idea that mutation supply rate can bias the spectrum of mutations contributing to adaptation. Large populations with high mutation supply rates have access to a larger spectrum of mutations, and clonal interference during substitution can lead to preferential fixation of those with the largest fitness effects. Interestingly, however, there is little evidence that network topology itself biases the spectrum of mutations available to selection; rather, it is the preferential enrichment of large effect mutations that avoid drift loss in star metapopulations that governs the dynamics of molecular variation in these situations.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work provides direct, experimental evidence that the topology of connections in a metapopulation can alter the pace of adaptive evolution and the identity of the mutations responsible. Specifically, we have shown that small <italic>N</italic> star metapopulations, those characterized by satellite populations connected through a central hub, can accelerate adaptation over and above that observed in a well-mixed, fully connected setting. Acceleration is associated with an enrichment of large effect mutants and results in higher levels of gene-level parallelism compared to well-mixed populations of the same size. These results are consistent with an underlying mechanism involving the concentration of beneficial mutations in the hub by dispersal and facilitating their rapid spread to other leaves in the metapopulation. The contribution of reduced probability of drift loss and lower levels of clonal interference in accelerating adaptation is a topic that deserves further exploration.</p><p>That we observed acceleration in the small <italic>N</italic> stars is surprising because it does not fit with the two main models of reproduction used to track allele frequencies in metapopulations. The approach most common in population genetics, the Fisher–Wright model, assumes reproduction involves bulk replacement of parents by offspring in non-overlapping generations leading to global competition among individuals each generation. Metapopulation topology has little or no effect on fixation probabilities in this model, and the pace of adaptation is almost always fastest in well-mixed populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maruyama, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Slatkin, 1981</xref>). An alternative approach, evolutionary graph theory, is based on the Moran model of individual reproduction and death, which leads to overlapping generations and local competition among neighbouring individuals. Moran-based models show that stars can increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutants relative to a well-mixed population, although at the cost of longer fixation times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tkadlec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frean et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>). Our results show that both models fail to capture accurately the dynamics of adaptation on stars: in contrast to Fisher–Wright models, stars can adapt faster than well-mixed populations, whereas times to fixation appear to be much smaller than anticipated for the Moran process on graphs. Progress towards a general theory of adaptation in spatially structured populations will thus demand we rethink the central assumptions underpinning reproduction in both models.</p><p>Our results also bear on an old debate around how to appropriately conceptualize the role of spatial structure in adaptive evolution. One view, due to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher, 1930</xref>, effectively ignores spatial structure: selection across subpopulations is modelled as if it was occurring in a large, panmictic and freely recombining population, the fitness effect of any given allele being described by its average fitness improvement over the current wild type when tested against all possible genetic backgrounds from all subpopulations. An alternative view, attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wright, 1932</xref> and called the shifting balance model, treats spatial structure as an integral feature of adaptation: selection occurs independently in small, spatially separated subpopulations connected by migration. The fitness effect of an allele depends both on the genetic background in which it arises in a given subpopulation and on how effectively it outcompetes distinct beneficial mutants originating in other subpopulations. Our experimental results provide insight into the mechanisms driving this second phase of the shifting balance model, the competition among beneficial mutants derived from distinct subpopulations, by showing how, when mutation supply rates are low, the combined effects of reduced clonal interference and higher probability of avoiding drift loss can allow beneficial mutants to spread rapidly through a metapopulation.</p><p>How common is accelerated adaptation on star-like structures in more natural systems? This question remains difficult to answer. Many microbial communities occupy environments such as soil or hosts that are spatially structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dang and Lovell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraemer and Boynton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Bayona and Comstock, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stacy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hajishengallis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Werner et al., 2014</xref>), and some studies have shown that spatial structure following population bottlenecks imposed during host dissociation or biofilm dispersal can have profoundly different outcomes depending on the spatial structure of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steenackers et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that we only observed acceleration at the smallest population sizes in our experiment (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> ~10<sup>5</sup> individuals) suggests there could be an upper threshold of population size above which acceleration is unlikely to be observed. Nevertheless, the metapopulation structure of many large organisms may resemble that of a star, for example when range edge populations are sparse compared to the more abundant centre or due to habitat fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sagarin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pennington et al., 2021</xref>). If so, star topologies could be an explanation for the rapid spread of invasive species. Moreover, many scale-free networks, which often characterize contact networks in epidemiology, contain sub-structures resembling stars and are known to be weak amplifiers of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leventhal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>). It is not inconceivable that metapopulation structures such as the star play a more important role in adaptive evolution than has been recognized up to now.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microbial strains and conditions</title><p>For all experiments, clonal populations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 14 (PA14) and PA14:<italic>lacZ</italic>, isogenic to PA14 except with an insertion in the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene, respectively, were used.

Genomic DNA was then extracted from each metapopulation mix for whole-genome sequencing using the QIAGEN DNeasy UltraClean 96 Microbial kit, following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by Genome Quebec at McGill University on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, using paired-end sequencing of 2 × 150 base-pair reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Processing of genomic data and variant calling</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing of 24 metapopulations yielded a total of ~ 400 Gb of raw data, with a median depth of 3622.3-fold and an average of 98.5% genome coverage. Sequencing reads were first quality checked by generating FastQC reports using FastQC version 0.11.9 and quality trimmed using Trimmomatic version 0.39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>), with the command SLIDINGWINDOW:5:20 MINLEN:20 LEADING:5 TRAILING:5 CROP:140 HEADCROP:10. Variants were called using Breseq version 0.36.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deatherage and Barrick, 2014</xref>) a tool specifically designed for detecting mutations in microbial genomes, with default parameters (detection limit of 5%) and -p flag for detecting polymorphisms in the sequenced metapopulations. Reads were aligned to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reference genome UCBPP-PA14 – assembly GCF_000014625.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winsor et al., 2016</xref>). We subsequently discarded variants common across both ancestral strains (PA14 and PA14:<italic>lacZ</italic>) and all evolved populations using the gdtools module of breseq to identify only the mutations that arose over the course of the selection experiment. We found no evidence of cross-contamination in our sequenced metapopulations (each even numbered replicate had the <italic>lacZ</italic> insertion which was absent in the odd numbered replicates). Also, none of the metapopulations harboured any mutations in the genes that have been linked to increased mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliver and Mena, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiegand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanders et al., 2006</xref>) in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, so we did not have to discard any sequenced genomes from further downstream analyses. All genomic analyses were performed on Compute Canada high performance computing platform using a custom bash script for bioinformatic workflow (see data availability section for details). Breseq output files with information on genetic changes were processed further for performing statistical tests and generating plots in R statistical computing software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.2.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">R Core Team, 2022</xref>).</p><p>We modelled the rate of change in fitness (both relative growth rate and carrying capacity) through time separately for each population size treatment using a linear mixed model (lmer) with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>), migration rate and network topology as fixed factors, and a random intercept for individual replicate population to account for resampling across time (repeated measures). Time was considered to be a second order polynomial regressor in our model since the trajectories were not linear. The distribution of fitness effects among the beneficial mutants isolated from the end-point metapopulations was compared between the network topologies using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test paired with a resampling procedure (10,000 permutations).</p><p>To quantify gene-level parallelism in our experiment, we focused on genes reaching or exceeding a frequency of 8% and excluded synonymous mutations under the assumption they are selectively neutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, since ~97% synonymous mutations reached the frequency of ~8% or less in our experiment). Since there is no broadly accepted metric for quantifying gene-level parallelism, we use three distinct measures: variance in dispersion of Euclidean distances between populations, Jaccard distance (Jdist = 1 − Jaccard index, which describes the likelihood that the same gene is mutated in two independent populations) and observed repeatability relative to expectation under randomness using the hypergeometric distribution (<italic>C</italic>-score) (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schick et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, a low value for dispersion, a low Jaccard distance, and a high <italic>C</italic>-score indicates a high degree of parallelism and vice versa.</p><p>For dispersion, we calculated the mean distance between a population and the corresponding population or network topology treatment centroid, following a principal component analysis on a Euclidean distance matrix using the vegdist function from the vegan package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oksanen et al., 2024</xref>). The distance is measured as the population and network topology level genetic variance with larger mean dispersion signifying more divergent genetic changes and therefore less parallelism.</p><p>For the Jaccard distance measure, we calculated the Jaccard measure from the vegdist function from the vegan package in R as the dissimilarity between all pairs of populations within a treatment (effective population size or network topology) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schick et al., 2022</xref>). Jaccard distance is the complement to Jaccard index and describes the likelihood that the same gene is mutated in two independent populations (here metapopulations). Jaccard distance can range 0–1: zero being two samples are exactly alike and one being two samples are completely different. We reported the difference between the network topology means (estimated difference = star − well-mixed, averaged over samples) for each effective population size treatment. For the <italic>J</italic>-distance, a positive difference denotes higher parallelism for well-mixed and negative difference means higher parallelism for the star topology.</p><p>Our last measure of repeatability is the <italic>C</italic>-score, which uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the deviation between the observed amount of parallelism and the expectation under random gene use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yeaman et al., 2018</xref>). The magnitude of the <italic>C</italic>-score represents the magnitude of the deviation, larger <italic>C</italic>-scores signifying higher repeatability and therefore more parallelism. As for the Jaccard distance, we report the differences between the <italic>C</italic>-score means for each treatment combination. A positive difference denotes higher parallelism for a star, and a negative difference means higher parallelism for the well-mixed topology.</p><p>To determine the significance of each metric, we first performed a two-way ANOVA with the metric (Euclidean distance, Jaccard distance, or <italic>C</italic>-score) as the response variable and effective population size and network topology and their interactions as explanatory variables. We followed up any significant interaction between effective population size and network topology by measuring the difference in gene-level parallelism between the two topologies for each effective population size (significance threshold set at p &lt; 0.05 for all three metrics) using the emmeans package from R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lenth, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, to determine the significance of both Jaccard and <italic>C</italic>-score metrics, we performed a permutation test by randomizing population size and network topology treatment labels (number of permutations  = 10,000) and calculating a null distribution of <italic>F</italic>-values. We complemented this analysis by calculating the probability (out of the total number of permutations) of the observed difference between the star and the well-mixed topologies being higher (<italic>C</italic>-score) or lower (<italic>J</italic>-distance) than the randomized estimated difference between the topologies, for each effective population size.</p><p>Parallelism at the gene level was defined as the proportion of populations with mutations in that gene, both globally for effective population size and network topology and within all of the four treatment combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schick et al., 2022</xref>). To test for significance, we calculated the probability of our observed results against the null hypothesis that gene use was random, using the binomial distribution with the number of metapopulations as the number of trials, number of times a gene was mutated as the number of successes, and proportion of total metapopulations across all treatments with a mutation in that gene as the probability of success. From this, if the probability of an observation was &lt;0.05, we considered that gene to be either effective population size or network topology treatment specific.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Alan Moses as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all found this work to be interesting, and agree that the experiments will represent a valuable contribution to the literature. However, there is some disagreement about the relationship to prior theory, along with some concerns about methods and conclusions. The authors should consider the following essential points in a revision:</p><p>1) Please consider the comments raised by reviewer 1 in point 1.1 and 2.3. Similar points are raised by the other two reviewers. There is some concern that the acceleration of adaptation is relatively weak and only observed at a single population size, and relies on a small number of potential outlier points. These effects may be real but the authors should consider and comment on the statistical points raised by the reviewer.</p><p>2) Reviewer 1 suggests substantial theoretical or computational work. Reviewer 3 also makes related suggestions. The authors will probably feel that this is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, which is a reasonable position. However, some discussion of the general differences between their setup and earlier theory along with an intuitive description of potential implications of these differences would be useful. The authors could also comment on potential directions for future theory along these lines in the discussion, if they wish.</p><p>3) The authors should expand their analysis of parallelism as suggested by reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>4) The point raised by reviewer 1 in point 3.1 is a significant issue that complicates the interpretation of the results. This is not reasonably addressable in a revision but this caveat should at least be acknowledged by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors carry out a short-term evolution experiment in populations with two distinct geographic structures, the &quot;star&quot; topology (STAR), and the &quot;well-mixed&quot; control (WM). The main result presented in Figures 2 and 3 is that the STAR populations adapt on average faster than the WM populations when the population size is &quot;small&quot; (~10^5) but not &quot;large&quot; (~10^6). The authors rationalize this surprising observation in terms of an increased probability of establishment of new beneficial mutations in the hub deme.</p><p>The question of how geographic structure affects evolutionary dynamics is a classic one in theoretical population genetics. The prediction of the standard theory is that subdivision should slow down adaptation (at least on short time scales) because it slows down the spread of adaptive mutations compared to well-mixed populations. However, recent developments in evolutionary graph theory (EGT) challenge some of the classical results. In particular, EGT shows that certain geographic structures, notably the star topology, can increase the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations (albeit at the cost of longer fixation times), while other structures can do the opposite.</p><p>However, the classical theory and EGT operate under different assumptions, and it is not entirely clear whether the predictions of EGT might hold at least to some extent in meta-population context. This is an interesting theoretical problem and may be important for our understanding of populations in nature. The authors chose to approach it experimentally, in the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, letting it adapt to sublethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin for about 100 generations. The experiments and analyses overall are reasonable, although I have some methodological concerns discussed below. The main observation, if it holds, is interesting and worth reporting.</p><p>Concerns</p><p>I have many concerns with the present version of the manuscript. While none of them individually are fatal, the paper is substantially weakened by their collective weight. Since they are all roughly equally serious, I organized them by type rather than severity.</p><p>1. Conceptual</p><p>1.1. The relevance of the main result for the field is very much in doubt for the following reasons. (a) The observed effect of the geographic structure on the rate of adaptation is rather weak (less than 10%), (b) it is observed only for one population size, (c) statistical significance is established only for carrying capacity but not growth rate, and (d) the variance in the rate of adaptation across populations may not have been estimated very accurately from just 8 replicates, which could potentially further undermine the statistical significance (see point 2.3 below). Furthermore, (e) the supporting arguments presented in Figures 4-6 are not particularly convincing (see point 2 below). This concern could be to some extent alleviated if there was a strong theoretical support for the observations. But the theory in this regime is lacking.</p><p>1.2. The absence of a theory makes the interpretation of observations difficult. The authors rely heavily on their previous paper (Ref. 26) where they showed that the star topology transiently accelerates the spread of an adapted mutant through a metapopulation. Although I take a bit of an issue with how the authors describe this effect (see below), overall that result makes sense and is almost certainly real. However, it is unclear to me whether and how this effect (which holds for an isolated beneficial mutant) would translate to the rate of adaptation in the strong clonal interference regime (which is where the experiments are carried out). Indeed, when new mutations continuously enter the population, each new most-fit class in the hub node is populated by both new mutations and migrants from peripheral nodes. New mutations likely weaken the acceleration of establishment of the most-fit class afforded by the star topology. While working out the analytical theory would most certainly constitute its own major project, it is possible to address this concern to some extent with simulations, similar to how the authors have done it in Ref. 26.</p><p>I think the simplest model to consider is the one by Desai and Fisher (Genetics 2007), though it may not be sufficient. In any case, a model like that can be simulated with selection coefficients, mutation rates and population sizes spanning the range of those realized in the experiments. I would also strongly encourage the authors to vary the number of peripheral nodes because there are good reasons to expect that it would make the effect stronger. It would then be good to generate theoretical predictions for Figures 2-5. Even if the simulations do not immediately reveal the precise mechanism of acceleration, they would (a) establish that the effect is real and is not caused by some experimental artifacts (see point 3 below); (b) show the range of effect sizes; and (c) outline the parameter range where the effect may be observable.</p><p>2. Evidence</p><p>2.1. LL 161-175. Figure 5 shows that WM populations have a larger number of mutations than STAR populations. I don't know whether this supports or contradicts the authors' hypothesis that the star topology &quot;reduces the probability of drift loss&quot;. The authors should either explicitly discuss their expectation here or provide the results of simulations to motivate this experiment.</p><p>2.2. LL 176-198. Similar to above, it is unclear to me why we should expect more parallel evolution at the meta-population level in STAR vs WM populations. Is it possible that the results in Table 1 are just a consequence of the result in Figure 5? In other words, suppose we have two types of populations, such that populations of type 1 sample K1 mutations from some pool and populations of type 2 sample K2 mutations from the same pool. Will there be a systematic difference in parallelism between these two types if K1 ≠ K2? Does the observed difference go in the same or opposite direction from the one predicted by this simple null model?</p><p>To more intuitively understand where the difference between the parallelism statistics reported in Table 1 comes from, in addition to Figure 5, it might also be helpful to plot the frequencies of all genes that have parallel mutations + the group of all singleton mutations (for each population type separately). So, similar to Figure S3 but for all mutations and grouped by population type rather than mutated gene.</p><p>2.3. Figure 3. Both K plots (SPHM and SPLM) have one outlier each. If these outliers are removed, the blue and red curves would become more similar. Since these plots represent the main statistically significant result, I am quite concerned that significance here may be driven by these outliers. Have the authors tested whether their results remain significant if they remove the outliers? The corresponding r plots also have one outlier each. Are the same SPHM and SPLM populations responsible for both outliers in r and K? How would removing these populations change Figures 4-6?</p><p>By the same token, I am also worried about the fact that the main difference between the small STAR and WM populations is in the carrying capacity but not in growth rate, even though these populations spend most of the time growing (see point 3.1 below). This is counter to my expectations. Do the authors have a rationalization of this?</p><p>2.4 Figure 4. Why are the K values so much lower here than in Figures 2 and 3? Is it really the case that polymorphic evolved populations reach much lower carrying capacities than individual clones sampled from them? This is not impossible of course, but the effect is huge, and this surprising fact is not mentioned anywhere. Some explanation is needed.</p><p>3. Experimental issues</p><p>3.1. LL 639-648. I am quite concerned about the fact that large populations go through 6.67 divisions between transfers whereas small populations go through 13.28 divisions. This difference implies that large populations spend more time in starvation compared to small populations, which almost certainly alters the selection pressures they experience. The Petrov lab has demonstrated such effects very clearly in yeast. If the situation is similar in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, small and large populations are probably not directly comparable. This would not necessarily undermine the central claims of the paper but would significantly affect the interpretation of Figure 6 and discussion on LL 237-240.</p><p>3.2. Figures 2 and 3. Large populations show a very consistent big jump in the first time interval (Figure 2) but this is not the case for small populations (Figure 3). Could this jump be due to physiological adaptation? If so, it may be necessary to exclude this time point from the analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an exciting paper that demonstrates how the structure of spatial structure can quantitatively affect evolutionary responses to selection. The authors demonstrate that the evolutionary effects of different spatial structures are mediated by population size. These ideas have a long history in evolutionary theory, but have only undergone limited experimental testing. The combination of phenotypic and genotypic assays for the selected populations provides a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary responses. A more detailed description of the evolutionary responses would strengthen their conclusions and provide a broader context for evaluating their results.</p><p>This is an interesting experiment with complicated results. Looking first at the main results, in Figure 2 there are no major differences in evolutionary responses over 15 days of culturing in &quot;large&quot; populations, regardless of the topology. Large is 10^7 CFU per ml. The phenotypic traits measured do not directly map to competitive fitness, although growth rate is typically regarded as a good proxy. Carrying capacity is much more complicated, although it can be viewed as a measure of absolute fitness. In Figure 3, we see evidence of a difference between the two treatments (WM vs Star), with Star appearing to have a faster response than WM.</p><p>Some issues with the experimental results and analysis. 1. Adaptation is faster in larger populations, regardless of the trait and topology, than in smaller populations, but this does not appear to be mentioned in the manuscript when discussing the results (lines 130 – 198). 2. The analysis as presented appears to be in chunks (for each population size treatment), rather than an overall analysis with subsequent a priori tests. The approach in the paper could inflate p-values and prevents direct comparisons among treatments (small vs. large populations). 3. Not comparing the rate of evolutionary responses in the small and large populations necessarily avoids discussion of the rapid reduction in the rate of adaptation observed in the large populations. 4. Given the focus on phenotypic parallelism among the populations, the focus exclusively on genetic parallelism is a missed opportunity. 5. The graphs in figures 2 and 3 appear not to leverage the more sophisticated statistical analysis of populations, which is unfortunate and provides a less clear perspective of the data.</p><p>Having said that, the experiments are interesting. The results, as presented, provide an overly biased view of the actual response to selection. In addition, the complete absence of any mention of Wright's perspective on adaptation in small populations is surprising.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses a central question in evolutionary biology: how does the spatial structure of a population influence the rate of adaptation? The authors use evolution experiments with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> populations to test the effects of two contrasting network topologies, a well-mixed structure and a star-shaped metapopulation, under controlled migration and selection conditions. The paper builds on prior work from the group done in the single mutation limit and also prior theoretical predictions that star-like structures can increase the probability of mutant fixation by preserving beneficial mutations through a hub population.</p><p>Experimental design is robust, with multiple replicates across four metapopulations per topology and different mutation supply regimes (controlled via population size). Phenotypic measurements of fitness over time, along with sequencing at the endpoint, provide complementary evidence of rates of adaptation for star topologies. The finding that the effect disappears in high-mutation supply regimes (larger populations) also supports prior theoretical results on rates of evolution and clonal interference in these topologies (see Kuo, Hu and Carja, 2025).</p><p>Genomic analyses further strengthen the paper's claims, showing both a reduced diversity of mutations (consistent with clonal interference reduction) and a high rate of parallel evolution in the star topology. However, some key differences in fitness improvement (e.g., in growth rate) are only marginally significant, and the implications of this should be more explicitly discussed.</p><p>While this proof of concept for star topologies is important, these structures are nonetheless highly artificial. The broader applicability of the results, beyond this experimental setup is discussed briefly, but could be elaborated further. Overall, the work provides validation that population structure is not merely a complicating detail, but can play a key role in shaping evolutionary outcome.</p><p>Some recommendations I have:</p><p>1. I would cite recent work in the multi-mutational regime that is more relevant than the theoretical results the authors reference, particularly because it theoretically supports their claims and addressed the clonal interference scenario (see their Figure 6 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40027632/)</p><p>2. I would try to explain the connection and differences between mutation rate and migration rate in the experiments. Mutation supply rate is defined as &quot;the product of population size, N, and mutation rate, m&quot; (line 95), but the authors later state that supply rates are affected by &quot;population size and migration rate&quot; (line 127) and that is a bit confusing for a reader.</p><p>3. How are initial populations distributed, specifically, what fraction of mutant and wild-type cells are present in leaves versus hub at the start of experiments. Does it matter for outcome?</p><p>4. In cases where the p-values are marginal (e.g., growth rate differences between treatments), I would consider including effect sizes or confidence intervals.</p><p>5. Some additional discussion on how these artificial topologies nonetheless can inform on more realistic biological scenarios would be appreciated by a reader.</p><p>Thank you for allowing me to read about this great work!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107189.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all found this work to be interesting, and agree that the experiments will represent a valuable contribution to the literature. However, there is some disagreement about the relationship to prior theory, along with some concerns about methods and conclusions. The authors should consider the following essential points in a revision:</p><p>1) Please consider the comments raised by reviewer 1 in point 1.1 and 2.3. Similar points are raised by the other two reviewers. There is some concern that the acceleration of adaptation is relatively weak and only observed at a single population size, and relies on a small number of potential outlier points. These effects may be real but the authors should consider and comment on the statistical points raised by the reviewer.</p></disp-quote><p>The issue of effect sizes is an important one that we address more fulsomely in our responses below. Briefly: we have followed the suggestion of reviewer 3 and included effect sizes to be clearer about how much acceleration is happening. We find that, for small populations, stars can accelerate adaptation by (when considering <italic>K</italic> as our fitness proxy) as much as 1.5x that of the well-mixed, fully connected metapopulation. The effect is modest but real: dropping outliers and re-running our analyses does not change our results. Moreover, the fact that we only see acceleration at one population size (the smaller one) is consistent with expectations stemming from evolutionary graph theory. This is biologically interesting because it suggests acceleration, if and when we see it in the ‘real’ world, is a phenomenon that is associated with small populations such as in the initial stages of an infectious disease outbreak or at range edges for species expanding into new habitat. Our work therefore serves to clarify the conditions under which we expect to see topology impacting rates of adaptation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer 1 suggests substantial theoretical or computational work. Reviewer 3 also makes related suggestions. The authors will probably feel that this is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, which is a reasonable position. However, some discussion of the general differences between their setup and earlier theory along with an intuitive description of potential implications of these differences would be useful. The authors could also comment on potential directions for future theory along these lines in the discussion, if they wish.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we feel a full theoretical treatment is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. That said, we have made a number of revisions in response to the reviewer’s suggestions to better characterize existing theory and paths forward. We acknowledge, moreover, that our original explanation – reduced probability of drift loss – is probably not sufficient on its own to explain acceleration and now offer a second, not mutually exclusive, explanation: lower levels of clonal interference in stars relative to well-mixed metapopulations can decrease time to establishment for beneficial mutations. Exploring these mechanisms in a full theoretical treatment is well beyond the scope of our current manuscript. For the moment, we are content to have drawn attention to acceleration as a real, biological phenomenon grounded in experimental evidence. Hopefully our results spur further theoretical work in this exciting area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should expand their analysis of parallelism as suggested by reviewers 1 and 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this by revising our mechanistic explanations to include the clonal interference effect. Please see our responses to reviewers for further explanation. We remain puzzled by reviewer 2’s request for further discussion of phenotypic parallelism as, to our thinking, it is parallelism (as measured by the variance in our measures of fitness among replicate evolving metapopulations) that is the main effect being tested in our analyses. As already explained, this effect does seem to be real and we have now quantified it by providing effect sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The point raised by reviewer 1 in point 3.1 is a significant issue that complicates the interpretation of the results. This is not reasonably addressable in a revision but this caveat should at least be acknowledged by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The point the reviewer makes here is that large and small populations spend different amount of times in stationary phase, and so different durations of starvation. The implication is that selection might act differently in large and small populations, so comparing them may not be legitimate. While this may be the case, the available evidence suggests otherwise: the same genes associated with starvation are mutated in both conditions. Moreover, in our experience, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations probably spend most of a 24 hr growth cycle in stationary phase for both population sizes so any selective differences in starvation duration is not likely to be strong. Finally, we note that the time in stationary phase is the same for stars and well-mixed populations at a given population size, so contrasts in rates of adaptation between metapopulation topologies at the same population size remain legitimate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors carry out a short-term evolution experiment in populations with two distinct geographic structures, the &quot;star&quot; topology (STAR), and the &quot;well-mixed&quot; control (WM). The main result presented in Figures 2 and 3 is that the STAR populations adapt on average faster than the WM populations when the population size is &quot;small&quot; (~10^5) but not &quot;large&quot; (~10^6). The authors rationalize this surprising observation in terms of an increased probability of establishment of new beneficial mutations in the hub deme.</p><p>The question of how geographic structure affects evolutionary dynamics is a classic one in theoretical population genetics. The prediction of the standard theory is that subdivision should slow down adaptation (at least on short time scales) because it slows down the spread of adaptive mutations compared to well-mixed populations. However, recent developments in evolutionary graph theory (EGT) challenge some of the classical results. In particular, EGT shows that certain geographic structures, notably the star topology, can increase the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations (albeit at the cost of longer fixation times), while other structures can do the opposite.</p><p>However, the classical theory and EGT operate under different assumptions, and it is not entirely clear whether the predictions of EGT might hold at least to some extent in meta-population context. This is an interesting theoretical problem and may be important for our understanding of populations in nature. The authors chose to approach it experimentally, in the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, letting it adapt to sublethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin for about 100 generations. The experiments and analyses overall are reasonable, although I have some methodological concerns discussed below.

But the theory in this regime is lacking.</p></disp-quote><list list-type="alpha-lower" id="list1"><list-item><p>The reviewer raises concern over whether the effect size associated with acceleration is real. We believe it is, as the treatment effect remains statistically significant even after removing outliers (more detailed responses, including re-analysis, provided in response to 2.3 below). To aid in interpretation we also now report effect sizes following the suggestion of reviewer 3. Even a modest effect size is biologically interesting because: (i) it is in the opposite direction to that expected from classic theory; and (ii) small effects on rates of adaptation in the short term of 100 generations (as in our experiment) can lead to large changes in fitness over the long run.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The reviewer questions our results because acceleration is observed only in small populations. We respectfully point out: (i) acceleration at small population sizes is consistent with one of our proposed mechanisms – the avoidance of drift loss – and in tune with the predictions of EGT; (ii) our observations clarify the conditions under which acceleration is expected to be observed and inform future models. That acceleration was only observed in small populations therefore does not undermine the biological significance of our work. Rather, it points to where we might see acceleration happening in the real world. Small range edge populations, for example, may be more likely to experience acceleration than an equivalently spatially structured metapopulation in the range center.</p></list-item><list-item><p>That only carrying capacity rather than growth rate shows a significant effect in our study also does not undermine our results.

Since our experiment was conducted on a 24 hr transfer schedule and the ancestor completes exponential growth in 6-8 hrs, the populations spend the bulk of their time (16-18 hrs) in stationary phase.

The absence of a theory makes the interpretation of observations difficult. The authors rely heavily on their previous paper (Ref. 26) where they showed that the star topology transiently accelerates the spread of an adapted mutant through a metapopulation. Although I take a bit of an issue with how the authors describe this effect (see below), overall that result makes sense and is almost certainly real. However, it is unclear to me whether and how this effect (which holds for an isolated beneficial mutant) would translate to the rate of adaptation in the strong clonal interference regime (which is where the experiments are carried out). Indeed, when new mutations continuously enter the population, each new most-fit class in the hub node is populated by both new mutations and migrants from peripheral nodes. New mutations likely weaken the acceleration of establishment of the most-fit class afforded by the star topology. While working out the analytical theory would most certainly constitute its own major project, it is possible to address this concern to some extent with simulations, similar to how the authors have done it in Ref. 26.</p><p>I think the simplest model to consider is the one by Desai and Fisher (Genetics 2007), though it may not be sufficient. In any case, a model like that can be simulated with selection coefficients, mutation rates and population sizes spanning the range of those realized in the experiments. I would also strongly encourage the authors to vary the number of peripheral nodes because there are good reasons to expect that it would make the effect stronger. It would then be good to generate theoretical predictions for Figures 2-5. Even if the simulations do not immediately reveal the precise mechanism of acceleration, they would (a) establish that the effect is real and is not caused by some experimental artifacts (see point 3 below); (b) show the range of effect sizes; and (c) outline the parameter range where the effect may be observable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful comments and agree with them that the theory deserves more attention. As will be evident from our responses below, such an effort is well beyond the scope of our current manuscript and so we will defer a complete treatment to another paper.</p><p>That said, the reviewer’s comments have caused us to consider a second explanation in addition to the avoidance of drift loss for our results. Acceleration could also conceivably be due to reduced clonal interference in stars relative to fully-connected populations. Clonal interference will be present everywhere in a fully-connected metapopulation. In a star, however, leaf subpopulations do not exchange migrants with each other (only with the hub) so clonal interference will be lower in the leaves relative to that observed in the fully-connected case. This means a beneficial mutation arising in the leaf of the star – especially when population sizes are small – could fix more rapidly and so be more likely to seed the hub (and as a consequence the rest of the population), even if the likelihood of drift loss doesn’t change. If reduced clonal interference is the cause of acceleration, then we would expect to see higher rates of acceleration with lower population sizes, as we do, because clonal interference will be lower on average in leaves at small population sizes.</p><p>We note that it is conceivable that these two explanations – reduced clonal interference in the leaves and reduced probability of drift loss in the hub – could work in concert. A more sophisticated theoretical study could be helpful in teasing these effects apart. That said, we have now amended our text to reflect this alternative interpretation and highlighted the need for theory to help decide whether these mechanisms are competing or complementary. Doing so will also shed light, as the reviewer suggests, on the range of effect sizes and parameter space in which acceleration occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This is counter to my expectations. Do the authors have a rationalization of this?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in response to point 1.1, the phenotypic target of selection is of less interest than the fitness differences they confer. That said, two additional points are relevant:</p><list list-type="order" id="list2"><list-item><p>It is not, in fact, true that these populations spend most of their time growing. In our experience, these populations typically reach stationary phase (ie, carrying capacity) after 6-8 hrs of growth. On a 24-hour transfer protocol the bulk of their time is spent near carrying capacity, which could explain why carrying capacity showed the strongest response to selection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We note further that our estimates of the effect for <italic>r</italic> are close to formally significant at the p&lt;0.05 level, even after removing the outlier strains. It is possible that since our ancestral strain (PA14) has a propensity to produce biofilms (and we find putative mutations upregulating biofilm formation in the c-GMP pathway in our evolved metapopulations), our estimates of OD in exponential phase are more variable than they might otherwise be, which could explain why the statistical tests are close to but not quite significant. We note further that the direction of change in <italic>r</italic> and <italic>K</italic> is positively correlated (and quite strong, being above 0.82 in all cases, suggesting with a bit more replication we would see a statistically significant effect on <italic>r</italic>, in addition to the convincing effect we see for <italic>K</italic>).</p></list-item></list><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107189-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The facet labels are different days.

Experimental issues3.1. LL 639-648. I am quite concerned about the fact that large populations go through 6.67 divisions between transfers whereas small populations go through 13.28 divisions. This difference implies that large populations spend more time in starvation compared to small populations, which almost certainly alters the selection pressures they experience. The Petrov lab has demonstrated such effects very clearly in yeast. If the situation is similar in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, small and large populations are probably not directly comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree (and have noted the lack of comparability in our response to reviewer 2, who asked for more discussion on how population size impacts rates of adaptation). As our main focus is in comparing the effect of topology on rates of adaptation we elected to focus attention on contrasts between topology at a given population size. Thus, even if the effects of starvation were more severe in the large populations than in the small ones, they would have been experienced in the same way by both topologies at a given population size. Additionally, a recent study shows that in LB (the rich laboratory media that we use in our study) <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> can maintain viable cells from 10^10 to 10^11 cfu/ml from 24 to 72 hours (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11504098/). Since, we bottlenecked every 24 hours, we can rule out any confounding effect of prolonged starvation on PA14 evolved in the large metapopulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This would not necessarily undermine the central claims of the paper but would significantly affect the interpretation of Figure 6 and discussion on LL 237-240.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not entirely clear to us how different times spent in starvation mode at different population sizes would impact the interpretation of Figure 6. While there are some clear examples that a handful of mutations are differentially selected in large and small populations, these are not obviously associated with adaptation to starvation conditions. PA14 is expected to adapt to starvation by biofilm dispersal, stringent response, metabolic shifts and changes in gene expression. This would mean decreased levels of c-di-GMP, higher (p)ppGpp alarmone and virulence factors etc. We uncover various genes that modulate the levels of c-di-GMP and virulence factors mutated in both large and small metapopulations (wspF/R/A, morA, pilB/D/F) without any population size specific occurrence. This reinforces that different lengths of time spent in starvation likely does not confound the interpretation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2. Figures 2 and 3. Large populations show a very consistent big jump in the first time interval (Figure 2) but this is not the case for small populations (Figure 3). Could this jump be due to physiological adaptation? If so, it may be necessary to exclude this time point from the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that excluding this early time point from the analysis is necessary. Our main interest is in contrasting the effects of topology at a given population size, so the comparison of fitness dynamics between large and small populations is not directly relevant to our main conclusions.</p><p>That said, while we cannot definitively rule out physiological adaptation as the cause of the jump in fitness in large populations (because we haven’t sequenced this early time point) we note that this explanation seems unlikely. Large populations will have more access to large-effect beneficial mutations early in the experiment than small populations, which readily explains this early jump in fitness. Consistent with this, we show that the large metapopulations in our experiment often fix gyrA mutations that previous work (Melnyk mSphere 2: e00158-17, 2017) showed results in large changes in resistance and, based on our previous measurements, are more advantageous than other ciprofloxacin resistant mutations at ~40ng/ml ciprofloxacin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):This is an exciting paper that demonstrates how the structure of spatial structure can quantitatively affect evolutionary responses to selection. The authors demonstrate that the evolutionary effects of different spatial structures are mediated by population size. These ideas have a long history in evolutionary theory, but have only undergone limited experimental testing. The combination of phenotypic and genotypic assays for the selected populations provides a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary responses. A more detailed description of the evolutionary responses would strengthen their conclusions and provide a broader context for evaluating their results.</p><p>This is an interesting experiment with complicated results. Looking first at the main results, in Figure 2 there are no major differences in evolutionary responses over 15 days of culturing in &quot;large&quot; populations, regardless of the topology. Large is 10^7 CFU per ml. The phenotypic traits measured do not directly map to competitive fitness, although growth rate is typically regarded as a good proxy. Carrying capacity is much more complicated, although it can be viewed as a measure of absolute fitness. In Figure 3, we see evidence of a difference between the two treatments (WM vs Star), with Star appearing to have a faster response than WM.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to reviewer #1 regarding the relationship between growth rate and carrying capacity as components of fitness in the context of our experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some issues with the experimental results and analysis.</p><p>1. Adaptation is faster in larger populations, regardless of the trait and topology, than in smaller populations, but this does not appear to be mentioned in the manuscript when discussing the results (lines 130 – 198).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this. We chose to emphasize the role of topology rather than population size as the former is less well studied and understood than the latter. Moreover, for reasons articulated in response to point 2 below, a formal comparison across population size is probably not appropriate. That said, we now note the population size effect on lines 145-146.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The analysis as presented appears to be in chunks (for each population size treatment), rather than an overall analysis with subsequent a priori tests. The approach in the paper could inflate p-values and prevents direct comparisons among treatments (small vs. large populations).</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to point 1 above regarding our focus on topology rather than population size. We note that including population size in a complete analysis reveals a large main effect of population size, as expected, and, reassuringly, does not otherwise change our results.

Given the focus on phenotypic parallelism among the populations, the focus exclusively on genetic parallelism is a missed opportunity.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is not clear to us. What, specifically, does the reviewer mean by phenotypic parallelism, and what opportunity is being missed? Phenotypic parallelism at the level of fitness is almost always very high (Figure 3, Bailey <italic>et al.</italic> 2015, https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/6/1436/1070729) and our results are no exception. We focus on gene-level parallelism because it is central to understanding the genetic causes and repeatability of adaptation (see Bailey <italic>et al.</italic> 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201600176).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The graphs in figures 2 and 3 appear not to leverage the more sophisticated statistical analysis of populations, which is unfortunate and provides a less clear perspective of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is also unclear. Our results very clearly show a statistically significant difference in rates of adaptation across treatments so it is unclear what additional tests might accomplish. However, we have now shown even with population size as an additional fixed factor the effect of network topology remains statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). We welcome any suggestions for a specific test the reviewer thinks is more appropriate to ascertain our interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Having said that, the experiments are interesting. The results, as presented, provide an overly biased view of the actual response to selection. In addition, the complete absence of any mention of Wright's perspective on adaptation in small populations is surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased the reviewer found our work interesting. Thank you for pointing out the relevance of our work to Wright’s shifting landscape models of adaptation. We have now included a brief description of how our work relates to this model in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):This manuscript addresses a central question in evolutionary biology: how does the spatial structure of a population influence the rate of adaptation? The authors use evolution experiments with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> populations to test the effects of two contrasting network topologies, a well-mixed structure and a star-shaped metapopulation, under controlled migration and selection conditions. The paper builds on prior work from the group done in the single mutation limit and also prior theoretical predictions that star-like structures can increase the probability of mutant fixation by preserving beneficial mutations through a hub population.Experimental design is robust, with multiple replicates across four metapopulations per topology and different mutation supply regimes (controlled via population size). Phenotypic measurements of fitness over time, along with sequencing at the endpoint, provide complementary evidence of rates of adaptation for star topologies. The finding that the effect disappears in high-mutation supply regimes (larger populations) also supports prior theoretical results on rates of evolution and clonal interference in these topologies (see Kuo, Hu and Carja, 2025).</p><p>Genomic analyses further strengthen the paper's claims, showing both a reduced diversity of mutations (consistent with clonal interference reduction) and a high rate of parallel evolution in the star topology. However, some key differences in fitness improvement (e.g., in growth rate) are only marginally significant, and the implications of this should be more explicitly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to reviewer 1 regarding effect sizes and the impact of outliers on our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While this proof of concept for star topologies is important, these structures are nonetheless highly artificial. The broader applicability of the results, beyond this experimental setup is discussed briefly, but could be elaborated further. Overall, the work provides validation that population structure is not merely a complicating detail, but can play a key role in shaping evolutionary outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this generous comment. We note that we mention in the discussion the relevance of our work to understanding both fundamental models of evolution (penultimate paragraph) and real world scenarios involving pathogen spread and range size evolution (last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some recommendations I have:</p><p>1. I would cite recent work in the multi-mutational regime that is more relevant than the theoretical results the authors reference, particularly because it theoretically supports their claims and addressed the clonal interference scenario (see their Figure 6 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40027632/)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this citation and have made the necessary revisions (line 163).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I would try to explain the connection and differences between mutation rate and migration rate in the experiments. Mutation supply rate is defined as &quot;the product of population size, N, and mutation rate, m&quot; (line 95), but the authors later state that supply rates are affected by &quot;population size and migration rate&quot; (line 127) and that is a bit confusing for a reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for picking up on this. We have revised the text on line 100 to read, “…when mutation supply rates in each subpopulation (which is <italic>NU</italic>, as defined above times <italic>m,</italic> the migration rate into a subpopulation) are &lt; 1 …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How are initial populations distributed, specifically, what fraction of mutant and wild-type cells are present in leaves versus hub at the start of experiments. Does it matter for outcome?</p></disp-quote><p>All populations are isogenic at the start of the experiment. All genetic variation arises de novo through mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In cases where the p-values are marginal (e.g., growth rate differences between treatments), I would consider including effect sizes or confidence intervals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
