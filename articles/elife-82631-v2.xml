potential, increasing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Chronic maternal gestational hypoxia, as well as placental insufficiency are associated with increased FGR incidence; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying FGR remain unknown.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Pregnant mice were subjected to acute or chronic hypoxia (12.5% O<sub>2</sub>) resulting in reduced fetal weight. Placenta oxygen transport was assessed by blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The placentae were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Human placentae were selected from FGR and matched controls and analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Maternal and cord sera were analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We show that murine acute and chronic gestational hypoxia recapitulates FGR phenotype and affects placental structure and morphology. Gestational hypoxia decreased labyrinth area, increased the incidence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the labyrinth while expanding the placental spiral arteries (SpA) diameter. Hypoxic placentae exhibited higher hemoglobin-oxygen affinity compared to the control. Placental abundance of Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) was upregulated in the syncytiotrophoblast and spiral artery trophoblast cells (SpA TGCs) in the murine gestational hypoxia groups compared to the control. Hif1α levels were higher in the acute hypoxia group compared to the control. In contrast, human FGR placentae exhibited reduced BPGM levels in the syncytiotrophoblast layer compared to placentae from healthy uncomplicated pregnancies. Levels of 2,3 BPG, the product of BPGM, were lower in cord serum of human FGR placentae compared to control. Polar expression of BPGM was found in both human and mouse placentae syncytiotrophoblast, with higher expression facing the maternal circulation. Moreover, in the murine SpA TGCs expression of BPGM was concentrated exclusively in the apical cell side, in direct proximity to the maternal circulation.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study suggests a possible involvement of placental BPGM in maternal-fetal oxygen transfer, and in the pathophysiology of FGR.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by the Weizmann Krenter Foundation and the Weizmann – Ichilov (Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center) Collaborative Grant in Biomedical Research, by the Minerva Foundation, by the ISF KillCorona grant 3777/19.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>BPGM</kwd><kwd>2,3 BPG</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3777/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovo</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Neeman</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001658</institution-id><institution>Minerva Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neeman</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001735</institution-id><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neeman</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of Bisphosphoglycerate mutase, a key enzyme affecting the release of oxygen from hemoglobin, is augmented in the murine placenta challenged by gestational hypoxia in mice while its expression is attenuated in placenta of human FGR.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The placenta is a transient organ, crucial for the growth and development of the fetus during gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garnica and Chan, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gude et al., 2004</xref>). The placenta provides the interface between the maternal and fetal circulation, mediating gas and metabolic exchange along with fetal waste disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton and Fowden, 2015</xref>). Abnormalities in placental growth, structure, and function are associated with gestational complications such as FGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Woods et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), which is defined as the failure of the fetus to reach its growth potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Romo et al., 2008</xref>). The clinical definition of FGR is fetal weight below the 10th percentile of predicted fetal weight for gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lausman et al., 2013</xref>). FGR affects approximately 10–15% of pregnancies, increasing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Romo et al., 2008</xref>). Long-term complications of FGR include poor postnatal development and are associated with multiple adverse health outcomes including respiratory, metabolic and cardiovascular deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">von Beckerath et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Multiple factors contribute to FGR, including fetal genetic aberrations or malformations, placental or umbilical cord defects, and maternal infections or diseases. Maternal anemia, smoking, high altitude residency, as well as placental and umbilical cord anomalies, are all associated with restricted placental and fetal oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chew and Verma, 2022</xref>). Interestingly, about 40% of all FGR cases are idiopathic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghidini, 1996</xref>), with no identifiable cause, which might hint on possible biological predisposition factors that contribute to FGR development by creating an hypoxic placental or embryo environment. However, the molecular mechanisms that provoke and contribute to this pregnancy complication have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>One of the key placental functions is the transfer of oxygen from the mother to the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton, 2009</xref>), and inefficient oxygen transport and availability is detrimental for placental and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Late-gestation hypoxia results in utero-placental vascular adaptations, such as capillary expansion, thinning of the inter-haemal membrane and increased radial artery diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahill et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, there is substantial evidence that late-gestation exposure to hypoxic environment alters placental structure and functionality ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higgins et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tomlinson et al., 2010</xref>). In-vitro studies on human placental samples under acute reduction of oxygen tension induced direct placental vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howard et al., 1987</xref>). Placental oxygen transport depends on Hemoglobin (Hb), which is responsible for carrying and mediating oxygen transfer in mammalian organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mairbäurl and Weber, 2012</xref>). BOLD contrast MR imaging is a powerful tool that utilizes hemoglobin as an endogenous reporter molecule to assess oxygen-hemoglobin affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avni et al., 2015</xref>). Previous MR studies have shown altered placental oxygen-Hb affinity following exposure to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avni et al., 2016</xref>). However, limited information is available on how placental structure and function is altered in chronic gestational hypoxia that commences at the onset of gestation.</p><p>The most significant allosteric effectors of Hb are organic phosphates, specifically 2,3 BPG, which is produced by the BPGM enzyme in a unique side reaction of glycolysis, known as the Luebering-Rapoport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sasaki et al., 1982</xref>). 2,3 BPG plays a key role in delivering O<sub>2</sub> to tissues by binding to and stabilizing deoxy-hemoglobin, thus leading to the release of oxygen from the Hb unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulquiney and Kuchel, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinberg et al., 2018</xref>). During gestation, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the dominant form of Hb present in the fetus, comprised of α and γ subunits. During late gestation, the γ subunit is gradually replaced by the adult β subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>). HbF has a higher affinity to oxygen compared to the adult Hb, caused by a structural difference, which leads to a weakened ability to bind 2,3 BPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frier and Perutz, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 1997</xref>). The transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal Hb is facilitated by the higher affinity of maternal Hb to 2,3 BPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinberg et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, BPGM expression is specifically restricted to erythrocytes and the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, a multinucleated layer that mediates transport of oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pritlove et al., 2006</xref>). In a study that used <italic>Igf2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> knockout mice as a model of FGR, BPGM expression in the placental labyrinth was lower compared to wild-type placentae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). However, scarce information is available on the role of this enzyme during gestation. We report here that placental BPGM expression pattern is consistent with a role in adaptation of the placenta to gestational hypoxia, facilitating the transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal circulation. Here, we show that gestational hypoxia augments placental BPGM expression in mice, while in human FGR placentae of unknown etiology BPGM expression is suppressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Female C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice (8–12 weeks old; Envigo, Jerusalem; n=28) were mated with C57BL/6JOlaHsd male mice (Envigo, Jerusalem; n=8). Detection of a vaginal plug the following day was considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). At E0.5 or E11.5, the pregnant females were randomly allocated to control (21% O<sub>2</sub>, n=15) or hypoxia group (12.5% O<sub>2</sub>, acute hypoxia; n=6, chronic hypoxia; n=7). Throughout the experiments, the animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled room (22 ± 1°C) on a 12 hr:12 hr light–dark cycle. Food and water was provided ad libitum and animal well-being was monitored daily. At E16.5 the pregnant females were analyzed using high-field MRI under a respiration challenge of hyperoxia-to-hypoxia (40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% O<sub>2</sub>, 10% O<sub>2</sub>). After MR imaging, the animals were sacrificed via cervical dislocation for tissue collection. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Protocol number: 07341021–2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Establishment of maternal hypoxia models</title><p>We applied two models of maternal hypoxia – acute and chronic. The pregnant mice were housed in a hypoxic chamber (VelO2x, Baker Ruskinn, Sanford, Maine, USA) from E11.5 (acute hypoxia; n=6) or E0.5 (chronic hypoxia; n=7) until E16.5. On the first day in the hypoxic chamber, maternal oxygen supply was gradually reduced from 21%O<sub>2</sub> to 12.5 ± 0.2% O<sub>2</sub> by continuous infusion of a nitrogen gas. The water contained in the expired gas was trapped using silica gel beads (Merck, CAS #: 7631-86-9). A portable oxygen analyzer (PO<sub>2</sub>-250, Lutron, Coopersburg, Pennsylvania, United States) was used to monitor the oxygen concentration in the chamber. Pregnant control females were housed in an identical chamber supplied with a constant 21% ± 0.2% O<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>In vivo MR imaging</title><p>MR imaging examinations were performed at a 15.2T with an MR spectrometer (BioSpec 152/11 US/R; Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a gradient-coil system capable of producing pulsed gradients of 10 mT/cm in each of the three orthogonal directions. A quadrature volume coil with a 35 mm inner diameter and an homogeneous radiofrequency field of 30 mm along the axis of the magnetic field was used for both transmission and reception. Immediately prior to MR imaging, the pregnant females were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% for induction; Piramal, Mumbai, India) mixed with 2 L/min of 40% O<sub>2</sub> and 60% N<sub>2</sub> delivered into a closed induction chamber. Once anesthetized, the animals were placed in a prone position in a head holder with breathing gas mixed with isoflurane delivered through a tooth bar. Respiration rate and rectal temperature were monitored using a monitoring and gating system (Model 1030 S-50; SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY). Respiration rate was maintained throughout the experimental period at approximately 20–30 breaths per minute by adjusting the isoflurane level (1–2% for maintenance). Body temperature was maintained at 30 ± 1°C (to reduce fetal movement) by adjusting the temperature of a circulating water heating blanket placed above the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MR imaging data acquisition</title><p>Anatomic data to determine optimal animal positioning was acquired by using a short Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) sequence with imaging slices acquired in three orthogonal planes. The animals were positioned to maximize the number of fetuses that could be viewed while still observing maternal liver. The duration of the MRI measurements at each oxygen level was approximately 20 min. After the O<sub>2</sub> concentration was reduced, a 2-min interval was given before acquiring the next set of MRI images, allowing relaxation rate (R2*) stabilization. At each oxygen phase, the nitrogen level was adjusted to maintain a constant flow of inhaled gas. To determine R2* values three Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) acquisitions were performed with TE = 1.6 ms, 2.6ms, and 3.6ms. The parameters for these GRE measurements were as follows: 48 slices with slice thickness of 0.4 mm with 0.1 mm inter-slice gap, field of view 4.2X3.3 cm<sup>2</sup>, pulse flip angle 40°, matrix size 280x220 (150 x 150 um<sup>2</sup> pixel size), 2 averages (motion averaging). Images were acquired with fat suppression and RF spoiling. The excitation pulse was 0.5ms (6400 Hz bandwidth) and the acquisition bandwidth was 200 kHz. The slice order was interleaved. The sequence was respiration triggered (per slice) with an approximate TR of 800ms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MR imaging data analysis</title><p>Images were reconstructed by Paravision 6.0 (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany).

Accordingly, maternal gestational hypoxia constitutes a risk factor for FGR incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ducsay et al., 2018</xref>). However, the etiology and molecular mechanisms underlying idiopathic as well as maternal gestational hypoxia induced FGR remains unclear. In order to elucidate on the mechanisms leading to FGR, this study employed a murine FGR model based on maternal acute and chronic gestational hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced FGR placentae displayed smaller labyrinth fraction, higher RBC content and enlarged spiral arteries. However, in vivo functional MRI experiments in response to hypoxia-hyperoxia challenge are consistent with similar deoxyhemoglobin content in all groups. Oxygen release under hypoxia might be regulated by 2,3 BPG, as suggested by the BPGM expression in the murine hypoxic placentae which was upregulated and concentrated in the cell side facing the maternal circulation. The murine levels of placental Bpgm might be regulated via Hif1a, a transcriptional regulator of cellular and developmental response to hypoxia. Conversely, human FGR placentae of unknown etiology exhibited an opposite phenotype, presenting lower BPGM expression and reduced level of 2,3 BPG in the cord serum. This suggests that induction of placenta BPGM may be part of the hypoxic adaptation response in the murine placenta; while suppression of BPGM may contribute to placenta deficiency in the human FGR.</p><p>Intra-uterine hypoxia has adverse effects on placental and embryonic development. This study shows a decreased placental and embryonal weight, and a reduction in the percent of AGA and LGA placentae and fetuses in the gestational hypoxia groups, with no difference in litter size between hypoxic and control groups. Moreover, the labyrinth area of hypoxic placentae was significantly smaller, implying an improper placental development. Previous studies showed that intermittent hypoxia increased placental weight and labyrinth size, while chronic gestational hypoxia in mice leads to reduced litter size and had no effect on the labyrinth zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badran et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matheson et al., 2016</xref>). These contradictory results may be due to the different experimental setups employed in the intermittent hypoxia model, and the differences in litter size of the chronic hypoxia model, which might in turn affect placental size and development. Furthermore, the current study demonstrated an increase in the diameter of placental SpA following gestational hypoxia. This enlargement might serve as a compensational mechanism for the placental and labyrinthine size reduction, by supplying higher volumes of blood to the placenta thereby increasing oxygen content, tissue oxygenation and oxygen supply to the fetus. Previous studies have shown that gestational hypoxia from mid-late gestation increased the diameter of radial arteries compared to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahill et al., 2018</xref>); however, no significant difference was observed in the spiral arteries, possibly due to the late exposure to hypoxia. However, this study mimics adaptation to early gestational hypoxia and early onset placental dysfunction leading to severe FGR and therefore, might serve as a better model for the human hypoxic-induced FGR.</p><p>MRI is an important tool for imaging changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration in vivo. Previous in vivo studies on non-treated pregnant mice obtained oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curves in mid-late gestation placentae under hyperoxia - hypoxia challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avni et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in the present study no significant differences were found in the R2* values between the hypoxic and control placentae under hyperoxic, normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This result is consistent with similar deoxyhemoglobin levels in the hypoxic and control placentae, despite the upregulation of RBC levels in the hypoxic placentae. These results indicate that the partial amount of HbO<sub>2</sub> is higher in the hypoxic placentae compared to the control, implying on the ability of the placenta to maintain its oxygen levels albeit the maternal hypoxia.</p><p>In RBCs, the BPGM enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of 2,3 BPG, which induces the release of oxygen from Hb in the mammalian organism. Remarkably, the expression of BPGM has been reported in the human placental labyrinth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pritlove et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting on its role in placental oxygen transfer. This study shows for the first time the polar pattern of BPGM expression in both the murine and human placental cells, amassing at the apical lumen, facing the maternal circulation. This polar expression might increase the efficiency of oxygen sequestering from maternal blood by reducing the distance between 2,3 BPG molecule and the maternal RBCs. Moreover, following maternal intra-uterine hypoxia, the expression of murine placental BPGM is further upregulated, suggesting a physiological role for placenta BPGM in the placental acclimatization to low oxygen availability. Strikingly, attenuation in the expression of BPGM in FGR human placentae was found when compared to the control. Moreover, 2,3 BPG levels in the cord serum of FGR placentae were also decreased compared to control. This suggests that failure in induction of placental BPGM and subsequently lower 2,3 BPG levels may contribute to the pathophysiology of FGR. Remarkably, the same phenotype was observed in a murine FGR model of <italic>igf2</italic> +/-knockout mice, where labyrinthine BPGM expression was lower compared to control dams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). This study demonstrates opposite BPGM expression patterns in mouse and human FGR, suggesting that the murine FGR in our model originates in low maternal oxygen concentrations, which are compensated by the placenta <italic>via</italic> upregulation of BPGM levels, while human FGR of unknown etiology is related to a placental pathology that might include inadequate BPGM expression. During human gestation, the γ hemoglobin subunit starts to decline around week 32 and β hemoglobin rises, switching from fetal to adult hemoglobin. Following this increase in HbA in the fetus, it might be possible that placental BPGM and 2,3 BPG are also used by the fetus at that stage, to mediate the release of oxygen to its organs. However, the question of how placental 2,3 BPG might be transported to the nearby maternal RBCs needs to be addressed, while a possible explanation would be a specific transport system. In summary, we hypothesize that placental BPGM provides an important mechanism for placental adaptation to oxygen transfer during the course of gestation. We propose that placental BPGM sequesters oxygen from the maternal Hb, and facilitates oxygen diffusion from the maternal to the fetal circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results offer a possible causative link between the expression of this enzyme and the development of an FGR. This novel molecular mechanism for the regulation of oxygen availability by the placenta might provide a better understanding of the FGR pathology and possibly pave the way toward development of novel therapies for FGR complications.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of placental adaptation to oxygen transfer during the course of gestation.</title><p>Expression of BPGM, a key enzyme affecting the release of oxygen from hemoglobin, is augmented in the murine placenta challenged by gestational hypoxia in mice, while its expression is attenuated in placenta of human FGR.

The solid evidence draws on a comprehensive array of methods including tissue histology, high-resolution tissue MR imaging, and biochemical analysis in both mouse models and human subjects. The major strength of the study lies in the novel exploration of BPGM in placental oxygenation, while further investigations could expand on these findings to establish more definitive connections between the enzyme's activity and fetal health outcomes. The findings have practical implications for the subfield of developmental biology, particularly in understanding the mechanisms of fetal growth restriction. This research will predominantly interest developmental biologists and medical professionals specializing in prenatal care.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82631.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lizneva</surname><given-names>Daria</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kalisch-Smith</surname><given-names>Jacinta</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.14.507932">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.14.507932v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jacinta Kalisch-Smith (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In the mouse model, staining for BPGM in SpA-TGCs (and poor staining in the labyrinth, see below) was increased after hypoxia, but in MRI experiments assessing placental and fetal haemoglobin-oxygenation, showed no differences. While human FGR samples showed reduced 2,3-BPG in cord blood, the same experiment in the mouse was not performed. Further evidence is required to show hypoxia increases BPGM as a compensatory mechanism to permit adequate 2,3-BPG and placental-fetal oxygenation levels as the authors claim. Such evidence should include hypoxy-probe (pimonidazole hydrochloride) staining in placenta, QPCR for Bpgm in mouse model for labyrinth and junctional zone expression, collect fetal blood from umbilical cord, mass spec of 2,3-BPG in mouse model cord blood (does this correlate with placental Bpgm expression). In addition, the mouse model could be further utilised to inhibit Bpgm/BPGM genetically (knockout), or pharmacologically (enzyme inhibition) in isolation and combination with hypoxia groups (and MRI oxygenation experiments). This would demonstrate that BPGM is advantageous in the context of hypoxia and would strengthen the authors arguments, and would provide a novel mechanism for adaptive responses to hypoxia in the placenta which is highly interesting.</p><p>2. BPGM staining in labyrinth not convincing in control group and is suspicious in hypoxia groups. In control, BPGM shows little staining if any in the labyrinth, let alone in SynT. I queried data from Marsh et al. <italic>eLife</italic> (2020), and found high expression in RBCs but only negligible expression in labyrinth trophoblast. Can antibodies for MCT1 (SynT-I) or MCT2 (SynT-II) co-localise with positive signal for BPGM in any group? BPGM in hypoxia groups shows staining in the majority of labyrinth cells, which also contain endothelial cells, pericytes and sinusoidal TGCs, is this background? Or is there an alternative explanation?</p><p>3. Mouse model: It is known that hypoxia is associated with reduced food intake in mouse models. The authors fail to properly use the model of hypoxia and should have a paired-fed group to really understand if the results observed in the mouse model are exclusively due to the reduced oxygen level or due to a combination of low food intake and oxygen deprivation.</p><p>4.

What are the signalling pathways that are altered? Is BPGM linked to potential changes in HIF1alpha or HIF2alpha? The lack of mechanisms behind the changes in BPGM reduces the impact of this paper.

Panel D: please show all data dots. Panel E-F: is each dot one fetus or one litter? If fetus, the numbers seem small for this type of analysis. Panels H-I were not statistically analyzed? What post hoc test was used if ANOVA was found to be significant? The results text associated with the figure does not need to restate the p values etc.</p><p>– Figure 4: It would be important to assess if there were differences in labyrinthine sinusoidal giant cells, where Hb-O2 dissociation might occur.</p><p>– Line 132: should be Figure 1I, not 2I, similar errors in lines 183-185. The legend to Figure 4 also has errors in panel annotations.</p><p>– The authors indicate 17 participants (line 243), but Table 1 and Figure 5 includes only 16. Infant sex: enough to show one sex.</p><p>– Figure 6 Panels C, E lack statistical analysis.</p><p>– All IF experiments: please show the secondary only images.</p><p>– Methods: with the dramatic changes in feto-placental development during the 18-19 days of mouse gestation, consider performing the analysis after exposures to hypoxia at different intervals of pregnancy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to evaluate the effects of hypoxia on placental physiology using murine models and human placental samples. The focus of the paper is to understand how bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM), an enzyme unique to erythrocytes and placental cells is involved in the pathogenesis of fetal growth restriction (FGR). The authors report that placental BPGM levels are increased in response to hypoxia in mice, but in humans suppressed in FGR placentas (umbilical cord) without unclear etiology.</p><p>Mouse model: It is known that hypoxia is associated with reduced food intake in mouse models. The authors fail to properly use the model of hypoxia and should have a paired-fed group to really understand if the results observed in the mouse model are exclusively due to the reduced oxygen level or due to a combination of low food intake and oxygen deprivation.</p><p>Results: It would be good if the authors could introduce briefly the model of hypoxia. Currently, the flow of the text does not allow you to understand the model. The reader has to jump between results and methods to understand the model and the results, which is a bit annoying. This could be easily done by adding two sentences at the beginning of the result's section.</p><p>– The numbers of the maternal parameters (eg. haematocrit) do not match with the numbers of litters performed. Similarly, the number of litters (Figure 1D) do not match with the number of fetal/placental weights. Please explain why this variability. In the material and methods the authors report that have used 15 mice for the control group, but then the numbers in figure 1 and across the study are very different.</p><p>– SGA/AGA/LGA: the authors have to define the cut-off used. Please write in mg what is defined a SGA/AGA/LGA fetus.</p><p>– Analysis of the placental Lz: The authors have used more than one placental per litter. The statistical analysis performed is not correct. The authors should average the litters on a single value (as performed in Figure 1 – Fetal weights) or instead use a MIXED model. Please correct the analysis.</p><p>– Spiral artery diameter: how many sections the authors analysed to determine the spiral artery diameter? Stereological analysis should be conducted in serial sections rather than in only one section to really have a correct value of the size of the diameter.</p><p>– Labyrinth fraction: The analysis of the Lz is not corrected for the reduced weight of the placenta. Please analyse the volume and multiply the density or fraction by the weight of the placenta. Also, the structural changes occurring in the Lz are not well defined. Can the authors phenotype in depth the Lz structure? Is the reduced size of the Lz due to reduced maternal blood spaces, trophoblast or fetal capillaries? This analysis can be easily performed with Lectin and cytokeratin IHC stainings.</p><p>– The hyperoxia-hypoxia experiment is not well introduced. Why did the authors put the mice in hyperoxia? Please explain the rationale for doing this experiment. What does the R2*measure exactly? I think it is iron levels, but this is very unclear in the text.</p><p>– Levels of BPMG: The authors report significant differences in the levels of BPMG. However, the quantification was done by IHC and not by protein quantification using western blotting. IHC has many limitations (background and image analysis). Please quantify protein abundance by western blotting (antibodies are available in thermofisher). Also, for figure 4, please include a low-magnification image of the staining. It would be nice to see the whole scanner of representative placentas to see potential differences in the Jz or in the decidua (the authors do not have to quantify BPMG in these two regions, but it will help other scientists working in the field).</p><p>– Figure 4: The authors need to explain why they use 3 control dams (2-3 placentas per dam) when they have used for that group a total of 8 animals (similar applies to the other two groups). Again, because the authors have used more than 1 placenta per dam, the values should be averaged or corrected using a MIXED model.</p><p>– Figures 6 A, B, D are not described in the results. Also, the quantification of BPMG by western blotting is required.</p><p>– Lack of mechanism in the mouse model: The authors report changes in BPGM, however, the mechanism that led to this change observed in the placenta is totally lacking in this project. What are the signalling pathways that are altered? Is BPGM linked to potential changes in HIF1alpha or HIF2alpha? The lack of mechanisms behind the changes in BPGM reduces the impact of this paper. Indeed, this is even more obvious when the authors use two different models (mouse and human) and do not obtain similar results, suggesting that the mechanisms of BPGM are not only hypoxia.</p><p>Statistical analysis: Please incorporate the post hoc test employed to analyse the ANOVA. Were the data analysed with Tukey, Bonferroni or Fisher post hoc?</p><p>&quot;We suggest that placental BPGM sequesters oxygen from the maternal Hb, and facilitates oxygen diffusion from the maternal to the fetal circulation&quot;. This statement is only correct if the authors analyse the oxygen levels in fetal circulation. The authors should measure oxygen levels, haemoglobin and the haematocript.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Please incorporate the method for sacrificing the mice.</p><p>Human exclusion data: Please explain why so many women were excluded. According to figure 5, the study was performed with 236, but then the authors only use 9 and 7 women.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82631.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

This is imperative because the placenta consists of diverse cell populations, and the sole viable technique for isolating these cells is through FACS sorting based on fluorescence. Additionally, the challenge arises from syncytiotrophoblast cells forming a syncytium, a multi-nucleated cell layer, resulting in intricate interconnections that complicate extraction. Consequently, the probable outcome may encompass cytotrophoblast cells, which are precursors to syncytiotrophoblasts. Furthermore, the placenta contains a notable amount of red blood cells that are rich in BPGM, which could potentially exert a significant influence on the QPCR outcomes due to their high abundance.</p><p>On average, mice have around 58.5 ml of blood per kg of bodyweight. Mouse embryos at E19-20 weigh approximately 1-1.2 grams, thus their total blood volume (TBV) will be approximately 58.5 ml/kg x 0.001 kg = 0.0585 ml = 58.5 μl. For the mass spec of 2,3 BPG at least 10 μl of plasma is required, which greatly exceeds the blood volume that can be extracted from an embryo, let alone from its cord blood.</p><p>Currently, there is no established technique for selectively delivering compounds to the placenta without impacting the entire organism. It's important to note that inhibiting Bpgm in the circulatory system could potentially have repercussions on both the mouse model and the experimental outcomes. We are developing a transgenic mouse with syncytial Bpgm deletion but its analysis is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>We examined Hif1a and Hif2a levels, since both these factors are recognized for their significance in adaptive responses to hypoxia. Our findings illustrate an increase in Hif1a and Hif2a levels in the labyrinth across both acute and chronic hypoxia models. This observation implies that the elevation of Bpgm expression could potentially be orchestrated by the upregulation of Hif1a and\or Hif2a. It is worth mentioning, that Bpgm has two Hif1a binding domains, one 775 bp upstream the TSS and one ~500 downstream the TSS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

When the pregnant dams are submitted to hypoxia, the lack of oxygen is probably compensated by the elevation of placental Bpgm, which facilitates transport of additional oxygen to the placenta. In the human study, the pregnant females were not exposed to hypoxia while Bpgm levels in the FGR placentae were significantly lower than in the control placentae, suggesting that lower placental Bpgm levels were possibly contributing to FGR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
