exchange in grasses. Subsidiary mother cells (SMCs) strongly polarise before an asymmetric division forms a SC. Yet apart from a proximal polarity module that includes PANGLOSS1 (PAN1) and guides nuclear migration, little is known regarding the developmental processes that form SCs. Here, we used comparative transcriptomics of developing wild-type and SC-less <italic>bdmute</italic> leaves in the genetic model grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> to identify novel factors involved in SC formation. This approach revealed BdPOLAR, which forms a novel, distal polarity domain in SMCs that is opposite to the proximal PAN1 domain. Both polarity domains are required for the formative SC division yet exhibit various roles in guiding pre-mitotic nuclear migration and SMC division plane orientation, respectively. Nonetheless, the domains are linked as the proximal domain controls polarisation of the distal domain. In summary, we identified two opposing polarity domains that coordinate the SC division, a process crucial for grass stomatal physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>grass stomata</kwd><kwd>subsidiary cells</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>Brachypodium distachyon</kwd><kwd>stomatal gas exchange</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 3117/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spiegelhalder</surname><given-names>Roxane P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hidalgo</surname><given-names>Inés</given-names></name><name><surname>Jesenofsky</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Raissig</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindner</surname><given-names>Heike</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Nunes</surname><given-names>Tiago DG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate research fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abrash</surname><given-names>Emily B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anleu Gil</surname><given-names>M Ximena</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergmann</surname><given-names>Dominique C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The formation of stomatal 'helper cells' (=subsidiary cells) in grasses requires two opposing polarity domains with diverse roles in establishing division asymmetry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stomata are ‘breathing pores’ in the plant epidermis that regulate gas exchange between the plant and the environment. They open to enable the entry of carbon dioxide to be assimilated in photosynthesis and close to restrict water vapour loss. Efficiently balancing carbon dioxide uptake and water vapour loss is key for plant survival and abiotic stress resilience. Grasses like <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize), <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice), and the genetic model system <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> present a unique stomatal morphology, where a pair of central, dumbbell-shaped guard cells (GCs) is flanked by two lateral subsidiary cells (SCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nunes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stebbins and Shah, 1960</xref>). The grasses’ stomatal morphology is linked to faster stomatal movements that contribute to more water-use efficient gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franks and Farquhar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawson and Vialet-Chabrand, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McAusland et al., 2016</xref>). Among other features, the grasses’ morphological innovations to stomatal form and function likely contributed to their evolutionary success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</xref>) and their importance in modern agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">FAO Statistical Pocketbook FAO, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The linear epidermal cell files in a growing grass leaf follow a strict and stereotyped developmental gradient from base to tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stebbins and Shah, 1960</xref>). Some cell files acquire stomatal identity at the leaf base, where a transversal, asymmetric cell division (ACD) generates a small guard mother cell (GMC) and a large, interstomatal pavement cell precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raissig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stebbins and Shah, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). The GMC then induces its lateral neighbour cells to become subsidiary mother cells (SMCs), which strongly polarise towards the GMC and undergo an extreme longitudinal ACD to generate a proximal SC and a distal pavement cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartwright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stebbins and Shah, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the GMCs undergo a symmetric longitudinal cell division generating two GC precursors before complex morphogenetic processes shape the so-called graminoid stomatal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galatis and Apostolakos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spiegelhalder and Raissig, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stebbins and Shah, 1960</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>BdPOLAR</italic> is a novel regulator of subsidiary cell (SC) division in the <italic>Brachypodium</italic> <italic>distachyon</italic> stomatal lineage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stomatal development in <italic>B. distachyon</italic>; in a stomatal file (1) (grey asterisk) a transverse asymmetric division (2) generates a guard mother cell (GMC; blue, with blue asterisk), which laterally induces subsidiary mother cells (SMCs; yellow) (3).

It was shown that SC presence is critical for stomata to open and close quickly in response to environmental cues in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>), yet few factors required for SC formation have been identified. SC formation can be divided into three steps: (1) SMC establishment, (2) SMC polarisation, and (3) the ACD that yields the SC. Previous work showed that orthologues of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> stomatal bHLH transcription factor <italic>MUTE</italic> are required to establish SMC identity in the three grass species <italic>B. distachyon,</italic> maize, and rice, and that <italic>mute</italic> mutants lack SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In maize SMCs, a proximal polarity module localised at the GMC/SMC interface establishes pre-mitotic polarity and guides the migrating nucleus towards the GMC/SMC interface. ZmBRICK1 (ZmBRK1), a subunit of the SCAR/WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), initially localises at the interface of GMC/SMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette et al., 2015</xref>). ZmBRK1 then promotes the polarised accumulation of two leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases, ZmPANGLOSS1 (ZmPAN1) and ZmPAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartwright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). ZmPAN2 acts upstream of ZmPAN1, which then recruits two Rho of plants (ROP) GTPases, ZmROP2 and ZmROP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The ZmROPs physically interact with and possibly activate WRC components, which lead to actin patch formation at the GMC/SMC interface and nuclear migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette et al., 2015</xref>). Upon nuclear migration, the phosphatases DISCORDIA1 (ZmDCD1) and ALTERNATIVE DCD1 (ZmADD1) control the formation and positioning of the preprophase band (PPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wright et al., 2009</xref>), which is a transient cytoskeletal array that guides the future division plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Facette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Livanos and Müller, 2019</xref>). After the disappearance of the PPB, factors such as the microtubule-binding protein TANGLED1 (TAN1) maintain the cortical division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleary and Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).

To quantify the degree of polarisation of BdPOLAR-mVenus and BdPAN1-YFP in WT and mutant SMCs, we employed polarity measurement (POME) to quantify the fraction of the PM occupied by the protein of interest and to determine the polarity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong et al., 2021b</xref>). In WT, the broad, distal BdPOLAR polarisation domain showed a much higher average polarity index (i.e. less polarised) than the highly polarised BdPAN1 domain at the GMC/SMC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, H</xref>). In <italic>bdpan1-1</italic>, however, we observed an almost uniform distribution of BdPOLAR-mVenus signal at the periphery of SMCs, where BdPOLAR-mVenus seemed to have invaded the BdPAN1 domain at the GMC/SMC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Quantifying the polarity index of BdPOLAR-mVenus in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> indeed showed a significantly decreased polarisation of BdPOLAR-mVenus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, BdPAN1-YFP polarised normally at the GMC/SMC interface independent of the presence or absence of functional BdPOLAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). Thus, functional BdPAN1 was required for polarised localisation of BdPOLAR, but BdPAN1 localisation was not affected in the <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> mutant background. This suggested that even though BdPAN1 and BdPOLAR show opposing polarisation patterns they exhibit a one-way rather than a mutual inhibition. This might be due to the earlier polarisation of BdPAN1, which accumulated at the GMC/SMC interface before BdPOLAR was expressed in SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Accurate dosage and localisation of BdPOLAR are necessary for functionality</title><p>In addition to the non-polarised localisation of BdPOLAR-mVenus in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic>, the expression of BdPOLAR-mVenus strongly enhanced the <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> SC defect frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). 86% of SMCs displayed abnormal formation in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> plants that expressed BdPOLAR-mVenus compared to only ~30% in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> plants without BdPOLAR-mVenus expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In fact, even WT plants with strong <italic>BdPOLARp:BdPOLAR-mVenus</italic> expression (~19%) or ubiquitously expressed BdPOLAR-mVenus (~10%) resulted in SC defects further indicating that correct dose and/or stability of BdPOLAR seems to be crucial for its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, I, J</xref>).</p><p>Finally, only weak BdPOLAR-mVenus expression partially rescued <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> defects, while strong BdPOLAR-mVenus expression failed to complement altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). It is also conceivable that the lines do complement but create a simultaneous, dosage-dependent overexpression phenotype.

SMC nuclei were located more proximal to the GMC/SMC interface next to longer and, thus, more mature GMCs (i.e. higher LWR of GMCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We chose a GMC LWR of 0.9 as cut-off since &gt;93% of the SMC nuclei were within 4 μm of the GMC/SMC domain and thus considered polarised in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In WT, the average distance of SMC nuclei to GMCs with an LWR &gt;0.9 was 3.19 μm— the lowest distance value of all genotypes. The average distance of SMC nuclei was significantly increased in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> (3.48 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) but almost 80% of the nuclei were still within 4 µm of the GMC/SMC interface. In <italic>bdpan1-1,</italic> the average distance was clearly increased (3.78 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and more than 35% of the SMC nuclei were beyond the 4 µm cut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) suggesting that <italic>BdPAN1</italic> indeed affected nuclear migration more than <italic>BdPOLAR</italic>. Finally, the double mutant <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> displayed an almost identical nuclear migration defect (3.89 μm, and &gt;37% unpolarised nuclei; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) as <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggested that nuclear migration defects in <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> were mostly caused by the loss-of-function of <italic>BdPAN1,</italic> and indicated that nuclear migration is promoted by BdPAN1 rather than BdPOLAR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, the fraction of unpolarised SMC nuclei in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> and the <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> mutants are similar, yet the defective SMC divisions are twice as frequent in the double mutant. This suggested that the exaggerated ACD defects in the double mutant might not solely be induced by deficient nuclear migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>BdPOLAR is involved in cortical division site orientation</title><p>As defective nuclear migration cannot explain the severe SC division defects in <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic>, another, yet unknown pathway must also be affected and likely involves <italic>BdPOLAR</italic>. We not only found an absence of BdPOLAR-mVenus signal at the GMC/SMC interface but also at the cortical division sites just above and below the GMC/SMC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesised that <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> might have a role in specifying cortical division sites and cell division orientation. To test this possibility, we generated <italic>BdTANGLED1 (BdTAN1)-mCitrine</italic> reporter lines specifically expressed in dividing SMCs and GMCs (using the <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> promoter), which stably marked cortical division sites throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) much like the maize homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, however, BdTAN1-mCitrine also shows weak expression in the nucleus and nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which we could use to quantify nuclear migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Manual tracing and comparison of BdPOLAR-mVenus and BdTAN1-mCitrine occupancy at the SMC circumference confirmed that indeed the BdPOLAR-mVenus signal is not only absent from the BdPAN1 domain at the SMC/GMC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but also at the future division site where BdTAN1 localises to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). In WT SMCs, BdTAN1 always localised above and below the GMC/SMC interface, correctly predicting the future SC division plane (100%, n=33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). In <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> SMCs, BdTAN1 is still mostly localised to the ‘wild-type’-like proximal division site independent of nuclear polarisation (92.5%, n=40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). In <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> SMCs, however, we found that in 28.1% of cases (n=32) BdTAN1 is mis-localised to the proximal and distal PM predicting a transverse, oblique rather than longitudinal, curved division plane. In addition, in 12.5% of <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> SMCs, BdTAN1 marked three rather than just two cortical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). This indeed suggested a role for <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> in orienting cell division planes in SMCs.</p><p>To exclude that our observation regarding the diverse cellular roles of BdPAN1 and BdPOLAR stems from growth artefacts and/or individual outliers, we repeated the cellular phenotyping on a set of simultaneously grown plants. We grew WT, <italic>bdpolar-1,</italic> and <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> plants, each expressing <italic>BdPOLARp:BdTAN1-mCitrine</italic>, on common nutrient agar plates. We then quantified the distance between SMC nucleus and GMC/SMC interface and cortical TAN1-mCitrine-based division site specification in the same SMCs of the second leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). We then used the third leaf at 19 dag of these exact individualsto quantify SC division defects of the mature leaf (for details see Methods). Using this approach, we could confirm the nuclear migration defects in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Yet unlike before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we did not find any nuclear migration defects in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> compared to WT strongly suggesting that there are no or very weak nuclear migration defects in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We could also confirm a more severe defect in cortical division site localisation in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> (16.5%) compared to <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> (6.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, we found that both mutant lines in this set exhibited a similar frequency of SC division defects (37% in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> and 44% in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This indicates that indeed BdPAN1 promotes nuclear migration and that cortical division site defects are exaggerated in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic>. It remains unclear, however, why the comparatively low frequency of wrongly specified cortical division sites leads to a relatively high frequency of abnormally formed SCs (see Discussion). Finally, we investigated if <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> has a role in regulating cell division potential like its homologue in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). We found that individual SMCs in both <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> and <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> can undergo more than one round of misoriented ACDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Quantifying rounds of cell divisions per individual SMC in both mutant backgrounds revealed that in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> almost 75% of the SMCs divided more than one time, whereas only 55% of the SMCs in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> divided more than once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). In <italic>bdpolar-1</italic>, we even observed a small fraction of SMCs (1.5%) that exhibited four rounds of aberrant cell division, which we never saw in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). On average, SMCs divided 1.9 times in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> but only 1.6 times in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic>.</p><p>Successful recruitment of WT-like SCs seemed to occur at later stages in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> compared to <italic>bdpan1-1</italic>. We thus quantified the LWR of GMCs that successfully recruited one or two WT-like SCs as a proxy for developmental stage/maturity in WT, <italic>bdpan1-1</italic>, <italic>bdpolar-1,</italic> and <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D, F</xref>).

This suggested that GMCs that successfully recruited SCs were developmentally more mature in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> and <italic>bdpolar1;bdpan1-1</italic> compared to <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> and WT. This could be due to a potential developmental delay in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic>, or indicate that more rounds of divisions occurred until successful SC recruitment was completed. Together, these findings suggested that <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> might affect cell division potential. Yet, repeated rounds of cell division in SMCs were also observed in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> suggesting that repetitive divisions might be an inherent consequence of misoriented SMC divisions rather than a gene-specific effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Morphologically aberrant SCs negatively impact stomatal gas exchange</title><p>We have previously shown that <italic>bdmute</italic> stomatal complexes that failed to specify and recruit SCs altogether displayed severely impaired stomatal dynamics and gas exchange capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>).

Yet in <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic>, the neighbouring cells presumably adopted SC lineage identity through the action of <italic>BdMUTE</italic> but failed to properly divide and form SCs. To test stomatal opening and closing speediness, we performed gas exchange measurements in a changing light regime.

In grasses, however, the positional cue for nuclear migration seems to be linked to the PAN1 polarity domain at the GMC/SMC interface, which is proximal to the division plane and is required to attract rather than repel the migrating SMC nucleus pre-mitotically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartwright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphries et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, the PAN1 polarity domain is formed independently of SMC identity (i.e. also in <italic>bdmute</italic>) and, thus, seems to be primarily following mechanical or biochemical signals from the rapidly elongating GMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giannoutsou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Livanos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Livanos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nunes et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the PAN1 polarity domain is established significantly before the SMC division and persists significantly after the SMC division until late stages. This suggests that the PAN1 domain is a ‘primary’ polarity domain that reads SC lineage independent polarity cues and is stably positioned at the GMC/SMC interface throughout stomatal development. Finally, BdPAN1 is initially expressed in all protodermal cells, and only later executes an SC-specific, polarised accumulation.</p><p><italic>BdPOLAR</italic>, on the other hand, is specifically expressed in the stomatal lineage. Its expression is strongest in SMCs, which depends on <italic>BdMUTE</italic> establishing SC identity. This suggests that unlike the PAN1 domain, which seems to respond to intercellular polarisation cues, BdPOLAR might be a cell-autonomous polarity factor linked to a specific cell fate. In addition, BdPOLAR is the first SMC polarity factor that forms a polarity domain distal to the future division plane in SMCs. BdPOLAR shows strong but transient polarised localisation before it is quickly dissociated from the PM after completion of the ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The transient nature of BdPOLAR localisation might underlie its sensitivity to dosage and/or altered protein stability potentially explaining the incomplete rescue of the <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> phenotype by the translational reporter. Similarly, YFP-ZmROP2 reporter lines in maize showed SCs defects likely due to dosage and mislocalisation effects of YFP-ZmROP2 in SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphries et al., 2011</xref>). Much like for BdPOLAR-mVenus, YFP-ZmROP2 expression levels and SC division defects were correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphries et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, the distally polarised localisation of BdPOLAR depends on BdPAN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and in the absence of a functional BdPAN1 domain, BdPOLAR was able to invade the GMC/SMC interface. This suggests that the BdPAN1 domain either sterically hinders BdPOLAR from entering the GMC/SMC interface by prior occupation of this domain or it induces localised degradation of BdPOLAR through protein modification. This supports a hierarchical model, where a cell-fate-independent polarity domain (BdPAN1) polarises a cell-fate-dependent polarity domain (BdPOLAR). Finally, much like the PAN homologues, BdPOLAR then persists in young GCs and SCs. While ZmPAN2 was shown to have a role in SC morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sutimantanapi et al., 2014</xref>), there is no obvious role for the grass PAN1 homologues or BdPOLAR in the SC lineage after the SC division. A role for BdPAN1 and BdPOLAR in the GC lineage is difficult to assess because absence of SCs affected GC length and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> was initially expressed in the GC lineage and seemed to polarise to the base of dividing cells likely following similar polarity cues as <italic>AtBASL</italic> when it was ectopically expressed in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nir et al., 2022</xref>). Functionally, however, BdPOLAR played no role in this first ACD that generated the GMC. Upon <italic>BdMUTE</italic>-dependent specification of SMCs, BdPOLAR is redeployed from the GC to the SC lineage, where it is functionally required during ACD. The absence of BdPOLAR signal at cortical division sites and cortical division site mislocalisation revealed by <italic>BdTAN1</italic> reporter imaging in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> suggested a role in placing and orienting the cortical division site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The rather uniquely positioned cortical division sites in SMCs and strikingly curved SC wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) might underlie the requirement for not only one but two polarity domains, one of which is cell-fate-specific and orients this peculiar division. The mechanism by which <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> affects division plane orientation is yet to be determined. We propose that the BdPOLAR domain actively repels microtubules or cortical division site factors like DCD1 and ADD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wright et al., 2009</xref>) and/or phragmoplast orienting kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lipka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Temporally, however, it seems to act before cell plate formation and phragmoplast expansion and guidance, which are controlled by OPAQUE1/DISCORDIA2 in SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A relevant open question is why we observed a much lower frequency of mislocalised cortical division sites compared to the relatively high frequency of aberrant SCs particularly in <italic>bdpan1</italic>. In <italic>bdpan1</italic>, we observed &lt;10% cortical division site defects but ~40% defective SCs. In particular, defective nuclear migration in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> still seemed to mostly allow normal formation of cortical division sites. Conversely in maize, nuclear migration defects seem to be strongly linked to misspecified PPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arif Ashraf et al., 2022</xref>). This could indicate that defects in the proximal polarity domain in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> also affected later cellular events like phragmoplast formation or guidance. Alternatively, it is conceivable that in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> the extending phragmoplast ‘short-cuts’ more readily to the distal wall when polarity is compromised. SMC geometry in maize and <italic>B. distachyon</italic> is quite different, which can influence how plant cells divide (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besson and Dumais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller, 2019</xref>). In maize, SMCs tend to be much wider relative to their length, whereas <italic>B. distachyon</italic> SMCs are much narrower, which could favour phragmoplast ‘short-cuts’ when nuclei are not properly migrated to the GMC/SMC interface. In addition, the maize SMC walls just above and below the GMC/SMC interface seem often to be at an ~45° angle with respect to the GMC/SMC wall. This might facilitate proper phragmoplast extension even in polarity-compromised SMCs in maize compared to <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, where the SMC walls above and below GMC/SMC interface are hardly at an angle at all.</p><p>In addition to <italic>BdPOLAR</italic>’s role in cell division orientation, it might also affect cell division capacity. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtPOLAR interacts and sequesters the GSK3-like kinase BIN2; this results in disinhibition of the stomatal lineage initiating and ACD regulating transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH) before mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Houbaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacAlister et al., 2007</xref>). Right at the onset of mitosis, a BSL family phosphatase is recruited to the polarity crescent in meristemoids, which releases BIN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>). This enables BIN2 to enter the nucleus of the larger daughter cell after the ACD, where it can downregulate SPCH and inhibit ACD potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Houbaert et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, mutants affecting several POLAR family members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> show reduced cell division capacity in meristemoids. In grasses, a mutation in <italic>BdPOLAR</italic> alone was sufficient to reveal the family’s functional relevance, yet <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> SMCs exhibited an increased rather than a decreased cell division capacity. Whether this reversed functionality also involves the sequestration of signalling components that directly or indirectly affects the cell cycle or is just a consequence of misoriented division planes remains elusive. It is possible, for example, that properly migrated SMC nuclei at the GMC/SMC interface in <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> but not in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> might positively affect cell division capacity. Importantly, excessive cell division in wrongly dividing SMCs was also observed in <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> albeit at a lower frequency. This indicates that division capacity is affected in wrongly dividing SMCs independent of the mutated genetic pathway. How normally formed SCs inhibit additional divisions remains elusive.</p><p>SCs functionally contribute to the fast opening and closing kinetics of grass stomata by acting as water and ion reservoirs and by providing mechanical support to GC movement through inverse turgor regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franks and Farquhar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nunes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spiegelhalder and Raissig, 2021</xref>). Compared to <italic>bdmute</italic> plants, where the SC lineage is never established, <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> showed an overall milder defect in respect to stomatal opening and closing speediness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raissig et al., 2017</xref>). This could be due to fewer SCs being defective in <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> (82%) compared to <italic>bdmute</italic> (almost 100%), which also results in a reduced effect on GC size and shape. Also, <italic>bdmute</italic> shows lower stomatal density (~30% of stomata abort), which is correlated with slower stomatal kinetics in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nunes et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, and unlike in <italic>bdmute</italic>, wrongly divided SCs in <italic>bdpolar-1;bdpan1-1</italic> might have acquired and retained residual SC identity thus expressing appropriate ion channels, signalling modules or cell wall modifiers, which could positively influence stomatal kinetics. If partial SC-like functionality did not require anatomical changes to the stomatal complex, then stomatal speediness could be more easily engineered in crops that form stomata without SCs.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a novel, cell-fate-dependent, distal polarity domain that is polarised by a SC lineage-independent, proximal polarity domain. Apparently, the peculiar, highly asymmetric division of SMCs seems to require two connected, yet functionally diverse polarity domains to faithfully form this highly relevant cell type for efficient gas exchange in grasses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

after germination grown on ½ MS plates at 20°C with ~100 µmol photons m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> light) were carefully pulled out of the sheath of the first leaf to isolate the leaf developmental zone (3 mm at base of the leaf). 25 developmental zones were collected per replicate and genotype (3 replicates per genotype), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground using mortar and pistil. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen’s RNeasy Plant Mini kit with on-column DNAse digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Kapa mRNA HyperPrep (Roche) was used to generate an mRNA enriched sequencing library with an input of 1 µg of total RNA. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Read quality was assessed with FastQC and mapped against the Bd21-3v1.0 genome using bowtie2. Mapped reads were counted using summarised overlap, and differentially expressed genes were analysed using DeSeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

To avoid the variability in localisation patterns due to different focal planes, we always focused on the middle plane for single images after defining top and bottom of each imaged SMC. Also laser intensity for fluorophore excitation was kept constant for a specific line to allow direct comparison unless otherwise noted in the text or figure legends.</p><p>Image analysis and processing were carried out in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Polarity index</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Polarity Measurement</title><p>For POME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muroyama et al., 2020</xref>) analysis of BdPAN1-YFP and BdPOLAR-mVenus polarity in WT and mutant backgrounds, confocal images of the developmental zone of second (5~6 dpg) PI-stained leaves were acquired with a ×63 glycerol immersion objective and a ×2 zoom factor. Individual SMCs at stage 3 with strong and clear reporter signals were selected for the analysis. 19–33 SMCs were analysed for each genotype. For the BdPOLAR reporter lines, only cells with signal at the apical, basal, and distal PM were picked. Additionally, recently and incorrectly divided SMCs in both mutant backgrounds were excluded. In some instances where the SMCs were slightly skewed, a small z-stack was obtained and then projected to reveal the complete polarity domain before POME analysis. Fluorescence intensity at each pixel and angle was obtained in ImageJ/FIJI as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muroyama et al., 2020</xref>. Before running POME on a selected cell, the input parameters were specified for each individual cell in the POME FIJI macro. The obtained measurements were then imported, summarised, and analysed in RStudio (details available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muroyama et al., 2020</xref>). The polarity index was calculated as the fraction of fluorescence intensity values above the half maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2021a</xref>). Briefly, the maximum fluorescence intensity of each cell was determined, and the fraction of values above half of this maximum was calculated. The polarity indices of all analysed cells of the same condition were grouped and statistically compared to the other conditions with unpaired Mann-Whitney U-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Manual tracing</title><p>For manual polarity analysis of BdPAN1-YFP, BdPOLAR-mVenus, and BdTAN1-mCitrine polarity in WT, confocal images of the developmental zone of second (5~6 dpg) PI-stained leaves were acquired (midplane, ×63 glycerol immersion objective). Individual SMCs with reporter signal were selected for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Fluorescence intensity at each pixel of SMC PM was traced using the Segmented Line tool in Fiji. We always started tracing just above the GMC/SMC interface and completed the whole circumference to obtain the grey value of each pixel in the SMC circumference. The length and width of each neighbouring GMC were also measured using the Straight Line tool (see above ‘Nuclear migration assay’ for more details). The average fluorescence intensity of BdPAN1-YFP (n=13) and BdPOLAR-mVenus (n=8) each was normalised to their respective average maximum fluorescence intensity and plotted, together with a normalised standard error, displaying the GMC/SMC interface first and then displaying the remaining outline of the SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Average fluorescence intensity of BdTAN1-mCitrine (n=13) and BdPOLAR-mVenus was normalised to their respective average maximum fluorescence intensity. Here, we plotted the intensities of a 4 µm region just before and after the GMC. We did not include the GMC/SMC interface as they vary in length and would have offset the TAN1 and BdPOLAR domains after the GMC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Nuclear migration assay</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Staining assay</title><p>For nuclear staining experiments, we used the basal 0.5~1 cm developmental zone from second (5–6 dpg) leaves. First, leaf strips were rinsed with 1× PBST three times for 10 min each in vials, then 1 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 (Thermofisher) solution was added into vials, and vacuum was applied three times for 10 min each. Then leaf strips in vials were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature along with gentle shaking. Afterwards, we washed leaf strips with 1× PBST three times for 10 min each, then added 0.1% Direct red 23 (w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich) into vials, and applied vacuum three times for 10 min each, then incubated leaf strips 1 hr at room temperature along with gentle shaking. Next, we washed leaf strips again with 1× PBST three times for 10 min each. Finally, leaf strips were dried with paper and mounted in 50% Glycerol on slides. Direct red 23 and Hoechst 33342 were used to stain the cell wall and nuclei, respectively. Images were captured with the following excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) wavelengths (Ex/Em): Direct red 23 561 nm/600–650 nm and Hoechst 33342 405 nm/425–475 nm. Image analysis and processing were carried out in Fiji. The d distance, GMC length, and width were measured in Fiji using the ‘straight’ tool. The d distance was measured starting from the middle point of nuclei in SMC and ending at the middle point of the GMC/SMC interface. The GMC length was measured from the middle point of the apical side to the middle point of the basal side of the GMC. The GMC width was measured from the middle point of the left side to the middle point of the right side of the GMC. To avoid deviations of d distance measurement due to imaging at different Z-axis positions, we also measured the nuclear diameters per genotype, and they did not show a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For quantification of d distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), d distance linear regression in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and quantification of SMC nuclei diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), each SMC was considered as a replicate. In total 12–30 nuclei of 20–28 individual plants were analysed per genotype; double-blind examination was not performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Multi-parameter phenotyping of cellular defects on simultaneously grown plants</title><p>A quantitative experiment on simultaneously plate-grown BdPOLARp:BdTAN1-mCitrine lines in WT (n=19 individuals), <italic>bdpolar-1</italic> (n=23 individuals), and <italic>bdpan1-1</italic> (n=20 individuals) was performed. Plants were initially grown on plates in a growth chamber to the 5-6 dag stage for a collection of immature leaf 2 for SMC analysis, then in a greenhouse to 19 dag after transplanting to the soil, when % abnormal SCs were scored in leaf 3. The second leaf at 5–6 dag was used to measure nuclear migration and BdTAN1 localisation. The nuclear BdTAN1-mCitrine signal was used to quantify the distance d between the SMC nucleus and the GMC/SMC interface, and the LWR of the flanking SMCs was scored to consider only mature SMCs (i.e. flanking GMCs with an LWR &gt;0.9). BdTAN1 localisation was scored in the very same cells of the second leaf. The seedlings of which the second leaf was analysed were then transplanted to soil, and the third leaf was collected at 19 dag, fixed, and cleared. 11–21 fields of view per image at ×40 magnification were imaged and scored for aberrant SC divisions phenotype in the very same individuals that were analysed for the cellular defects of the second leaf. Blind scoring of phenotypes was achieved by having RS acquire and anonymise images and DZ score them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gas exchange measurements</title><p>Leaf-level gas exchange measurements were performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nunes et al., 2022</xref>. In short, LI-6800 Portable Photosynthesis System (Li-COR Biosciences Inc) was used to measure the youngest, fully expanded leaf (17–21 days after sowing). The LI-6800 was equipped with a Multiphase Flash Fluorometer (6800–01 A) chamber head, and the conditions were as follows: flow rate, 500 µmol s<sup>–1</sup>; fan speed, 10,000 rpm; leaf temperature, 28°C; relative humidity (RH), 40%; [CO<sub>2</sub>], 400 µmol mol<sup>–1</sup>; photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), 1000–100 – 1000–0 µmol PAR m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> (20 min per light step). Stomatal conductance (<italic>g</italic><sub>sw</sub>) measurements were automatically logged every minute.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michelle Facette (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) To address the concerns of reviewers 1 and 2 about the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between BdPOLAR and BdPAN1 localization without dual localization of proteins with contrasting FP tags, quantitative analysis is needed to integrate and compare the distribution of BdPOLAR-VENUS vs. BdPAN1-YFP for a population of wild type SMCs (also in the pan1 mutant background, for BdPOLAR-VENUS). A suggestion here is to use data for a single focal plane at a consistent depth (e.g. the midplane), measuring signal intensity along the entire SMC face adjoining GMC + interstomatal cells, for SMCs with a length:width ratio &gt;0.9 where the nucleus is almost always polarized in wild type, but not selected for conformity to the distribution illustrated schematically in Figure 6A. It is further suggested to use plants whose BdPOLAR-VENUS signal intensity is in the &quot;weak&quot; category (as defined for purposes of Figure S4, while explaining in methods or figure legend how that was defined). The rationale for these suggestions is two-fold: (1) Some of the variability in localization patterns seen in the figures may be due to lumping together SMCs at different stages of SMC polarization and/or looking at different focal planes. (2) SMC division defects in BdPOLAR lines with higher expression levels (Figures S4D and perhaps also S4B) may be due to BdPOLAR mislocalization so it makes sense to focus the analysis on lines with low expression. In displaying the results, please indicate the boundaries of the SMC-GMC interface so that signal peaks can be related to these boundaries. Please specify in methods that standardized imaging conditions were used to permit direct comparisons. Note: fulfilling this request will not necessarily require swapping out existing micrograph panels displaying localization findings, however, I concur with the reviewers that Figure 2C and 2F, and the corresponding movies, are more confusing than helpful and that Figure 2G is low priority, so these panels could be replaced with results of quantitative analyses with no loss of impact. The outcome of this quantitative analysis should dictate whether the use of the term &quot;opposite&quot; to describe BdPOLAR vs. BdPAN1 localization patterns (in the title and elsewhere) is appropriate, i.e. if the patterns are perfectly complementary as implied by this term. If not, that's fine but other terminology can be used such as &quot;divergent&quot;.</p><p>(2) To address similar concerns of reviewers 1 and 2 regarding the lack of clarity in the relationship between BdPOLAR-VENUS vs. BdTAN1-citrine distribution in wild-type plants, quantitative analysis of the same sort requested in (1) is needed to support the conclusion that BdTAN1 rings are located at sites of BdPOLAR depletion, as illustrated schematically in Figure 6.</p><p>(3) Clarification is needed to address the concerns of reviewer 1 about the implausible implications of data shown in Figure 4F and the overall picture emerging from the analyses presented in Figures 4B-C and Figure 4E-F. Suggestion: repeat SMC nuclear polarization (Figure 4B-C) and BdTAN1 localization analyses (Figure 4E-F) on a common population of plants grown under the same conditions, whose % defective subsidiaries is also counted and presented, e.g. in a mature portion of the same leaf whose SMC division zone is used for the analysis. If there is a way to visualize nuclei enabling classification of the division stage as part of the TAN1 analysis, that would be ideal but won't be considered essential. Alternatively, the data presented in Figure 4A-F could be dropped from the manuscript, as it wasn't considered essential for key conclusions. If an additional analysis is done and the conclusions hold up, please discuss the seemingly contradictory findings that pan1 mutants have a higher frequency of unpolarized nuclei, yet a lower proportion of SMCs with improperly specified division planes, compared to Bdpolar mutants.</p><p>(4) Revise the discussion of &quot;division competence&quot; in light of reviewer 1's point 3.</p><p>(5) Please attend to the revisions affecting text or figure composition only (no additional experiments or data analysis needed) as recommended by all 3 reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This impactful work should be published, and I don't feel further experiments are necessary. However, I do think the authors should address some inconsistencies in the data, either through rewriting or even potentially leaving some data out.</p><p>Figures 1-3 and data therein are beautiful and well controlled. I personally found the top panel in figure S3B more interesting/illustrative than panel G – at the authors' discretion, perhaps consider swapping them?</p><p>Re MUTE: &quot;This observation suggested that BdPAN1 polarisation was independent of a successful establishment lateral cell files and indicated that either biochemical or mechanical signals from the elongating GMC polarise BdPAN1.&quot; Yes possible (and most likely true) but not the only possibility – MUTE could, in theory, be downstream of PAN1. E.g., the pathway could conceivably be PAN1&gt;MUTE&gt;POLAR, based on available data. I doubt it's true – but it's plausible. (Also, thank you for doing this – I've wanted to know for ages – have you looked at MUTE in pan1 yet?).</p><p>Primary concerns:</p><p>(1) My biggest concern is with the data in Figure 4F – something doesn't quite &quot;jive&quot; and a lot of inference is drawn from observed differences between pan1 and polar. According to Figure 1, pan1 mutants (in Brachy) have something like ~40% abnormal subsidiaries. If only ~10% of the TAN localization is wrong – that means something goes wrong in Brachy pan1 AFTER the division site is specified – i.e. during phragmoplast guidance. This would be rather shocking, and completely different from maize. It implies that the primary defect in pan1 is not due to polarization, but rather a phragmoplast guidance defect. Coupled with the data that pan1 is (mildly) more affected in nuclear polarization – at least moreso than polar – (as indicated in Figure 4C/Table S5C), yet polar has a more severe defect in TAN localization, the whole thing together leaves me scratching my head.</p><p>Ultimately, the data are the data – and since everything is so well controlled I trust it, but I think this has to either be addressed in the text, or careful analysis if some bias was inadvertently introduced. In our lab, we see pretty large variations in % abnormal cells in greenhouse-grown plants. Were the plants within an experiment grown at the same time? Was the quantification done double-blind? How many individual plants (vs cells) were counted – could a single &quot;bad&quot; plant be throwing off the numbers?</p><p>If you are confident the numbers are all correct – then I think you must discuss why pan1 mutants have an increased % abnormal subsidiary cells, relatively greater defect in nuclear polarization, yet very little defect in division site specification.</p><p>(2) In Figure 4C, n is in the hundreds. I think your p-value might be artificially inflated. I almost wonder if Table S5C is more clear in getting the point across than this scatter plot, which I think indicates that both polar-1 and pan1 have nuclear polarization defects (although the double mutant has a similar defect to pan1. Given that your three alleles of polar have different % defects, and polar-2 is more similar to pan1 polar-1 appears to be a weaker allele, for some unclear reason), I wonder if the difference between pan1 and polar-1 is because you have a weak allele, in which case I would hesitate to interpret them as terribly different.</p><p>Coupled with this, I think the assertion that PAN1 governs or guides the nucleus is a bit strong – in many cases the nucleus is just fine. I suggest using &quot;promotes&quot; nuclear polarization. Governs also imply a somewhat direct relationship – which I don't believe there is evidence for here, or in maize.</p><p>Putting together 1 and 2 – I honestly feel that a slightly less strong interpretation of nuclear polarization (i.e., that both mutants have a polarization defect) and leaving out figure D-F would have no negative effect on the conclusions, model or impact of the paper. The localization is amazing and interesting! The fact that you know POLAR is dependent on PAN1 is cool! There are future papers to be had here, and I think in future work, (re-)looking a TAN-YFP in conjunction with a microtubule (PPB) marker would clarify things. (Theoretically, you could look at PPBs using immunostaining, but I feel this is beyond the scope necessary here.)</p><p>A suggestion, also related to figure 4:</p><p>(3) Figure 4G to 4I, regarding the number of aberrant divisions and &quot;cell division capacity&quot;.</p><p>I think this is useful for you to know, but ultimately, I think your interpretation of the data should be as you want. Acceptance of this manuscript should not be contingent on changing any of this – this is meant to be informative/helpful.</p><p>In maize mutants (pan1, pan2, brk1, dcd1, dcd2/o1, etc.) these repeated divisions are quite common, including in mutants I would describe as &quot;late stage&quot; (e.g. o1) where there are no polarity defects. I scoured past papers and realized that we don't really explicitly talk about it much (and perhaps even inadvertently avoided images showing it), so mea culpa. The fact that SMCs divide once, and only once, is an important and interesting point (indeed – it makes this model system unique from many other asymmetric in that it is NOT a stem cell division), and carefully documenting it is useful. We can even see SMCs that are in the process of re-dividing after the oriented division of the GMC. I think the most likely explanation for repeated rounds of division is when the division plane is incorrect, subsidiary fate is not specified – perhaps due to incorrect segregation (or concentration of?) known or unknown fate factors. Note that incorrectly divided subsidiaries, fate is sometimes, and sometimes not, correctly specified (see Gallagher and Smith, 2000).</p><p>I can see why you hypothesized that POLAR contributes to &quot;capacity&quot;, based on the known roles of AtPOLAR. I am unconvinced from the data that polar and pan1 are meaningfully different in this regard – in both cases multiple divisions are happening many times (as opposed to the near zero times in wildtype). This is especially true since you only have a single allele for each mutant, and again, it is unclear how many different plants (as opposed to cells) are analyzed. Coupled with the head-scratcher in 4F – I might not speculate to the extent that these data suggest unique functions for PAN1 and POLAR. The extrapolation that POLAR might be uniquely related to division capacity seems like a big stretch. On the other hand, these data link the only discussion of how At and Bd POLAR might have opposing functions, so it might be nice to keep some discussion, in conjunction with an alternate hypothesis. Either way, I think this is the author's call, but wanted to share these observations.</p><p>Other notes: I think something that would be lovely to have done is to make PAN1 and POLAR localization constructs in different colors, so they could be imaged at the same time. I think it is NOT worth holding up publication for this – but I spent a long time looking at Figure 2 trying to figure out how the PAN1 &quot;stripes&quot; overlap (or don't) with POLAR. It would also help resolve the relative timing of the two proteins. Similarly, I tried to determine if POLAR lines up with where the PPB/division zone is. POLAR seems to be excluded from a discrete domain that seems to align more closely with the PPB than PAN1 in the &quot;shoulders&quot; and I don't know if that is consistent or just in the images in Figure 2F. In particular, a microtubule marker to determine how the division site aligns (or does not) would be useful. Since PAN1 is pretty far away from the division site, how or why.</p><p>Finally – I think the abstract gives short shrift to how you discovered POLAR (transcriptional profiling of mute) and I think, based on my critique, overemphasizes &quot;distinct roles&quot; for POLAR and PAN1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. &quot;ABdPAN1p:BdPAN1-YFP reporter line was expressed…at the cell periphery (Figure 2A; Figure S3A).&quot; Delete &quot;line&quot;.</p><p>2. Equilateral triangular arrowheads are used to point to the objects in Figures 2E and 3E. However, it is difficult to identify the points indicated by these marks. Replace them with irregular arrowheads as seen in Figure 4E.</p><p>3. &quot;Just after cell division, BdPOLAR quickly dissociated from the distal PMs (Figure 2E; Figure S3B).&quot; Is this the correct figure citation? I could not recognize BdPOLAR dissociating from PMs in Figure 2E.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading this manuscript and am particularly excited about your findings regarding BdPOLAR polar localization and function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) To address the concerns of reviewers 1 and 2 about the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between BdPOLAR and BdPAN1 localization without dual localization of proteins with contrasting FP tags, quantitative analysis is needed to integrate and compare the distribution of BdPOLAR-VENUS vs. BdPAN1-YFP for a population of wild type SMCs (also in the pan1 mutant background, for BdPOLAR-VENUS).

First of all, we provide more details regarding image acquisition to visualize polarity domains (p. 20). Indeed, we always imaged the midplane of SMCs, which we determine by identifying the top and bottom of each SMC. Also, laser intensity was kept constant within a line to allow direct comparison, except where we specifically mention that this was not the case.</p><p>Second, we manually traced the outlines of SMCs expressing BdPAN1-YFP (LWR &gt;0.8) or “weak” BdPOLAR-YFP (LWR &gt;0.9) to determine where polarity domains reside relative to one another (see new <italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 2</italic> for an overview of the analyzed cells). We have used SMCs with a LWR &gt;0.8 for BdPAN1-YFP cells, as BdPAN1 is solidly polarized much earlier than BdPOLAR. We plotted the average fluorescence intensity of the two markers in the same plot, always displaying the GMC/SMC interface first and then displaying the remaining outline of the SMCs. This plot and a schematic model of what it is representing are now displayed as <italic>Figure 2E</italic> replacing Figure 2C and 2F. The data becomes quite noisy towards the end as SMCs tend to have different sizes (and thus different cell circumferences), but it is obvious that BdPOLAR is the lowest and BdPAN1 is the highest at the GMC interface. While it is not perfectly complementary (i.e. there is a part of the SMC where neither BdPAN1 nor BdPOLAR are detected), we still would strongly argue for these polarity domains to be opposite. Imaging conditions were standardized within a maker line but are slightly different between marker lines (i.e. laser intensity) as they are expressed at different levels. We have therefore normalized the average fluorescence intensity levels of each reporter for direct comparison (relative average fluorescence intensity was plotted). We have included a paragraph regarding this analysis in the results part on p. 6 and added detailed methods on p. 21.</p><p>We agree that analysis of both BdPAN1 and BdPOLAR reporters in the same cells would be an excellent addition, and to this end, we generated a dual marker line (BdPAN1p:BdPAN1-CFP; BdPOLARp:BdPOLAR-mCitrine). However, we found that the BdPAN1-CFP signal was too weak compared to the mCitrine signal to be able to visualize the proximal BdPAN1 domain. It is a lengthy process and technical challenge to create dual reporter lines in grasses, and because of this disappointing dual-reporter result, we instead focused on the quantitative analysis of reporter distribution detailed in the previous paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To address similar concerns of reviewers 1 and 2 regarding the lack of clarity in the relationship between BdPOLAR-VENUS vs. BdTAN1-citrine distribution in wild-type plants, quantitative analysis of the same sort requested in (1) is needed to support the conclusion that BdTAN1 rings are located at sites of BdPOLAR depletion, as illustrated schematically in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested we have generated a very similar analysis of BdPOLAR-YFP and BdTAN1-mCitrine. We re-used the data from above for BdPOLAR-YFP (same as Figure 2E) and in addition, manually traced the circumference of BdTAN1-mCitrine lines. We again normalized the average fluorescence intensity for each line and plotted the normalized fluorescence intensity of the 4µm before and after the GMC/SMC interface. We did not plot the signal along the GMC/SMC interfaces as these varied in size and would have created variable TAN1 peaks and POLAR gaps after the GMC/SMC interface. The plot and one representative image are now shown as new Figure 4G-I. This figure replaces previous panels (Figure 4G-I, division capacity control) which we moved to the supplementary information to address point 4 and the criticism about division competence (see below). We added a few sentences explaining our observations in the result part (p. 9) and provided details regarding the analysis in the methods (p. 21)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Clarification is needed to address the concerns of reviewer 1 about the implausible implications of data shown in Figure 4F and the overall picture emerging from the analyses presented in Figures 4B-C and Figure 4E-F.

Indeed, it is unexpected that we observe so few cortical division site defects (i.e. BdTAN1 localization) when observing relatively frequent SC division defects. Particularly in <italic>bdpan1,</italic> where nuclei are not polarized normally, we get &lt;10% BdTAN1 localization defects but ~40% of aberrant SCs. We agree that this is in stark contrast to the recent observations in maize (Ashraf et al. (2022) bioRxiv).</p><p>Again, we have undertaken several efforts to address these seemingly conflicting observations. First and as requested, we have repeated the quantification of nuclear migration defects, BdTAN1 localization and mature SC division defects on a set of simultaneously grown BdTAN1-mCitrine reporter lines in WT, <italic>bdpolar</italic> and <italic>bdpan1</italic> backgrounds. Importantly, the person that took the images (RS) anonymized the images and the first author DZ then analyzed the randomized images. We used the weak nuclear BdTAN1-mCitrine signal to quantify the distance d between SMC nucleus and the GMC/SMC interface (again considering LWR of the flanking SMCs), and have scored the BdTAN1 localization in the very same cells of the second leaf. We then collected the third leaf at 19 dag and scored the mature SC division phenotype in these very same individuals. Not only could we confirm the results in Figure 4, we now only observe nuclear migration defects in <italic>bdpan1</italic> and not in <italic>bdpolar</italic> and find a similar frequency of mature SC division defects in <italic>bdpan1</italic> and <italic>bdpolar</italic>. We have included the new data in <italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F and G,</italic> added a paragraph in the results part to address the new experiment (p. 9) and summarized the methods in detail (p. 22).</p><p>Second, we have addressed these unexpected observations in a new paragraph in the discussion part on p. 12. We address that indeed polarity defects in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> SMCs could affect phragmoplast-related processes. In addition, we offer a hypothesis that considers the cell geometry of SMCs, which seems to differ between <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and maize; in particular, SMCs in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> are less wide relative to their length and usually do not present distinctly skewed cell walls just above and below the GMC/SMC interface. We, therefore, speculate that the extending phragmoplast is more likely to short-cut to the distal wall in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> SMCs when SMC polarity is compromised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Revise the discussion of &quot;division competence&quot; in light of reviewer 1's point 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank Prof. Facette for openly sharing her findings that this seems to be a common observation in many of her SMC polarity and ACD mutants.

Nonetheless, the repeated, “simultaneous, double-blind” experiment supported our previous findings and this is why we think it is appropriate to retain the data in Figure 4D-E.</p><p>Regarding immunostainings and/or microtubule markers to visualize PPB, the developmental zone in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> is much smaller than in maize and there are only a handful of SMCs that polarize and divide per leaf (hence the high number of individuals (often &gt;20) required for these analyses). Therefore, visualizing the highly transient PPB using immunostainings is very hard in our hands (we tried), which is why we decided to use the mitotically stable TAN1 marker instead.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A suggestion, also related to figure 4:</p><p>(3) Figure 4G to 4I, regarding the number of aberrant divisions and &quot;cell division capacity&quot;.</p><p>I think this is useful for you to know, but ultimately, I think your interpretation of the data should be as you want. Acceptance of this manuscript should not be contingent on changing any of this – this is meant to be informative/helpful.</p><p>In maize mutants (pan1, pan2, brk1, dcd1, dcd2/o1, etc.) these repeated divisions are quite common, including in mutants I would describe as &quot;late stage&quot; (e.g. o1) where there are no polarity defects. I scoured past papers and realized that we don't really explicitly talk about it much (and perhaps even inadvertently avoided images showing it), so mea culpa. The fact that SMCs divide once, and only once, is an important and interesting point (indeed – it makes this model system unique from many other asymmetric in that it is NOT a stem cell division), and carefully documenting it is useful. We can even see SMCs that are in the process of re-dividing after the oriented division of the GMC. I think the most likely explanation for repeated rounds of division is when the division plane is incorrect, subsidiary fate is not specified – perhaps due to incorrect segregation (or concentration of?) known or unknown fate factors. Note that incorrectly divided subsidiaries, fate is sometimes, and sometimes not, correctly specified (see Gallagher and Smith, 2000).</p><p>I can see why you hypothesized that POLAR contributes to &quot;capacity&quot;, based on the known roles of AtPOLAR. I am unconvinced from the data that polar and pan1 are meaningfully different in this regard – in both cases multiple divisions are happening many times (as opposed to the near zero times in wildtype). This is especially true since you only have a single allele for each mutant, and again, it is unclear how many different plants (as opposed to cells) are analyzed. Coupled with the head-scratcher in 4F – I might not speculate to the extent that these data suggest unique functions for PAN1 and POLAR. The extrapolation that POLAR might be uniquely related to division capacity seems like a big stretch. On the other hand, these data link the only discussion of how At and Bd POLAR might have opposing functions, so it might be nice to keep some discussion, in conjunction with an alternate hypothesis. Either way, I think this is the author's call, but wanted to share these observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank Prof. Facette for this carefully argued, very valid comment and for sharing that in the maize mutants these repeated divisions are common yet nowhere explicitly stated. We have indeed looked at this knowing that AtPOLAR controls division capacity in Arabidopsis. We have moved Figure 4G-I into supplemental materials and now discuss this observation still in the light of AtPOLAR’s function, but not implying a unique role for BdPOLAR compared to BdPAN1.</p><p>In addition, we would like to mention that (at least in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> and other Pooid systems (Stebbins and Shah, 1960)) some SMCs flank two GMCs and asymmetrically divide twice (which make SMCs kind of a stem cell). Yet how this is regulated is unclear. It could be that there is a signal from GMCs that keep division competency high.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other notes: I think something that would be lovely to have done is to make PAN1 and POLAR localization constructs in different colors, so they could be imaged at the same time. I think it is NOT worth holding up publication for this – but I spent a long time looking at Figure 2 trying to figure out how the PAN1 &quot;stripes&quot; overlap (or don't) with POLAR. It would also help resolve the relative timing of the two proteins. Similarly, I tried to determine if POLAR lines up with where the PPB/division zone is. POLAR seems to be excluded from a discrete domain that seems to align more closely with the PPB than PAN1 in the &quot;shoulders&quot; and I don't know if that is consistent or just in the images in Figure 2F. In particular, a microtubule marker to determine how the division site aligns (or does not) would be useful. Since PAN1 is pretty far away from the division site, how or why.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have tried generating a dual marker line (BdPAN1p:BdPAN1-CFP; BdPOLARp:BdPOLAR-mCitrine), yet unfortunately, the BdPAN1-CFP signal (compared to mCitrine signal) was too weak to visualize the proximal BdPAN1 domain in these lines.</p><p>To determine how BdPOLAR and BdPAN1 relate spatially to each other, we have added data in <italic>Figure 2E</italic> where we manually traced mature SMC outlines to determine BdPOLAR-mVenus and BdPAN1-mCitrine occupancy along the SMC’s circumference. This confirmed that the polarization is indeed opposite yet not perfectly reciprocal (see details above, Essential Revisions #1). We did the same thing for BdTAN1-mCitrine and plotted relative average fluorescence intensity in <italic>Figure 4G-I</italic> nicely showing that BdTAN1 indeed resides in the BdPOLAR gaps above and below the GMC (again, details above, Essential Revisions #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally – I think the abstract gives short shrift to how you discovered POLAR (transcriptional profiling of mute) and I think, based on my critique, overemphasizes &quot;distinct roles&quot; for POLAR and PAN1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the abstract to highlight how we discovered BdPOLAR and toned down “distinct roles” to “diverse/various roles” as both proteins might contribute to each other's function on a cellular level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. &quot;ABdPAN1p:BdPAN1-YFP reporter line was expressed…at the cell periphery (Figure 2A; Figure S3A).&quot; Delete &quot;line&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
