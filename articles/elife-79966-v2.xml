These events are linked to a clearance of damaged tissue prior to blastema formation and regeneration of the missing structures. Here, we report the resorption of calcified skeletal tissue as an active, cell-driven, and highly regulated event. This process, carried out by osteoclasts, is essential for a successful integration of the newly formed skeleton. Indeed, the extent of resorption is directly correlated with the integration efficiency, and treatment with zoledronic acid resulted in osteoclast function inhibition and failed tissue integration. Moreover, we identified the wound epithelium as a regulator of skeletal resorption, likely releasing signals involved in recruitment/differentiation of osteoclasts. Finally, we reported a correlation between resorption and blastema formation, particularly, a coordination of resorption with cartilage condensation. In sum, our results identify resorption as a major event upon amputation, playing a critical role in the overall process of skeletal regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axolotl</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>skeleton</kwd><kwd>osteoclasts</kwd><kwd>integration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SA 3349/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riquelme-Guzmán</surname><given-names>Camilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DFG Research Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>432439166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandoval-Guzmán</surname><given-names>Tatiana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo evaluation of mineralized skeleton in the regenerating axolotl limb reveals a significant osteoclast-driven resorption as an early event with long-lasting impact for tissue integration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) has the ability to regenerate different body structures, including the limbs. Besides making new cells of the right type at the right place, a successful regeneration requires a functional integration of those new cells with the pre-existing tissue, a process that has not been widely studied. In particular, it remains unknown how early processes impact tissue integration.</p><p>In general, regeneration progression is marked by different overlapping phases, which lead to the re-establishment of the missing limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sandoval-Guzmán and Currie, 2018</xref>). Two of the most critical events are the formation of the wound epithelium (WE) and the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanaka, 2016</xref>). The WE is formed by migrating keratinocytes, which close the wound in just a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay and Fischman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Repesh and Oberpriller, 1978</xref>). Importantly, the WE is characterized by the absence of a basal lamina, which enhances the diffusion of important factors for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neufeld and Aulthouse, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Repesh and Oberpriller, 1978</xref>). Indeed, the WE is a major regulator of the immune response, tissue histolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>), and blastema proliferation and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boilly and Albert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, several works have demonstrated that the WE is required for blastema formation and thus, regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thornton, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The blastema is a heterogenous pool of progenitor cells arising from the various tissues at the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>). The connective tissue (CT), a conglomerate of different cell types, is a critical cell source for the blastema, supplying over 40% of the cells within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunis and Namenwirth, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Muneoka et al., 1986</xref>). A particular case is the skeleton: cells embedded in the tissue do not actively participate in regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>), instead, CT cells (dermal and periskeletal) rebuild the new skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunis and Namenwirth, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Muneoka et al., 1986</xref>). Although the skeleton represents more than 50% of the exposed surface upon amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hutchison et al., 2007</xref>), it is unclear the role the embedded cells play in the remodeling and integration of new tissue.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the skeletal system is essential for the limb, serving as a physical scaffold and allowing locomotion. Juvenile axolotls present a cartilaginous skeleton composed of chondrocytes and perichondral cells, which progressively ossifies from the time animals reach sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riquelme-Guzmán et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, mammalian appendicular skeleton develops by endochondral ossification, a process where a cartilage anlage is replaced by bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>). To maintain skeletal homeostasis, a key cell type is the osteoclast, a myeloid-derived population, which mediates the degradation of the cartilage matrix prior to bone formation.</p><p>Osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells with a specialized morphology adapted for skeletal resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cappariello et al., 2014</xref>). Besides their role in homeostasis, osteoclasts are recruited upon bone injuries or trauma. The most studied case is fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>) however, in the context of regeneration, osteoclasts are recruited after fin amputation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum and Begemann, 2015</xref>) and digit tip amputation in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernando et al., 2011</xref>). In urodeles, evidence of osteoclast-mediated resorption is scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischman and Hay, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tank et al., 1976</xref>). Nevertheless, the presence of myeloid cells triggered by the amputation has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debuque et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leigh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodgers et al., 2020</xref>), and the participation of macrophages was shown to be critical. Indeed, ablating macrophages completely halt regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results were observed in mouse digit tip amputation, and furthermore, a specific osteoclast inhibition resulted in delayed bone resorption, wound closure, and blastema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simkin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Immune cells are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vicinity of the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stocum, 2017</xref>), helping the mobilization of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thornton, 1938a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thornton, 1938b</xref>). Accordingly, macrophage ablation resulted in a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). Essential for successful regeneration, histolysis is characterized by the release of proteolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vinarsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang and Bryant, 1994</xref>) and is partially controlled by the WE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vinarsky et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Limb regeneration is achieved by a complete amalgamation (integration) of the regenerated structures with the mature tissues. Although the regenerated limb is often considered a perfect replica of the pre-existing limb, in the last decade regeneration fidelity has been addressed by a couple of works. For instance, abnormalities were observed in 80% of larvae due to conspecific bites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2014</xref>), and in over 50% of amputated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bothe et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is still unknown why such phenotypes are observed, and what entails successful versus unsuccessful regeneration. In this regard, regeneration-specific signals in the stump tissue could prime the limb and promote a successful integration. In the newt <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>, structural changes in the ECM of the distal humerus can be observed after an elbow joint amputation, demonstrating a correlation between ECM remodeling and proper joint regeneration as well as integration to the mature tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>With all the aforementioned evidence, we sought to assess the significance of skeletal histolysis for regeneration. We observed a rapid skeletal resorption which is carried out by osteoclasts, and we provide evidence that this process is essential for tissue integration. Moreover, we propose a role for the WE in resorption induction and a spatiotemporal coordination between resorption and blastema formation. Overall, our work provides an in-depth assessment of how a remodeling process influences the final outcome of regeneration using the axolotl limb.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Skeletal elements are resorbed upon amputation</title><p>To determine the changes in the skeleton upon amputation, we used the stable calcium-binding dyes calcein and alizarin red. These dyes label mineralized cartilage in juvenile axolotls, allowing in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riquelme-Guzmán et al., 2021</xref>). Using 4–6 cm snout-to-tail (ST) axolotls, we amputated the zeugopod at the distal end of the calcified tissue and imaged at different days post amputation (dpa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed a consistent reduction in the calcein<sup>+</sup> tissue from 7 to 12 dpa. We quantified the length of the calcified tissue in both zeugopodial elements and compared them to the initial length at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Resorption initiated after 7 dpa and by 12 dpa, over 40% of the calcified radius and 60% of the calcified ulna were resorbed (length resorbed radius: 342.83±95.75 µm; ulna: 770.67±94.34 µm). We pooled five independent experiments and noticed an important variability between assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, each color represents an assay). The median for radius resorption is 40% and for ulna 60%; however, in several cases the calcified tissue was completely resorbed in both elements. Although an inter-assay variability was observed, intra-assay animals presented a consistent resorption ratio.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Skeletal elements are resorbed upon amputation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of resorption during zeugopod regeneration.

Similar to the zeugopod, we quantified the calcein<sup>+</sup> tissue length at different dpa and revealed a similar trend in the resorptive dynamics: resorption starting after 7 dpa and receding by 13 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), vanishing over 50% of the calcified tissue length (320.43±113.56 µm).</p><p>Finally, we collected limbs at 9 and 15 dpa and stained them with alcian blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). At 9 dpa, we observed resorption in both radius and ulna. Remarkably, we occasionally observed a break in the ulna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> arrowhead) that sometimes led to the extrusion of the skeletal fragment through the epidermis.

At this stage, limbs are fully formed but they have not reached yet full size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tank et al., 1976</xref>). Looking at the gross morphology, resorption inhibition did not halt regeneration, as zol-treated animals were able to form a new limb. We assessed integration by sequential stainings using calcium binding dyes of different colors. We distinguished the original calcification (calcein<sup>+</sup>) from the calcification of regenerated skeletal elements (alizarin red<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel). In contralateral limbs, alizarin red staining showed new calcification after 0 dpa. Comparatively, we observed no calcein<sup>+</sup> tissue in the untreated animals, indicating a full resorption of the calcified tissue in the radius and ulna. The alizarin red<sup>+</sup> region demonstrated regeneration of the skeleton. In zol-treated animals, at least half of the calcified region was calcein<sup>+</sup>/alizarin red<sup>+</sup>, confirming resorption inhibition.

A correlation between resorption rate and integration efficiency could be observed, particularly for the radius. In a zol-treated animal, with null resorption in the radius (R:0), the distal end of the stump and the proximal end of the regenerated skeleton failed to meet. The regenerated skeleton formed at an adjacent plane, therefore lacking continuity with the pre-existing skeleton. Moreover, a secondary condensation zone was seen, as cartilage also formed distal to the unresorbed tissue. To consistently quantify integration success, we generated a score matrix (Materials and methods), which provided values of 0–4 to the different integration phenotypes. Faithfully regenerated elements had lower values than malformed elements. We calculated the score for each radius and ulna and correlated them with the resorption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For both skeletal elements there was a correlation between resorption and integration success, particularly for the radius, in which the most dramatic phenotypes were observed.

We collected untreated limbs at 90 dpa and stained them with alcian blue/alizarin red. In 6/6 limbs screened, in which the resorption rate was over 50% for both elements, we could still observe a faulty integration of both radius and ulna (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This imperfect integration was identified by an angulation at the stump-regenerated interphase, similar to what we reported at 45 dpa.</p><p>As resorption has a clear impact on skeletal integration during regeneration, we sought to analyze the ECM organization and its changes at the stump-regenerated interphase using quantitative polarization microscopy (LC-PolScope) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oldenbourg, 1996</xref>). In zol-treated limbs, the phenotype is disruptive and thus hinders any attempt to assess ECM organization, therefore, we used limb sections from normally regenerated animals for our analysis (i.e. untreated). By looking at the ECM organization (retardance image), we observed a clear difference in the hypertrophic zone (HZ) of regenerated ulnas when compared to the contralateral limb (arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We believe that this region in the HZ corresponded to the stump-regenerated interphase. Next, using the retardance image, we created a digital mask that allowed us to quantify the orientation of the ECM components using the slow axis orientation image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lower panels). We defined two regions, the HZ, where the interphase is found, and the resting zone (RZ), a control region proximal to the amputation plane. We generated a histogram representing the angle distribution in each zone. We observed that the HZ in the contralateral ulnas presented a parallel organization of the ECM respect to the proximodistal axis, while the regenerated presented a shift in the organization, with the ECM fibers arranged perpendicularly. The RZ remained unchanged in both sample sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This result shows that the regenerated ECM does not recapitulate the original structure and supports the idea that skeletal regeneration is not completely efficient in the axolotl.</p><p>Altogether, these results show the importance of resorption during skeletal regeneration and its requirement for integration of the regenerated tissue.

Morphologically, the WE is characterized by the absence of a basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neufeld and Aulthouse, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Repesh and Oberpriller, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>); hence, we used this feature to correlate the WE and resorption in untreated animals. We collected and sectioned limbs at 1, 5, and 7 dpa and performed Masson’s trichrome staining. The lack of a basal lamina was observed by the absence of collagen staining in blue (yellow arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Osteoclasts could be identified by their multiple nuclei and morphology. As expected, we did not observe any osteoclast at 1 dpa. At 5 dpa, we identified the first infiltration of the skeletal elements, albeit a small number of osteoclasts (white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Finally, we saw pronounced infiltration at 7 dpa, including the presence of osteoclasts (white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>). Notably, most of these cells were located in the proximity of the WE. To evaluate the location of osteoclasts, we defined a region by drawing a line between the edges of the WE, and we mapped the position of each osteoclast at 7dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Most of the osteoclasts were located in the region covered by the WE, i.e., in the distal part of the skeletal elements. In the more proximal regions of the zeugopod, we did not observe any osteoclasts. This analysis was confirmed using our <italic>Ctsk:eGFP</italic> line at 7 dpa. We imaged sections for eGFP and nuclear labeling prior to performing Masson’s trichrome staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Our analysis suggests factors expressed in the epithelial fraction as potential candidates regulating osteoclastogenesis during regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Skeletal resorption and blastema formation are spatially and temporally correlated</title><p>Blastema formation is the accumulation of progenitor cells at the amputation plane. However, taking resorption into consideration, those cells might initially accumulate (or reprogram) more proximal to the amputation plane. Here, we showed that resorption can reach up to 100% of the calcified tissue; and hence, the accumulation of progenitor cells might occur up to 1 mm behind the amputation plane. With this in mind, we sought to assess the blastema specification in the context of skeletal resorption.</p><p>First, we measured the blastema surface in images taken at 15 dpa, when resorption is completed and blastema already formed in zol-treated animals. We considered the distal end of the skeletal elements as the starting point of blastema, as it was proposed as the zone where progenitor cells accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tank et al., 1976</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, we found a significant decrease in blastema area in zol-treated animals (yellow dashed line). However, the number of proliferative cells (as measured by EdU staining) did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Importantly, we showed that resorption inhibition does not halt regeneration; and hence, the accumulation of progenitor cells cannot be defined by the position of the skeleton. To efficiently analyze the blastema position during resorption, we used molecular markers. First, we performed whole mount EdU staining at different dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, two independent experiments). Similar to previous reports, in an intact limb, EdU<sup>+</sup> cells are less than 0.5% of the total cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). At 7 dpa, we observed EdU<sup>+</sup> cells behind the amputation plane, spanning over more than 500 µm. These cells were located where we expected to observe resorption. Interestingly, several EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were located in the periskeleton (arrowheads), which could account for cells contributing to skeletal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCusker et al., 2016</xref>). These cells were found along most of the skeletal element length. At 10 dpa, when resorption is occurring, we observed a more defined blastema (white arrowhead), which contained EdU<sup>+</sup> cells. Similar to 7 dpa, a significant proportion of those EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were located next to the resorbing skeleton. Finally, at 15 dpa, we observed an evident reduction in the skeletal length (yellow arrowheads) and a defined blastema distal to those skeletal elements (white dashed line). At this point, very few EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were found next to the skeleton.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Skeletal resorption and blastema formation are spatially and temporally correlated.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of blastema size in zoledronic acid-treated limbs at 15 dpa.

At 0 dpa, no mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells were found outside the calcified tissue. At 9 dpa, we observed a break in the calcified phalanx (arrowhead), which shows the place where resorption was initiated. At 11 dpa, some mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells started to group distal to the resorbed calcified tissue (white arrowhead). Those cells represent the initial condensation of the regenerating cartilage. Interestingly, at 13 dpa, resorption continued (yellow arrowhead) and the number and density of mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells increased. Finally, resorption was finished at 15 dpa, and the condensation of mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells in the new phalanx presented a defined pattern. The condensation observed from 11 dpa occurred behind the amputation plane and parallel to resorption. Indeed, we observed condensation of mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells while eGFP<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts were still present at the same plane in the skeleton at 11 and 13 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In sum, resorption and skeletal regeneration are overlapping processes, as condensation of cartilage progenitors occurs in the presence of osteoclast behind the amputation plane.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Axolotl limb regeneration is an intricate multi-step process that requires the fine-tuning of events such as wound closure, tissue repair, progenitor cells recruitment, and the re-establishment of the functional unit. Although extensive work has been done to understand the cellular dynamics of blastema formation, other processes such as tissue histolysis, the immune response, and tissue integration are yet to be fully understood.</p><p>Here, we report that upon digit and zeugopod amputation, significant skeletal resorption is carried out by an osteoclast population and can result in the resorption of 100% of the calcified matrix. Skeletal resorption is observed in young animals with cartilaginous limbs as well as young adult animals with ossified bones. Upon inhibition of resorption, we observed a failure in the integration of the regenerated zeugopodial elements and, interestingly, this failure can also occur in untreated animals undergoing regeneration. Moreover, we present evidence supporting the role of the WE in resorption induction. Finally, we observed a spatial correlation between resorption progression and blastema formation. Particularly, we found that the condensation of new cartilage started before the resorptive process is completed.</p><p>Similar to salamanders, mouse digit tip regeneration progresses with early histolysis and blastema formation. An extensive resorption of the phalanx can lead to bone volume reduction of almost 50% of its original size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernando et al., 2011</xref>). When osteoclasts are inhibited, regeneration is not compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simkin et al., 2017</xref>), and when wound closure is induced earlier, resorption is delayed but regeneration progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simkin et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that in mouse digit tip, resorption facilitates blastema formation. Moreover, it has been shown that both periosteal and endosteal cells are responsible for regeneration of the phalanx upon amputation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dawson et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that bone resorption may be required for mobilization of a pool of progenitor cells. Although bone resorption is not required for regeneration to progress, this histolytic process is indeed an important event for the efficient regeneration of the mouse digit tip. In contrast to mouse, axolotl skeletal elements do not mobilize progenitors to the blastema, and wound closure occurs within hours upon amputation, even when skeletal structures protrude at the surface. An important similarity to our findings in axolotl is the time frame when resorption occurs (7–15 dpa). This suggests that the unique fast activation and clearance of osteoclasts are particular to regeneration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Resorption efficiency defines skeletal integration success</title><p>In this work, osteoclast inhibition with zol resulted in a clear failure in tissue integration. This phenotype often presented as an angulation of the radius, heterotopic cartilage formation in the ulna, or a complete separation between the mature and the regenerated structures. In general, we observed a higher rate of resorption for the ulna than for the radius, which could account for the more striking integration phenotypes reported for the radius.</p><p>Our experiments revealed a gradient of integration phenotypes correlated with the amount of tissue resorbed: the more resorption, the better the integration. Strikingly, in animals undergoing normal regeneration we often observed faulty integration phenotypes in mineralized skeleton, as seen by angulations at the stump-regenerated interphase. A recent report showed abnormally regenerated limbs in almost 50% of the animals screened, and they presented similar phenotypes to the ones presented here, i.e., a narrowing in the diaphysis and some heterotopic cartilage formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bothe et al., 2021</xref>). Using polarization microscopy, we presented evidence of an ECM disorganization in the interphase region where both stump and regenerated tissue are connected. Finally, we showed a prevalence of these phenotypes at 90 dpa, proving that they are not resolved after regeneration has been completed.</p><p>Remarkably, we observed a high variability in the amount of calcified tissue resorbed in different animals, ranging from 25 to 100% for radius and ulna, being the inter-assay variability higher than the intra-assay. The source of this variability could be an environmental factor (e.g. water temperature), but it highlights the different outcomes that skeletal regeneration can produce. Indeed, in some cases, resorption involved a sequential degradation of the skeletal tissue, and at other times, a break and shedding of a skeleton piece, which has been observed in mouse digit tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernando et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to mouse, skeletal shedding in the axolotl is not associated with wound re-epithelialization, since this occurs after wound closure.</p><p>Our results highlight the misconception that axolotl limb regeneration recapitulates the pre-existing morphology with high fidelity. This report reveals that a faulty skeletal regeneration is a rather common outcome in the axolotl limb and correlates resorption efficiency with successful skeletal integration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>WE, resorption, and blastema</title><p>The WE is a critical structure for the progression of regeneration, regulating process such as ECM remodeling, tissue histolysis, proliferation, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>). Here, by blocking the formation of the WE, we underscore its role in the initiation of resorption. Moreover, we analyzed available WE RNA-seq data and found several factors known to influence osteoclast progenitor migration and/or differentiation. Among those candidates, <italic>Sphk1</italic>, <italic>Ccl4,</italic> and <italic>Mdka</italic> are upregulated in the epithelial fraction during regeneration and have been linked to osteoclast biology. Indeed, S1P, which is phosphorylated by the sphingosine kinase, has been shown to have a role in both bone resorption and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishii et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pederson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ryu et al., 2006</xref>), while CCL4 and MDKA have been connected with osteoclast progenitor recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maruyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xuan et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies to understand how these factors are regulated in osteoclast-mediated resorption during regeneration will be needed.</p><p>We hypothesized that the connection between the WE and skeletal resorption could be mediated by the WE position. Our results show that resorption starts distally, enclosed by the WE boundaries, supporting this idea. Although the WE may not be the only source of factors inducing osteoclast progenitor migration and differentiation, it probably is a general source of chemokines inducing the recruitment of receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK)<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitors. We hypothesize that those myeloid cells will then recognize factors secreted by the skeletal elements that promote osteoclast differentiation. Indeed, the main source of RANK ligand (RANKL) in mammals is both hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we also provide evidence supporting a spatiotemporal correlation between skeletal resorption and blastema formation. The WE produces signals involved in blastema proliferation and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boilly and Albert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>), and thus both, resorptive and proliferating signals, could be acting in the same zone of influence. Moreover, since the skeletal elements are structural supports of the limb, the resorption of the hard matrix might cause a collapse of the soft tissue toward the proximal region, and thus a formation of the blastema behind the amputation plane. Indeed, we observed EdU<sup>+</sup> cells and <italic>Kazald1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in the surroundings of the skeletal elements shortly before the start of resorption, and condensation of skeletal progenitors distal to the resorbed tissue and under the amputation plane.</p><p>Historically, the amputation plane has been conceptualized as a fixed position in the limb which determines the beginning of the blastema. This could be derived from the common practice to trim the skeletal elements right after amputation, because it ensures a consistent blastema formation between experiments. In this surgical procedure, the skin of the amputated limb is retracted, and the extending skeletal elements are re-amputated. Trimming results in a faster WE and blastema formation; however, this procedure might cause the erroneous perception of a fixed amputation plane. Comparatively, in the case of the mouse digit tip, in which bone resorption occurs, a regeneration plane has been identified as more proximal than the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seifert and Muneoka, 2018</xref>). This study has implications for demarcating the blastema, the progenitor cell source, and the dynamic interphase created by nascent, migrating cells and a stream of morphogens.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Future perspectives and challenges</title><p>There are still unresolved questions regarding the osteoclast population here described. First, what is the origin of this population during regeneration? Upon amputation, a peak of myeloid chemotactic molecules was reported at 1 dpa, followed by an infiltration of myeloid cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that osteoclast progenitors are recruited to the amputation plane, but it does not rule out the participation of resident progenitors in the neighboring tissues. Interestingly, axolotl osteoclasts might be different to the more extensively studied mouse osteoclasts. We report here a considerable number of <italic>Ctsk</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to be F4/80<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, F4/80 inhibits osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2017</xref>). Second, how homogenous is this <italic>Ctsk<sup>+</sup></italic> population? We observed in situ, a range of mononucleated and multinucleated cells resorbing the skeleton. We speculate that as a consequence of resorption speed, some immune cells may skip fusion; and hence, mononucleated osteoclasts are observed. Nevertheless, these speculations need to be addressed in future works. Third, what is the fate of osteoclasts after resorption? We showed that this population eventually vacates the regenerating structure, but before this occurs, some osteoclasts turn positive in an apoptosis staining. Whether all cells undergo apoptosis or if some will recirculate, need further investigation. Recent works have shown that osteoclasts can be long lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacome-Galarza et al., 2019</xref>) and also be recycled via a cell type named osteomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McDonald et al., 2021</xref>). These studies underline the need to continue investigating osteoclast biology in vivo, and in general, the rapidly triggered immune response. The axolotl limb presents a new paradigm in which osteoclast function can be assessed, and thus the development of new transgenic lines to label myeloid progenitors and to indelibly label osteoclast will provide a mean to resolve the aforementioned questions. These tools will also allow to specifically assess the function of individual immune cell types, which is lacking when using chemicals as inhibitors. For example, macrophages exhibit some sensitivity to zol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mönkkönen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rogers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the concomitant resorption and regeneration need to be further explored. It is known that histolysis helps with the mobilization of progenitor cells in salamanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thornton, 1938b</xref>) and in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dawson et al., 2018</xref>), but how osteoclast-mediated resorption could be influencing cartilage condensation in the context of axolotl regeneration remains to be studied. Specifically, how the cell differentiation and migration are orchestrated with respect to resorption is unclear. Of particular interest are periskeletal cells migrating toward the blastema and contributing to the formation of the proximal skeleton. The cell source zone, i.e., a zone where blastema cells are recruited, has been roughly defined to be 500 µm from the amputation plane; however, resorption was not taken into consideration for that assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2016</xref>). It is unclear how resorption and the detachment and migration of periskeletal cells are coordinated, or if the source of periskeletal cells corresponds to a region not resorbed (e.g. proximal to the calcified tissue). Previous works have demonstrated the interaction between osteoclast and osteoblasts in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furuya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ikebuchi et al., 2018</xref>), and the in vivo assessment of this in the context of skeletal regeneration would be necessary.</p><p>Finally, we need to consider the location where resorption is occurring since different cell types are found in the same skeletal element along the proximodistal axis, which could influence the outcome of resorption in skeletal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riquelme-Guzmán et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>This work presents a systematic assessment of the timing, extent, and consequences of skeletal resorption. We show that the skeleton undergoes a massive and rapid histolytic event, which is essential for a successful integration of the regenerated structure. This process, which is carried out by osteoclasts, is influenced by the formation of the WE and is correlated with the spatial position of the early blastema. Furthermore, we present proof that the axolotl limb regeneration is not perfect, and it often leads to abnormal skeletal phenotypes. We consider that resorption is playing a key role in skeletal regeneration, and its implications need to be further explored, particularly its coordination with cell migration and condensation of the

Sample size was determined based on previous axolotl studies. The value of the biological replicates per experiment (n) is stated in each figure. For analyses of results, no outlier was removed.</p><p>In vivo skeletal staining was performed using calcein or alizarin red. A 0.1% solution was prepared for either dye with swimming water. Axolotls were submerged in solution for 5–10 min in the dark. After staining, animals were transferred to a tank with clean swimming water, which was changed as many times until water was not stained. Amputations were performed either 10 min after staining or the next day for better visualization.</p><p>For amputations, animals were anesthetized with 0.01% benzocaine solution. All amputations were performed at the distal end of the calcified diaphysis using an Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope. After surgical procedure, animals were covered with a wet tissue (with benzocaine) and allowed to recover for 10 min prior to be transferred back to swimming water.

Injection volume was adjusted to 10µL with APBS. After injections, animals were kept covered with a wet paper for 10min before returning them into the water tank.</p><p>In vivo imaging was performed in anesthetized animals. For stereoscope imaging, animals were placed in a 100 mm petri dish, and limb was positioned accordingly. An Olympus SZX16 stereoscope microscope (objective: SDF Plapo 1xPF) was used. For confocal imaging, animals were place in a glass bottom dish (ø: 50/40 mm, #HBSB-5040, Willco Wells, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). A wet tissue with benzocaine was laid on top of the animal to avoid it to dry, and a silica block was laid on top of the hand to flatten it and improve light penetrance. A Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope LSM780 (objectives: Plan apochromat 10×/0.45 or Plan-apochromat 20×/0.8) was used.</p><p>For tissue collection, animals were anesthetized prior to collection.

RNA isolation was performed using the RNAeasy Mini Kit. 50ng of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (#RR037A, Takara, Göteborg, Sweden) following the provider’s instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using the TB Green Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNAseH Plus) kit (#RR420A, Takara). RT-qPCR was done using a LightCycler 480 system with a pre-defined protocol for SYBR Green. Results were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method and the <italic>Rpl4</italic> housekeeping gene. After analysis, results were shown as relative levels compared to a control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Polarization microscopy</title><p>The LC-PolScope is a powerful tool to quantitatively image optically anisotropic materials having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation of light (birefringence), such as collagen, the main component of cartilage ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fox et al., 2009</xref>). An LC-PolScope (on a Ti Eclipse microscope body) with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0) was used. Acquisitions were done with a 20×/0.8 objective and using µManager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>). Two images were acquired: the retardance and the slow axis orientation. The retardance correlates with the amount of birefringent components, while the slow axis orientation image provides information on the orientation of those components, i.e. the angle in which they are aligned in the sample. Retardance and slow axis orientation images were aligned using a custom-made MATLAB script such that the x-axis corresponded to the proximodistal axis and the y-axis corresponded to the anteroposterior axis, with the elbow on the top-right corner of the image. The angle was measured with respect to the proximodistal axis. Once the images were aligned, the regions of interest were cropped and segmented using the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin from Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017</xref>). The segmentation was done to obtain masks for the collagen regions and to remove the cells from the analysis. The masks were then applied to the slow axis orientation images, and the orientations of the collagen fibers were quantified using MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Curating RNA-seq data</title><p>Recently published axolotl RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>) were used to evaluate osteoclast-related transcript levels in samples upon FSF surgery. For curating the datasets, R Studio was used (RStudio Team, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rstudio.com/">http://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>). In order to find osteoclast-related transcript identifiers, the human, mouse, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> protein orthologous for each transcript were used. With the protein sequences, a protein blast was performed using the predicted proteins from Bryant et al. de novo axolotl transcriptome (supplementary data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2017</xref>). The best three matches for each protein were used for browsing in Tsai’s transcriptome. The datasets from both of Tsai et al. works were combined and filtered in order to have only the results from 0 dpa, 5 dpa, and 5 dpa in FSF surgery. In addition, the 2N, 4N, and EP fractions at 5 dpa were also filtered from the combined datasets. For organizing, filtering, and calculating z-scores in the datasets, the tidyverse package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>) and plyr package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wickham, 2011</xref>) were used. For creating the heatmaps, the ggplot2 package was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wickham, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To find possible candidates involved in osteoclast recruitment and differentiation, a search in the available literature was done for each differentially downregulated transcript in FSF samples (385 transcripts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2020</xref> supplementary data). Transcripts, which have been connected to osteoclast function or belong to a protein family shown to play a role in osteoclast recruitment and differentiation, were filtered and heatmaps were created for better visualization of the levels during regeneration and in the different fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Score matrix for integration phenotypes</title><p>To assess the integration phenotype in limbs at 45 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), we assessed each limb individually using the criteria shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrei S Chagin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, this is a well-executed and technically sound study. However, with the current set of data, the correlation between bone resorption and bone regeneration is not fully established, and additional experiments/analyses are needed. Particularly, additional analyses of zol-treated or full skin flap surgery-treated groups would strengthen this study. In addition, the authors should consider addressing several other concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Dear authors, the manuscript is nicely done, and the data are well presented. In my opinion, the intrinsic limitation of the study is the question, on which this work is focused on. It is of limited value, in my opinion. Nevertheless, here are some specific comments and suggestions to improve the study.</p><p>There are some questions, which can make the story more exciting.</p><p>1. Bisphosphonates block bone resorption but osteoclasts remain there. What would be the differences in the regenerative process in the case of osteoclast ablation versus inhibition of their resorption ability? Is the same outcome anticipated? What is the role of osteoclasts in the regeneration of urodeles?</p><p>2. Tissue histolysis causes degradation of the extracellular matrix. What does happen with bone cells upon bone resorption? Do they dedifferentiate upon matrix destruction, do they die, and do they contribute to new bone formation?</p><p>3. Reintegration of old and new bone is a very interesting process. How does it occur on a cellular level? Is there intramembranous or endochondral ossification, where and what matrix starts to be built, and by what cells?</p><p>There are a few uncertainties in the text, which would be good to clarify.</p><p>1. Lines 226-228. The statistic and p values supporting this statement would be good to present: The regenerated skeleton formed at an adjacent plane, therefore lacking continuity with the pre-existing skeleton.</p><p>2. Lines 230-234: Does this statement refer to zol-treated or untreated animals? Please clarify.</p><p>3. Lines 239-240. Please clarify if the statement refers to zol-treated or untreated animals. Please clarify how the original axis was determined.</p><p>4. Lines 251-253. Please clarify if the statement refers to zol-treated or untreated animals.</p><p>5. Line 283. Please clarify WISH abbreviation, the first time mentioned in the text to avoid the reader searching method section.</p><p>6. Please clarify if Figure 5e,f,h depict limbs upon flap-surgery or normal regenerating limb.</p><p>7. Line 320 says (red arrows, Figure 6C). I did not find red arrows anywhere in Figure 6.</p><p>8. The paragraph presented between lines 314-326 is rather associative (see my major comments above). Please present accordingly.</p><p>9. Lines 352-360. Double staining is needed to make a reliable conclusion (see my major comments above). Please soften conclusions if not performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a very nice manuscript with new and strong data. The work is well executed and it is a pleasure to read.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Abstract:</p><p>– I feel that the abstract is oversimplified and overstated without important details. The authors should at least clarify that they used zol to inhibit bone resorption. Also, I do not see any data showing that the extent of resorption is directly correlated with the extent of integration in a quantitative manner. It is also not clear how these data demonstrate that the wound epithelium creates &quot;a zone of influence&quot; and functions as a major regulator of skeletal resorption. It seems to be a mere correlation.</p><p>2. Introduction:</p><p>– The introduction is overall well-written but is also too long. The authors perhaps try to cover too much in this section. They could make this section more succinct.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>– Line 161: CTSK may also be expressed by mesenchymal cells in the periosteum. The authors should acknowledge the possibility that these cells may include cells other than osteoclasts.</p><p>– Line 171: Can the authors clarify if they also used in vivo imaging for these elegant transgenic assays?</p><p>– I feel that the logical connection between the section prior to Line 228 and the section after Line 229 is weak. It would be important to show how the angulation is also altered in zol-treated animals. It is possible that this phenotype is completely independent of zol-treatment.</p><p>– Line 264: Again, it is possible that these CTSK<sup>+</sup> cells include periosteal cells, which may have an important contribution to blastema formation.</p><p>– For Figure 5E-H, it would be important to show how the distribution of osteoclasts changes when FSF is performed.</p><p>– Figure 6 is interesting but very descriptive.

In my opinion, the intrinsic limitation of the study is the question, on which this work is focused on. It is of limited value, in my opinion. Nevertheless, here are some specific comments and suggestions to improve the study.</p><p>There are some questions, which can make the story more exciting.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank Reviewer #1 for their comments and suggestions, we do believe the suggestions have made the work more exciting. We hope that with the initially submitted and new data we are able to show that although it is tempting to extrapolate our knowledge from other systems, species-specific mechanisms are a reality. As we mention in this manuscript, the fate of osteoclast is not completely understood, and in the case of regeneration, the very fast arrival and clearance is in itself fascinating and worth exploring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Bisphosphonates block bone resorption but osteoclasts remain there. What would be the differences in the regenerative process in the case of osteoclast ablation versus inhibition of their resorption ability? Is the same outcome anticipated?</p></disp-quote><p>Taking into consideration works in the literature, we expected that osteoclasts would be ablated upon zoledronic acid treatment. However, to our surprise, it only resulted in a decreased number and function inhibition. The variability in tissue resorbed in normal conditions reported in our work gives us already a range of integration phenotypes, which are exacerbated when we applied zoledronic acid. Upon osteoclasts ablation, we speculate that a more consistent lack of resorption would be observed and thus a higher number of dramatic phenotypes.</p><p>It is important to note that osteoclasts have been reported to influence other processes, such as vascularization, and in the context of osteoclasts ablation, those processes could be examined in detail using diverse tools such as new transgenic lines. Finally, during regeneration, resorption of the amputated skeleton occurs in a short time window where the regenerative process is occurring simultaneously. Thus, we consider that complete ablation or decreased numbers, will unambiguously show us an effect on tissue integration. We believe in this report we provide the first in-depth assessment of a histolytic process and its consequences for limb regeneration in the axolotl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the role of osteoclasts in the regeneration of urodeles?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the role of osteoclasts in regeneration is to clear the damaged skeleton and to prime it to receive the newly formed skeleton and amalgamate the old matrix to the new one. Other roles could include the freeing of cells to activate secretory activity, however, to answer this question we will require further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Tissue histolysis causes degradation of the extracellular matrix. What does happen with bone cells upon bone resorption? Do they dedifferentiate upon matrix destruction, do they die, and do they contribute to new bone formation?</p></disp-quote><p>Several works showed the lack of participation of skeletal cells in salamander regeneration (Currie et al., 2016; McCusker et al., 2016). In addition, a previous work has shown that chondrocytes at the very amputation plane do divide however do not migrate into the blastema (Currie et al., 2016).</p><p>Due to the magnitude of the skeletal resorption that we describe here, we hypothesized that skeletal cells would either die through apoptosis or be phagocytosed by immune cells, likely Ctsk<sup>+</sup> cells. In the past, we had performed stainings for Caspase 3, where there was minimal signal. However, to be more conclusive and to address the reviewer’s question, we performed TUNEL assay at 5 and 7 dpa and see very few positive cells in the skeleton, indicating DNA cleavage/damage (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D). Additionally, we performed imaging of amputated digits from Ctsk<sup>+</sup> /<italic>Sox9</italic><sup>+</sup> animals. We observed that <italic>Sox9</italic><sup>+</sup> chondrocytes at the site of resorption are phagocytosed by Ctsk<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 2E, F). The minimal apoptosis inside the skeleton is supported by a previous work in which apoptosis was mostly observed in the wound epithelium, muscle and periosteum (Bucan et al., 2018)</p><p>Currie JD, Kawaguchi A, Traspas RM, Schuez M, Chara O, Tanaka EM (2016) Live Imaging of Axolotl Digit Regeneration Reveals Spatiotemporal Choreography of Diverse Connective Tissue Progenitor Pools.

How does it occur on a cellular level? Is there intramembranous or endochondral ossification, where and what matrix starts to be built, and by what cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The core of the work was assessing regeneration in animals up to 6 cm total length. However, we confirmed that resorption occurs in adult animals, with ossified bone in the limbs. From our experience working with axolotls, in adult and metamorphic animals, regeneration occurs by first forming a chondrogenic anlage (endochondral ossification). In juvenile axolotls, the appendicular skeleton is composed solely of cartilage and thus its regeneration occurs by condensation of chondroprogenitors (as shown in Figure 7D). It is unclear what type of matrix starts to be built and the cells secreting it, although we hypothesize that condensation of chondroprogenitors might activate developmental pathways which initiate the deposition of cartilage ECM (collagen type II for example). The activation of developmental pathways during regeneration of connective tissue has already been demonstrated in a previous work (Gerber, et al. 2018). Also, we have recently shown that the viscoelasticity recovery of the cartilage is progressive during regeneration and surprisingly, at 30 dpa has not reach the original values, although morphologically, the tissue is comparable (Riquelme-Guzman et al. 2022). This underlines the need to investigate the exact cellular mechanism by which the cartilage and its matrix are restored.</p><p>Gerber T, Murawala P, Knapp D, Masselink W, Schuez M, Hermann S, Gac-Santel M, Nowoshilow S, Kageyama J, Khattak S, Currie J, Camp JG, Tanaka EM, Treutlein B (2018) Single-cell analysis uncovers convergence of cell identities during axolotl limb regeneration.

There, the position of Kazald1<sup>+</sup> cells next to the skeletal element is clearly visible, supporting our observations that blastema starts to form at the site where resorption occurs. Moreover, we have added Figure 7-supplement 1C, in which osteoclasts (identified by our transgenic line Ctsk:eGFP) are imaged at the same optical plane as chondrocytes which are forming the new phalanx (identified by our transgenic line <italic>Sox9</italic>:<italic>Sox9</italic>-T2a-mCherrynls). Overall, we believe our conclusions are sustained. We proved that blastema cells started to appear before resorption, under the amputation plane. Additionally, cartilage starts to regenerate before resorption finished and while osteoclasts are still present in the tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall this is a very nice manuscript with new and strong data.

Abstract:</p><p>– I feel that the abstract is oversimplified and overstated without important details. The authors should at least clarify that they used zol to inhibit bone resorption. Also, I do not see any data showing that the extent of resorption is directly correlated with the extent of integration in a quantitative manner. It is also not clear how these data demonstrate that the wound epithelium creates &quot;a zone of influence&quot; and functions as a major regulator of skeletal resorption. It seems to be a mere correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>Taken together the suggestions from all reviewers, we have improved and strengthen the conclusions from this work. We have provided a more quantitative assessment of the integration phenotypes. Nevertheless, we have made some modifications to the abstract to better demonstrate the results from this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Introduction:</p><p>– The introduction is overall well-written but is also too long. The authors perhaps try to cover too much in this section.

The authors should acknowledge the possibility that these cells may include cells other than osteoclasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. Indeed, CTSK is expressed in periosteal cells in mice and this is now acknowledged in the text. We do observe however, that the morphology of periskeletal cells is very distinctive from osteoclasts and can be identified with ease. Nevertheless, addressing the reviewer’s concern, we performed immunofluorescence for the macrophage marker F4/80 in sections from our transgenic line CTSK:eGFP at 7 dpa (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A,B) and found most of the cells in the vicinity of the skeleton to be positive, demonstrating the immune lineage of osteoclasts in axolotls. Interestingly, we also observed some periskeletal cells to be eGFP<sup>+</sup> but F4/80<sup>-</sup>, which might resemble the Ctsk<sup>+</sup> stem cells in mice. These modifications can be found in lines 164-173.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 171: Can the authors clarify if they also used in vivo imaging for these elegant transgenic assays?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the imaging was performed in vivo and this was now clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I feel that the logical connection between the section prior to Line 228 and the section after Line 229 is weak. It would be important to show how the angulation is also altered in zol-treated animals. It is possible that this phenotype is completely independent of zol-treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer and we modified this section by creating a scoring method to assess the integration phenotypes observed (details in Materials and methods). We also modified the paragraph after line 229 (now 283-290) with the new results accordingly to improve the quality of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 264: Again, it is possible that these CTSK<sup>+</sup> cells include periosteal cells, which may have an important contribution to blastema formation.</p></disp-quote><p>Albeit this is possible, our results demonstrate that the majority of Ctsk<sup>+</sup> cells are osteoclasts and have an immunological background. In addition, perioskeletal cells are morphologically different than osteoclasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For Figure 5E-H, it would be important to show how the distribution of osteoclasts changes when FSF is performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 5C, upon FSF surgery, the number of Ctsk<sup>+</sup> cells (which represent in its majority osteoclasts) is strikingly reduced to almost absent. We considered that the distribution of very few, if any osteoclast would not add considerable information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6 is interesting but very descriptive. The authors should at least provide some validation of these predicted changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s concern, and we continue insisting on finding the best way to validate the GOI and explore their influence in osteoclast-mediated histolysis. We observed that there are several genes related to recruitment and/or activation of osteoclasts, in addition to MMPs, expressed in the WE. Creating Crispants or morpholinos for this battery and evaluate the phenotypes for several candidate genes would be a lengthy experiment that we look forward to tackle in a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7: What is the significance of decreased blastema formation in zol-treated animals?

Although we show that blastema size decreases in zol-treated animals, it does not have an effect in the overall limb regeneration process. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed EdU staining and show no difference in the number of proliferative cells in zol-treated animals compared to vehicle and control (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1A). The results show in Figure 7 demonstrate that the position of the blastema in the limb is not fixed to the amputation plane and that the skeleton cannot be used as a reference point to define it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 366: aggrupation (?)</p></disp-quote><p>Changed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 7D, the Sox9 reporter assay is nice, but it would be important to see how these cells are disrupted in zol-treated animals, to enhance the relevance of this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of Figure 7D was to show that resorption and condensation of the new skeleton occur in parallel, which is demonstrated by this image set.

It puts the entire story under question.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest of reviewer #1, and as we respectfully disagree with some of the statements, we would like to further explain why.</p><p>Regarding our treatments with zoledronic acid, we are unequivocally showing that there is a decrease in the resorption of the calcified matrix. In Figure 3A, B we show an inhibition in resorption. In Figure 3C, D we show that zoledronic acid does not result in a significant reduction of mRNA levels of osteoclasts markers (e.g. <italic>Ctsk, Trap, Dcstamp</italic>) and in our transgenic animal, we show that <italic>Ctsk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are still visible, while tissue resorption is clearly affected. This support our statement that although the cells are still there, the function is compromised, the cells are present and they fail to resorb the skeleton. The specificity of zoledronic acid is fairly questioned. We have used an additional experimental set up, the FSF, where we show an absence of osteoclast and lack of resorption. The reviewer’s concern is that zol could be affecting macrophages and the phenotype we see is a result of this. Indeed, the publication referred by the reviewer (PNAS, 2013, 110 (23) 9415-9420), uses clodronate to ablate macrophages, which stops regeneration. Similar to zoledronic acid, the use of clodronate to specifically ablate macrophages comes at the expense of affecting other immune cells. Transgenesis could prove useful to overcome these pitfalls, and we have included these concerns in our discussion.</p><p>The gigantic cells that we have followed in vivo, arrive at the amputation site (Figure 2D), remain in the proximity of the skeleton (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2) and engulf skeletal cells (Figure 2E), without moving into the blastema mesenchyme (Figure 5C, Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). And as a textbook definition of osteoclasts, these cells resorb skeleton, are multinucleated and are localized in proximity of skeletal structures. Additionally, our conclusions do not claim that osteoclasts are involved in the re-integration process, but rather that the active skeletal resorption mediated by osteoclasts is necessary for the following phase: tissue integration. This tissue integration is a fascinating process that probably orchestrates cell differentiation with concomitant matrix deposition, and surely deserves more detailed attention to finally understand it. When we inhibit resorption in our FSF setting, we unequivocally show the absence of <italic>Ctsk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, further implicating these cells in skeletal resorption.</p><p>Our results in adult animals (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1), show that resorption of ossified bone occurs to a similar extent and similar time window as in our small animals. We believe that only osteoclasts could drive this resorption of the hard, bony matrix so effectively in such a short time. This supports the evidence that osteoclasts are responsible for the regeneration-triggered skeletal resorption in axolotl. Even more striking, is the fact that re-amputation of the skeleton occurs in some cases (Figure 1F). The resulting loose piece of skeleton is then extruded through the already formed wound epidermis. Making a very localized breaking point in a hard-calcified structure and relatively fast, is very likely to be the result of osteoclast function, and not merely decalcification.</p><p>The concern that <italic>Ctsk</italic> is expressed in other cell types and possibly in blastema cells is addressed in this work, by providing evidence of the morphology and location of these cells (see above). The reviewer mentions the publication of our colleagues (Gerber et al.) and as also correctly states that the RNAseq was only performed using <italic>Prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. With that dataset, it is impossible to have a point of comparison of transcript counts with cells that do not express <italic>Prrx1</italic>, such as immune cells and other blastema cells. On the other hand, Tsai et al. 2020, performed a RNAseq from three sorted populations of cells during regeneration: blastema cells, mature cells and epithelial cells. In that work, <italic>Ctsk</italic> is highly expressed in mature cells and not in blastema cells (shown in our Figure 6 and Tsai et al. 2020). Moreover, our work provides images of the <italic>Ctsk</italic> transgenic that clearly shows the location of the positive cells. Particularly, in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2, the position of <italic>Ctsk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells is almost entirely observed surrounding the skeletal elements, while blastemal cells (negative for <italic>Ctsk</italic>) are observed distal to them. Finally, in Figure 7 —figure supplement 1, no <italic>Ctsk<sup>+</sup>/Sox9<sup>+</sup></italic> cell is observed, suggesting that no chondroprogenitor is expressing <italic>Ctsk</italic> during the early phases of cartilage condensation.</p><p>This fast resorptive process could imply that differentiation of osteoclasts is also occurring simultaneously, which could involve fusion of cells of different origin occurs, including macrophages. Additionally, as we observed mononucleated <italic>Ctsk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells<italic>,</italic> it would be interesting to know if they are posed to rapidly behave as skeletal resorbing cells. It is clear to us that more studies to unravel the axolotl immune system are required, such as determining molecular signatures for different populations and also untangling how those populations are participating during regeneration. Moreover, the differentiation process of myeloid cells to contribute to the osteoclast population, as well as the contribution of circulating and resident macrophages will need to be further explored. These challenges were already included in our “Future Perspective” section in the discussion, but in order to address the Reviewer’s concerns, we have included more details regarding the pitfalls from our work.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that it is important to understand how axolotl regeneration diverts from what we know in mammalian systems. For example, we have recently published a developmental characterization of the axolotl limb skeleton, and surprisingly found a population of cells expressing Osteocalcin and <italic>SOX9</italic> in homeostatic conditions. The presence of a hybrid cell type, expressing chondrocyte and osteoblast genes, occurs in zebrafish and mouse but only during an injury response, further underscoring species-specific differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors revised the manuscript in response to the comments from three reviewers during the previous round of peer review.

The authors did not clarify that they used zoledronic acid to inhibit bone resorption in the abstract, as requested. It is extremely important to specify in the abstract that they used zol, but not other reagents, to inhibit resorption. This is an essential piece of information to support the overall integrity of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake.
