negative impact on health. Neonatal hyperoxia that is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia confers susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection later in life. Given our previous findings that the circadian clock protects against IAV, we asked if the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia vis-à-vis IAV infection includes circadian disruption. Here, we show that neonatal hyperoxia abolishes the clock-mediated time of day protection from IAV in mice, independent of viral burden through host tolerance pathways. We discovered that the lung intrinsic clock (and not the central or immune clocks) mediated this dysregulation. Loss of circadian protein, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells recapitulates the increased mortality, loss of temporal gating, and other key features of hyperoxia-exposed animals. Our data suggest a novel role for the circadian clock in AT2 cells in mediating long-term effects of early-life exposures to the lungs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neonatal lung disease</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>hyperoxia</kwd><kwd>type 2 alveolar cells</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>lung injury</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08HL132053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Shaon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K12HD043245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Shaon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR023567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>FitzGerald</surname><given-names>Garret A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32MH106442-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCATS-5UL1TR000003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neonatal hyperoxia abrogates the circadian protection from influenza infection in recovered adults.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperoxia represents the single most important toxic exposure to premature neonatal lungs and is the key risk factor for chronic lung disease of prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jobe and Bancalari, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peek et al., 2017</xref>). Despite remarkable improvements in the survival of premature neonates, almost 40% of infants born at &lt;29 weeks of gestation (approximately 10,000 new cases in USA each year) suffer from BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network et al., 2015</xref>). In surviving adults, BPD is associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections, such as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gough et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Islam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McGrath-Morrow and Collaco, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Savran and Ulrik, 2018</xref>). As an increasing number of prematurely born neonates survive into adulthood, these long-term morbidities have acquired greater public health importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jain, 2015</xref>). In a murine model, neonatal hyperoxia increased morbidity from influenza A virus (IAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">O'Reilly et al., 2008</xref>) in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maduekwe et al., 2015</xref>) through pathways involving both alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells and immune pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buczynski et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, this effect seems independent of the pathogen, since Yee et al. have recently demonstrated that the expression of the SARS-COV2 receptor, ACE2 in club cells, and AT2 cells is increased in adult mice exposed to hyperoxia as neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that circadian rhythms offer a protection against IAV, wherein mortality is threefold lower if the animals are infected in the morning than in the evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>). This time of day-specific protection is lost upon genetic disruption of the clock via global deletion of core clock gene, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, which exacerbates immunopathology independent of viral replication. In keeping with their evolution imperative, circadian rhythms temporally segregate physiological process that allows organisms to anticipate its environment and adapt accordingly. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian pacemaker; however, peripheral tissues, including the lung, also have cell autonomous clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Spengler and Shea, 2000</xref>). Changes in oxygen tension are known to affect the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Low oxygen levels or hypoxia stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). There exists a reciprocal relationship between the circadian clock and <italic>Hif1a</italic> mediated at the genomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, even a short burst of hypoxia was shown to desynchronize the relationship between the SCN and peripheral clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manella et al., 2020</xref>), which would confer further risk under conditions of stress. However, the effect of hyperoxia, especially very early in life, on circadian regulation of the recovered lung has not been investigated.</p><p>The early neonatal period represents a critical window for the development and consolidation of many important pathways, including circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rivkees, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Early-life exposure to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coleman and Canal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Smarr et al., 2017</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2014</xref>), or alcohol has disruptive effects on circadian rhythms in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2005</xref>). But despite the high incidence of hyperoxia in premature neonates, how neonatal hyperoxia affects the development of circadian regulatory networks is not known. We hypothesized that early-life hyperoxia disrupts the development of circadian rhythms and that such disruption undermines recovery from lung injury. Here we test this hypothesis using an IAV infection model of adult mice exposed to neonatal hyperoxia. We find that indeed exposure to neonatal hyperoxia abrogates the time of day protection from circadian regulation of IAV infection through primarily host tolerance rather than anti-viral effects. This effect appears stage specific to the saccular stage of development that corresponds to the period during which the mice were exposed to hyperoxia in our model since adult mice exposed to hyperoxia did not lose the time of day-specific protection. To identify the location of the relevant clock, we used tissue-specific adult onset deletion of the core clock gene <italic>Bmal1</italic>. We report that disrupting <italic>Bmal1</italic> in AT2 cells of the lung faithfully recapitulates the phenotype of animals exposed to neonatal hyperoxia, suggesting that early-life hyperoxia disrupts the circadian regulation of the pulmonary response to hyperoxia through the AT2 clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neonatal hyperoxia abrogates the circadian protection from influenza infection in recovered adults</title><p>We previously showed that mice infected at ZT11 (ZT11 refers to ‘Zeitgeber Time’ 11 or dusk which marks the beginning of the active phase in mice since they are nocturnal) had threefold higher mortality than mice infected at ZT23 (dawn or at the beginning of their rest phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>). Upon global disruption of the clock (<italic>Bmal1<sup>fl/fl</sup>:CAGG<sup>creERt2/+</sup></italic>), in adult animals, the time of day difference was lost such that the mortality was high irrespective of the time of day of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>). Here we hypothesized that neonatal hyperoxia would disrupt circadian rhythms to result in a loss of temporal difference in outcomes in recovered adult mice infected with IAV at ZT11(dusk) or ZT23 (dawn). Mice exposed to either hyperoxia or room air as neonates were recovered to adulthood and infected with IAV (H1N1 mouse-adapted strain PR8) at either ZT23 or ZT11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Mice are born at the saccular stage of lung development that corresponds to 24–28 weeks gestation for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Warburton et al., 2010</xref>) and thus neonatal hyperoxia provides an excellent model to study BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hilgendorff et al., 2014</xref>). The room air controls maintained the time of day difference in mortality; the group infected at ZT11 had a mortality 2.6 times higher than the mice infected at ZT23 (survival 72% in ZT23 vs. 33% in ZT11, p&lt;0.01). By contrast, the mice that had been exposed to hyperoxia as neonates lost this time of day difference: both groups had mortality comparable to the ZT11 (in RA) group (survival in hyperoxia groups: ZT23 at 37% and ZT11 at 25%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). However, when adult mice exposed to hyperoxia were infected with IAV at either ZT23 or ZT11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), they maintained the same difference in outcomes as seen in room air controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>. Thus, exposure to hyperoxia as adults did not appear to impair the circadian control over mortality and morbidity from IAV seen with exposure to neonatal hyperoxia. Considered together, this suggests that early life (p0–p5) accords a unique window of influencing circadian regulation and as such exposure to hyperoxia during this period disrupts circadian regulation of the lung injury response to IAV infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall experimental design and effects of neonatal hyperoxia on circadian regulation of IAV infection adulthood.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental model for neonatal hyperoxia followed by IAV infection: C57Bl6 pups aged &lt;12 hr were exposed to either hyperoxia (&gt;95% O<sub>2</sub>) or room air (21% O<sub>2</sub>) from PN0–5.

Entrainment refers to the re-synchronization of the internal or endogenous circadian rhythms to external cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golombek and Rosenstein, 2010</xref>), such as the change in lighting schedule here, and is a way to assess the function of the central clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tahara and Shibata, 2018</xref>).

Contrary to our hypothesis, this was not influenced by neonatal exposure to hyperoxia, since even among the hyperoxia-exposed pups, the total BAL count was higher in the ZT11 than in the ZT23 group.

A hallmark of circadian regulation is a difference in outcomes based on time of day at which the insult is sustained. We found that this time of day-specific protection from IAV is lost in adult animals exposed to hyperoxia as neonates, reminiscent of the effect of global genetic disruption of core clock gene <italic>Bmal1</italic> from our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>). Hyperoxia is known to cause significant damage to the lung and one speculation might be that the loss of the time of day difference in outcomes in reflective of a generalized lack of well-being rather than a loss of circadian control. However, our data clearly refutes that possibility, given that the hyperoxia-exposed groups only ever have mortality comparable to the control group infected in the evening; not worse. We have also seen the loss of this circadian protection without worsening beyond the ZT11 group at lower doses of the virus (data not shown).</p><p>Consistent with our previous observations on clock disruption, the viral burden after challenge was similar across all the groups. Thus, the loss of protection from IAV in mice exposed to hyperoxia as neonates is not due differences in viral replication. Therefore, we addressed the possibility that this loss of central gating reflected dysregulation of central clock function (measured as locomotor activity rhythms), the immunological response to infection or peripheral clock function in pulmonary epithelial cells.</p><p>We found that mice exposure to neonatal hyperoxia did not have a significant effect on the central clock by adulthood. This is not surprising – while other adverse effects early in life are known to disrupt local or central circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coleman and Canal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Smarr et al., 2017</xref>), the SCN clock is well known to be resistant to non-photic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stokkan et al., 2001</xref>). At baseline, we also saw that neonatal hyperoxia could disrupt the immune clock, which would account for abrogated time of day protection from IAV. Since these cell populations were implicated in the exaggerated inflammation in the groups infected in the evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>), we initially hypothesized that neonatal hyperoxia disrupts the immune clock which in turn abrogates the circadian protection from IAV. However, following IAV infection total BAL cell counts were higher in the group infected at ZT11 than in those infected at ZT23 in both the room air and neonatal hyperoxia-exposed animals. This is in contrast with the work of O’Reilly et al. who have shown that adults exposed to hyperoxia as neonates had a hyper-inflammatory response, with higher BAL counts in comparison to the room air controls. We speculate that this difference from the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">O'Reilly et al., 2008</xref> results from our circadian experimental design since we infected mice at dawn and dusk. Furthermore, we found that exposure to hyperoxia did not change the viral burden at either time points, which is consistent with previous literature. Overall, given that even in our previous work, the myeloid clock did not completely control the phenotype seen in animals with a disrupted clock, we focused on the lung epithelium.</p><p>The lung consists of anatomically distinct regions (tracheas, bronchioles, and alveoli) each populated by structurally and functionally distinct epithelial cell types. Tracheas and proximal airways are lined by multi-ciliated cells, secretory cells (Scgba1a1<sup>+</sup>), goblet cells, and basal stem/progenitor (BSC) cells. The small airways terminate in the alveolar sacs, which are mainly composed of alveolar type1 (AT1) or AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zepp and Morrisey, 2019</xref>). Although all epithelial cells are susceptible to IAV infection, AT2 cells are primarily affected by neonatal hyperoxia. Even though there were only subtle differences in gene expression rhythms assayed in the entire lung, the possibility that the AT2 clock is disproportionately affected cannot be ruled out. We suspect that since AT2 cells contribute only a small portion of the total RNA extracted from the lung, the disruptive effect on the AT2 clock was underestimated. In fact, in our lung explant model, while pulmonary rhythmicity was maintained, the amplitude was definitely blunted in the hyperoxia-treated group. Thus, a role for the AT2 clock is supported by our Bmal1<italic><sup>−</sup></italic><sup>/−</sup> data.</p><p>We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibbs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) have demonstrated a role for the Scgb1a1 (or CCSP) clock in mediating lung injury, however, this is the first report of a cell intrinsic clock in AT2 cells. Although many clock genes participate in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms, <italic>Bmal1</italic> is the only circadian gene whose sole deletion is sufficient to cause arrhythmicity of locomotor activity – the hallmark of circadian disruption. Embryonic deletion of <italic>Bmal1</italic> results in a severe accelerated aging phenotype, in which the circadian phenotype is confounded by potentially off target developmental effects of <italic>Bmal1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). We avoid any confounding by non-circadian effects from <italic>Bmal1</italic> by targeting gene deletion in adulthood. The time of day difference in IAV induced mortality in cre<sup>−</sup> littermates was abrogated amongst <italic>Sftpc<sup>CreERt2/+</sup>::Bmal1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, treated with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age. It is intriguing that the both hyperoxia and AT2 clock disruption not only abolish the circadian directed time of day protection from IAV, but also share many similarities in the mechanisms underlying this dysregulation. In both conditions, the loss of circadian regulation of the host response to IAV is not mediated through control of viral burden, but rather through worse injury. Overall, our data strongly support the possibility that hyperoxia disrupts the circadian regulation of lung injury in IAV through the AT2 clock. Since many of the <italic>Scgb1a1-cre</italic> models affect AT2 cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that the Scgb1a1-cre described previously overestimates the effect of <italic>Bmal1</italic> deletion. Thus, neonatal hyperoxia impairs the circadian regulation of host response to IAV in adult mice.</p><p>Our work further strengthens the observation in the field that oxygen tension modulates the circadian clock. While we focused on long-term effects of neonatal hyperoxia on circadian networks, Lagishetty et al. has suggested that hyperoxia exposure in adult mice changes the circadian gene expression, although only a single time point was assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lagishetty et al., 2014</xref>). Most evidence for the connection between the changes in oxygen tension and circadian clock comes from hypoxia. Interestingly, both clock and HIF belong to the same basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor super family. In the skeletal muscle, a reciprocal relationship was noted between the hypoxia-sensing HIF1 pathways and the circadian clock – the response to hypoxia is gated by the circadian clock and HIF1α binds to clock targets to modulate the clock output under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peek et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, HIF1α is shown to accelerate adaptation to jetlag, suggesting an interaction between the two at a central level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamovich et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, hypoxia was shown to desynchronize the relationship between peripheral tissue clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manella et al., 2020</xref>). Our work here suggests that a unique window exists in the lung in the early neonatal period that might affect circadian regulation throughout later life. Since this period, (around p4) affects the development of AT2 population, it was not surprising that AT2-specific disruption of the circadian clock, via <italic>Bmal1</italic> deletion, recapitulated the results from the neonatal hyperoxia cohort. Many developmental pathways such as the Wnt-βcatenin pathways have recently been demonstrated to be central to the pathogenesis of BPD following neonatal hyperoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sucre et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, one possibility would be that the developmental reprogramming that is triggered by noxious stimuli like neonatal hyperoxia also disrupts the development of the circadian networks within the epithelium. Neonatal hyperoxia affects multiple transcription factors such as <italic>Nfe212</italic>, <italic>Cdnk1a</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Trp53</italic>, <italic>Rela</italic>, <italic>Stat3</italic>, and <italic>Cebpa </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wright and Dennery, 2009</xref>). Many of these transcription factors and pathways are known to be under circadian control. Thus, one possibility is that a reciprocal relationship between one or more of these pathways and the circadian clock may underlie the life course effects of hyperoxia on circadian regulation, akin to the <italic>Hif1</italic>a and <italic>Bmal1</italic> connection discussed above. However, since there is not a single regulatory node for hyperoxia unlike the hypoxia–<italic>Hif1</italic>a axis, it is hard to speculate which specific pathway would play this role.</p><p>In conclusion, children born prematurely and suffering from even mild BPD have persistent adverse effects on their lung function into adulthood. This may result in part from long-lasting damage to circadian mechanisms residing in AT2 cells that influence the response to injury after viral infection. The current study provides a circadian paradigm for the long-term consequences of early-life insults in this vulnerable population, paving the way for novel therapeutics and chronobiological strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Bmal1 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab230822</td><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Pro-SPC (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">EMD Millipore</td><td valign="top">ab3786</td><td valign="top">IF(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Nk1.1 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">108716</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Ly6C (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">128024</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">CD45 (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">103114</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">CD11c (Hamster monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">117324</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">CD11b (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">EBiosciences</td><td valign="top">11-0112-41, 47-0112-82</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">CD3 (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">EBiosciences</td><td valign="top">11-0032-82</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Ly6G (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">127606, 127608,</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Siglec F (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Pharmingen</td><td valign="top">552126</td><td valign="top">Flow cytometry (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software Algorithm</td><td valign="top">Clocklab</td><td valign="top">Actimetrics</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Rest-activity analyses</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">DAPI stain</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">D1306</td><td valign="top">(1 µg/mL)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemicals strain, strain background (include species and sex here)</td><td valign="top">Tamoxifen</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">T5648-1G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (include species and sex here)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jax</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 000664 | B6</td><td valign="top">Both genders and age at infection &gt; 8 weeks</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models, hyperoxia exposure, and influenza infection</title><p>For neonatal hyperoxia, newborn C57BL/6J mice (&lt;12 hr old) were exposed to either 21% oxygen (room air) or ≥95% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) between post-natal days 0 and 5.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Edit paper to address reviewer #1 points 1-3 and 5-8 listed below to increase the readability of the for a broad readership.</p><p>2) To edit the paper to suggest a mechanism for the proposed effects of hyperoxia on circadian signalling pathways in the lung and impact of other respiratory pathogens. The authors should cite a recent BioRixv pre-print: Yee et al., 2020.</p><p>3) To provide the following additional data sets to strengthen their overall conclusions:</p><p>– Provide additional viral replication parameters beyond PCR enumeration of influenza viral RNA such as measuring viral infectivity or viral antigen immunostaining in the lung</p><p>– Include data to validate Bmal1 gene KO in AT2 cells – such as protein staining in the KO cells.</p><p>– Address stage specificity of hyperoxia on circadian gene expression</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Issah and colleagues show that neonatal hyperoxia perturbs circadian protection from influenza infection in a mouse model that is phenocopied by a genetic deletion of Bmal1 in alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells. These elegant experiments provide a mechanism for why neonatal hyperoxia associates with increased susceptibility to influenza associated disease in adult life. The manuscript is well written and overall the experimental data support the stated conclusions, however, both the text and figure legends are brief and further information would increase the readability of the paper. Encourage the authors to discuss the translational impact of their results for treating IAV infection and other viruses that infect the respiratory tract such as SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>1) The brevity of the manuscript text may reflect the authors drafting of the paper for a general audience, resulting in text that could be read as “superficial” by chronobiologists or viral immunologists. For example: “The mechanism involves both the pulmonary epithelium and the immune system.” “Changes in oxygen tension are known to affect the clock as well as the interplay between the SCN and peripheral clocks.” I would encourage the authors to expand and provide mechanistic data for some these statements.</p><p>2) Current Figure 1 and Figure 2 could be combined into a single figure.</p><p>3) Figure 3B – can the authors provide more details on what this figure shows bearing in the mind the general readership of the journal.</p><p>4) Figure 4B. The authors should provide more detail on how they measure viral burden and why these time points were selected. Have they evaluated infectious virus levels rather than simple PCR quantification of IAV RNA. This is the one area of the study that I felt was over-interpreted and further data could substantiate their conclusions. The colors used for the bar charts in this figure are not easy to discern – similar criticism of Figure 4D. Suggest the authors recolor the figures and provide an overlay of all data points.</p><p>5) Figure 4C – it is not clear what the data points in the histological scoring represent and why they differ between ZT11 and ZT23.</p><p>6) Figure 5A was poorly described with limited stat analysis and very low resolution figures.

These elegant experiments provide a mechanism for why neonatal hyperoxia associates with increased susceptibility to influenza associated disease in adult life. The manuscript is well written and overall the experimental data support the stated conclusions, however, both the text and figure legends are brief and further information would increase the readability of the paper. Encourage the authors to discuss the translational impact of their results for treating IAV infection and other viruses that infect the respiratory tract such as SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>1) The brevity of the manuscript text may reflect the authors drafting of the paper for a general audience, resulting in text that could be read as “superficial” by chronobiologists or viral immunologists. For example: “The mechanism involves both the pulmonary epithelium and the immune system.” “Changes in oxygen tension are known to affect the clock as well as the interplay between the SCN and peripheral clocks.” I would encourage the authors to expand and provide mechanistic data for some these statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insight and have accordingly expanded the sections as recommended in not only the above two instances but others where the critique would be relevant.</p><p>Upon further review, the comment on epithelium and immune cells did not seem to be pertinent here, so have deleted that reference altogether.</p><p>Revised as below:</p><p>“Changes in oxygen tension are known to affect the clock (Walton et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2017). […] More recently, even a short burst of hypoxia was shown to desynchronize the relationship between the SCN and peripheral clocks (Manella et al., 2020), which would confer further risk under conditions of stress.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Current Figure 1 and Figure 2 could be combined into a single figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3B – can the authors provide more details on what this figure shows bearing in the mind the general readership of the journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the same in both the Materials and methods section and the legends that accompany the figure. Revised section as below:</p><p>Main text: “To address the hypothesis that neonatal hyperoxia caused instability of circadian regulation, we examined the ability of the animals to re-entrain to 12hr light-dark cycles after several weeks in constant darkness. […] Normoxia and hyperoxia groups did not entrain differently to this small change [Figure 2B and C]”.</p><p>Materials and methods: “Mice were singly housed in circadian light control boxes (Actimetrics) to measure their locomotor or rest-activity rhythms using either running wheels or Infrared Motion Sensors (Actimetrics). […] Data was analyzed using Clocklab software.”</p><p>Legends for new “Figure 2B” (was earlier Figure 3B): “Representative actigraph images taken from adult mice exposed to either neonatal hyperoxia and room air. […] The black bars represent the number of turns of the running wheel/movement sensed by the infrared motion sensors and indicates a time when the mouse of active.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4B. The authors should provide more detail on how they measure viral burden and why these time points were selected. Have they evaluated infectious virus levels rather than simple PCR quantification of IAV RNA. This is the one area of the study that I felt was over-interpreted and further data could substantiate their conclusions. The colors used for the bar charts in this figure are not easy to discern – similar criticism of Figure 4D. Suggest the authors recolor the figures and provide an overlay of all data points.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have expanded our dataset for both eth hyperoxia and the Sftpc cohorts. For hyperoxia animals we now have days 1, 3, 5 and 8 and for the Sftpc-cre we have days 1, 5 and 8. Our aims was to capture the early replication and clearance trajectory following IAV infection. Further, we have expanded our viral burden determination from qPCR to include the hemagglutination inhibition assay. We have included the results from Hemagglutination inhibition assay for the hyperoxia and the SPC-cre animals. We are glad to note that overall, the conclusion of the two methods of viral burden determination are the same. Time of day at infection doesn’t impact viral replication/burden in room air or neonatal hyperoxia exposed animals or for the Sftpc status.</p><p>Figure 4D: We have also changed the color scheme of the figure and overlaid the individual data points on top of the summary stats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4C – it is not clear what the data points in the histological scoring represent and why they differ between ZT11 and ZT23.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this response we have included the scoring scheme as a table in the source data (Figure 3—source data 2) and expanded on the same in the text. The data points in the histological scoring is the summary from these measurements. Revised as:</p><p>“Next, we quantified lung injury on histological analyses using a previously validated scoring system(Sengupta et al., 2019).
