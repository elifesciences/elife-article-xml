However, how energy metabolism and chromatin modifications are interlinked during MI and heart repair has been poorly explored. Here, we examined the effect of different carbon sources that are involved in the major metabolic pathways of acetyl-CoA synthesis on myocardial infarction and found that elevation of acetyl-CoA by sodium octanoate (8C) significantly improved heart function in ischemia reperfusion (I/R) rats. Mechanistically, 8C reduced I/R injury by promoting histone acetylation which in turn activated the expression of antioxidant genes and inhibited cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. Furthermore, we elucidated that 8C-promoted histone acetylation and heart repair were carried out by metabolic enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and histone acetyltransferase Kat2a, suggesting that 8C dramatically improves cardiac function mainly through metabolic acetyl-CoA-mediated histone acetylation. Therefore, our study uncovers an interlinked metabolic/epigenetic network comprising 8C, acetyl-CoA, MCAD, and Kat2a to combat heart injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone acetylation</kwd><kwd>acetyl-CoA</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>ischemia reperfusion</kwd><kwd>interplay between metabolism </kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL109054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL139735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An acetyl-CoA-mediated metabolic and epigenetic network has been elucidated that stimulates histone acetylation and anti-oxidative stress gene expression for heart repair after myocardial infarction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Energy is a fundamental requirement for all living organisms and its production typically requires fuels (metabolites) and oxygen. Heart function is sensitive to energy supply and provision. One key response to fuel changes is the epigenetic modifications using one carbon or two carbon moieties derived from metabolites to change chromatin structure by methylation and acetylation and regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reid et al., 2017</xref>. Notably, a bi-directional interplay between metabolism and epigenetic control has been proposed recently: metabolism directly regulates chromatin epigenetic state, whereas chromatin state defines gene control in response to metabolic status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi and Tu, 2015</xref>.</p><p>Myocardial infarction (MI), which blocks the supply of energy to infarcted area, is one of the leading causes of death in the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pagidipati and Gaziano, 2013</xref>. Despite the severe complications of this devastating disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibáñez et al., 2015</xref>, the therapies to reduce MI injury are still limited. MI is accompanied by severe energy deprivation and extensive epigenetic changes. Regulations in either energy metabolism or epigenetics are essential for heart function and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keating and El-Osta, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maack and Murphy, 2017</xref>, but how these two events are interlinked in the context of MI has been under-explored. Clearly, exploring an integrated metabolic and chromatin control in MI injury and heart repair and regeneration may provide novel therapies against heart injury.</p><p>Acetyl-CoA, an intermediary metabolite that serves as an energy-providing substrate, is also used by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to transfer the acetyl-group to histone residues for histone acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>. Manipulation of acetyl-CoA, either by intervention of synthetic enzymes, or nutrient source could alter histone acetylation in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sutendra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McDonnell et al., 2016</xref>. Importantly, acetyl-CoA induces metabolic adaptations through regulating histone acetylation in response to starvation or hypoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulusu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2016</xref>. Moreover, myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury causes dramatic metabolism changes and subsequent histone deacetylation. Inhibition of histone deacetylation activity protects heart function after I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xie et al., 2014</xref> and inhibits cardiac remodeling and heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>. Thus, the intersection of acetyl-CoA-mediated metabolism and histone acetylation is very likely a novel hub for identifying targets for heart repair.</p><p>In this study, we examined whether metabolic manipulation of acetyl-CoA level could alter histone acetylation, which in turn promotes heart repair and protection after I/R injury. Our screen identified a nutrient, the medium chain fatty acid 8C, as an effective carbon source to stimulate acetyl-CoA production and histone acetylation and protect heart function after MI. Specifically, we showed that a single i.p. injection of 8C at the time of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct size and improved cardiac function at both 24 hr and 4 weeks after MI. We found that 8C produced acetyl-CoA and rescued histone acetylation decrease both in vivo and in vitro after I/R injury. We further elucidated that the metabolic enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and histone acetyltransferase Kat2a were key factors in transferring the acetyl moiety in 8C to acetyl groups in histone acetylation. Knockdown of either MCAD or Kat2a abolished 8C-mediated histone acetylation and subsequently oxidative stress reduction for cardiomyocyte protection after I/R injury. Thus, our study established an interlinked metabolic/epigenetic network that may provide new strategies to treat heart injuries.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Administration of 8C at reperfusion elevated acetyl-CoA and improved short-term and long-term cardiac function after I/R</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) induces dramatic metabolic and epigenetic changes including decrease of acetyl-CoA synthesis and histone acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Granger et al., 2008</xref>. We reasoned that swift synthesis of acetyl-CoA could rescue heart function by restoring histone acetylation. Based on the major metabolic pathways for acetyl-CoA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>), we examined the effect of sodium acetate (2C, 500 mg/kg), sodium pyruvate (3C, 500 mg/kg), sodium citrate (6C, 500 mg/kg), sodium octanoate (8C, 160 mg/kg), and sodium nonanoate (9C, 200 mg/kg) on heart function after I/R. Rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with these metabolites as well as saline for three days and another dose before I/R surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At 24 hr after I/R, the infarct size was measured by Evans blue and tripheyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24 hr after I/R. Evans blue staining indicated area at risk (AAR) and TTC staining indicated the infarct size (IS). The ratio of AAR/LV was similar in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Interestingly, these metabolites displayed distinct effects on reducing myocardial infarct size. Among the five metabolites examined, 2C, 3C, and 8C significantly reduced the IS/AAR ratio, whereas 6C and 9C treatment did not reduce IS/AAR ratio compared to saline-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>).

The infarct size was then measured by Evans blue/TTC staining at 24 hr after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Evans blue/TTC staining showed that 24 hr after reperfusion, 8C administration reduced the IS/AAR ratio from 72% to 52% compared to saline control after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, 8C also significantly improved the left ventricle function evaluated by echocardiography 24 hr after I/R. Compared to saline treated I/R rats, 8C administration led to increase of EF and FS from 47% to 58% and 24% to 31%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), while the normal rat heart has EF at 72% and FS at 43%. These results indicated that 8C significantly improved cardiac function by approximately 40%. Importantly, we found that there was a significant reduction of acetyl-CoA concentration in hearts after I/R, while 8C administration increased acetyl-CoA level in hearts after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, 8C administration elevated H3K9ac level in hearts after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>). Furthermore, to investigate whether a single dose of 8C administration is beneficial for long-term cardiac function after I/R, we examined the infarct size and heart function at 4 weeks after I/R. Trichrome Masson staining showed that the infarct size was notably reduced after 8C treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L, M</xref>). The left ventricle function was also improved after 8C treatment as evidenced by the increase of EF and FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N, O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together with the fact that 8C can quickly enter into cells and contribute to around 50% of acetyl-CoA in heart at one hour after administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walton et al., 2003</xref>, our results indicated that 8C administration at the time of reperfusion elevated acetyl-CoA production and histone acetylation level and significantly improved both short-term and long-term cardiac function after I/R.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>8C attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis through alleviating oxidative stress</title><p>Apoptosis is one of the major reasons for cardiac damage after I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacLellan and Schneider, 1997</xref>. To detect the impact of 8C on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, TUNEL staining was performed at the border zone of infarct hearts. 8C treatment dramatically reduced TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes in border zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Consistent with the TUNEL assay, the levels of myocardial death marker cTnI, serum CK-MB as well as total CK and LDH were also reduced in I/R rats after 8C administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Moreover, 8C led to reduction in pro-apoptotic regulator Bax and upregulation of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 at 24 hr after I/R injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). To study the mechanism of the beneficial effect of 8C administration after I/R, we examined the differential gene expression in the cells at the border zone 24 hr after I/R by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref> showed that genes involved in apoptotic signaling pathways were enriched in saline-treated compared to 8C-treated rats after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis using differential expressed genes in 8C and saline-treated rats showed that genes related to cellular response to tumor necrosis factor were highly enriched in saline-treated I/R groups, whereas genes related to cardiomyocyte functions were highly expressed in 8C-treated I/R hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). These results suggested that 8C administration reduced the cardiomyocyte death after I/R. Specifically, I/R reduced the expression of anti-oxidative stress enzymes such as SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, CAT, Txnrd2, and Txnrd3, while 8C treatment upregulated the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since I/R-induced oxidative stress triggers CM apoptosis after reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hausenloy and Yellon, 2013</xref>, it is likely that 8C reduces cell death by activating antioxidant process after I/R injury. To address this, we measured the level of cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) after I/R by staining of dihydroethidium (DHE), a chemical that could be oxidized by ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griendling et al., 2016</xref>. The intensity of DHE signal was significantly lower in the presence of 8C after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>), indicating that 8C reduced oxidative stress after I/R. Moreover, 8C rescued the myocardial SOD activity after I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Altogether, these results showed that one major mechanism through which 8C improved cardiac function after I/R was reduction of the oxidative stress and subsequent cell apoptosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Post ischemic administration of 8C reduces the oxidative stress and cell death after I/R injury.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative of TUNEL (green) and cTnT (red) double staining at boarder zone at 24 hr post I/R injury.

Then the NRVMs were subjected to 2 hr of simulated ischemia followed by 4 hr of simulated reperfusion. The percentage of apoptotic cells after sI/R was measured by labeling with Annexin V and Propidium iodide (PI). 8C significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells, as evidenced by the lower percentage of Annexin V and PI double positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). In addition, combination of CCK8 and LDH release assays were used to measure the total cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukami et al., 2016</xref>. 8C administration reduced cell death after sI/R as showed by increased cell viability and decreased LDH release into to culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).

To examine the potential epigenetic regulation of 8 C derived acetyl-CoA in antioxidative stress, we performed ChIP to measure H3K9ac at the promoters of antioxidant genes. 8 C elevated H3K9ac level at the promoters of NQO1, HO1, and SOD2 in both normoxia and sI/R conditions, with a more profound increase under sI/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). 8 C upregulated both mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant genes including HO1, NQO1, and SOD2 after sI/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that the histone acetylation increase by 8 C promoted antioxidant response under stress.

Our data show that I/R injury reduces the cellular acetyl-CoA level, which is associated with decrease of histone acetylation and increase of cardiomyocyte death after I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Granger et al., 2008</xref>. We further show that these associations are causally related. In particular, we demonstrate that 8 C restores the acetyl-CoA level and subsequently increases the histone acetylation and improves cardiac function after injury. Moreover, 8 C administration directly contributes about 50% of acetyl-CoA in rat hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walton et al., 2003</xref>, implying that 8 C derived acetyl-CoA plays an essential role after I/R injury. Importantly, knockdown of MCAD, which metabolizes 8 C to acetyl-CoA, diminishes the rescuing effect of 8 C treatment. Moreover, other acetyl-CoA sources including acetate and pyruvate that improved cardiac function after I/R could also stimulate histone acetylation in cardiomyocytes under sI/R in vitro. Thus, our study suggests that acetyl-CoA from 8 C metabolism, as well as from acetate and pyruvate, could improve heart function after I/R through modulating histone acetylation.</p><p>Our study indicates that histone acetylation is a major downstream event of 8 C and acetyl-CoA in heart repair after injury, which is consistent with the notion that acetyl-CoA could serve as second messenger to modulate epigenetic response to environmental changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>. Indeed, tracing by C13-labeled 8 C indicate that 8 C produced acetyl-CoA directly contributes to histone acetylation. Knockdown of Kat2a, a major HAT enzyme in catalyzing histone acetylation, greatly diminishes the cardiomyocyte protective effect of 8 C metabolism under a sI/R setting. Consistent with this notion, 8 C effect on elevating histone acetylation and heart protection is largely abolished under Kat2a knockdown conditions. Although 8C-mediated acetyl-CoA synthesis could promote mitochondrial metabolism for cardiac protection, our Kat2a knockdown experiments suggest that 8C-mediated histone acetylation in gene expression plays a key role in cardiac protection. Histone acetylation as a general epigenetic regulatory mechanism can play essential roles in numerous cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backs and Olson, 2006</xref>. In this study, we have identified that 8C-mediated histone acetylation increases the expression of HO1, NQO1 and SOD2 and decreases the ROS level after I/R injury both in vivo and in vitro. These data indicate that the protecting effect of 8 C treatment after heart injury is at least partially mediated through stimulating gene expression against oxidative stress. This result is consistent with the previous observation that a high level of histone acetylation activates gene expression against oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimazu et al., 2013</xref>. A future genome-wide study will provide a complete picture of 8C-mediated cellular processes in combating heart injury.</p><p>Histone acetylation can also be regulated by histone deacetylase (HDACs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backs and Olson, 2006</xref>. Interestingly, studies by us and others reveal that chemical inhibition of HDACs also leads to attenuation of myocardial infarction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xie et al., 2014</xref> and heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>. Our recent work indicates that valproic acid, an FDA approved HDAC inhibitor for treatment bipolar disorder, protects heart function after I/R injury by promoting a Foxm1-mediated transcriptional pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>. In addition, SAHA, another HDAC inhibitor, blunts myocardial infarction via regulating autophagy activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xie et al., 2014</xref>. Moreover, HDAC inhibitors could alter the acetylation of myofibrils and govern diastolic function of heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>. Whether acetyl-CoA and HDAC inhibitor mediated histone acetylation alternations share the same regulatory mechanisms in cardiac repair requires detailed investigation. It will also be interesting to determine how metabolism mediated histone acetylation and HDAC inhibition coordinate their actions in cardiac repair.</p><p>Our establishment of direct connection between epigenetic status and metabolite abundance in heart repair may provide an alternative perspective for numerous published studies. For instance, activation of AMPK shows cardioprotective effect after I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russell et al., 2004</xref>. It is postulated that the ability of AMPK in enhancing glucose uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russell et al., 2004</xref> and suppressing ribosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2017</xref> is the major reason for cardioprotection. However, the translation of AMPK activation for cardiac therapy has not been successful, partially due to limited understanding of the mechanism for AMPK protection. A recent study shows that activation of AMPK results in increased level of acetyl-CoA and therefore likely elevates histone acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salminen et al., 2016</xref>. Thus, it is possible that AMPK promotes cardiac repair via direct epigenetic regulation. Similarly, altering the levels of different metabolites show beneficial effect on cardiac repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olenchock et al., 2016</xref>. The change of Acetyl-CoA may also have a direct effect on the expression of HATs after I/R injury in heart. Kat2a, a major HAT enzyme in catalyzing histone acetylation, was upregulated after I/R, while enrichment of acetyl-CoA by 8 C metabolism diminished the need of Kat2a upregulation. Considering the potential roles of these metabolites in epigenetic regulations, re-examining these studies will likely provide new insights into metabolite-mediated epigenetic changes in heart disease treatment beyond the mitochondria function, and lead to more successful therapy.</p><p>Our study suggests that increasing histone acetylation by metabolic acetyl-CoA production is an effective strategy for heart repair. Although increasing histone acetylation by metabolic acetyl-CoA production is an effective strategy for heart repair, not all metabolites that generate acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation have the same beneficial effect. One major reason could be that certain metabolites also generate other signals that cancel or even outweigh this beneficial effect. For example, succinate is found to be the major source of ROS production after I/R and succinate administration aggravates I/R injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>. 9 C produces succinate through anaplerotic reaction, and our results show that the accumulation of succinate level is much higher in 9 C compared to 8 C treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Moreover, 9 C also produces propionyl-CoA, which inhibits the activity of Kat2a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montgomery et al., 2015</xref>, and likely abolishes the potential effect of acetyl-CoA on stimulating histone acetylation. Together, these data may explain the null effect of 9 C administration in heart repair. Overall, this study elucidates that exploring detailed metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms mediated by various metabolic carbon sources in combating I/R injury will be an exciting research area to develop potential effective heart therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

carried out in rats as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, 8–9 weeks old male SD rats (Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Myocardial ischemia was performed by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) using 6–0 silk sutures. After 45 min of ischemia, the myocardium was reperfused. Sodium acetate (2 C), sodium pyruvate (3 C), sodium citrate(6 C), sodium octanoate (8 C), and sodium nonanoate (9 C) were dissolved in saline at concentrations of 125 mg/mL, 125 mg/mL, 125 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, and 50 mg/mL, respectively. 2 C (500 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frost et al., 2014</xref>), 3 C (500 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">González-Falcón et al., 2003</xref>), 6 C (500 mg/kg), 8 C (160 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vinay et al., 1976</xref>), and 9 C (200 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vinay et al., 1976</xref>) were intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected to rats for 3 continuous days and another dose before LAD ligation for screening assay. In a clinically relevant setting, 8 C was i.p. injected at the time of reperfusion, which was 45 min after LAD ligation. For blood sample collection, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) then euthanized by injection of pentobarbital at 50 mg/kg for subsequent heart isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>The rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. Echocardiography (ECG) was performed 1 day and 4 weeks after surgery using Vevo 2,100 system with M model. Left ventricular internal diameter end diastole (LVIDd) and left ventricular internal diameter end systole (LVIDs) were measured perpendicularly to the long axis of the ventricle.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Lei and colleagues explores the role of acetyl-CoA in mediating the metabolic/epigenetic crosstalk that is proposed to occur in heart injury. Specifically, they focus on defining the source of the acetyl-CoA and which specific histone modifications it contributes to. Using both the rat LAD-surgery induced myocardial I/R model and an in vitro NRVM model of ischemic injury they propose that sodium octanoate (8C) is the source and that it leads to transcriptional reprogramming of antioxidant and apoptosis genes through histone acetylation mediated by lysine acetyltransferase 2a (KAT2A). Importantly, they also show that the source of this 8C is via MCAD and that this can contribute to heart repair. Overall, this is an important area of research. However, the reviewers have several concerns regarding this manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The main hypothesis of this study is that increasing mitochondrial acetyl CoA production will increase histone acetylation which may protect the heart from I/R injury. However, despite the fact that acetylation of proteins in each compartment is strongly linked to local acetyl-CoA levels (PMID: 30467427), the authors did not take into consideration the cell compartment-specific level of acetyl-CoA in their study. In this case, while the nuclear/cytoplasm acetyl CoA levels could be critical for histone acetylation, the mitochondrial acetyl CoA levels may not have a direct impact on histone acetylation but rather on mitochondrial protein acetylation. This is a major methodological gap and the authors should include specifically the changes in nuclear/cytoplasmic acetyl CoA levels.</p><p>2. It is generally accepted that increased acetylation of certain histone proteins improves cardiovascular function in response to various injuries which led to the discovery of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. In contrary, hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins are linked with metabolic disturbances and cardiac dysfunction (PMID: 32413386). Relevant to the current study, there is strong evidence suggesting that increased acetylation of antioxidant enzymes in the mitochondria including SOD2 is associated with its decreased activity and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, this concept was not considered despite the fact that increased acetyl CoA production may have a negative impact on these enzymes by hyperacetylating them. How do the authors reconcile this contradiction? In addition, how do they explain the absent of mitochondrial acetylation impact assessment in their study?</p><p>3. Most of the carbon sources used in this study were not the common ones or physiologically relevant to human FA metabolism. Why did the authors exclude physiologically relevant fatty acids such as palmitate and oleate in their study?</p><p>4. Despite all of the metabolites contributing to acetyl CoA generation, the authors tried to show that only the acetyl CoA derived from 8C is responsible for increased histone acetylation. However, the subsequent experiments confirm this 8C specific acetyl CoA action is problematic. Firstly, fractional contribution of each metabolite to the total acetyl CoA pool was not accessed. Though sophisticated, carbon labeling and metabolite analysis from tissue extracts by NMR could be used to accurately determine this. But the KD of MCAD can also block metabolism of other metabolites catalyzed by this enzyme and is not specific to 8C. Thus, there is no direct evidence to support that acetyl CoA from 8C is specifically responsible for increased histone acetylation. At least the authors could have compared the effect of each of these metabolites on the histone acetylation level instead of 8C only.</p><p>5. As indicated in #2 above, increased mitochondrial acetyl CoA may not be the exact mechanism for increased histone acetylation following these short chain FA administration. Rather, as suggested previously, direct binding of the short chain fatty acids to HDACS and its inhibition could be possible mechanisms that could have been investigated. Any of nuclear cytoplasmic specific acetyl CoA generating enzymes: ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and acyl-coenzyme A synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), and the nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), could have been also targeted instead of MCAD to better understand the situation.</p><p>6. There are evidence that shows that fatty acid oxidation is increased during reperfusion, which implies an increased acetyl CoA level (PMID: 9293951). However, in this study the authors suggested that there is a decrease in acetyl CoA level after I/R. How do the authors reconcile this paradox?</p><p>7. The use of serum CK and LDH as an indicator of cell death is also misleading. First, these are not the best markers. Secondly, instead of measuring cardiac specific isoenzymes, the authors analyzed only unspecified(total?) serum levels of these enzymes.</p><p>8. To understand the pathophysiological significance of the findings the authors should measure the concentrations of the metabolites that are achieved after IP injection.</p><p>9. Conclusions would be strengthened if heavy labeled substrates were used in the in vivo experiments and the authors showing that the acetyl-coA that they are measuring in heart tissues were derived from label that was injected.</p><p>10. Although 8C was the most statistically significant protection, Figure 1C, the changes were similar with 2C and 3C. This should be expanded upon in the discussion as other sources of acetyl-CoA could also be protective.</p><p>11. Please include a supplementary table with the genes and their fold change for the pathway analysis; e.g. Figure 2G. Along those lines there is a comment in the Figure 2 legend for a heatmap (H) of the antioxidant gene expression that is not provided. In place of it is the DHE staining images</p><p>12. The data in Figure 4 is robust. However, please reword the conclusion ending on page 10. Some of the decreases in histone acetylation was rescued, however not all (e.g. H3K9 and H3K27) which were attenuated. Please rephrase.</p><p>13 There is a disconnect between histone acetylation, RNA, and protein for the targets examined in Figure 4 and S3; i.e. HO1 and NQO1. Although this is not uncommon, it does draw into question the proposed transcriptional regulation mechanism versus post-transcriptional regulation. Specifically, how is the increased sI/R acetylation in these targets associated with increased mRNA but decreased protein and the further increase in histone acetylation seen with sI/R+8C is leading to a further increase in mRNA but rescue of protein, while the increase in acetylation in normoxia+8C has no effect. Please clarify or adjust conclusions based on the data shown.</p><p>14. Inclusion of Mcad in Figure 5F is an important control to show that 8C is not interfering with the KD. Please discuss in the text.</p><p>15. A primary conclusion of the paper is the role of KAT2A. The in vitro work in Figure 6 supports this. However, the authors should also present if Kat2a gene expression was changed in the RNA-seq data from the rat model. It is noted that KAT2A protein could be driving the differences in vivo based on acetyl-CoA levels but this should be discussed.</p><p>16. Some of western blot band are shown in different molecular weight than it should be normally. First, cleaved caspase 3 band in figure 3E is shown to be under 20kda while the band in supplementary figure S6 is shown around 25kda. As cleaved caspase 3 is normally detected around 17 or 19 KDa, this cleaved caspase 3 blot may be nonspecific band from the antibody used in western blot. Second, NQO1 band in figure S3, S4, S5 and S8 are shown to be above 37 KDa while normally NQO1 is detected around 29-31 KDa. This NQO1 band may be non-specific band from the antibody. The authors are advised to confirm the western blot results for cleaved caspase 3 and NQO1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Acetyl-CoA production by select metabolites promotes cardiac repair after myocardial infarction via histone acetylation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The antioxidant enzymes are regulated by both transcriptionally and post-translationally, and as the reviewer suggests, the reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes by potential hyperacetylation may cancel the effect of transcriptional upregulation of antioxidant enzymes by histone acetylation increase. The overall effect of acetyl-CoA production on antioxidant activity would be a sum of the two effects. In our experiments, we found the treatment of 8C could reduce oxidation level in the cells. Thus, it is likely that the effect of 8C on histone acetylation is greater than potential acetylation of antioxidant enzymes and overall shows a beneficial effect. This is also the main reason we did not examine the changes in mitochondrial acetylation in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Most of the carbon sources used in this study were not the common ones or physiologically relevant to human FA metabolism. Why did the authors exclude physiologically relevant fatty acids such as palmitate and oleate in their study?</p></disp-quote><p>The palmitate and oleate require CD36 for transport. The CD36 expression was reduced after I/R injury. Therefore, we use medium chain fatty acids that can permeabilize to cells to bypass the involvement of CD36 for membrane transfer. Nevertheless, we will also examine these long chain fatty acids in our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

How do the authors reconcile this paradox?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The paper reviewer referenced suggests the inhibition activity of ACC, an enzyme determines the ratio of acetyl-CoA: Malonyl-CoA, not directly the level of acetyl-CoA. The ratio could increase by either increased level of acetyl-CoA or decreased level of Malonyl-CoA. There is a study directly measuring the levels of acetyl-CoA and Malonyl-CoA, which shows that both acetyl-CoA and Malonyl-CoA levels decrease after I/R, whereas the ratio of acetyl-CoA vs Malonyl-CoA significantly increases <sup>2</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

A significant increase of acetyl-CoA with 8C administration would diminish the need for Kat2a upregulation. Following this rationale, we discussed the change of Kat2a in line 381: “The change of Acetyl-CoA may also have a direct effect on the expression of HATs after I/R injury in heart. Kat2a, a major HAT enzyme in catalyzing histone acetylation, was upregulated after I/R, while enrichment of acetyl-CoA by 8C metabolism diminished the need of Kat2a upregulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Echocardiography – Describe the device/machine used and indicate the anesthesia that was used if any.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the methods describing echocardiography. “The rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and echocardiography (ECG) was performed 1 day and 4 weeks after surgery using Vevo 2100 system with M model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the basis for estimated NRVM surface area as 6000μm3?
