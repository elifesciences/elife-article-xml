organisms. ‘Interface surveillance’ comprises one such distinct mechanism that specifically guards against aberrant cells which undergo inappropriate cell fate and differentiation programs. The cellular mechanisms which facilitate detection and elimination of these aberrant cells are currently unknown. We find that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs, clones of cells with inappropriate activation of cell fate programs induce bilateral JNK activation at clonal interfaces, where wild type and aberrant cells make contact. JNK activation is required to drive apoptotic elimination of interface cells. Importantly, JNK activity and apoptosis are highest in interface cells within small aberrant clones, which likely supports the successful elimination of aberrant cells when they arise. Our findings are consistent with a model where clone size affects the topology of interface contacts and thereby the strength of JNK activation in wild type and aberrant interface cells. Bilateral JNK activation is unique to ‘interface surveillance’ and is not observed in other tissue-intrinsic defense mechanisms, such as classical ‘cell-cell competition’. Thus, bilateral JNK interface signaling provides an independent tissue-level mechanism to eliminate cells with inappropriate developmental fate but normal cellular fitness. Finally, oncogenic Ras-expressing clones activate ‘interface surveillance’ but evade elimination by bilateral JNK activation. Combined, our work establishes bilateral JNK interface signaling and interface apoptosis as a new hallmark of interface surveillance and highlights how oncogenic mutations evade tumor suppressor function encoded by this tissue-intrinsic surveillance system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell elimination</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>interface contractility</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>cell competition</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC850/A08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Classen</surname><given-names>Anne-Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CL490/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Classen</surname><given-names>Anne-Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIBSS-390939984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Classen</surname><given-names>Anne-Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGBM-GSC-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>Deepti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIF Plus3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Classen</surname><given-names>Anne-Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deregulated cell fate specification pathways, including oncogenic Ras, cause activation of JNK-signaling at contact sites with wild type cells, which drives apoptosis and aberrant cell elimination in a contact-dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetically altered cells appear in epithelial tissues at constant rate, either as a result of developmental errors or mutagenesis throughout adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martincorena, 2019</xref>).

In classical cell-cell competition scenarios, the comparison of cell fitness between neighboring cells is the driving force of cell elimination, with less fit ‘loser’ cells being eliminated by fit ‘winner’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levayer and Moreno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgartner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kucinski et al., 2017</xref>).

These mutations may change a cell’s fate and developmental trajectory but, importantly, may not disrupt cellular fitness per se. In the absence of fitness information, comparison of fitness states cannot be used to eliminate this aberrant cell. Thus, inappropriately specified cells create a distinct challenge to tissue health and, consequently, must activate a distinct program for their detection and elimination from tissue.</p><p>We previously established <italic>interface contractility</italic> as a novel paradigm for tissue-intrinsic defense mechanisms against aberrant, misspecified cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). To reflect the more general implications of this mechanism, we will from now on use the term <italic>‘interface surveillance’</italic>. Briefly, we demonstrated that two adjacent cells appear to be able to compare their fate and differentiation status: cells respond to pronounced fate differences between them by recruiting actomyosin to their shared contact surfaces. This response drives cell segregation between two clonal cell populations via smoothening of the contractile clone interface and is accompanied by elevated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). This is a surprisingly universal response to relative differences in cell fate and differentiation states. Mosaic manipulation of the patterning pathways Dpp/TGF-β, Wg/WNT, Hh/Shh, JAK/STAT, and Notch or cell-fate-specifying transcription factors (Abd-B, Arm, APC, Iro-C, Omb, Yki, En/Inv, Ap, and Ci) induces actomyosin recruitment, clone smoothening, and apoptosis in imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson and Perrimon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen and Dahmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Widmann and Dahmann, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widmann and Dahmann, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallavi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gandille et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bessa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beuchle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prober and Edgar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Worley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Perea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gold and Brand, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Classen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell and Thompson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Organista and De Celis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villa-Cuesta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, these responses are induced in a strict position-dependent manner according to the cell fate of the surrounding cells. For example, Cubitus interruptus (Ci)-expressing clones have normal corrugated shapes in anterior wing compartments, where Ci-activation by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is high. However, Ci-expressing clones undergo clone smoothening and die in posterior compartments, where Ci-signaling is normally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). In summary, the characteristic contractile interface response observed in interface surveillance is exclusively driven by differences in cell fate programs between neighboring cells.</p><p>Interface surveillance efficiently eliminates aberrantly misspecified cells in the absence of fitness differences and thus in the absence of information about which of two neighboring cells should survive. Instead, by comparison to the program of the surrounding cells, interface surveillance uses spatial context and defines a clone as ‘different’. As a consequence, not only aberrant clones are eliminated from the tissue but remaining wild-type clones are also eliminated when surrounded by a majority of aberrant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). Thus interface surveillance promotes apoptosis of cells, which appear aberrant by their relative mispositioning with respect to the fate of surrounding cells. This distinguishes interface surveillance from cell-cell competition, which ensures that always the ‘aberrant’ loser cell dies, independent of spatial context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ultimately, elimination of cells by interface surveillance depends on clone size. Single aberrant cells and small aberrant clones are more efficiently eliminated. Moreover, small clones present with higher level of apoptosis than larger clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). We previously suggested that this may depend on compression induced by the contractile interface around clones, which theoretically gives rise to stronger compression of clones with a small circumference. However, this hypothesis or alternative pathways have not been experimentally tested. In fact, the molecular and cellular pathways, which drive elimination by interface surveillance are not known.</p><p>Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc model, we describe here a surprisingly ingenious solution to remove aberrant cells by interface surveillance. We find that interface surveillance is associated with activation of pro-apoptotic JNK signaling in cells at the interface of two differently fated cell populations, invoking a rejection response between two very different yet seemingly egalitarian cell types. This bilateral response of two contacting cell types drives apoptosis at clonal interfaces. JNK activation scales with clone size and thereby correlates with efficient elimination of single aberrant cells and small clones. This is consistent with a model where cell contact topologies at the interface of large and small clones differ, resulting in size-dependent apoptotic susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Apoptosis is essential to eliminate cells by interface surveillance</title><p>To better understand how interface surveillance drives elimination of aberrant cells, we analyzed mosaic wing imaginal discs using two genotype classes affecting cell fate: (1) cell fate regulators that are not normally expressed in the wing disc and (2) those that are expressed but in specific spatial patterns. The first class is represented by the transcription factors Fkh and Ey, which are master regulators of salivary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haberman et al., 2003</xref>) and eye specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halder et al., 1995</xref>), respectively. These genes are not expressed in the wing discs, and their ectopic expression causes interface surveillance hallmarks like actomyosin enrichment at clone interface in any position of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D’, J-K’’</xref>). The second class is represented by Dpp-mediated (Tkv), EGF-mediated (Egfr), Wg-mediated (Arm), and Hh-mediated (Ci) patterning programs. Dpp-, EGF-, and Wg-signaling are predominantly active in the central wing pouch, whereas Hh-signaling is activated in the anterior wing compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E-I</xref>). Consequently, ectopic activation of these pathways by expression of <italic>tkv<sup>CA</sup></italic>, <italic>Egfr<sup>CA</sup></italic>, or <italic>arm<sup>S10</sup></italic> causes actomyosin enrichment and clone smoothening in lateral pouch domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2L-O’’</xref>). In contrast, actomyosin enrichment and clone smoothening are detected in the posterior compartment upon expression of <italic>ci</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2P-Q”</xref>). Consistent with the idea that it is specifically the difference between neighboring cell fates which induce interface surveillance, we found that loss of <italic>tkv</italic>-function induces actomyosin enrichment and clone smoothening in domains where Dpp-signaling is usually high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I’’</xref>).

Similarly, expression of <italic>bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic> did not prevent the pattern-specific activation of JNK in wild-type cell at the interface with <italic>tkv<sup>CA</sup></italic>-expressing clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that contact between different cell fates activates JNK signaling on each side of the interface – independent of JNK activity in the neighboring interface cell. While these experiments only test if JNK activation in one interface cell is dependent on JNK activation in the neighboring interface cell, our results point to a model where JNK activation is a cell-autonomous response induced by contact between differently fated cells. Cell-autonomous JNK activation invokes independent stress responses to a cell fate difference within two differently fated yet equally viable cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>JNK activation is not dependent on JNK activation in the adjacent interface cell.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Wing discs carrying mosaic clones (magenta or gray) expressing <italic>Bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic> (<bold>A and D</bold>), <italic>Ey</italic> (<bold>B and E</bold>), or <italic>Bsk<sup>DN</sup>, Ey</italic> (<bold>C and F</bold>) and expressing the JNK reporter TRE-RFP (gray or green).

We utilized two genetic strategies: we first inhibited JNK by expression of <italic>bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic> within <italic>tkv<sup>CA</sup></italic>-expressing clones. Indeed, intraclonal inhibition of JNK strongly reduced apoptosis at intraclonal interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). Secondly, to also test the effect of JNK signaling in both clonal and wild-type interface cells, we expressed <italic>bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic> in the posterior compartment of a disc also harboring <italic>tkv<sup>CA</sup></italic> clones. We found that not only apoptosis at intraclonal interfaces in the posterior compartment was reduced but also apoptosis in wild-type interface cells, demonstrating that wild-type cell survival is also affected by JNK interface signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,D’</xref>). The observation that both wild type and aberrant cell survival are regulated by JNK interface signaling supports our model that cell elimination by interface surveillance acts on differences in cellular fates rather than on a specific cell identity per se. Combined, these results clearly establish that JNK interface signaling strongly contributes to the elimination of cells at clonal interfaces and is thus a functional hallmark of the interface surveillance program.</p><p>Intriguingly, JNK interface signaling cannot account for all apoptotic events that we observed in aberrant clones. A second population of apoptotic cells, which could not be suppressed by expression of <italic>bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic>, located specifically to interior zones of clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and L</xref>). These interior zones have lower JNK activity, but their apical surface often buckles to form cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). Theoretically, cysts arise when the contractile clonal interface compresses small and intermediate-sized clones, thereby driving apical surface buckling and cyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). When we analyzed apoptotic patterns, we observed a strong spatial correlation between apical buckling and the apical presence of a subpopulation of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>). This raises the possibility that cell death in clone interiors may be driven by surface buckling dynamics and likely represents the source of JNK-independent apoptotic cell death. While this needs to be investigated further, we conclude that two spatially distinct and independent mechanisms act to promote elimination of aberrant cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>JNK interface signaling scales with clone size and specifically eliminates small clones</title><p>So how could a bilateral activation of pro-apoptotic JNK-signaling by both cell types create specificity for the elimination of aberrant cells? When a mutant cell arises, it is surrounded by wild-type cells. Thus, all surfaces of the aberrant cell - but only one surface in each wild type cell - will be in contact with a different fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As clone sizes increase and the topology of the interface changes, the number of contacts an aberrant cell has with wild-type cells will decrease, and clonal cells without interface contact will emerge.

In contrast: for surrounding (wild type) interface cells, the number of contacts with enclosed (aberrant) cells in small clones will be low, and this number will increase, although only mildly, with increasing clone size. To explore if the likelihood of JNK activation in either interface population may really scale with clone size, we specifically quantified JNK reporter intensities in each interface cell population. Indeed, JNK activation in <italic>fkh</italic>-expressing interface cells is initially higher and strongly decreases with increasing clone size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Of note, we did not observe the mild increase of apoptosis in wild-type interface cells, as predicted for increasing clone sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). While apoptosis was still low, apoptosis was higher in wild-type interface cells around small clones than around large clones. We suggest that apoptosis of wild-type interface cell adjacent to small clones may be subject to additional apoptotic inputs, such as mechanical stress induced by buckling activity of clones, which is predicted to be higher in small clones than in larger clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Combined, these results support a model where bilateral JNK activation is a read-out of clone-size-dependent cell contact topology, which may directly affect the frequency of apoptosis in interface contacting cells.

Activation of JNK has been previously observed when steep differences in cell fates occur and has been suggested to be required for elimination of aberrant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monier and Suzanne, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manjón et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi-Yamada and O’Connor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ohsawa et al., 2011</xref>). We now define bilateral JNK signaling as a central new hallmark of interface surveillance and interface surveillance as a distinct branch of tissue-intrinsic error correction mechanisms protecting against cells with aberrant fate. Bilateral JNK activation is consistent with a model where interface surveillance monitors tissue health by assessing the degree of local differences. As difference per se does not carry information about which of the two contacting cells is aberrant, both cells respond by initiating stress-signaling via JNK activation. This is different than in cell-cell competition, where cell-autonomous activation of JNK signaling in loser cells due to deregulated cellular homeostasis predisposes the loser genotype to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kucinski et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, bilateral JNK activation promotes apoptosis in cells of either genotype, also of wild type cells, that come into contact at the interface. Both JNK activation and apoptosis scale with the changing topology when clone sizes increase. In this interface topology model, bilateral JNK activation is particularly effective at eliminating single aberrant cells and small clones, which can indeed be observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). This would reflect effective suppression of mutant cells by interface surveillance, as mutations in tissues affect single cells initially. While it may be surprising that evolution accepted that also wild-type cells are occasionally eliminated by bilateral JNK activity, the advantages of a such general detector of cell fate mispositioning may outweigh the disadvantage of collateral cell loss. Finally, we note that the topology of interface contacts between two large cell populations equalizes and reduces the number of potential JNK-activating interface contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a consequence, large clones are less likely to activate apoptosis and die. The clone size-dependent topology of bilateral JNK activation may thus also protect large fate compartments and their boundaries from high, potentially deleterious effects of JNK activation during development.</p><p>Strikingly, expression of oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> induces hallmarks of interface surveillance, such as interface actomyosin, apical buckling, cyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>), as well as JNK interface signaling.

Indeed, JNK interface-like signaling has been reported for oncogenic Src-expressing cells in organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krotenberg Garcia et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, oncogenic Ras is a potent suppressor of apoptosis in flies and mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>).

However, why are <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> cells then reported to be eliminated from mammalian tissue? Importantly, different studies conclude that <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> cells are eliminated from epithelial layers by a cell-death-independent mechanism that involves strong activation of interfacial actomyosin activity, driving mechanical squeezing out of the tissue layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kajita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohoka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gudipaty and Rosenblatt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitchell and Rosenblatt, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fadul et al., 2021</xref>).

To define the total region of the wing disc, a Gaussian blur filter of sigma = 4 was applied to the DAPI channel. Intensity-based thresholding using ‘triangle dark’ threshold function was then used to generate a DAPI-based wing disc mask. To create a mask of GFP-labeled clones, the variation in GFP intensities were first pre-processed by applying a maximum and minimum filter of radius = 2. Then, intensity-based thresholding using the ‘default dark’ threshold function was performed to create a binary image. ‘Despeckle’ and ‘fill holes’ functions as well as a size inclusion range of 10-infinity µm<sup>2</sup> were applied to create the final clonal mask. The wing disc mask and the clonal GFP mask were used to define (by Boolean functions) different ROIs and then extract parameters, such as total clonal area, whole disc area, and background area. To define the apoptotic area, the cDcp1 channel was pre-processed by applying maximum and minimum filters, each of radius = 1. An intensity threshold (‘intermodes dark’) for cDcp1 channel was set in such a way that only high intensity cDcp1 particles were picked up. cDcp1 particles were quantified in the different ROIs by ‘limit to threshold function’, and the percentage apoptotic area in each ROI was calculated. A paired t-test test was performed to test for statistical significance. In addition, the total area and apoptotic area were measured for individual clones for an analysis of clone-size-dependent apoptosis. A correlation analysis using the Spearman coefficient and a non-linear regression analysis were performed on the data set. A one-way ANOVA was performed to test for statistical significance between different clone area bins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Quantification of TRE-RFP reporter activity in interface surveillance and cell-cell competition models</title><p>Z-projections of maximum intensity of 2–3 slices of basal sections were generated. To define the total region of the wing disc, a Gaussian blur filter of radius = 4 was applied to the DAPI channel. Intensity-based thresholding using ‘minimum dark’ threshold function was then used to generate a DAPI-based wing disc mask. To create a mask of GFP-labeled clones, the variation in GFP intensities were first pre-processed by applying a maximum and minimum filter of radius = 2. Then, intensity-based thresholding using the ‘otsu’ threshold function was performed to create a binary image. ‘Despeckle’ and ‘fill holes’ functions as well as a size inclusion range of 10-infinity µm<sup>2</sup> were applied to create the final clonal mask. To determine the average size of cells in the wing disc to define a 1 cell wide ROIs for wild type and clonal interfaces, we measured the size of 30 nuclei in three wild-type wing discs and determined their average size as 3.75 µm. To account for cytoplasm in the densely packed pseudostratified tissue, we set the size of each ROI to be 4 µm wide. The enlarge function was used on the GFP clonal mask to generate a 4 µm thick band around clones, representing the wild-type interface ROI (dark blue) as an approximately 1 cell thick band. Then, a second mask of only large clones was generated by defining an ROI with clones of a minimum area of 180 µm<sup>2</sup> to visualize and only select clones that also contained an ‘interior clonal cells (light pink)’ population. On this second mask of large clones, we applied the enlarge function of –4 µm to create ‘clonal interface cells’ ROI (magenta) and the ‘interior clonal cells’ ROI (light pink). Using Boolean functions on these ROIs, the wing disc and the clonal mask, all ROIs required for further analysis could be generated. For example, to generate the background wild-type cell ROI, clones and their wild type interface regions were excluded from the whole disc. Ultimately, the fluorescence intensity of the TRE-RFP channel was measured in different ROIs. Please note that for the quantification of the background TRE-RFP intensity in the discs with RpS3<sup>−/−</sup> clones, the background was defined as a 4 µm band of wild-type cells adjacent to the wild-type interface cells, as we observed a general upregulation of JNK-signaling independent from an interface pattern in the mosaic RpS3<sup>−/−</sup> wing discs. One-way ANOVA tests were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Quantification of TRE-RFP reporter activity in the center and periphery of the pouch in clones expressing GFP or UAS-<italic>tkv</italic><sup>CA</sup> clones</title><p>A single representative section of the disc proper was selected, which contained nuclei of both clonal cells and wild-type cells and used for further analysis. To create a mask of GFP-labeled clones, the variation in GFP intensities were first pre-processed by applying a maximum and minimum filter of radius = 2. Then, intensity-based thresholding using the ‘otsu’ threshold function was performed to create a binary image, and a size inclusion range of 10-infinity µm<sup>2</sup> was applied to create the final clonal mask. Individual clones were then picked in such a way that a 4 µm band could be drawn around them using the enlarge function, without this region encroaching into the area of surrounding clones. The criteria for picking different clones were as follows: <italic>Dad</italic>-LacZ intensity in clones in the center of the pouch and in the 4 micron band around the respective clone was in the range of ±20 AU; however, the difference in intensity in <italic>Dad</italic>-lacZ clones and the 4 micron band around the clone was much larger in the pouch periphery (the Dad-LacZ intensity in the 4 micron band around clones in pouch periphery was close to 0). The channel with TRE-RFP signal was selected, and the fluorescence intensity in the clones in the center and periphery of the pouch was measured. A paired t-test was used to statistically analyze the TRE-RFP reporter intensity in clones expressing GFP or <italic>tkv</italic><sup>CA</sup> in the center and the periphery of the pouch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Quantification of percentage of apoptotic area in the presence and absence of JNK signaling</title><p>The percentage of apoptotic area in wing discs expressing aberrant clones was analyzed in in presence (5B, 5C S5B, and S5C) and in the absence of JNK signaling (5 H,L). We used two different model systems to study the effect of JNK inhibition on the apoptosis of aberrant clones. We first suppressed intra-clonal JNK activity only, for example, flip-out clones co-expressing UAS-<italic>tkv</italic><sup>CA</sup> and UAS-bsk<sup>DN</sup> (5 H). For the second model, we suppressed JNK activity in the entire posterior compartment using the en-GAL4-UAS expression system, and the <italic>tkv</italic><sup>CA</sup> expressing clones were under the control of the LexA-LexO system (5 L).</p><p>Z-projections of maximum intensity of 5–6 slices of basal sections were generated. To define the total region of the wing disc, a Gaussian blur filter of radius = 4 was applied to the DAPI channel.

On this second mask of large clones, we applied the enlarge function of –4 µm to create ‘clonal interface cells’ ROI (magenta) and the ‘interior clonal cells’ ROI (light pink). Additionally in 5 H, ROIs of the posterior and anterior wing disc compartments were generated using the en-GAL4,UAS-GFP channel and the Boolean function XOR, respectively. Using Boolean functions on these ROIs, the wing disc and the clonal mask, all ROIs required for further analysis could be generated. For example, to generate the background wild-type cell ROI, clones and their wild-type interface regions were excluded from the whole disc. To define the apoptotic area, the cDcp1 channel was pre-processed by applying maximum and minimum filters, each of radius = 1. An intensity threshold (‘intermodes dark’) for cDcp1 channel was set in such a way that only high intensity cDcp1 particles were picked up. cDcp1 particles were quantified in the different ROIs by ‘limit to threshold function’, and the percentage apoptotic area in each ROI was calculated. For measuring apoptosis of the wild-type cells at the wild-type cell interface and the remaining wild-type population (‘background’), a cDcp1 mask was generated from the pre-processed and thresholded cDcp1 channel. A GFP mask was generated, which contained all GFP-positive particles. The image calculator function ‘AND’ was used to generate a GFP-positive cDcp1 mask. Then, the image calculator function ‘Subtract’ was used between the cDcp1 mask and the GFP-positive cDcp1 mask to generate the mask of GFP-negative cDcp1 particles. An ROI of these GFP negative particles was created, and the AND function was employed between the wild-type interface ROI and the background ROIs to measure the area of GFP-negative cDcp1 in the respective ROIs. A one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA test was performed to test for statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Quantification of TRE intensities and apoptosis within individual clones</title><p>A single representative section of the disc proper was selected, which contained nuclei of both clonal and wild-type cells to measure TRE-RFP intensity.

On this second mask of large clones, we applied the enlarge function of –4 µm to create ‘clonal interface cells’ ROI (magenta) and the ‘interior clonal cells’ ROI (light pink). Individual clones of varying sizes in the pouch and hinge were selected. While TRE-RFP and cDcp1 areas were measured for all ROIs in the medium and large clones, on the total clone TRE-RFP and cDcp1 areas, and wild-type interface data was measured for the small clones. The wing disc mask and the clonal GFP mask were used to define (by Boolean functions) different ROIs and then extract parameters, such as total clonal area, clonal interface area, and clonal and wild-type interface areas.

A correlation anaylsis using the Spearman coefficient and a non-linear semi-log regression analysis were performed on the data set of individual clone. The clones were also separated into bins according to their size, and a one-way ANOVA was performed to test for statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Analysis of spatial correlation between buckling and apoptosis</title><p>Maximum intensity projections were generated, which specifically excluded the peripodium, when analysis of all apoptotic events in 3D was required. The GFP-marked clonal mask was generated using intensity-based thresholding, followed the ‘fill holes’ and ‘despeckle’ functions to remove noise. Medium-sized clones with an area of buckling as well as a planar area were selected and added to the ROI manager. A whole disc cDcp1 mask was generated using intensity-based thresholding on the cDcp1 channel. A clonal cDcp1 mask was generated using Boolean function AND and added to the ROI manager. Maximum projections of the apical junctional network (E-cad) were used to outline the buckling area within a clone with the oval selection tool, which was then added to the ROI manager. Buckling was defined as a characteristic reduction in cell surface areas observed in max projections of the curved surface during buckling. Buckling was verified by analysis of the reprojected Z-sliced stack. An area of similar size and shape was then selected in non-buckling, planar area of the same clone. Care was taken that the planar region was not close to a clonal boundary to avoid confounding effects of JNK-dependent interface signaling on apoptotic behavior. The clonal cDcp1 within the buckling area or the planar area was combined by means of the ‘AND’ function. Lastly, cDcp1 area measurements in both buckling and planar areas were performed. 11 clones from at least 3 different wing discs were quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Quantification of <italic>miniCic</italic>-reporter activity</title><p>A single representative section of the disc proper was selected from the stack for further analysis.

To compare the clonal <italic>miniCic</italic> signal with the signal in surrounding wild-type cells, individual clones were selected as and added to the ROI manager. An outer band ROI (4 μm, corresponding to one cell row) was established around the selected clones using the ‘enlarge’ function. An ROI of clonal nuclei was obtained by using the Boolean function AND on the nuclear mask and the respective clone ROI. Similarly, the outer band of nuclei ROI was also generated for the respective clones. Then the fluorescence signal intensity in the <italic>miniCic</italic> channel was measured for individual clones in the clonal nuclei ROI and the outer band nuclei ROI.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bilateral <italic>JNK</italic> activation is a hallmark of interface contractility and promotes elimination of aberrant cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1 – Quantitative characterization of much of the data is missing. Only single representative images are shown for many of the experiments. The manuscript would strengthen massively when these images are supported with a quantitative measurement. For example (but not limited to), TRE-GFP in correctly vs mis-specified clones in Figure 2K-L, TRE-GFP intensity in Figure 3, clonal analysis in Figure 5.</p><p>2 – The authors claim that removal of aberrant cells is dependent on clone size and only occurs when aberrant cells are the minority compared to the surrounding tissue. Currently, there is no data in the manuscript that supports this claim. The only analysis of tissues containing a majority of miss-specified cells (Figures 2I-2J) shows a bilateral activation of <italic>JNK</italic>, similar to a minority of miss-specified cells. To support the claim that the phenotype is size dependent further analysis of clone size in relation to apoptosis and <italic>JNK</italic> activation is essential.</p><p>3 – Range of <italic>JNK</italic> activation. It is difficult to evaluate the exact range of <italic>JNK</italic> activation on both side of the clones relative to cell diameter. It is however an important point especially if the mechanism is somehow based on direct contact between cells (as claimed by the authors). Could the author try to quantify more precisely the average <italic>JNK</italic> signal at different distance from clone boundary? Ideally, this could be done after apical surface cell segmentation to see to which extent it is restricted to one raw of cells on each side and using some local projection tools to restrict as much as possible the number of plane projected (for instance using the local projector plugin from Fiji).</p><p>4 – <italic>JNK</italic> and cell-autonomous regulation. The authors validate that expression of TRE-GFP is dependent on <italic>JNK</italic> signaling, through over-expression of a dominant negative variant of the <italic>JNK</italic> kinase (BSKDN) in clones of miss-specified cells (ey or tkv). This experiment nicely shows that activation of <italic>JNK</italic> in surrounding WT cells is not altered. This furthermore illustrates that <italic>JNK</italic> signaling in the miss-specified cells is not needed for activation of <italic>JNK</italic> in their neighbors. However, this does not support the conclusion that <italic>JNK</italic> is activated in a cell autonomous fashion in either of these populations. The interaction of the two cell types can still cause signaling, but through inhibition of one of the kinases within the pathway, this just does not lead to downstream activation of TRE-GFP. In fact, one could argue that the expression of TRE-GFP is not cell-autonomous, because tkvCA clones that are not mis-specified (within dad4-LacZ regions) do not show induction of TRE-GFP (Figure 2L). The only way to untangle cell autonomous vs non-autonomous effects is through manipulation of upstream communication between the different cell populations. Such experiments, for example, manipulation of contractility, are likely beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, I would suggest rephrasing this paragraph.</p><p>5 – Apoptosis. The authors use p35 to prevent apoptosis but p35-protected cells are themselves known to activate <italic>JNK</italic>. It would be better to use DIAP1 expression, or to add Dronc-DN to p35. Preventing cell death with p35+dronc-DN could possibly restore the loss of mis-specified cells, because p35-protected cells are known to produce Dronc-dependent growth signals, which could actually be what is maintaining these cells.</p><p>6 – This study in context. While this study investigates a wide range of genetic backgrounds and uses comprehensive approaches, there are precedents in the literature that should be mentioned and discussed. Specifically, previous studies showed similar patterns of <italic>JNK</italic> activity upon local distortion of morphogens (so called morphogenetic apoptosis, Adachi-Yamada and O'Connor Dev Biol 2002), or the pattern of <italic>JNK</italic> activation observed near polariy mutant clones (Ohsawa et al., Dev Cell 2011) suggesting that this bilateral <italic>JNK</italic> activation might not be completely unique to these contexts. Previously, the expression &quot;morphogenetic apoptosis&quot; was used by Adachi-Yamada, please acknowledge and discuss those previous studies and tone down assertions of novelty accordingly.</p><p>7 – Clarifications and accuracy of statements. There are several areas in which editorial revisions should be considered. The authors used the terminology &quot;interfacial contractility&quot; to define the elimination context that they previously characterized (most likely to delineate it from other competition scenarios and as this was one of first distinctive feature that they found). This may give the impression (which is probably not what the authors wants to convey) that the <italic>JNK</italic> activation pattern is a byproduct of the interfacial contractility, which the authors have not shown. Possibly, an unknown factor associated with all these mislocalisation contexts triggers both an increase of lateral tension and in parallel this pattern of <italic>JNK</italic>. Unless the authors can demonstrate that interfacial tension and sorting are causal to <italic>JNK</italic> activation, it would be best to re-phrase throughout the text, the title and the abstract (for instance, figure 2 title &quot;Interfacial contractility activates <italic>JNK</italic> interface signaling&quot;) and use some other descriptor such as pattern defect.</p><p>8 – Clarifications and accuracy of statements. The model proposed by the authors at the end (relationship between number of contact and <italic>JNK</italic> levels) seems a bit premature and not fully supported by current data. If this was true, one would expect differences in the <italic>JNK</italic> levels in small isolated cells compared to boundary or larger clones, and it does not really seem to be the case (e.g.: Figure 2I, there are few UAS-Fkj cells in the center of the WT large patch on the left and they don't have higher levels of <italic>JNK</italic> compared to the UAS-fkh cells surrounding the WT patch and most likely sharing less contact). Actually the relationship between clone size and probability to disappear could be explained by several alternative models: (i) if cell death is mostly restricted to the boundary, while proliferation distributed throughout the clone, then the ratio death over cell division will scale with the perimeter over the surface ratio of the clone. As a result, clone above a certain size will not disappear. (ii) Alternatively, the size effect can be explained by the previous study of the authors. Assuming that part of the death is trigger by pressure coming from lateral contractility, then pressure should be higher for small clones (small curvature) and may lead to this preferential elimination. Therefore, unless the author can show a correlation between <italic>JNK</italic> levels and number of neighbors, it would be best to keep open the models explaining this size effect and certainly not include this in the main figure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80809.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1 – Quantitative characterization of much of the data is missing. Only single representative images are shown for many of the experiments. The manuscript would strengthen massively when these images are supported with a quantitative measurement. For example (but not limited to), TRE-GFP in correctly vs mis-specified clones in Figure 2K-L, TRE-GFP intensity in Figure 3, clonal analysis in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and performed additional quantification experiments and modified some quantification workflows, as requested by others below.

Currently, there is no data in the manuscript that supports this claim. The only analysis of tissues containing a majority of miss-specified cells (Figures 2I-2J) shows a bilateral activation of JNK, similar to a minority of miss-specified cells. To support the claim that the phenotype is size dependent further analysis of clone size in relation to apoptosis and JNK activation is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this analysis which is now shown in new Figure 6 and new Figure 6 —figure supplement 1. This new data supports of our model that changes in cell contact topology due to changes in clone size alter <italic>JNK</italic> activation strength. In addition, however, we minimized the minority/majority analogy in our text, as this concept was useful to highlight the differences to cell competition but appeared too abstract and distracted from what we actually think is import, which is the interface shape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Range of JNK activation. It is difficult to evaluate the exact range of JNK activation on both side of the clones relative to cell diameter. It is however an important point especially if the mechanism is somehow based on direct contact between cells (as claimed by the authors). Could the author try to quantify more precisely the average JNK signal at different distance from clone boundary? Ideally, this could be done after apical surface cell segmentation to see to which extent it is restricted to one raw of cells on each side and using some local projection tools to restrict as much as possible the number of plane projected (for instance using the local projector plugin from Fiji).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that segmentation of apical surfaces would be ideal for this analysis. We are aware of the local projector plugin for FIJI and have used it in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1E. However, the relatively small size of the apical cell surface and distortion of its shape due to mechanics arising from interface contraction, apical surface buckling or apoptosis makes segmentation and interpretation of the junctional network for quantitative purposes exceedingly difficult. In addition, the segmented apical network will not always correspond well with the more lateral cytoplasmic/nuclear signals for the <italic>JNK</italic> reporter. Our approach to quantify <italic>JNK</italic>-activity in a lateral section offers a reproducible spatial representation of cells and <italic>JNK</italic> reporter activity. To address your comment experimentally, we now provide an additional analysis in Figure 2 C, F, IK and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 A-D: we introduced an extra band (ie. ‘cell row 2’) next to interface cells to better illustrate the significant drop in <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling next to the interface cell band. We hope that this modification improves the spatial description of the bilateral JNKsignaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – JNK and cell-autonomous regulation. The authors validate that expression of TRE-GFP is dependent on JNK signaling, through over-expression of a dominant negative variant of the JNK kinase (BSKDN) in clones of miss-specified cells (ey or tkv). This experiment nicely shows that activation of JNK in surrounding WT cells is not altered. This furthermore illustrates that JNK signaling in the miss-specified cells is not needed for activation of JNK in their neighbors. However, this does not support the conclusion that JNK is activated in a cell autonomous fashion in either of these populations. The interaction of the two cell types can still cause signaling, but through inhibition of one of the kinases within the pathway, this just does not lead to downstream activation of TRE-GFP. In fact, one could argue that the expression of TRE-GFP is not cell-autonomous, because tkvCA clones that are not mis-specified (within dad4-LacZ regions) do not show induction of TRE-GFP (Figure 2L). The only way to untangle cell autonomous vs non-autonomous effects is through manipulation of upstream communication between the different cell populations. Such experiments, for example, manipulation of contractility, are likely beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, I would suggest rephrasing this paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree and rephrased that entire section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – Apoptosis. The authors use p35 to prevent apoptosis but p35-protected cells are themselves known to activate JNK. It would be better to use DIAP1 expression, or to add Dronc-DN to p35. Preventing cell death with p35+dronc-DN could possibly restore the loss of mis-specified cells, because p35-protected cells are known to produce Dronc-dependent growth signals, which could actually be what is maintaining these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included new experiments where we use Diap1 to prevent cell death in aberrant clones. These experiments did not change our conclusion. The quantified data is now included in (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Please note that we performed and quantified similar experiments previously, which are published in Figure 6 A-I, Figure S6 J-N in reference [1].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – This study in context. While this study investigates a wide range of genetic backgrounds and uses comprehensive approaches, there are precedents in the literature that should be mentioned and discussed. Specifically, previous studies showed similar patterns of JNK activity upon local distortion of morphogens (so called morphogenetic apoptosis, Adachi-Yamada and O'Connor Dev Biol 2002), or the pattern of JNK activation observed near polariy mutant clones (Ohsawa et al., Dev Cell 2011) suggesting that this bilateral JNK activation might not be completely unique to these contexts. Previously, the expression &quot;morphogenetic apoptosis&quot; was used by Adachi-Yamada, please acknowledge and discuss those previous studies and tone down assertions of novelty accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this lack of citation. Please allow us to explain:</p><p>We are now commenting on and including Adachi-Yamada and O'Connor and Ohsawa et al. in the beginning of the discussion, together with Monier and Suzanne and Manjon et al.</p><p>Of note, we have not been able to reproduce bilateral <italic>JNK</italic> activation in <italic>scrib</italic> mutant clones (Ohsawa et al) possibly because of differences in allelic strength and are thus refraining from discussing <italic>scrib</italic> mutant clones.</p><p>Also, we did not want to use the term ‘morphogenetic apoptosis’ for two reason: interface apoptosis and interface contractility are parallel pathways of the same process and are induced not just by morphogen deregulation but also other fate specification processes. Secondly, the term morphogenetic apoptosis (in our perception) is now more closely associated with the morphogenetic consequences of apoptotic extrusion for tissue fold formation in development, as described in leg discs (see <italic>Monier and Suzanne</italic> and <italic>Manjon et al.)</italic>. We did not want to create confusion in the literature (by using the term ‘morphogentic apoptosis’) about what we think the causes of interface apoptosis are (any aberrant fate, not just morphogen-induced) and what we think the consequences of interface apoptosis are (we do not observe morphogenetic changes in the wing discs that we can attribute to interface/morphogenetic apoptosis). All characteristic morphological changes created by aberrant clones can still be observed in our experiments when we inhibit apoptosis by Diap1, p35 or BskDN. Even the apical buckling and cyst formation from the clone interior does not depend on any morphogenetic forces from apoptosis, as buckling and cyst are equally well observed when apoptosis is inhibited (see [1-3] and this manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7 – Clarifications and accuracy of statements. There are several areas in which editorial revisions should be considered. The authors used the terminology &quot;interfacial contractility&quot; to define the elimination context that they previously characterized (most likely to delineate it from other competition scenarios and as this was one of first distinctive feature that they found). This may give the impression (which is probably not what the authors wants to convey) that the JNK activation pattern is a byproduct of the interfacial contractility, which the authors have not shown. Possibly, an unknown factor associated with all these mislocalisation contexts triggers both an increase of lateral tension and in parallel this pattern of JNK. Unless the authors can demonstrate that interfacial tension and sorting are causal to JNK activation, it would be best to re-phrase throughout the text, the title and the abstract (for instance, figure 2 title &quot;Interfacial contractility activates JNK interface signaling&quot;) and use some other descriptor such as pattern defect.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. We have now termed the process ‘interface surveillance’ which improves readability and clarity of this manuscript, and provides an open/neutral term for future discussion of its role in tissue-intrinsic error correction processes but also developmental processes (for example compartment boundary formation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8 – Clarifications and accuracy of statements.

However, we now provide evidence in Figure 6 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 that <italic>JNK</italic> levels in wild type and aberrant interface cells scale with clone size in the expected (opposite) manner. Moreover, our experimentally observed distribution of apoptosis confirms this model as well. While we did not quantify the exact number of neighboring cells at the interface due to spatial limitations for segmentation (small cell size, cell network distortions, and apical surface distortions – particularly in interface cells around small clones). Yet, we are certain that our new data in Figure 6 provides a basis to discuss a simple possible concept of how interface surveillance induces a scaling of a bilateral response between two cell types and drives elimination of single aberrant cells.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
