lifelong infection through establishment of latency. Although reactivation from latency can cause life-threatening disease, our molecular understanding of HCMV latency is incomplete. Here we use single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize latency in monocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In monocytes, we identify host cell surface markers that enable enrichment of latent cells harboring higher viral transcript levels, which can reactivate more efficiently, and are characterized by reduced intrinsic immune response that is important for viral gene expression. Significantly, in latent HSPCs, viral transcripts could be detected only in monocyte progenitors and were also associated with reduced immune-response. Overall, our work indicates that regardless of the developmental stage in which HCMV infects, HCMV drives hematopoietic cells towards a weaker immune-responsive monocyte state and that this anergic-like state is crucial for the virus ability to express its transcripts and to eventually reactivate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most people around the world unknowingly carry the human cytomegalovirus, as this virus can become dormant after infection and hide in small numbers of blood stem cells (which give rise to blood and immune cells). Dormant viruses still make their host cells read their genetic information and create viral proteins – a process known as gene expression – but they do not use them to quickly multiply. However, it is possible for the cytomegalovirus to reawaken at a later stage and start replicating again, which can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems. It is therefore important to understand exactly how the virus can stay dormant, and how it reactivates.</p><p>Only certain infected cells allow dormant viruses to later reactivate; in others, it never starts to multiply again. Techniques that can monitor individual cells are therefore needed to understand how the host cells and the viruses interact during dormant infection and reactivation.</p><p>To investigate this, Shnayder et al. infected blood stem cells in the laboratory and used a method known as single-cell RNA analysis, which highlights all the genes (including viral genes) that are expressed in a cell. This showed that in certain cells, the virus dampens the cell defenses, leading to a higher rate of viral gene expression and, in turn, easier reactivation.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the blood stem cells that expressed the viral genes were marked to become a type of immune cells known as monocytes. In turn, these infected monocytes were shown to be less able to defend the body against infection, suggesting that latent human cytomegalovirus suppresses the body’s innate immune response.</p><p>The reactivation of human cytomegalovirus is a dangerous issue for patients who have just received an organ or blood stem cells transplant. The study by Shnayder et al. indicates that treatments that boost innate immunity may help to prevent the virus from reawakening, but more work is needed to test this theory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>latency</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>reactivation</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infect-ERA, TANKACY</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting grant (StG-2014-638142)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cambridge NIHR BRC Cell Phenotyping Hub</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinclair</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0701279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinclair</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell and bulk expression analyses reveal that HCMV latent infection drives cells towards a weaker immune-responsive state, which is important for its expression and reactivation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a prevalent pathogen of the beta-herpesvirus family, infecting the majority of the human population worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Staras et al., 2006</xref>). Following primary infection, HCMV persists through the lifetime of the host by establishing latency. In the latent state, no viral progeny is produced but the virus maintains the capacity to reactivate. Reactivation in immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients and HIV patients, leads to severe illness and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crough and Khanna, 2009</xref>). Despite the significant health burden that accompanies HCMV reactivation from latency, to date there is no treatment that targets the latent stage and the processes governing latency and reactivation are far from fully understood.</p><p>HCMV has a wide cell tropism within its human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mocarski and Shenk, 2013</xref>), with most cell types supporting lytic replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sinzger et al., 2008a</xref>). In contrast, latent infection has so far been characterized in cells of the early myeloid lineage, including CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and CD14+ monocytes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendelson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor-Wiedeman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">von Laer et al., 1995</xref>). Since CD14+ monocytes are short-lived cells it has been proposed that the latent reservoir resides in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Slobedman et al., 2010</xref>) and that latent monocytes support viral spread and persistence within the infected host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stevenson et al., 2014</xref>). Latent cells in HCMV seropositive individuals are scarce and were estimated by PCR-driven in situ hybridization, at 1:10,000 to 25,000 with a copy number of 2 to 13 genomes per infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slobedman and Mocarski, 1999</xref>). Using highly sensitive methodologies, such as digital PCR, viral genomes were detected in less than half of seropositive individuals and viral load was estimated at less than 10 genomes in 10,000 cells in most individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parry et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the scarcity of HCMV-infected cells in the natural context, in vitro HCMV infection of primary cells, mainly HSPCs and monocytes were developed as models. The caveat of these systems is their heterogeneity and the possibility that they may represent dynamic differentiation states. Additionally, although both models are being widely used, the differences between them are not well understood.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly evident that the repertoire of viral genes expressed during latent infections is broader than initially appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwartz and Stern-Ginossar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>). Despite low expression of viral transcripts, a number of studies have described infection driven changes in host cells during HCMV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kew et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reeves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Slobedman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). Monocyte infection was proposed to promote differentiation to macrophages with specific polarization towards genes that mark M1 phenotype with some atypical attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand it was shown that the viral homolog of human interleukin-10, encoded by UL111A, polarizes monocytes into an anti-inflammatory M2 subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avdic et al., 2013</xref>). The UL7 viral protein was found to bind Fms-like tyrosine kinase three receptor (Flt-3R), inducing differentiation of HSPCs to monocytes and of monocytes to macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crawford et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, analysis of HCMV- infected HSPCs revealed reprogramming of HSPCs into immune-suppressive monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, although it is clear that latent HCMV infection affects the differentiation state of infected HSPCs and monocytes, the nature of these effects is still enigmatic and controversial.</p><p>The studies to date examining host responses to latent HCMV infection focused on differences between infected and uninfected cells or on the effect of specific viral transcripts. Since the experimental systems for HCMV latency rely on primary immune cell populations, which are heterogeneous, and since infection is variable within the culture, it is likely that analyses of bulk populations could miss important signatures. Single cell-RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) provides a unique opportunity to depict viral and host heterogeneity simultaneously and thus to uncover functional connections between the cellular environment and viral gene expression. Indeed, several recent works that applied single cell transcriptomics, revealed novel insights into the complexity of the host response and cellular permissiveness for a number of well-studied viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drayman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galinato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steuerman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wyler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zanini et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using single cell RNA data, we analyzed host determinants that are associated with HCMV latency. In CD14+ monocytes, we identified two cellular cell surface markers, MHCII and its chaperon CD74, whose expression is inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels. We demonstrate these markers allow separating between cells harboring higher and lower viral transcript levels, that these differences are induced by HCMV infection and that the cells exhibiting higher viral transcript levels support more efficient reactivation of HCMV from latency. Using these markers, we show that latently infected cells display an intrinsic weaker immune response state that is important for the viral ability to express its genes and reactivate. Furthermore, analysis of 7500 infected HSPCs revealed very heterogeneous populations, but viral transcripts were only detected in cells expressing monocyte lineage markers, such as CD14. Remarkably, also in these HSPC-derived monocytes, higher viral transcript levels were associated with lower expression of CD74 and reduced immune response gene signature. Taken together, our findings highlight cell surface proteins associated with viral transcript levels and establish that both HSPC and monocyte infection models lead to establishment of HCMV latency in a similar anergic-like state of monocytic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of host genes correlates with viral transcript levels</title><p>We have previously performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on HCMV- infected CD14+ monocytes as a model for studying HCMV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>). We used the Massively Parallel RNA Sequencing (MARS-seq) platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paul et al., 2015</xref>) to analyze experimentally infected primary CD14+ monocytes at different days post infection (dpi). This approach provided high coverage of cellular and viral transcriptomes, spanning expression of more than 11,000 genes in 3,655 cells. We previously used this dataset to examine the viral transcriptome during HCMV latency, showing it largely mirrors a late lytic viral program, albeit at much lower levels of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An inherent advantage of scRNA-seq is the ability to track viral and host expression within the same cell, thus allowing analysis of viral-host interactions while keeping information on cell-to-cell and infection heterogeneity. Viral transcript levels in the majority of the infected monocyte population was low to undetectable and projection of the cells using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) demonstrated that the cell distribution is determined mainly according to host gene expression variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the cells are organized according to viral transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that much of the differences in host gene expression are associated with variation in viral transcript levels. We therefore calculated Spearman correlation coefficient between the expression of each host gene and the total number of viral transcripts across all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). 319 cellular genes showed significant positive or negative correlations with viral gene expression (Z score &gt;2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Since a key challenge in transcriptome analysis is to connect between snapshots of gene expression profiles and a functional outcome, we first focused on identifying cell surface markers that exhibited strong association with viral gene expression in the scRNA-seq data as these may allow us to enrich for cells with higher viral transcript levels within the population. Among the strongest co-varying genes were genes encoding for MHC class II (variants HLA-DRB1/HLA-DPB1/HLA-DRA/HLA-DQB1/HLA-DPA1/HLA-DQA1/HLA-DMA/HLA-DRB5/HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DMB) and the transcript of CD74, an MHCII chaperon as well as a cell surface receptor on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann, 2012</xref>). Indeed, across the infected monocyte population, the expression level of MHC class II (MHCII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and CD74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) showed clear inverse-correlation to viral transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular gene expression co-vary with viral transcript levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) t-SNE plot of 3416 latently infected CD14+ monocytes based on host and viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>), colored by percentage of HCMV reads per cell.

Indeed, we observed that the expression of both CD74 and MHCII increase over time in culture, both in infected and in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore tested whether this inverse-correlation between CD74 and MHCII expression and viral transcript levels is upheld within a single infected population at single time points. To this end, we infected primary CD14+ monocytes with HCMV strain TB40/E-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Connor and Murphy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sinzger et al., 2008a</xref>).

The first possibility is that viral entry is more efficient in CD74<sup>low</sup> monocytes compared to CD74<sup>high</sup> monocytes, leading to more incoming viral genomes and higher viral transcript levels. In this case, differences in viral levels between CD74<sup>high</sup> and CD74<sup>low</sup> monocytes should be evident immediately following viral entry to the cells. An alternative option is that the differential expression of CD74 is driven by HCMV infection. In this case, the viral DNA and RNA levels in early stages of infection should be independent of CD74 cell-surface levels, and at later time points, higher load of virus leads to the observed differences in CD74 expression. To test these possibilities, uninfected freshly isolated CD14+ monocytes were FACS sorted based on CD74 cell-surface levels and then infected separately with TB40E-GFP. At 8 and 72 hr post infection (hpi) viral DNA and RNA were analyzed by qPCR. We confirmed that indeed the CD74<sup>high</sup> and CD74<sup>low</sup> sorted cells exhibited differences in CD74 transcript levels negating the possibility that the separation is only due to variations associated with the cell surface staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Therefore, a key challenge in gene expression analysis is to connect between snapshots of gene expression profiles and the infection status of the cells, which is defined by this functional outcome. The identification of cellular cell surface markers that inversely-correlate with viral transcript levels provides a handle to connect between gene expression and the ability of the virus to reactivate. To test the association between viral transcript levels and reactivation efficiency, HCMV- infected primary CD14+ monocytes were sorted by CD74 cell-surface levels, and viral reactivation was induced by two complementary methods; cytokine driven differentiation to dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reeves et al., 2005</xref>), followed by incubation with an indicator fibroblasts monolayer, or long term co-culturing with fibroblasts. Quantification of GFP positive plaques showed that reactivation was significantly more frequent in CD74<sup>low</sup> cells compared to CD74<sup>high</sup> cells, in both protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Lysed samples of monocytes plated onto indicator fibroblasts produced no plaques, confirming that these infected cells did not produce any detectable infectious virus, consistent with latency prior to reactivation induction.

We used digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to detect viral genome loads in CD14+ monocytes from seven seropositive donors. Despite using a highly sensitive platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and detection of several positive events, testing 100,000–400,000 cells per donor did not provide us with levels of detection and reproducibility that allowed relative quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Recently, it was suggested that latent HCMV resides in a unique B7H4-positive monocyte subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). To examine whether we can enrich for a cell population in which we can detect robust levels of HCMV genomes, we collected CD14+ monocytes from 5 healthy seropositive individuals.

Significantly, this gene signature of monocyte lineage priming was also inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels in the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To further investigate the cell differentiation state, we analyzed gene sets that were previously associated with M1 or M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerrick et al., 2018</xref>) and found that genes that were more highly expressed in CD74<sup>high</sup> monocytes were significantly enriched for genes previously associated with M2 phenotype (Pval = 2.25×10<sup>−8</sup>).

To test this we examined whether inhibition of interferon signaling affects the expression level of viral transcripts and its ability to reactivate in infected CD14+ monocytes. We used ruxolitinib, a potent and selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2009</xref>) that blocks the signaling downstream of interferon receptors. Treatment with ruxolitinib immediately after infection (3hpi) resulted in a considerable reduction in the levels of interferon-induced genes at 3 and 6dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and in increased expression of essentially all viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), in an overall uniform manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to test how long after infection blocking interferon signaling still affects viral transcript levels, we applied ruxolitinib at different time points along infection and measured viral transcripts by RNA-seq. Interestingly, although the effect was smaller when the inhibitor was added later along infection, blocking interferon signaling still increased viral transcript levels even when added 3dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results therefore indicate there is continuous expression of viral genes and at 3dpi viral genes are still transcribed. However, the reduced effect of ruxolitinib with time also points that in addition there is gradual repression of viral gene expression as was also captured in our scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, blocking interferon signaling led to more efficient reactivation of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This demonstrates that interferon signaling has a major role in repression of viral gene expression in infected monocytes and that the anergic-like state of monocytes exhibiting higher viral transcript levels is likely important for latency maintenance and reactivation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of interferon signaling increases viral gene expression and promotes reactivation.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) HCMV- infected monocytes were treated at 3hpi with interferon signaling inhibitor, ruxolitinib (ruxo), or left untreated, and analyzed for gene expression level, by RNA-seq. (<bold>A</bold>) Expression of interferon-induced genes at 3dpi (left) and 6dpi (right).

To gain insight into the effects of HCMV on HSPC differentiation, we inferred differentiation trajectories using Monocle, a strategy that allows placing single cells along a pseudotime continuum based on their gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The cells expressing HCMV transcripts were clustered in a region that exhibited the latest pseudotime (i.e the most differentiated state, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Remarkably, although we infected bone marrow derived CD34+ HSPCs, viral transcripts were expressed only in cells expressing monocyte lineage markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Velten et al., 2017</xref>), such as IRF7, IRF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and CD14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Taking into account that it was previously shown that HCMV infects multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrum et al., 2004</xref>), these results indicate that HCMV induces differentiation of infected HSPCs towards the monocyte lineage. Interestingly, more detailed analysis of the distinct group of cells that expressed monocyte markers, revealed that this group could be split into two close yet distinct clusters, with viral reads being detected in much more cells in one of the clusters. Interestingly, the cluster showing higher viral transcript levels exhibited lower expression of CD74 (Pval = 1.73×10<sup>−95</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>) as well as gene signatures associated with lower immune response to interferon gamma and lower adaptive immune response (Pval &lt;0.001 and Pval = 0.003, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). Thus, cells within the HSPC population that exhibit the highest viral gene expression belong to the CD14+ monocyte cell lineage and are associated with similar anergic-like signatures as infected monocytes.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Viral transcript levels in HCMV-infected CD34+ HSPCs is associated with priming towards the monocyte lineage and with reduced immune-response.</title><p>Pseudotime trajectory of single cell transcriptomes from HCMV- infected CD34+ HSPCs (n = 7,634, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>) colored by pseudotime (<bold>A</bold>), viral transcript levels (<bold>B</bold>), expression of monocyte priming gene signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Velten et al., 2017</xref>) (<bold>C</bold>) and CD14 expression (<bold>D</bold>).

Nevertheless, in cell culture experimental systems it is apparent that not all cells have the ability to reactivate, indicating that there are variations in the levels or dynamics of latent infection. This heterogeneity means that bulk assays, comparing infected and uninfected cell populations can capture host responses to HCMV infection but likely miss specific responses in the group of cells in which latency is established, and will enable reactivation down the line.</p><p>Recent single cell RNA-seq data portray low-level expression of a broad spectrum of canonical viral lytic genes during HCMV latent infection of various cells of the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galinato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnayder et al., 2018</xref>). Our analysis of latent HCMV- infected CD14+ monocytes revealed a continuous population. Essentially, all of the cells were infected; however, they varied in the levels of viral transcripts. We exploited the host and viral heterogeneity, revealed simultaneously in scRNA-seq data, to look for associations between viral transcript levels and the human transcriptome. We found that among the genes that were highly inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels, is a group of genes encoding MHCII as well as the cell surface marker CD74, which serves as an MHCII chaperone. The finding that there are host genes that show specific correlation with viral transcript levels indicates that there is direct interaction between the host and the virus during latent infection- either there is a preference of the virus to infect specific cell types or that the virus actively affects the host transcriptome. Indeed, these markers could be used to enrich for cells with increased viral genome load and viral transcript levels. Importantly, this was supported by analysis of CD14+ monocytes from viremic patients, which also shows a clear inverse-correlation between CD74 cell-surface levels and viral genome load. These results are in line with previous findings showing that human, murine and rat cytomegalovirus down regulate the surface expression of MHCII molecules in cells of the myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baca Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Slobedman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yunis et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, CIITA, a transcription factor that regulates CD74 and MHCII, was shown to be down regulated by HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The inverse-association between the expression of CD74 and MHCII and viral transcript levels could be related to differences in permissivity for the virus. By cell sorting according to CD74 levels prior to infection, we show that this is likely not the case; instead, these changes seem to be induced by viral infection. Moreover, we see that higher viral transcript levels in CD74<sup>low</sup> cells is also accompanied by higher abundance of viral genomes, indicating that the level of viral transcripts is determined, at least initially, by the amount of incoming genomes, and this contributes to the extent of the effect on the host. Importantly, reactivation from HCMV latency happens in a very small population of cells even in experimental systems where the majority of cells are infected. We show here that CD74<sup>low</sup> monocytes, which carry higher viral transcript and viral genome levels, reactivate more efficiently. This indicates that the ability of monocytes to reactivate is associated with viral transcript expression and that the cells carrying higher viral loads in these models are functionally the latent cell population, as they are more likely to reactivate. Recently, B7H4 was suggested as a marker for monocytes with higher levels of HCMV genomes from HCMV seropositive individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), however, we could not detect expression of B7H4 mRNA in any of our RNA-seq samples. Moreover, by staining for B7H4, we could not identify a distinct B7H4 positive monocyte population and did not detect higher levels of HCMV genomes in the top 2% B7H4 sorted cells. According to available human datasets, B7H4 is indeed not expressed in healthy monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blood Atlas, 2019</xref>), however, these differences may stem from sampling of different donors or due to other variables related to the isolation of the cells.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that the cells that have higher expression of viral genes are less immune-responsive including reduced response to interferons. Since the CD74<sup>high</sup> and CD74<sup>low</sup> monocytes we analyzed grew in the same culture, they were exposed to the same immune-extrinsic signals. Hence, this difference is intrinsic to specific cells, and may be actively induced by the virus. This is supported by a recent report showing that interferon induced genes are downregulated during latent infection of CD14+ monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elder et al., 2019</xref>). This anergic-like state is functionally related to the ability of the virus to express viral transcripts and to reactivate, as inhibiting the response to interferons resulted in increased expression of viral transcripts as well as increased reactivation efficiency. The importance of the role interferon plays in latent infection is further supported by the fact that CMV replication can be inhibited in otherwise permissive cells by treatment with interferon beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dağ et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, extrinsic interferon stimuli inhibited HSV-1 reactivation from latency in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linderman et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, blocking interferon signaling increases viral gene expression even when done up to 3dpi, suggesting that there is continuous viral gene expression. However, the effect was smaller when the inhibitor was added later along infection, indicating a gradual repression of viral gene expression with time. Overall, these findings indicate that a major aspect of the maintenance of latency and of the ability to reactivate at the cellular level is a balance between opposing forces which also affect each other- the intrinsic immune response, specifically the interferon pathway, and viral transcript levels. Future work will have to delineate the mechanisms by which these immune response pathways control general viral transcription and how viral transcripts and viral proteins modulate the immune response during latent infection.</p><p>Previous works have described changes in the differentiation state of monocytes in response to infection or to specific viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avdic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). The use of the CD74 marker, allowed us to focus on differentiation processes unique to the CD14+ monocytes with higher viral transcript levels and higher reactivation efficiencies. We show that higher viral transcript levels are associated with less expression of monocyte priming signature and lower expression of a gene signature associated with M2 phenotype. It was previously shown that the HCMV encoded IL-10 homolog polarizes monocytes towards an M2c macrophage phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avdic et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that the total population is indeed polarized towards this direction; however, this process may be inhibited in cells with higher viral transcript levels. These findings may suggest that the virus promotes attenuation of differentiation processes that monocytes are undergoing in culture and in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Examining the differentiation state in HSPCs following infection is far more complicated than in monocytes, as CD34+ HSPCs are a mix of pluripotent cells as well as progenitor cells in different stages of lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Velten et al., 2017</xref>). By applying single cell trajectory analysis, which allows recovery of gene expression kinetics of differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>), and aligning our data with data of lineage commitment during hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Velten et al., 2017</xref>), we show that cells containing detectable viral transcripts belong largely to one specific population- cells primed towards the monocyte lineage. From our data, we cannot determine whether this is due to preferential infection by HCMV of monocyte lineage committed cells within the HSPC compartment or whether HCMV infects multipotent cells, which are then either preferentially skewed towards the monocytic lineage or viral gene expression is initiated only when cells start to differentiate in the monocytes lineage. However since it was previously demonstrated that multipotent cells are infected with HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrum et al., 2004</xref>), the latter options are more likely. Previous studies demonstrated that HCMV infection leads to an increase in monocyte markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and similar results were shown specifically for the viral gene UL7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crawford et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are in line with these studies and show directly and in an unbiased manner that several days post infection, viral gene expression can be found only in cells in the monocyte lineage. Moreover, within the monocyte lineage primed cells, the cells exhibiting higher viral transcript levels show the same markers and characteristics as we found when infecting CD14+ monocytes, primarily lower expression of CD74 and weaker immune responsiveness. This is especially interesting as it suggests that regardless of the developmental stage in which HCMV infects, the end point, a few days after infection, are cells with very similar characteristics.</p><p>Overall, we use here single cell data to pinpoint the characteristics of the latently infected cells in an unbiased manner. Our analyses indicate that HCMV drives human HSPCs and monocytes into a monocyte state characterized by anergic-like gene signature. These findings shed light on the characteristics of the latent reservoir, which may help in the effort of developing strategies to eradicate the latently infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes a lifelong infection and achieves this through effective modulation of the host's immune response and establishment of a dormant state called latency. Reactivation from latency can cause life threatening disease. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCMV latency is far from complete. This study comprehensively characterizes, by applying single cell RNA-seq analysis, latency in monocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The authors identify monocyte cell surface markers that enable enrichment of latent cells which harbor higher viral transcript levels and can reactivate more efficiently. Importantly, these cells are characterized by reduced intrinsic immune responses, which is important for viral gene expression. For HSPCs latently infected with HCMV, viral transcripts could only be detected in monocyte progenitors, and these were also associated with reduced immune responses. In conclusion, this study shows that HCMV drives hematopoietic cells towards a weaker immune-responsive state, which is crucial for the virus to eventually reactivate and cause disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single cell analysis reveals human cytomegalovirus drives latently infected cells towards an anergic-like monocyte state&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lars Dölken (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall, the reviewers were very impressed with the data and how it was presented.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Single cell analysis reveals human cytomegalovirus drives latently infected cells towards an anergic-like monocyte state&quot;, the authors employ scRNA-seq to analyze determinants that are associated with HCMV latency. They identify surface expression of MHCII and the MHCII chaperon CD74 to be inversely correlated with viral transcript levels. They go on to show that these differences are not due to differences in virus entry but are rather induced upon virus entry. They show that cells exhibiting higher viral transcript levels support more efficient reactivation. The same phenotype was observed in HSPC-derived monocytes indicating that HCMV infection drives an immunologically anergic-like state of monocytic cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3: A useful experiment for Figure 2 or Figure 3 would be to quantify the increase in CD74 surface expression upon infection by FACS (histograms of CD74 signal at 0-14dpi). It would be interesting to see whether the distribution of CD74 surface expression is normally distributed before infection, and particularly whether it becomes bimodal/multimodal upon infection, as predicted from the scRNA-seq data. This would also support the conclusion from Figure 2, especially if the viral load could also be measured and would show lower values in cells with higher CD74 surface expression.</p><p>2) The authors show that viral gene expression in both CD14+ monocytes and HSPC essentially resembles late stage infection regarding the distribution of viral mRNA levels of the individual viral genes. As many viral genes act as immune evasins, it is not surprising that cells that express higher levels of these viral genes show signs of a counter-regulated IFNgamma response, namely a reduction in MHCII and CD74 surface levels. Furthermore, it is not surprising that this also augments virus reactivation. The million-dollar-question, however, is how it is possible that viral gene expression so closely matches the profile which is observed in late lytic infection despite no apparent DNA replication. The data obtained using ruxolitinib to inhibit IFN signaling provide strong evidence that the observed viral gene expression indeed results from de novo transcriptional activity and not from virion-associated RNA (the authors may want to state this in the Discussion). The key open question, however, is at what time after infection this viral gene expression occurs. It could either occur immediately after virus entry and then be more and more efficiently silenced, or it could be rather continuous thereby reflecting &quot;true latent&quot; viral gene expression. To clarify this important question, the authors should infect monocytes with HCMV and apply ruxolitinib at different time of infection and analyze the extent and expression profile of viral genes at 6dpi. This could e.g. comprise the following conditions: (i) ruxolitinib applied immediately with the virus, (ii) at 1dpi, (ii) at 2dpi, (iii) at 3 dpi, (iv) at 4 dpi and (v) at 5 dpi. Furthermore, they should apply ruxolitinib for the first three days and then replace the media with conditioned media from HCMV-infected monocytes. In case viral gene expression only occurs within the first 1-2 days post infection and is then efficiently silenced, treatment with ruxolitinib later on should not make any difference.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52168.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3: A useful experiment for Figure 2 or Figure 3 would be to quantify the increase in CD74 surface expression upon infection by FACS (histograms of CD74 signal at 0-14dpi).

The distribution of CD74 surface expression in infected cells does not significantly differ from what is seen in uninfected cells nor changed along infection. These results thus do not support two or several biologically distinct groups, rather a gradient of expression of CD74 which following infection is most likely affected by the innate immune response to infection (which increase CD74 expression) and by the effects of the virus (which counteracts this increase). Our results indeed show that the viral load (both genomes and transcripts) are lower in cells with higher CD74 surface expression (Figure 2B, D). However, in the MOI we have used (MOI=5) we do not think there are distinct groups of infected or bystander cells but rather a continuous (and probably random) distribution of viral load that inverse-correlates with a continuous distribution of CD74 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that viral gene expression in both CD14+ monocytes and HSPC essentially resembles late stage infection regarding the distribution of viral mRNA levels of the individual viral genes.

The results for applying ruxolitinib at different time points along infection showed that although the effect on viral gene expression are weaker the later the drug is added, there is still a significant increase in viral gene expression even at later time points of ruxolitinib addition (new Figure 7C, subsection “Inhibition of interferon signaling increases viral gene expression and reactivation” and Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>This indeed supports, as the reviewer said, that there is continuous viral gene expression but the reduced effect of ruxolitinib also points that viral gene expression is gradually repressed. The results of applying the drug at the beginning of infection and then removing it 3dpi showed decreased effect on viral transcript levels compared to adding a new dose of ruxolitinib also at 72hpi, further supporting there is continuous expression of viral transcripts. However, since replacing the media also for untreated cells led to decreased viral transcripts levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, these results are more complicated for interpretation and we did not include them in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52168-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
