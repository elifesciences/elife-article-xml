Here, we describe structural rearrangements and crosstalk within the <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ribonucleotide reductase R2b–NrdI complex, a di-metal carboxylate-flavoprotein system, as part of the mechanism generating the essential catalytic free radical of the enzyme. Femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free electron laser was utilized to obtain structures at room temperature in defined redox states without suffering photoreduction. Together with density functional theory calculations, we show that the flavin is under steric strain in the R2b–NrdI protein complex, likely tuning its redox properties to promote superoxide generation. Moreover, a binding site in close vicinity to the expected flavin O<sub>2</sub> interaction site is observed to be controlled by the redox state of the flavin and linked to the channel proposed to funnel the produced superoxide species from NrdI to the di-manganese site in protein R2b. These specific features are coupled to further structural changes around the R2b–NrdI interaction surface. The mechanistic implications for the control of reactive oxygen species and radical generation in protein R2b are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>serial

This reaction is the only known pathway for the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of dNTPs. Three classes of RNRs are differentiated based on their structural features and radical generating mechanism. Class I consists of a radical generating subunit, R2 and a catalytic subunit, R1. Oxygen is required to generate a radical in the R2 subunit, which is reversibly shuttled to R1 to initiate the ribonucleotide reduction. Class I, found in eubacteria and all eukaryotes, is to date divided into five subclasses, Ia–Ie, based on the type of metal cofactor, metal ligands, and radical storage in R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Högbom et al., 2020</xref>). The R2 subunit is characterized by a ferritin-like fold housing two metal ions coordinated by six conserved residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>), that is two histidines and four carboxylates (with the exception of subclass Ie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srinivas et al., 2018</xref>). The class Ib R2 subunit (R2b) metal site can bind two manganese ions or two iron ions. The two metal ions are oxidized from the M(II)/M(II) state to a short-lived M(III)/M(IV) intermediate which decays to M(III)/M(III) while producing a radical species on an adjacent tyrosyl residue (Tyr·), where it is also stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotruvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2010</xref>). The di-manganese R2b was shown to be the physiologically relevant form of R2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2010</xref>), it accumulates higher amounts of radical and has higher enzymatic activity than the di-iron R2b. Molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) can directly activate the di-iron R2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huque et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the di-manganese R2b form cannot react with O<sub>2</sub> but requires a superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>) provided by NrdI, a flavoprotein which is generally encoded in the same operon as R2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berggren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roca et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of the di-manganese centre in ribonucleotide reductase class Ib R2.</title><p>Both hydroquinone (hq) and semiquinone (sq) flavin mononucleotide (FMN) of NrdI can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide, which is shuttled to the metal site in R2b and activates the di-manganese cofactor. FMN is oxidized either to semiquinone or the fully oxidized form (ox) in the process.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79226-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>NrdI is a small, globular protein that binds the redox-active flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. NrdI stands out in comparison to other flavodoxins, which perform single one- or two-electron transfers, by being able to perform two successive one-electron reductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2008</xref>). Fully reduced NrdI with hydroquinone FMN (NrdI<sub>hq</sub>) can reduce O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> while being oxidized to semiquinone NrdI (NrdI<sub>sq</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotruvo et al., 2013</xref>). NrdI<sub>sq</sub> can in turn produce a second O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> from another O<sub>2</sub> molecule and become fully oxidized (NrdI<sub>ox</sub>) in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berggren et al., 2014</xref>). The oxidation state of NrdI can be followed by ultraviolet–visible light absorption (UV–vis) spectroscopy. NrdI is faint yellow in the hydroquinone state, dark blue in the semiquinone state, and bright orange in the oxidized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Røhr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). NrdI binds tightly to R2b in a 1:1 ratio with FMN at the protein–protein interface, forming a dimer of heterodimers. Previously obtained crystal structures of the R2b–NrdI complex from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> show that a conserved channel connects FMN and the metal site in R2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerstad et al., 2014</xref>). This channel is proposed to shuttle O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> produced by NrdI in complex with R2b to the metal site, where the radical is formed. Here, we investigate the structural details and reaction mechanism of the activation of NrdI by O<sub>2</sub> as well as the subsequent shuttling of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> to the metal site for the generation of Tyr⋅ in R2b.</p><p>Studying structural changes in redox-active proteins is challenging from an experimental point of view. X-ray crystallography is a well-suited method for investigating both high-resolution structural details in the redox-active centres and overall reorganization of proteins. However, both metalloenzymes and flavodoxins are very sensitive to photoreduction during the exposure to the high-energy X-ray radiation of synchrotron sources. Synchrotron crystal structures of RNR and NrdI proteins invariably suffer from photoreduction, which complicates the determination of the oxidation state of redox-active centres and has proven to be a problem for obtaining fully oxidized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grave et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Røhr et al., 2010</xref>). While there are well-established experimental workarounds like short exposure times, helical data collection, and serial synchrotron crystallography the time-scales necessary to obtain the diffraction data using these methods cannot fully avoid the reducing effects of the X-ray radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spence, 2017</xref>). Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) overcomes this problem by the so-called diffraction-before-destruction principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doerr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nass, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neutze et al., 2000</xref>). Short intense X-ray pulses of the duration of only a few femtoseconds are produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL), illuminating one crystal and giving rise to one diffraction pattern at a time. The crystal is generally destroyed in the process and needs to be replaced by a new one for the next image. This method allows to record the scattering information before atomic displacement has time to occur resulting in a dataset effectively free from the effects of radiation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spence, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the first SFX structures of R2b in complex with NrdI in the oxidized and hydroquinone state. The datasets reveal redox-dependent structural rearrangements both in the FMN-binding pocket of NrdI and at the protein interface. Despite the significant rearrangement in the direct vicinity of the cofactor, FMN itself changes surprisingly little between redox states. This marks an interesting contrast to structures of free NrdI, which display significant conformational change of FMN between different oxidation states. We conclude that the R2b–NrdI complex formation is restricting FMN movement and inhibits this conformational change with possible implications for its redox properties and O<sub>2</sub> reactivity. Moreover, we performed quantum chemical density functional theory (DFT) calculations to computationally estimate the strain energy and additional effects on the FMN redox properties. We also describe the first R2b–NrdI complex with a di-manganese metal centre from <italic>B. cereus</italic>. The metal coordination in both structures blocks access to the channel that connects FMN and the metal site providing further information on gating and control of catalytic reactive oxygen species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SFX crystal structures of <italic>B. cereus</italic> R2b in complex with oxidized and hydroquinone NrdI collected at ambient temperature</title><p>An initial crystallization condition for the R2b–NrdI complex was optimized to yield a sufficient amount of crystals smaller than 100 µm in the longest axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the maximum acceptable crystal size for the experimental setup. Crystals were initially tested at SACLA (SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser, Japan) under aerobic conditions with a grease extruder setup (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sugahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tono et al., 2013</xref>). The crystals diffracted to 2 Å and proved to be stable under room temperature for several days and sturdy enough to handle the physical stress of being manipulated for the experiment. At LCLS (Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, USA), we obtained two structures of the <italic>B. cereus</italic> R2b–NrdI (<italic>Bc</italic>R2b–NrdI) complex in different defined redox states by SFX. The datasets were collected at room temperature under anaerobic conditions using the drop-on-demand sample delivery method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuller et al., 2017</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p><italic>Bc</italic>R2b protein was produced metal free to allow full control over metal loading during complex reconstitution. The metal content of the protein was determined by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) and only trace amounts of metals could be detected. The iron and manganese content per R2b monomer corresponded to metal-to-protein molar ratios of 0.27% ± 0.04% and 0.07% ± 0.04%, respectively. The <italic>Bc</italic>R2b–NrdI complex was reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> by mixing both proteins in a molar ratio of 1:1 and set up for batch crystallization. Manganese was present both during the complex reconstitution and in the crystallization condition. Crystals for two different datasets were prepared to investigate different oxidation states of NrdI. The crystals for the first dataset were grown under aerobic conditions, yielding bright orange crystals, indicating that NrdI was fully oxidized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The structure from these crystals is later referred to as <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub> (PDB ID: 7Z3D). The second dataset was obtained by reducing <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub> crystals chemically with sodium dithionite in an anaerobic environment. Consequently, the crystal colour changed from bright orange to faint yellow, indicating that NrdI underwent a two-electron reduction to the hydroquinone state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The crystals were subsequently kept under anaerobic conditions, preventing reoxidation of NrdI. The corresponding structure is denoted <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>hq</sub> (PDB ID: 7Z3E).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overall structure</title><p>The two structures were solved in space group <italic>C</italic>222<sub>1</sub> and are of very similar quality with a resolution of 2.0 Å and similar unit cell dimensions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The physiological dimer can be generated by applying crystal symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Clear electron density maps allowed us to model residues 1–299 of 322 for R2b and 1–116 of 118 for NrdI in <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub> and 1–298 of R2b and all 118 residues of NrdI in <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>hq</sub>. Overall <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub> and <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>hq</sub> are similar, as indicated by the Cα root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.16 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Hammerstad et al. previously reported two crystal structures of the <italic>Bc</italic>R2b–NrdI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerstad et al., 2014</xref>), obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at a synchrotron source and under cryogenic conditions.

Structural alignment between the published synchrotron and our XFEL structures shows that the overall fold of the complex is similar with Cα-RMSD values between 0.42 and 0.47 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared to the <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>FeFe</sub>–NrdI structures we observe a 7–8 residue extended ordered C-terminus for R2b in our structures. The C-terminus in <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub> continues in the same orientation as the C-terminal helix without keeping a helical conformation. It interacts with a groove between R2b and NrdI extending the R2b–NrdI-binding area by forming hydrogen bonds to two other helices of R2b and a loop in NrdI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure of the <italic>Bc</italic>R2b-NrdI complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub> complex (PDB ID: 7Z3D).

In <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>ox</sub>, the isoalloxazine moiety of FMN<sub>ox</sub> is almost planar, with a butterfly bend of 0.2°. This value is comparable to the angle of −3.1° for FMN<sub>ox</sub> in NrdI calculated by QM/MM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Røhr et al., 2010</xref>).

The Fo(ox)–Fo(hq) map shows a slight movement of the oxygen on C4 of FMN indicating a small twist of the pyrimidine ring between both structures but no further bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This angle of <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI<sub>hq</sub> does not correspond to either the calculated bend of FMN of 14.1° nor the experimental bending angle of <italic>Bc</italic>NrdI<sub>sq+e</sub> of 11°. In the R2b–NrdI complex, the solvent exposed part of FMN is covered by R2b, which closes the binding pocket with residues Met16, Phe17, Gln20, Ile197, and Val200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In particular, nonpolar contacts formed between the outermost methyl groups of FMN and the side chains of Phe17 and Gln20 are sterically hindering the isoalloxazine moiety from bending. Both side chains are in turn held in place through a network of interactions involving a second shell of residues from R2b and NrdI that prevent Phe17 and Gln20 from changing conformation should FMN bend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to quantify the strain effects induced by R2b on FMN, we performed quantum chemical DFT calculations based on the R2b–NrdI complex structures or structures of NrdI alone (PDB IDs: 2X2O, 2X2P), including all first and second sphere interactions between FMN and the surrounding protein and water molecules, with around 170–250 atoms modelled quantum mechanically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The DFT calculations suggest that the isoalloxazine ring of FMN is bent in NrdI, with bending angles of −2° to 11° depending on the redox state, which compares well with the angles calculated at the QM/MM level by Røhr et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In contrast, we find that the binding of R2b to NrdI results in a more planar isoalloxazine ring for all oxidation states, with a bending angle of only –3° to +4°, which agrees with the angles obtained experimentally by SFX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) although not fully reproducing the planarity observed in the SFX crystal structures. This geometric distortion introduces molecular strain on FMN with strain energies of around 70–150 meV higher in the R2b–NrdI complex relative to NrdI alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We find that these effects tune the redox potential of FMN by 118 mV and 54 mV in the R2b–NrdI complex relative to NrdI alone for the oxidized/semiquinone (FMN<sub>sq</sub>/FMN<sub>ox</sub>) and semiquinone/hydroquinone (FMN<sub>hq</sub>/FMN<sub>sq</sub>) redox couples, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

The biggest change can be seen for Cα of Gly44 and a smaller shift for Cα of Thr43 and Phe45. The reorganization of the 40 s loop of NrdI after reduction is also apparent in the superposition of both structures and in the Fo(ox)–Fo(hq) map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Notably, Gly44 of NrdI is flipped by 180° and forms a hydrogen bond with the hydrogen of N5 on FMN. The hydrogen bond between O4 of FMN and Gly46 shifts slightly. Thr43 in turn is shifted towards FMN and its side chain is rotated by 180°; Phe45 is also slightly rotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The molecule is 3-coordinated to Trp74 (NrdI), Ser196 (R2b), and a water (p-ox in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). A similar density was previously observed in the di-iron <italic>Bc</italic>R2b–NrdI synchrotron structures where it was modelled as a chloride ion. In our structure, placing a water in this position does not sufficiently explain the density while modelling it as a chloride ion leaves no residual density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Chloride is abundant in the crystallization condition; however, serine and tryptophan are not typical chloride ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carugo, 2014</xref>). The exact nature of the molecule could not be determined and was thus designated as an unknown atom in the final model. Interestingly, the binding position undergoes a redox-dependent switch: In the reduced structure the density is instead found at a position between the oxygen on C2 of FMN<sub>hq</sub> and Asn71 of NrdI, 7 Å from the reactive C4a. Two adjacent water molecules make the unknown molecule 4-coordinated (p-hq in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>).

The unidentified molecule exchanges position with two different water molecules of the well-ordered solvent network connecting FMN with the active site in R2b. The solvent network is housed by a channel between both proteins lined by the side chains of Ser162, Tyr166, Lys263, and Asn267 and the mainchain of Glu195 and Ser196 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerstad et al., 2014</xref>).

Two main conformations have been observed for this ligand: In the ‘closed’ conformation the glutamate interacts only with Mn2 and is proposed to prevent O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> from reaching the metal site by obstructing the channel. In the ‘open’ conformation, on the other hand, Glu161 bridges both manganese ions leaving space for three water molecules to connect Mn2 to the water network in the channel between FMN and the metal site. The open conformation of the equivalent glutamate has been observed in structures of di-manganese R2b alone, for example from <italic>B. cereus</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic> (PDB ID: 4BMU, 3N37, 4N83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) but also in the R2b–NrdI complex of <italic>E. coli</italic> (PDB ID: 3N3A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerstad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhlynets et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, NrdI binding to R2b is not responsible for triggering the open conformation of Glu161 (Glu158 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and Glu157 in <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>). It has been hypothesized that the presence of manganese ions in the active site could cause the glutamate to shift to the open conformation as the closed conformation is typically observed in R2b structures containing a di-iron site, for example in the <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>FeFe</sub>–NrdI complex (PDB ID: 4BMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerstad et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, since the di-iron form of R2b is oxidized by O<sub>2</sub> via a NrdI-independent pathway, the movement of the glutamate is not required for radical generation. However, our SFX <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>–NrdI structures harbour a di-manganese site and exhibit a Glu161 in the closed conformation, thereby demonstrating that manganese in the active site is not sufficient to induce the glutamate shift. Finally, our radiation damage free structures also show that the opening of the channel towards the metal site is independent from the FMN oxidation state, as Glu161 is in the closed conformation when di-manganese R2b is in complex with either NrdI<sub>ox</sub> or NrdI<sub>hq</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Altogether, our data show that the glutamate shift of Glu161 is not caused by the presence of manganese ions, R2b–NrdI complex formation, a specific NrdI redox state or a combination of these factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we present two structures of the manganese containing R2b–NrdI complex of <italic>B. cereus</italic> with NrdI in two different oxidation states. These structures were obtained by room temperature SFX data collection using XFEL radiation in contrast to all previously studied R2b or NrdI structures, which were obtained by classical single-crystal synchrotron data collection at cryogenic temperatures. Determination of the oxidation state of redox-active enzymes via synchrotron radiation is problematic because exposure to X-rays exerts photoreduction on redox centres. Investigation of artefact-free oxidized enzymes is therefore exceedingly challenging with synchrotron radiation. In the context of class Ib RNRs this affects both the redox-active metal centre of R2b and FMN cofactor of NrdI. SFX eliminates the effects of photoreduction observed during synchrotron-based data collection. We describe SFX structures of the R2b–NrdI complex with NrdI in the oxidized and hydroquinone oxidation state. Both 2.0 Å structures are of similar quality as the previously published synchrotron structures of the same complex with a di-iron centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerstad et al., 2014</xref>) showing that the change of methodology does not affect the quality. This allowed detailed examination of structural reorganization induced by changes in FMN redox state. Notably, the FMN conformation per se changes little between the oxidized and hydroquinone oxidation state in R2b–NrdI. This is surprising since it was previously shown that FMN is bent in reduced NrdI when not bound to R2b. The complexation of R2b and NrdI thus prevents FMN bending and exerts strain on the isoalloxazine ring in the hydroquinone state, which was also reproduced in DFT calculations. Interestingly, the calculations revealed that the oxidized FMN is also under strain in the R2b–NrdI complex in comparison to NrdI alone. It could also be confirmed by the calculations that R2b causes a shift in redox potential for both redox couples (FMN<sub>sq</sub>/FMN<sub>ox</sub> and FMN<sub>hq</sub>/FMN<sub>sq</sub>). Other flavoproteins have been shown to tune the redox potential of FMN by forcing it into a specific binding angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Senda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walsh and Miller, 2003</xref>). A recent study by Sorigué et al. presented an SFX structure of the flavoenzyme fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) in complex with an oxidized flavin cofactor exhibiting a butterfly bending angle of 14° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorigué et al., 2021</xref>). Using time resolved SFX and complementary approaches, the study showed that during the enzymatic cycle of FAP the conformation of the flavin retains the butterfly bend in the different redox states. The authors conclude that the butterfly bend is enforced by the protein scaffold to promote flavin reduction. Following the same line of reasoning we propose that R2b binding to NrdI restricts FMN bending and thus, opposite to FAP, changes the FMN redox potential of the hydroquinone to favour FMN oxidation and reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide. This notion is supported by a study by Cotruvo et al. demonstrating that superoxide production by the <italic>in vitro</italic> R2b–NrdI<sub>hq</sub> complex of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is about 40 times faster than the production of superoxide by free NrdI<sub>hq</sub> under the same experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotruvo et al., 2013</xref>). Our calculations support that the effect of strain on the flavin can contribute to downshift the FMN redox potential, which would thermodynamically favour electron transfer. Interestingly, however, the electrostatic effects in the R2b–NrdI complex are predicted to counteract this effect. From a kinetic perspective, on the other hand, the strain imposed in the FMN<sub>hq</sub> state by the R2b–NrdI complex could lower the reorganization energy of electron transfer and thus kinetically favour superoxide generation. The full effects of R2b–NrdI complex formation on the FMN redox properties and their physico-chemical background are complex and warrant further investigation.</p><p>Controlling the superoxide production by complex formation could serve as a mechanism to protect the cell from production of superoxide by free NrdI. The binding of R2b may also facilitate access of O<sub>2</sub> to FMN by forming a hydrophobic binding pocket around the benzene ring of FMN. O<sub>2</sub> is reduced to superoxide at the C4a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN and we observe a molecule bigger than a water bound about 5 Å away from the C4a atom in the oxidized R2b–NrdI complex. From the experimental setup it seems unlikely that the unidentified molecule is a superoxide ion because FMN never underwent a redox cycle in this structure. With a concentration of 100 mM in the crystallization condition chloride is a more likely candidate for the molecule, as also suggested by model refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, refinement with a superoxide ion leaves little residual density, so the binding could fit a molecule of its size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given the similar negative charge and the comparable electron density for the superoxide and chloride anions, the observed density could thus represent a potential binding position of superoxide after its generation. In addition, the density undergoes a redox-dependent switch of position moving further away from the reactive C4a (7 Å) towards the channel entrance in the reduced R2b–NrdI complex. This move is accompanied by a change of the putative coordination sphere. Importantly, in both oxidized and reduced states, the unknown molecule is integrated into the conserved hydrogen-bonding network connecting FMN and the metal site and switches position with a water. Even though the exact nature of the observed electron density is unknown we conclude that the binding properties of these key positions are controlled by the FMN redox state and could mark the route superoxide would travel after being produced by the FMN.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that the production of superoxide by NrdI and the radical generation in R2b is elegantly orchestrated by the formation of the R2b–NrdI complex as well as redox state control of binding positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). R2b–NrdI binding induces conformational strain in the flavin as well as other effects influencing its redox properties to promote superoxide generation. The interaction surface also provides binding positions that are controlled by the redox state of the flavin, presumably involved in gating of channel and metal site access.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for the assembly of the R2b–NrdI complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Free NrdI<sub>hq</sub> and molecular oxygen react slowly to produce superoxide and NrdI<sub>sq</sub>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Redox-controlled structural reorganization and flavin strain within the ribonucleotide reductase R2b-NrdI complex monitored by serial femtosecond crystallography&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Dark sq-bound crystals were shown in Figure S1, but no preparation methods and results were mentioned regarding these crystals. Was the sq radical stable in the crystalline form? And did these crystals yield valuable information? The sq-bound structure could bridge the transition from the fully reduced to the oxidized states.</p><p>2) The manuscript mentioned multiple FMN conformations of various oxidation and complexation states, while Figure 2A missed one critical conformation, the theoretical calculation of FMNsq (-3.9{degree sign} bending angle). It is suggested to include this conformation or replacing the sq- (physiologically irrelevant form) in Figure 2A.</p><p>3) When comparing the flavin conformation with other published data and describing the structural reorganization at the interface, two highly related references reporting the complex structures from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. cereus</italic> (Boal et al., 2010; Hammerstad et al., 2014) were not included in the comparison and discussion.</p><p>4) In this study, the oxidized crystals were reduced by dithionite to yield the hydroquinone-bound structure. The fixed crystal lattice may restrict the structural movement upon the chemical reduction. Have the authors tried to first generate the reduced form in the solution state and then crystallize the complex?</p><p>5) If the redox state of FMN indeed controls the structural reorganization, synchrotron structures of the crystals prepared with oxidized flavin obtained should correspond to a reduced state, consistent with the R2b-NrdIhq structure. Showing such a structure would be a necessary control experiment to support the redox-controlled reorganization as claimed and exclude the possibility that the observed structural movement is due to the condition variation introduced by adding 1 M dithionite to the oxidized crystals.</p><p>6) The authors suggested that the unbending conformation reduces the redox potential of hydroquinone, but no direct evidence supports this statement. If it is known knowledge, please supply citations. Otherwise, a computational study predicting the redox potentials of FMN of different bending angles would be helpful.</p><p>7) The manuscript could be strengthened by the inclusion of experiments to measure the redox potential of the flavin before and after R2b-Nrd1 binding to provide experimental evidence towards the claim that this binding event lowers the redox potential (or, alternatively, the authors could dial back their interpretation here (p. 24)). Since the different redox states all have distinct optical properties, it seems like this could be monitored relatively straightforwardly spectroscopically.</p><p>8) The authors did not take a firm position on the nature of the strong electron density feature near to FMN that appears to occupy a different position in the oxidized versus reduced structures. Whatever this is, it is positioned appropriately to play a key role in the mechanism of this system. It is very much appreciated that the authors took the time to model these electron density features with candidate atoms (i.e. water, chloride ion, superoxide radical) and presented this in the Supplementary Information and that they wrote that they could not be sure of the nature of this unknown entity. However, with their acquired level of molecular detail and knowledge of the mechanism of this enzyme complex, it is suggested that the authors take a stronger position on the nature of this entity. They could present this as a model of the potential role of this entity in the mechanism. Could this not represent a superoxide ion that was formed before reduction by sodium dithionite?</p><p>9) An important aspect of the work is observation of conformational changes (or lack thereof) in residues from both the R2b and Nrdl subunits as a result of the different redox states of FMN. On this front, a request is for the authors to do a deeper analysis into the residues of R2b subunit that hold the FMN ring in place, preventing it from bending (i.e. Met16, Phe17, Ile197, Val200, Gln20). What prevents these residues from changing conformation should FMN bend? Are these residues themselves held in place through a network of interactions? i.e. is there a second shell of important interactions involving these residues? On the Nrdl side, it is recommended that they present 2Fo-Fc electron density maps of its residues that change conformation between the redox states of FMN; this would give more confidence in accepting their statements about rotations and conformational changes. i.e. residues 43 to 46.</p><p>10) It is noticed that in PDB files 7Z3D and 7Z3E corresponding to the oxidized state, an unknown density was modeled with water molecules (HOH556 or HOH323, respectively)). This is clearly wrong, as there is significant positive Fo-Fc density for these in both structures (7.09 and 5.47 rmsd in Coot, respectively) here. Depending on what the authors decide to do regarding modeling this or not, if they decide to leave it as &quot;unknown&quot;, the proper way to model this in the structure is with an &quot;UNX&quot; atom. https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/UNX</p><p>11) An important aspect of the mechanism of this complex is the tunnel through which the superoxide would be transferred from FMN to the di-divalent cation center of R2b. A surface representation of the tunnel would be a nice way to show it, but it was only shown in cartoon and stick representation in Supp. 3, or the schematic Schemes 1 and 3. It would be nice to see a second panel added to Supp. 3 to show a surface representation of tunnel (It is recommended to use the Cavities and Pockets function in Pymol).</p><p>12) The high resolution cutoff of the x-ray diffraction data collection was too generous. For both structures at 2.0 A resolution as the high resolution, mean I/σ(I) values were below 1 and the CC1/2 values were below 0.5, which are the typical cutoffs for a highest resolution shell in the literature. Similarly, the Rsplit values were quite high at these highest resolution shell. It is suggested that the authors justify their choice of 2.0 A or adjust to meet the typically accepted cutoffs.</p><p>13) The authors claim that both manganese ions are in the II state and refer the reader to Materials and methods and Discussion for details, but then do not indicate if their reduction protocol would reduce Mn(III) to Mn(II) or elaborate in the Discussion section. The authors are encouraged to address this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79226.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Dark sq-bound crystals were shown in Figure S1, but no preparation methods and results were mentioned regarding these crystals.

Crystals shown in this figure (now Figure 2 – Figure suppl. 1) were obtained during optimization of the reduction protocol. Due to the instability of the sq state, it has not been possible to obtain a sufficiently homogeneous sample where we can accurately assess the exact oxidation state of the FMN. We have added an explanation for the production of the dark sq crystals in the legend of Figure 2 – Figure suppl. 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript mentioned multiple FMN conformations of various oxidation and complexation states, while Figure 2A missed one critical conformation, the theoretical calculation of FMNsq (-3.9{degree sign} bending angle). It is suggested to include this conformation or replacing the sq- (physiologically irrelevant form) in Figure 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have modified this figure (now Figure 4) accordingly and added the missing angle of FMNsq. We have also performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations and modified the figure in order to include our new data. Moreover, we have remeasured the angles of FMN in our SFX structures using, for consistency, the same software as for measurement of angles in the DFT calculations (i.e., Chimera). Accordingly, the manuscript has been updated with the new values, which are 0.2° and 0.1° for <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>-NrdI<sub>ox</sub> and <italic>Bc</italic>R2b<sub>MnMn</sub>-NrdI<sub>hq</sub>, respectively (instead of -1° and 1.5° previously).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When comparing the flavin conformation with other published data and describing the structural reorganization at the interface, two highly related references reporting the complex structures from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. cereus</italic> (Boal et al., 2010; Hammerstad et al., 2014) were not included in the comparison and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include the complex structures from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. cereus</italic> in the comparison and discussion on the FMN site as we believe these structures are not suitable for direct comparison. Firstly, these structures were obtained at synchrotron sources and therefore the extent of photoreduction and the oxidation state of FMN are unknown. This aspect is not discussed in the corresponding publications. In the publications reporting structures of NrdI from <italic>B. cereus</italic> (Røhr et al., 2010) and <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, (Johansson et al., 2010) on the other hand, this aspect is discussed and both are included for comparison in our manuscript. Secondly, the FMN cofactor present in the complex structures is always refined in the oxidized electronic state (PDB ligand ID: FMN) even when referred to as reduced. It would appear that the reduced form of the ligand would be a more suitable model to use during refinement (PDB ligand ID: FNR). As no mention of a refinement protocol specific for reduced FMN could be found in the corresponding publications the rationale for performing the refinements in this way is unclear and it appears likely that the geometric restraints used for refinement of the FMN cofactor are inappropriate, making comparisons problematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In this study, the oxidized crystals were reduced by dithionite to yield the hydroquinone-bound structure. The fixed crystal lattice may restrict the structural movement upon the chemical reduction. Have the authors tried to first generate the reduced form in the solution state and then crystallize the complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried the approach suggested by the reviewers. Unfortunately, we were not able to produce crystals of the complex in the reduced form as the dithionite concentration was either too low to prevent NrdI reoxidation or too high to not be detrimental to crystallization. However, there are no crystal contacts in the direct vicinity of the FMN binding site and thus we think it is unlikely that they could restrict any conformational changes of the cofactor and its immediate environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) If the redox state of FMN indeed controls the structural reorganization, synchrotron structures of the crystals prepared with oxidized flavin obtained should correspond to a reduced state, consistent with the R2b-NrdIhq structure. Showing such a structure would be a necessary control experiment to support the redox-controlled reorganization as claimed and exclude the possibility that the observed structural movement is due to the condition variation introduced by adding 1 M dithionite to the oxidized crystals.</p></disp-quote><p>Exposing a crystal to a synchrotron beam indeed reduces the structure but the extent of the reduction is not known, since this is dependent on several factors (beam intensity, crystal properties, solvent content, ligand properties). Also, the structural changes accompanying redox changes at cryogenic temperatures may or may not represent what happens at room temperature. For this reason, we do not agree that the proposed experiment would be an appropriate control. While we understand the concern that the presence of dithionite might influence the results, the used concentration for reduction is 20 mM and it is also washed from the crystals before data collection (by washing the crystals 3 times with dithionite-free buffer). For these reasons we find the current setup to be a more appropriate control. We realized that the description of the protocol was not clear regarding the dithionite concentration – the crystals were at no point subjected to 1 M dithionite, this refers to the stock solution. We have modified the section “Reduction protocol” in the Materials and methods to clarify the protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors suggested that the unbending conformation reduces the redox potential of hydroquinone, but no direct evidence supports this statement. If it is known knowledge, please supply citations. Otherwise, a computational study predicting the redox potentials of FMN of different bending angles would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The principles behind redox tuning by conformational strain are well established. For a discussion specifically regarding flavins, see e.g. Walsh and Miller (2003) where they show that the flavin bending conformation enforced by the protein influences the stability of the cofactor, and that planarizing the hydroquinone flavin lowers its ionization potential (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0166-1280(02)00719-4). This reference is cited in our manuscript. Moreover, we have now performed density functional theory calculations confirming that the FMN is under strain in the R2b-NrdI complex and that redox potentials are shifted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The manuscript could be strengthened by the inclusion of experiments to measure the redox potential of the flavin before and after R2b-Nrd1 binding to provide experimental evidence towards the claim that this binding event lowers the redox potential (or, alternatively, the authors could dial back their interpretation here (p. 24)). Since the different redox states all have distinct optical properties, it seems like this could be monitored relatively straightforwardly spectroscopically.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional results would strengthen our conclusions. We have therefore performed density functional theory calculations to estimate the change in strain energy and additional effects on the FMN redox properties upon R2b binding. Accordingly, we have included the following in the manuscript: a new paragraph in the Results, a couple of sentences in the Discussion, a new section in the Materials and methods, an update of a main figure (now Figure 4), a new supplementary figure (Figure 4 – Figure suppl. 2), and new supplementary tables (Supplementary Files 2 and 3). Finally, we have removed “E<sub>FMN</sub>” from the last scheme (now Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors did not take a firm position on the nature of the strong electron density feature near to FMN that appears to occupy a different position in the oxidized versus reduced structures.

They could present this as a model of the potential role of this entity in the mechanism. Could this not represent a superoxide ion that was formed before reduction by sodium dithionite?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and agree that we have been rather careful in the interpretation. Given the experimental conditions we do not think superoxide could be present in the current structure while chloride is present at 100 mM in the crystallization condition. Thus, chloride seems the most likely candidate. Still, given the similar charge and size of the molecule the binding site may well be relevant for superoxide binding and gating, as the referee points out. We have updated the Discussion to more clearly emphasize this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) An important aspect of the work is observation of conformational changes (or lack thereof) in residues from both the R2b and Nrdl subunits as a result of the different redox states of FMN.

The main interactions are between the outermost methyl groups of FMN and R2b residues Phe17 and Gln20, which are also restricted in their movement by surrounding residues. We have added a more detailed analysis regarding this issue by modifying the corresponding section in the Results and by including a list of interactions in a supplementary table (Supplementary File 1). Furthermore, we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 4 – Figure suppl. 3) showing the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps for NrdI residues 43 to 46.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is noticed that in PDB files 7Z3D and 7Z3E corresponding to the oxidized state, an unknown density was modeled with water molecules (HOH556 or HOH323, respectively)).

Accordingly, we have mentioned this point in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) An important aspect of the mechanism of this complex is the tunnel through which the superoxide would be transferred from FMN to the di-divalent cation center of R2b. A surface representation of the tunnel would be a nice way to show it, but it was only shown in cartoon and stick representation in Supp. 3, or the schematic Schemes 1 and 3. It would be nice to see a second panel added to Supp. 3 to show a surface representation of tunnel (It is recommended to use the Cavities and Pockets function in Pymol).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a surface representation is a nicer way to visualize the tunnel. As suggested, we have added a second panel to the supplementary figure (Figure 5 – Figure suppl. 2B) with the surface representation of the tunnel and we have updated the corresponding section of the Materials and methods to describe how the figure was prepared using the Cavities and Pockets function in PyMOL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The high resolution cutoff of the x-ray diffraction data collection was too generous. For both structures at 2.0 A resolution as the high resolution, mean I/σ(I) values were below 1 and the CC1/2 values were below 0.5, which are the typical cutoffs for a highest resolution shell in the literature. Similarly, the Rsplit values were quite high at these highest resolution shell. It is suggested that the authors justify their choice of 2.0 A or adjust to meet the typically accepted cutoffs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. For the two R2b-NrdI datasets presented in this paper, the CC<sub>1/2</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>split</sub> and mean I/σ(I) values are ~0.3, ~0.8 and ~0.7, respectively. While it is true that the mean I/σ(I) value is lower than 1.0 in our case, we argue that the I/σ(I) value relies largely on the error models chosen, as discussed in Brewster et al., (2019)<sup>1</sup> and Karplus and Diedrichs (2015)<sup>2</sup>, and therefore should not be used to determine resolution cutoffs. The <italic>R</italic><sub>split</sub> value in general is an unweighted sum which will undermine final data quality if data of varying quality are merged into a dataset, as stated in Karplus and Diedrichs (2015)<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, <italic>R</italic><sub>split</sub> values depend dominantly on signal bandwidth<sup>3</sup>, and for these reasons we do not consider <italic>R</italic><sub>split</sub> to be a reliable parameter to decide resolution cutoff either.</p><p>Typically, we use two different criteria to decide the final resolution cutoff for a particular dataset:</p><p>a) The multiplicity cutoff where we cut the data where it falls off the 10-fold multiplicity value.</p><p>b) CC<sub>1/2</sub> values where the value of these parameters do not monotonically decrease as a function of resolution anymore.</p><p>The datasets at 2.0 Å fulfill both the standards we typically use for our XFEL datasets (see e.g., Kern 2018, Ibrahim 2020, Srinivas 2020, Rabe 2021)<sup>4-7</sup>, and therefore we think it is justified that we use the same criteria for these R2b-NrdI datasets. We have added a sentence to the Materials and methods to justify our choice for resolution cutoff.</p><p>1. Brewster <italic>et al.</italic> (2019) https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798319012877</p><p>2.

R2b was purified in the metal-depleted form and reconstituted with Mn(II)Cl<sub>2</sub> before crystallization with oxidised NrdI. The metal site is thus not subjected to oxidation by reduced NrdI in presence of O<sub>2</sub>. As has also been shown previously, the Mn(II)/Mn(II) metal site does not react directly with molecular oxygen. Moreover, the coordination of the metal ions in the crystal structures is fully consistent with the reduced (Mn(II)/Mn(II)) metal site when compared with previously published structures of class Ib R2. We have clarified the corresponding sections (i.e., “Crystallization” and “Reduction protocol&quot;) in the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
