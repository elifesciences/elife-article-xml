Deficiency in its homolog ARID1B is synthetically lethal with ARID1A mutation. However, the functional relationship between these homologs has not been explored. Here, we use ATAC-seq, genome-wide histone modification mapping, and expression analysis to examine colorectal cancer cells lacking one or both ARID proteins. We find that ARID1A has a dominant role in maintaining chromatin accessibility at enhancers, while the contribution of ARID1B is evident only in the context of ARID1A mutation. Changes in accessibility are predictive of changes in expression and correlate with loss of H3K4me and H3K27ac marks, nucleosome spacing, and transcription factor binding, particularly at growth pathway genes including <italic>MET</italic>. We find that ARID1B knockdown in ARID1A mutant ovarian cancer cells causes similar loss of enhancer architecture, suggesting that this is a conserved function underlying the synthetic lethality between ARID1A and ARID1B.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>SWI/SNF complex</kwd><kwd>ARID1A</kwd><kwd>ARID1B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 CA184043-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hargreaves</surname><given-names>Diana C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001368</institution-id><institution>V Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>V2016-006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hargreaves</surname><given-names>Diana C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001127</institution-id><institution>Genentech Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#G-37246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelso</surname><given-names>Timothy W R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ARID1A, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and its homolog ARID1B function to maintain chromatin accessibility and active histone modifications at enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in ARID1A have recently been identified in diverse cancer types, including ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadoch et al., 2013</xref>). The ARID1A protein is the largest subunit of the multi-protein SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, with two mammalian homologs, ARID1B and ARID2, also found in this complex; ARID1A and ARID1B associate with the BAF complex, and ARID2 with the PBAF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, compared to ARID1A, mutations in ARID1B and ARID2 are rare in cancer, apart from in neuroblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sausen et al., 2013</xref>). ARID1A and ARID1B are often co-expressed and are mutually exclusive in the SWI/SNF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), with each containing an ARID domain considered to facilitate non-specific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilsker et al., 2004</xref>). ARID1B is synthetic lethal with ARID1A mutation in cancer cell lines and fibroblasts, consistent with the presence of intact ARID1B-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). The reason for the selectivity for ARID1A mutations in cancer is not understood, and the functional basis for the synthetic lethal relationship between ARID1A and ARID1B has not yet been determined.</p><p>SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes disrupt DNA-histone contacts to rearrange the nucleosome landscape, utilizing energy from ATP hydrolysis to remodel nucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Côté et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imbalzano et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Owen-Hughes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pazin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whitehouse et al., 1999</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bossen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">John et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takaku et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinmann et al., 1999</xref>). Bound extensively across the genome at promoters and enhancers, these complexes can both activate and repress gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2009</xref>), and ARID proteins can have cooperative and antagonistic roles in expression, with frequent instances of co-binding at promoters and enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raab et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A recent study by Mathur and colleagues characterized SWI/SNF genomic occupancy in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells with wild-type ARID1A or homozygous truncating ARID1A mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). Despite widespread binding of SWI/SNF to promoters and enhancers, removal of ARID1A caused specific loss of the complex at enhancers of developmental genes, with the H3K27ac mark of active enhancers diminished at these sites. Similarly, in demonstrating that loss of ARID1A can initiate neoplastic transformation in non-tumorigenic cells, Lakshminarasimhan and colleagues identified a small number of changes in gene expression, which correlated with alterations in histone modifications but no significant change in accessibility at transcription start sites (TSSs) or CTCF insulator sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lakshminarasimhan et al., 2017</xref>). To date, the in vivo role of ARID proteins in chromatin remodeling at a genome-wide level has not been directly explored.</p><p>To study this question, we made use of isogenic wild-type and ARID1A homozygous mutant HCT116 lines. We further subjected these lines to ARID1B knockdown to study the role of ARID1B in the ARID1A wild-type and mutant context. We performed the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to assess genome-wide changes in DNA accessibility, which provides a direct measure of chromatin remodeling activity by SWI/SNF complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). We find that loss of ARID1A in wild-type HCT116 cells results in dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility, while ARID1B knockdown has no effect. In contrast, ARID1B knockdown in ARID1A mutant cells results in further up or down-regulation of accessibility at ARID1A-dependent and unique sites. Regions sensitive to ARID1A or ARID1B loss are predominantly found at enhancers and distal regulatory sites, where ARID1A and ARID1B are required for the maintenance of active enhancer histone marks. Additionally, ARID1A and ARID1B are critical for the binding of AP-1 family members at enhancers, consistent with diminished nucleosome spacing around AP-1 motifs upon loss of ARID1A and ARID1B. These alterations are highly correlated with changes in gene expression upon loss of one or both ARID proteins and we observe significant changes in the expression of genes encoding signaling intermediates in cell growth and adhesion, including <italic>MET</italic>. Applying similar techniques in a naturally occurring ARID1A-mutant ovarian cancer cell line, we find that knockdown of ARID1B results in loss of accessibility and active histone marks around AP-1 motifs at enhancers, suggesting a common mechanistic function for ARID proteins across cancer types. Our results demonstrate a role for ARID1A and ARID1B in maintaining chromatin accessibility and define nucleosome remodeling as a critical function underlying the tumor suppressor role of ARID1A and the synthetic lethal relationship of ARID1A and ARID1B.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ARID1A and ARID1B have unique functional roles in the maintenance of chromatin accessibility</title><p>We employed isogenic HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells that are wild-type for ARID1A (WT) or engineered for homozygous ARID1A protein loss (ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup>) by introduction of an early stop codon (Q456*) by gene trap (Horizon Discovery). We further infected these lines with vectors for shRNA knockdown of ARID1B (ARID1B KD) or a scrambled control (WT or ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup>). We performed two independent lentiviral infections as biological replicates to control for viral integration. As expected, ARID1A protein was abundantly expressed in WT HCT116 cells and completely absent in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Knockdown of ARID1B resulted in a 70–90% reduction in normal protein levels in both WT and ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells compared to a scrambled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We analyzed chromatin accessibility in these cells using ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of ARID1A in WT HCT116 cells dramatically altered overall chromatin accessibility, resulting in thousands of increased and decreased sites, while ARID1B KD surprisingly had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, ARID1B KD in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells resulted in hundreds of changed sites, primarily at regions where accessibility was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results are consistent with the synthetic lethal relationship observed for ARID1A and ARID1B in cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, ARID1B loss had no effect on WT HCT116 cells but strongly repressed proliferation of ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, deficiency in both ARID1A and ARID1B led to decreased accessibility at 12,623 sites (12.5%) and increased accessibility at 5264 (5.2%) of 101,140 total accessible sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We observed high correlation between biological replicates for all cell genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and our ATAC-seq accessibility patterns were consistent with the DNAseI hypersensitive profile of HCT116 cells from the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Semi-quantitative measurements revealed that ARID1A is approximately 7-fold more abundant than ARID1B in WT HCT116 cells (data not shown). However, loss of ARID1A did not affect ARID1B transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or protein abundance by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the effect of ARID1B KD in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells is not due to compensatory upregulation of ARID1B. Our results suggest that loss of ARID1A and ARID1B predominantly represses accessibility at thousands of sites, implying an important role for these factors in maintaining open chromatin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30506.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ARID1A and ARID1B have unique and shared roles in the maintenance of chromatin accessibility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differential peak calls from ATAC-seq in HCT116 WT cells expressing shRNAs to scrambled control (WT) or ARID1B (ARID1B KD), or HCT116 ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells expressing shRNAs to scrambled control (ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup>) or ARID1B (ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD).

In contrast, Clusters 4 and 6 contain sites that lose accessibility, with unique dependence on ARID1A alone or in combination with ARID1B. Specifically, accessibility at Cluster 4 sites is dramatically reduced in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells, with minimal further reduction in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD cells, while accessibility at Cluster 6 sites is slightly reduced in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells, and this residual accessibility is completely ARID1B-dependent. Accessible sites in Clusters 5 and 7 are primarily unchanged. Overall, our data demonstrate that ARID1A and ARID1B regulate chromatin accessibility at shared and unique sites across the genome. ARID1A affects a greater proportion of total accessible regions and maintains open chromatin in ARID1B-deficient cells, whereas ARID1B has a significant function only when ARID1A is lost.</p><p>Strikingly, ATAC-seq Clusters positively correlated with significant changes in RNA expression by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), highlighting the importance of accessibility in regulating gene transcription. We subjected annotated sites from each cluster group to hierarchical clustering of Hallmark gene sets following Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>). We found that Clusters 2, 4, and 6 grouped together, consistent with downregulation in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD cells. These Clusters were enriched for genes involved in KRAS signaling, TNFα signaling via NF-κB, estrogen response, TGFβ signaling, Hedgehog signaling, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, HCT116 cells have activating mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA, which share common targets with these gene sets through activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK, and NF-κB pathways that regulate cell cycle progression and proliferation. Clusters 1 and 3 clustered together with prominent enrichment in Hypoxia, while Clusters 5 and 7 were enriched for housekeeping processes, including metabolic and protein homeostasis. These data demonstrate that ARID1A and ARID1B specifically regulate chromatin accessibility and expression of genes that may be crucial for the observed synthetic lethality in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Requirement for ARID1A or ARID1B is determined by SWI/SNF complex occupancy</title><p>To determine whether accessible sites are enriched for SWI/SNF complex occupancy, we overlapped our ATAC-seq data with binding of SMARCA4 or SMARCC1 subunits from ChIP-seq experiments in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the majority of SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 binding occurred in accessible regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with previous reports showing strong overlap between chromatin remodelers and DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 binding in WT HCT116 cells was preferentially enriched at decreased sites in Clusters 4 and 6, indicating that SWI/SNF occupancy is a key determinant for sensitivity to ARID1A/1B loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Previous reports have shown that while the majority of SWI/SNF complex binding sites are lost in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116, residual ARID1B-containing complexes are intact in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and likely contribute to stable and gained SWI/SNF binding in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). To determine if changes in SWI/SNF complex binding are predictive of changes in accessibility, we categorized SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 sites that are lost, gained, or unchanged in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells according to accessibility cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Of the small number of gained SWI/SNF binding sites, the majority are found in Clusters 2 and 3, consistent with a role for SWI/SNF complexes in opening chromatin. Sites that lose SWI/SNF binding fall within Clusters 4 and 6, while stable sites are enriched in Clusters 4, 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, changes in SWI/SNF complex binding correlate with changes in accessibility in WT versus ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells. Furthermore, the residual binding of SWI/SNF complexes was predictive of ARID1B dependence in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells. For example, while SWI/SNF binding is dramatically reduced at Cluster 4 sites in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells, there is residual binding of SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 at Cluster 6 sites, consistent with a requirement for both ARID1A and ARID1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Genome-wide, we find that accessibility at SMARCA4 or SMARCC1-bound accessible sites is highly sensitive to loss of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data indicate that dependency on ARID1A or ARID1B is determined by SWI/SNF complex binding in WT and ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells, respectively. Increased accessible sites gain SWI/SNF complex binding in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells, while decreased accessible sites have the highest enrichment of SWI/SNF complex binding in both settings. This characteristic may engender these sites as particularly vulnerable to loss of ARID1A or ARID1B.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30506.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SWI/SNF occupancy correlates with ARID1A/1B-dependent changes in accessibility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram overlap of SMARCA4 or SMARCC1 ChIP binding sites with accessible sites in WT HCT116 cells.

Strikingly, we observed that decreased accessible sites in Clusters 4 and 6 are highly enriched for H3K4me and H3K27ac enhancer marks, but depleted for promoter-specific H3K4me3, suggesting that loss of ARID1A/1B primarily affects accessibility at enhancers. In contrast, increased accessible sites in Clusters 1 and 3 and unchanged sites in Clusters 5 and 7 were enriched for H3K4me3 found at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). None of the clusters is enriched for H3K27me3, consistent with little overlap of this repressive mark with accessible chromatin. We then examined whether the requirement for ARID1A/1B-dependent remodeling is associated with enhancer activity. Specifically, H3K27ac has been used to distinguish poised enhancers (H3K27ac-) from active enhancers (H3K27ac+) and super enhancers (H3K27ac high) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these criteria, we find that sites with decreased accessibility in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells are enriched at all three enhancer classes, but primarily at poised and active enhancers, while increased accessible sites are enriched at promoters and 5’ untranslated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). We then profiled nascent transcription at distal sites or promoters against the change in accessibility in WT versus ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells by referencing published GRO-seq data in HCT116 cells (GSE38140, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galbraith et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Nascent transcription giving rise to enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) has been observed at active enhancers and is thought to facilitate gene transcription through direct and indirect mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maruyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mousavi et al., 2013</xref>).

In addition, downregulated sites are enriched for nascent transcription, indicating that ARID1A/1B loss impacts accessibility at actively transcribing enhancers. After parsing intergenic sites in Clusters 1–7, we found that Cluster 6 intergenic regions have higher levels of nascent transcription than Cluster 4 sites, consistent with the notion that Cluster 4 sites are less active than Cluster 6 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Overall, there were thousands of differential H3K27ac and H3K4me sites that increased or decreased between WT and ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells, while only a handful of sites showed differential H3K4me3 marking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that ARID1A and ARID1B-dependent accessible sites in Clusters 4 and 6 had reduced H3K4me and H3K27ac marks in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells, while unaltered accessible sites in Cluster 7 did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Consistent with the strong dependence of Cluster 4 accessible sites on ARID1A, H3K4me and H3K27ac were markedly reduced in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells, and further reduced with ARID1B loss. In contrast, ARID1A removal repressed H3K27ac but not H3K4me at Cluster 6 accessible sites, while knockdown of ARID1B in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells caused loss of both marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Small changes in H3K4me are evident at sites in Clusters 1–3, which become more accessible in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> or ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data support a role for ARID1A and ARID1B in maintaining accessibility and active histone marks at enhancer regions. Although the SWI/SNF complex has previously been implicated in maintaining H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raab et al., 2015</xref>), a function for ARID1B in accessibility and H3K27ac marks at enhancer regions is unprecedented. Similarly, clustering accessible sites by strength of ARID1A and ARID1B regulation has revealed novel roles for SWI/SNF in maintenance of H3K4me, consistent with the requirement for SWI/SNF complex remodeling at both poised and active enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ARID1A/1B are required for binding of AP-1 complex family members</title><p>SWI/SNF complexes are generally recruited by transcription factors and facilitate further transcription factor binding, altering nucleosome spacing to increase chromatin accessibility around these sites. We therefore sought to determine whether occupancy of transcription factors is disrupted at ARID1A- and ARID1B-dependent sites. We performed hierarchical clustering of enriched motifs from clustered accessible sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, FRA1 and JUND had the strongest binding at Cluster 4 and 6 sites and CTCF binding was present throughout, but depleted in Cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Accessible sites found at FRA1 or JUND binding sites from Cluster 4 and 6 showed reduced accessibility in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells and ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD cells, consistent with overall dependence of Cluster 4 and 6 sites on ARID1A alone or in combination with ARID1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). We next investigated accessibility around AP-1 motifs to determine if loss of SWI/SNF binding influences nucleosome architecture. We measured nucleosome spacing around the AP-1 motif at Cluster 4 and 6 sites by selecting mononucleosome-sized ATAC-seq reads from each genotype. This analysis revealed a stepwise reduction in distance between nucleosome peaks with ARID1A loss and further ARID1B removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). A total 37–40 base pair reduction in the distance between mononucleosome peaks was observed at ARID1A- and ARID1B-dependent accessible sites, suggesting a reduction of nucleosome spacing around the AP-1 motif.

This subset includes active enhancer regulatory regions engaged in eRNA transcription, as demonstrated by higher GRO-seq signal at co-regulated sites (ATAC Down, H3K27ac Down, SWI/SNF Bound, FRA1 Bound) than at decreased accessible sites that lack SWI/SNF, H3K27ac, and FRA1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We next used RNA Pol II ChIA-PET data from the ENCODE project to determine whether co-regulated sites directly interact with gene promoters and other regulatory regions to affect gene expression. We compared how often co-regulated sites are coupled <sup>to</sup> a change in accessibility, H3K27 acetylation, or transcription at an interacting site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Co-regulated sites are enriched for interactions with sites that lose accessibility or H3K27ac, but anti-correlated with sites that gain these features. In addition, co-regulated sites are more likely to interact with TSSs of genes that lose expression, as shown for <italic>TGFA, TGFBR2, PLAU,</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but not gain expression. The inverse is true for increased accessible sites, which are more likely to interact with sites with increased accessibility, increased H3K27ac, and increased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate that ARID1A/1B-dependent changes in accessibility and H3K27ac at enhancers strongly impact gene expression as a result of looping interactions with TSSs and other regulatory regions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30506.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ARID1A/1B regulate gene expression of cell growth pathway genes by maintaining active enhancer architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differentially expressed genes in WT versus ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells.

Hierarchical clustering grouped ARID1B KD with the WT expression profile as expected, while ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> and ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD expression profiles clustered together, suggesting that ARID1B KD largely enhances the effect of ARID1A loss.

In HCT116 cells, we identified multiple accessible regions from Clusters 4 and 6 that are co-bound by the AP-1 complex and the SWI/SNF complex within and downstream of the <italic>MET</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, data not shown). These areas exhibited bi-directional GRO-seq signal and looping interactions back to the promoter and other regulatory sites. We focused on two regions (R1 and R2) with reduced accessibility in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells that was completely abolished by ARID1B loss, consistent with greater than 70% reduction in RNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and total protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>).

However, rescue of MET alone was insufficient to completely counteract the proliferation defect caused by ARID1A and ARID1B loss, which is likely due to the downregulation of multiple factors.

We therefore asked whether the mechanism of ARID1A and ARID1B synthetic lethality in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells identified in our study is conserved in OCCCs with naturally occurring ARID1A mutations. To this end, we performed ATAC-seq in the ARID1A-mutant TOV21G cell line infected with shRNAs to ARID1B (ARID1B KD) or with a scrambled control (scr). Knockdown of ARID1B led to a 70–80% reduction in ARID1B protein, which impaired cancer cell growth as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helming et al., 2014</xref>).

To better understand the mechanism of gene regulation by ARID1B in this context, we further characterized accessible sites altered by ARID1B KD.

We identified thousands of sites with enhanced or repressed modification levels upon ARID1B loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Decreased accessible sites have high levels of enhancer-associated H3K4me and H3K27ac marks, which are lost upon ARID1B knockdown; in contrast, H3K4me3 levels are initially low and do not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Increased accessible sites, on the other hand, are high for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks that are found at promoters and active enhancers, but the levels of these modifications do not change in ARID1B KD TOV21G cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Pathway analysis of decreased H3K27ac sites revealed an enrichment of ErbB and PI3K-Akt signaling, pathways in cancer, along with ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and proteoglycans in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). The enrichment of genes in pro-proliferative pathways among sites dysregulated by ARID1B loss suggests that ARID1B maintains accessibility and active enhancer architecture at regulatory regions that control OCCC cell proliferation. Indeed, when we compared ARID1B-dependent genes in TOV21G cells to the differential gene expression profile of primary human OCCCs compared to normal ovaries (GSE6008, Gene Expression Omnibus), we found that genes that are highly upregulated in OCCC and downregulated with ARID1B knockdown (Group 3) were enriched for cell cycle terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Genes that were downregulated in OCCCs but upregulated with ARID1B knockdown (Group 1) contained genes involved in cellular response to stress and EGFR inhibitor resistance, suggesting a potential compensatory response to the effect of ARID1B on growth pathways. Together these data suggest that the role of the SWI/SNF complex in maintenance of accessibility and enhancer marks is conserved in colorectal carcinomas and OCCCs. Repression of OCCC-upregulated genes by ARID1B KD in TOV21G cells, including those involved in cell cycle progression, may contribute to the synthetic lethality observed with ARID1A mutation in this context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inactivating <italic>ARID1A</italic> mutations have been detected across a range of diverse cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadoch et al., 2013</xref>), including 9.4% of colorectal carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>) and up to 60% of OCCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiegand et al., 2010</xref>). In the current study, after confirming the synthetic lethal relationship between ARID1A and ARID1B in colorectal carcinoma proliferation, we uncovered the mechanistic basis underlying this phenomenon by examining chromatin accessibility across the genome. Clustering of accessible sites revealed a range of genomic regions with diverse responses to ARID1A and ARID1B loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). ARID1A maintains open chromatin, enhancer marks, and gene expression, while ARID1B also modulates these features, but only in the absence of ARID1A. Although the effects of ARID1B knockdown are limited in comparison, our findings show that the ability of ARID1B to regulate accessibility underpins its absolute requirement for proliferation of ARID1A-deficient colorectal carcinoma cells and mutant OCCCs.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that maintenance of chromatin accessibility is central to the tumor suppressor function of ARID1A. Specifically, the effects of ARID1A versus ARID1B loss on the accessible genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are consistent with a higher frequency of ARID1A mutations in colorectal and ovarian carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiegand et al., 2010</xref>). The underlying cause of ARID1A dominance over ARID1B is not clear. These homologs are similar in molecular weight and protein sequence, with 60% homology and comparable distribution of protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patsialou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilsker et al., 2005</xref>), and do not exhibit differences in their DNA binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilsker et al., 2004</xref>). In HCT116 cells, ARID1A mRNA and protein is more abundant than ARID1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and data not shown), suggesting that there are more SWI/SNF complexes containing ARID1A than ARID1B in the nucleus. The relative abundance of ARID1A may partially account for its dominant role in tumor suppression, although complex composition and/or unique regulatory interactions of ARID1A-containing complexes may also contribute to the selective advantage of ARID1A mutations in human cancer. In contrast, in ARID1A-mutant cells, residual ARID1B-containing complexes ensure that the minimal requirement for SWI/SNF complex remodeling is met at ARID1A-dependent sites. ARID1B thus serves a compensatory role in HCT116 cells, consistent with limited redistribution of SWI/SNF complexes to new sites upon loss of ARID1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>). We did observe increased accessibility and expression in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> cells for a subset of genes reported to gain SWI/SNF binding and H3K27ac by Mathur and colleagues, however the expression of these genes was not ARID1B dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our data do not address whether ARID1B is retargeted to new sites upon loss of ARID1A in ovarian epithelium, or whether it provides residual, stable binding at predominantly ARID1A-dependent sites. Nevertheless, we find that the role of ARID1B in maintaining accessibility and active histone marks at enhancers in ARID1A-deficient cells is conserved and mechanistically describes its essential role in the ARID1A-deficient setting.</p><p>Along with decreases in accessibility across the genome, we found that loss of SWI/SNF subunits results in a significant number of increased accessible sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). SWI/SNF complex recruitment can lead to the direct eviction of Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC2), resulting in the loss of H3K27me3 modification and acquisition of accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadoch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stanton et al., 2017</xref>). While we observed that sites with gained SMARCA4/SMARCC1 binding generally overlap with sites that gain accessibility in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), there are far fewer new SWI/SNF binding sites than newly accessible regions. In addition, there was no enrichment of H3K27me3 at Cluster 1–3 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that eviction of PRC2 complexes cannot fully account for the increased accessibility that we observe. Notably, loss of ARID1A has been shown to release repression mediated by HDACs at gene promoters, which may be an alternative mechanism by which accessibility is gained in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide binding assays for subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have revealed that SWI/SNF is widely bound to promoters and 5’ regulatory regions of actively expressed genes, as well as intronic and distal regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Euskirchen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raab et al., 2015</xref>). SWI/SNF complexes are often co-bound with other remodeling complexes at these regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). Amidst this backdrop of regulatory complexity, we find that ARID1A and ARID1B preferentially regulate chromatin accessibility at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Loss of accessibility likely affects the recruitment of histone readers and writers that deposit H3K27ac and H3K4me active enhancer marks, as direct interactions between modifiers and the SWI/SNF complex have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogiwara et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, we observe a reduction in active enhancer marks at ARID1A/1B-dependent accessible sites in colorectal and OCCC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). Interestingly, sites with relatively low basal accessibility and typical enhancer marks exhibit greater dependence on ARID1A and ARID1B function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>), while super enhancer regions, active promoters, and sites with higher basal accessibility are less affected by ARID1A and ARID1B loss. Additional chromatin remodelers, such as PBAF, CHDs, and Mi-2β/NuRD complexes, may maintain chromatin architecture at unaffected sites in the absence of SWI/SNF. In contrast, we find that SWI/SNF complex binding is most enriched at ARID1A/1B-dependent sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that SWI/SNF-mediated regulation of accessibility is correlated with SWI/SNF complex density.</p><p>Accessible genomic regions maintained by ARID1A and ARID1B are bound by subunits of the AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). These findings are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating the enrichment of the AP-1 motif at SWI/SNF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raab et al., 2015</xref>). In vitro, the AP-1 transcription factor complex is known to directly bind and recruit SWI/SNF through interaction with the BAF60A subunit, resulting in transactivation of AP-1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2001</xref>). We observed diminished binding of this transcription factor complex concomitant with diminished mononucleosome spacing at sites with repressed accessibility following ARID1A and ARID1B loss, suggesting that SWI/SNF remodels nucleosomes to facilitate AP-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). AP-1 and SWI/SNF could cooperate in chromatin opening, as AP-1 has the ability to potentiate accessibility and prime sites for binding of additional transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biddie et al., 2011</xref>). Together this implies an important relationship between chromatin remodeling and transcription factor complexes in controlling gene expression, one that may involve both eRNA transcription and enhancer-promoter looping. Indeed, ARID1A/1B-dependent sites bound by AP-1 exhibit active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and interactions with TSSs of downregulated genes via RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that SWI/SNF complexes cooperate with transcription factors at distal regulatory sites to impact gene expression.</p><p>ARID1A/1B-dependent accessible regions were uncovered within the <italic>MET</italic> gene, consistent with loss of MET expression in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD HCT116 cells. MET expression moderately enhanced the proliferation of ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD cells, but did not fully rescue the proliferation defect caused by ARID1A/1B loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Thus, loss of MET expression is a contributing factor, but cannot fully explain the dependence of ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> HCT116 cells on ARID1B. Rather, the alteration of multiple compensatory factors likely accounts for the synthetic lethality observed between these SWI/SNF subunits. Indeed, loss of ARID1A/1B profoundly affected the expression of many RTKs and their ligands, as well as downstream signaling adapters in the Ras and PI3K-Akt pathways and transcription factors of the AP-1 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Our data suggest that by regulating enhancer accessibility, active enhancer histone modifications, and transcription factor binding, ARID1A/1B maintain expression of genes involved in these pro-proliferative pathways. Given the importance of these pathways in a broad range of cancer types, including colorectal and epithelial ovarian cancer profiled in this study, our data argue for SWI/SNF inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for ARID1A mutant cancers independent of cancer type. Further, a direct interaction between SWI/SNF and AP-1 could be crucial for initiating and/or maintaining oncogenic signaling, and disruption of binding by specific chemical inhibition represents a potential strategy for inhibiting SWI/SNF function for therapeutic effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul Wade (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Kelso and colleagues reports on a genome wide analysis of the binding and function of ARID1A and ARID1B in HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines. They find a dominant role of ARID1A in influencing chromatin accessibility, features of transcriptional regulatory elements and gene expression, with partial compensation of ARID1A deficiency by ARID1B. AP-1 motifs are highly enriched at sites of ARID1A binding and binding of AP-1 factors is reduced in ARID1 knockout cells. Although investigated in less depth, similar findings are obtained in an ovarian cancer cell line. Analysis of the relatively small number of genes that is altered by combined loss of function of ARID1A and ARID1B provides evidence for a set of growth pathway genes that include MET as being responsible for synthetic lethality in this context.</p><p>All three reviewers were of the opinion that the studies were performed at a high level of technical competence and will provide a valuable resource. One reviewer noted, 'The overall strength of this manuscript is the lengthy analysis with multiple datasets that provide a rich picture of roles of ARID1A and ARID1B in the selected system.' The three main concerns raised during discussion were whether the manuscript goes sufficiently beyond the recent studies by Mathur and colleagues, the strength of conclusions regarding MET, and the lack of readily accessible metrics the sequencing assays. With respect to the first concern, there is significant overlap of the findings presented in this manuscript with those of the recent Mathur, et al. paper. However, one reviewer noted, 'This study is unique from previous studies in that it directly analyzed chromatin accessibility in the context of ARID1A and/or ARID1B loss, while previous studies have focused on the changes in histone marks. A second reviewer noted that the findings are complementary and go significantly beyond the Mathur, et al., paper with respect to comparative analysis of the ARID1A and ARID1B proteins and the genome-wide analysis in general. In addition, an important aspect of this manuscript is on the synthetic lethality of combined deletion of ARID1A and 1B, whereas the Mathur, et al., paper primarily focuses on the role of ARID1A as a tumor suppressor gene and studies the consequences of loss of function of ARID1A in mouse colon. However, because of this emphasis, the studies of MET need to be further developed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Role of MET in synthetic lethality. This is inferred but not proven and the relatively small difference in expression between ARID1A KO cells and ARID1A KO plus ARID1B knockdown is relatively modest. It may be that small changes of several genes account for the phenotype, but the manuscript would be strengthened by direct experiments. To address this question, the authors should test whether synthetic lethality can be rescued by forced expression of MET. Acceptance of the manuscript is not conditional on the outcome, but this type of experiment is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying lethality.</p><p>2) A table of metrics for all new sequencing experiments is needed to enable an estimation of data quality beyond that provided by the browser tracks. For each RNA-Seq, GRO-Seq and ChIP-seq replicate, the table should include # of reads for each sample, # passing Quality Filter, # uniquely mapped, # after deduplication. For ChIP-seq experiments, the fraction of reads associated with peaks should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30506.054</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Role of MET in synthetic lethality.

We find that forced expression of MET did not significantly affect the proliferation of WT cells, although we were unable to overexpress MET above the levels expressed in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>). However, we were able to rescue MET expression in ARID1A<sup>-/-</sup> ARID1B KD cells to nearly WT levels. This resulted in a significant albeit small effect on proliferation of HCT116 cells lacking ARID1A and ARID1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). These results demonstrate that loss of MET is a contributing factor, but also show that rescue of this single gene is insufficient to fully counteract the proliferation defect caused by ARID1B loss in ARID1A mutant cells. We show that multiple RTKs are affected in this context, as well as downstream signalling adapters and transcription factors, and thus our data suggest that several genes account for the synthetic lethal phenotype. Indeed, the reduced expression of <italic>PIK3R1</italic>, <italic>JUN, JUND, FOSB</italic>, and <italic>ETS1/2</italic>, all of which are downstream of MET, likely account for why we do not see more of an effect with MET rescue.
